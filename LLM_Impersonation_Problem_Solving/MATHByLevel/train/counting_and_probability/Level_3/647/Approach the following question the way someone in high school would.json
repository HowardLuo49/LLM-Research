    "solution": "We will use complementary counting for this problem, which is a big fancy term for saying we will determine the probability of the event we want NOT occuring. Then we will subtract our answer from 1 to get the real answer. So, what is the probability of the product being an odd number? This is an easier question to answer because it requires that both numbers be odd. There are a total of ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of distinct numbers, and with only 3 of them odd, ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ pairs of odd numbers. So, the probability of having an odd product is $\\frac{3}{10}$, leaving the probability of an even product being $1- \\frac{3}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that their product is an even number, we need to consider the different ways that the product can be even when two numbers are selected. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways that two distinct numbers can be selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. \n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to select two distinct numbers from the set.\n\nNow, let's find the ways that the product is even. \n\nFor the product to be even, at least one of the numbers must be even. There are three even numbers in the set $\\{2, 4\\}$.\n\nIf we choose an even number as one of the numbers, we have 3 choices. For the other number, there are 4 remaining numbers to choose from. Thus, there are $3 \\times 4 = 12$ ways to have an even product.\n\nSo, the probability that the product is an even number is $\\frac{12}{10} = \\frac{6}{5}$. \n\nTherefore, the probability we are looking for is $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{5}}$.",
