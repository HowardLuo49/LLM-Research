Two distinct numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. What is the probability that their product is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We will use complementary counting for this problem, which is a big fancy term for saying we will determine the probability of the event we want NOT occuring. Then we will subtract our answer from 1 to get the real answer. So, what is the probability of the product being an odd number? This is an easier question to answer because it requires that both numbers be odd. There are a total of ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of distinct numbers, and with only 3 of them odd, ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ pairs of odd numbers. So, the probability of having an odd product is $\\frac{3}{10}$, leaving the probability of an even product being $1- \\frac{3}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is even, we must consider the possible ways in which the product can be even. An even number is a number that is divisible by 2. \n\nWe have five numbers to choose from: $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. \n\nIn order for the product to be even, at least one of the numbers must be even. There are two even numbers in the set: 2 and 4. Therefore, there are two ways to select an even number for the product: $(2,1)$ and $(2,2)$. \n\nThe total number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from a set of 5 numbers is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is even is $\\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$. \n\nThus, the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is even is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$.",
