What is the probability that their product is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We will use complementary counting for this problem, which is a big fancy term for saying we will determine the probability of the event we want NOT occuring. Then we will subtract our answer from 1 to get the real answer. So, what is the probability of the product being an odd number? This is an easier question to answer because it requires that both numbers be odd. There are a total of ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of distinct numbers, and with only 3 of them odd, ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ pairs of odd numbers. So, the probability of having an odd product is $\\frac{3}{10}$, leaving the probability of an even product being $1- \\frac{3}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product is an even number, we first need to figure out all the possible outcomes. \n\nThe set of numbers we can choose from is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. \n\nTo get an even product, we need at least one of the numbers to be even. \n\nThere are 2 even numbers in the set: 2 and 4. \n\nSo, we can choose one even number and one other number in 2 ways: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5). \n\nThere are a total of 5 x 4 = 20 pairs of numbers we can choose. \n\nSo, the probability of choosing a pair that results in an even product is 6/20 = 3/10. \n\nTherefore, the probability that their product is an even number is 3/10.",
