    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The deli has four kinds of bread, six kinds of meat, and five kinds of cheese. A sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of cheese. Ham, chicken, cheddar cheese, and white bread are each offered at the deli. If Al never orders a sandwich with a ham/cheddar cheese combination nor a sandwich with a white bread/chicken combination, how many different sandwiches could Al order?",
    "solution": "First, count the total number of possible sandwiches. There are four choices for bread, six for meat, and five for cheese, for a total of $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 120$ potential sandwiches. Discarding the ham / cheddar cheese combination will subtract four sandwiches (one for each type of bread). Similarly, discarding the white bread / chicken combination will subtract five sandwiches, one for each kind of cheese. Thus, Al can order $120 - 4 - 5 = \\boxed{111}$ different sandwiches.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total number of possible combinations of bread, meat, and cheese, and then subtract the combinations that Al cannot order.\n\nThere are 4 types of bread, 6 types of meat, and 5 types of cheese, so there are a total of 4 * 6 * 5 = 120 possible combinations of sandwiches.\n\nHowever, Al cannot order a sandwich with a ham/cheddar cheese combination or a white bread/chicken combination.\n\nThere are 1 type of bread (white bread) that cannot be paired with 1 type of meat (chicken), and also 1 type of cheese (cheddar cheese) that cannot be paired with 1 type of meat (ham). Therefore, there are 2 combinations that Al cannot order.\n\nSubtracting these 2 combinations from the total number of possible combinations, we have 120 - 2 = 118 different sandwiches that Al could order.",
