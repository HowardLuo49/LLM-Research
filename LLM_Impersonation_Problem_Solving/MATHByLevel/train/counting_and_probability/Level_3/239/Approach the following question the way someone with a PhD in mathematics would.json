    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem, the coefficient that we want is just $\\binom{6}{2}=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+y)^6$, we can use the binomial theorem. The coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{2}$, which is equal to $\\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{2 \\times 1 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+y)^6$ is 15.",
