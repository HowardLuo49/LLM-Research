    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+y)^6, we can use a little trick called the \"Combinations\" trick. Let's count together! \n\nWe start with $(x+y)^6 = x^6 + 6x^5y + 15x^4y^2 + 20x^3y^3 + 15x^2y^4 + 6xy^5 + y^6$. \n\nCan you find the $x^2y^4$ term? It's right here in the middle! \n\nNow, let's count the number of ways we can choose 2 x's from the 6 in this term, and 4 y's from the 6 in this term. It's like counting how many different ways we can arrange a group of things. Are you ready? Let's count together! \n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... \n\nWe counted 15 ways to choose 2 x's and 4 y's.
