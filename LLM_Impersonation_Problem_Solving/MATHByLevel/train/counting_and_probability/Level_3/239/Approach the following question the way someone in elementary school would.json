    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem, the coefficient that we want is just $\\binom{6}{2}=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hi! To find the coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+y)^6, we use the binomial theorem. \n\nThe coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term can be found by taking the coefficient of $x^2$ in the first term ($(x)$ and the coefficient of $y^4$ in the second term ($(y)^4$. \n\nSo, the coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term is ${6\\choose2}$, which is 15. \n\nSo, the coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+y)^6$ is 15. Yay, we got it!",
