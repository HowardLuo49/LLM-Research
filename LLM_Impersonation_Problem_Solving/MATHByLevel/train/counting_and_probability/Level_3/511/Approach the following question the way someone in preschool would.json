    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Two different integers from 1 through 20 inclusive are chosen at random. What is the probability that both numbers are prime? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many prime numbers are between 1 and 20. \nWe have 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. So there are 8 prime numbers.\nThere are a total of 20 numbers to choose from. So the probability of choosing a prime number on the first go is 8/20.\nNow, after picking a prime number, there are 19 numbers left to choose from, so the probability of picking another prime number is 7/19.\nTo find the probability of picking two prime numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities: (8/20) * (7/19) = 56/380 = 14/95.\n\nSo, the probability of choosing two prime numbers is 14/95.",
