    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two different integers from 1 through 20 inclusive are chosen at random. What is the probability that both numbers are prime? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both numbers chosen are prime, we must first determine the total number of ways to choose two numbers from 1 to 20 inclusive, and then determine the number of ways to choose two prime numbers from 1 to 20.\n\nThere are 20 numbers to choose from, so there are ${20 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose two numbers from 1 to 20. This is equal to $\\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190$.\n\nNow we need to determine the number of ways to choose two prime numbers from 1 to 20. There are 8 prime numbers in this range: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Therefore, there are ${8 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose two prime numbers from 1 to 20. This is equal to $\\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$.\n\nSo, the probability that both numbers chosen are prime is $\\frac{28}{190} = \\frac{14}{95}$.",
