    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",

This can be done using the combination formula: \n\n20 choose 2 = 20! / (2! * 18!) = 190\n\nNext, we need to find how many of these outcomes result in both numbers being prime. The prime numbers between 1 and 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. There are 8 prime numbers in total.\n\nUsing the same combination formula, we can find the number of ways we can choose two different prime numbers from this list:\n\n8 choose 2 = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28\n\nTherefore, the probability that both numbers chosen are prime is 28/190 = 14/95.",
