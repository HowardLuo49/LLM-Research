    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Two different integers from 1 through 20 inclusive are chosen at random. What is the probability that both numbers are prime? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both numbers are prime, we first need to figure out how many prime numbers there are from 1 to 20. The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. There are 8 prime numbers in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen from 1 to 20. There are 20 numbers to choose from for the first integer, and 19 numbers left to choose from for the second integer. This gives us a total of 20 x 19 = 380 possible pairs of numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both numbers are prime is the number of favorable outcomes (choosing two prime numbers) divided by the total number of outcomes (choosing any two numbers). So, the probability is 8 (number of prime numbers) divided by 380 (total number of possible pairs), which simplifies to 1/47.\n\nSo the probability that both numbers are prime is 1/47.",
