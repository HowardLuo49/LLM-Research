    "solution": "An $n$-gon has $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals.  To see this, subtract the $n$ consecutive pairs of vertices from the $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of vertices:  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{n}{2}-n&=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-n \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n}{2}-\\frac{2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n-2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-3n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}.\n\\end{align*} An octagon has $8(8-3)/2=\\boxed{20}$ diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many diagonals a regular octagon has, we first need to understand what a regular octagon is. A regular octagon is a shape with eight sides, all of which are the same length. \n\nNow, to find the number of diagonals in a regular octagon, we can use a formula: n(n-3)/2, where n represents the number of sides of the polygon. In this case, n=8 for the octagon. \n\nSo, plugging in n=8 into the formula, we get:\n8(8-3)/2 = 8(5)/2 = 40/2 = 20 \n\nSo, a regular octagon has 20 diagonals.",
