    "solution": "An $n$-gon has $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals.  To see this, subtract the $n$ consecutive pairs of vertices from the $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of vertices:  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{n}{2}-n&=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-n \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n}{2}-\\frac{2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n-2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-3n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}.\n\\end{align*} An octagon has $8(8-3)/2=\\boxed{20}$ diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of diagonals in a regular octagon, we first need to calculate the total number of diagonals that can be drawn from each vertex of the octagon. \n\nIn a regular octagon, there are 8 vertices. From each vertex, we can draw a diagonal to every other vertex except the two adjacent vertices. Therefore, for each vertex, there are 8 - 3 = 5 diagonals that can be drawn.\n\nSince there are 8 vertices in total, the total number of diagonals in a regular octagon can be calculated by multiplying the number of diagonals from each vertex by the total number of vertices and then dividing by 2 (to avoid counting any diagonal twice):\n\n(5 diagonals per vertex * 8 vertices) / 2 = 20 diagonals\n\nTherefore, a regular octagon has 20 diagonals.",
