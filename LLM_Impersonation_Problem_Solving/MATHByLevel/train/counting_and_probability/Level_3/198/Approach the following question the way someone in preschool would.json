A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So we have to think about what might happen when we flip the coin. \nWe know the chance of getting heads is $\\frac34$ and getting tails is $\\frac14$. \nIf we get heads, we win $\\$3$, but if we get tails, we lose $\\$8$.\nSo, to find the expected worth, we can do:\n$$E(\\text{worth}) = (\\frac34 \\times \\$3) + (\\frac14 \\times -\\$8).$$\nWhen we calculate that, we get:\n$$E(\\text{worth}) = (\\frac34 \\times \\$3) + (\\frac14 \\times -\\$8) = \\$2.25 - \\$2 = \\$0.25.$$\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\$0.25$.",
