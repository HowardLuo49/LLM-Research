A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we have to figure out how much money we expect to win on average. \n\nLet's start by finding out how much we can expect to win if we flip heads. Since heads have a probability of $\\frac34$, we would win $\\$3$ with that probability. So, the expected value if we flip heads is $3*\\frac34 = \\$2.25$.\n\nNext, let's find out how much we can expect to lose if we flip tails. Since tails have a probability of $\\frac14$, we would lose $\\$8$ with that probability. So, the expected value if we flip tails is $-8*\\frac14 = -\\$2$.\n\nNow, we can find the overall expected worth of a coin flip by adding the expected value of flipping heads and the expected value of flipping tails. \n\n$2.25 - 2 = \\$.25$\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\$.25$.",
