A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we need to multiply the amount gained by the probability of gaining it, and then do the same for the amount lost. \n\nThe amount gained is $\\$3$ with a probability of $\\frac34$. \nThe amount lost is $\\$8$ with a probability of $\\frac14$. \n\nSo, we can calculate the expected worth as follows: \n\nExpected worth = $(\\$3)(\\frac34) + (-\\$8)(\\frac14)$\nExpected worth = $\\$2.25 - \\$2$\nExpected worth = $\\$0.25$\n\nTherefore, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\$0.25$.",
