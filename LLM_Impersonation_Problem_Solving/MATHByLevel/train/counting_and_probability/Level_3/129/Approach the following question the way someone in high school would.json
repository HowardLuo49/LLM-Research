    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{21}{11}=\\binom{21}{21-11}=\\binom{21}{10}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{20}{9}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the given notation means. $\\binom{a}{b}$ represents the number of ways to choose b items from a total of a items. \n\nNow, we are given the equation $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$. We want to find all integer values of n that satisfy this equation.\n\nUsing the formula for combinations (or binomial coefficients), we can simplify the equation: $\\binom{20}{n} = \\frac{20!}{n!(20-n)!}$ and $\\binom{21}{11} = \\frac{21!}{11!10!}$.\n\nSo, we have $\\frac{20!}{n!(20-n)!} + \\frac{20!}{10!10!} = \\frac{21!}{11!10!}$.\n\nWe can simplify this further by multiplying everything by $n!(20-n)!$ to get $20!(20-n)! + 20!(n!(20-n)!)(10!) = 21!(n!)$.\n\nThis simplifies to $20!(20-n)! + 20!(n)(10!) = 21!(n!)$.\n\nWe can rewrite this as $20!(20-n) + 20!(n)(10) = 21!(n)$.\n\nExpanding the factorials, we have $20(20-n) + 200n = 21n$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $400 - 20n + 200n = 21n$ which simplifies to $400 + 180n = 21n$.\n\nSolving for n, we get $180n = -400$, which gives $n = -\\frac{400}{180} = -\\frac{20}{9}$.\n\nHowever, since we are looking for integer values of n, there are no solutions to this equation.
