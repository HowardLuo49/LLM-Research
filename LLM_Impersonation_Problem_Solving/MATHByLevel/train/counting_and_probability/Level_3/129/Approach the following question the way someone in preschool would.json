    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{21}{11}=\\binom{21}{21-11}=\\binom{21}{10}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{20}{9}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\\boxed{20}$.",

So, $\\binom{20}{10}=184,756$.\n\nNext, we need to find the value of $\\binom{21}{11}$. This means we need to find how many ways we can choose 11 things from a group of 21 things.
