    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember what a perimeter is. A perimeter is the distance around a shape. In this case, we have a rectangle with a perimeter of 64 inches. \n\nNow, let's think about the sides of a rectangle. A rectangle has two pairs of sides that are equal in length. So if one side is a certain length, the other side across from it will be the same length.\n\nTo find all the possible rectangles with a perimeter of 64 inches, we need to think of combinations of side lengths that add up to 64 inches. Let's start with the smallest number, 1 inch. If one side is 1 inch, the other side must also be 1 inch to make a rectangle. \n\nNext, we can try 2 inches. If one side is 2 inches, the other side must be 30 inches. \n\nWe can keep going like this, trying out different combinations of side lengths that add up to 64 inches. Remember, we need to have whole numbers, or integers, for the side lengths.\n\nAfter trying out different combinations, we will find that there are several non-congruent rectangles that meet the criteria. Can you figure out how many there are? Keep trying different combinations until you find them all!",
