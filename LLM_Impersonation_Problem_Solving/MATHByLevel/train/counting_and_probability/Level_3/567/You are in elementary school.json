    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
