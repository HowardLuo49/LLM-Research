    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many non-congruent rectangles meet these criteria, we need to first think about how to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides.\n\nLet's say the length of one side of the rectangle is x inches. Since a rectangle has two pairs of sides that are equal in length, the other side of the rectangle would also be x inches.\n\nSo the perimeter of the rectangle would be 2x + 2x = 4x inches.\n\nGiven that the perimeter is 64 inches, we can set up the equation:\n\n4x = 64\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nx = 16\n\nSo, the sides of the rectangle are 16 inches each. This means there is only one non-congruent rectangle that meets the criteria - a rectangle with sides of 16 inches and 16 inches.",
