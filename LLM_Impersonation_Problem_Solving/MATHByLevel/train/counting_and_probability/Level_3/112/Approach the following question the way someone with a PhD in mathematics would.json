    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{14}=\\binom{27}{14}$, so $n=14$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{27}{14}=\\binom{27}{27-14}=\\binom{27}{13}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{12}=\\binom{27}{13}$, so $n=12$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $12$ and $14$, so the sum is $12+14=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first recall the combinatorial definition of binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose a subset of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ distinct elements. In particular, $\\binom{n}{k}$ is equal to $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n\nGiven the equation $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$, we can rewrite it using the definition of binomial coefficients as $\\frac{26!}{13!13!}+\\frac{26!}{n!(26-n)!}=\\frac{27!}{14!13!}$.\n\nNow, by simplifying the expression, we get $\\frac{26!(n+13)}{n!(26-n)!}=\\frac{27!(13)}{14!13!}$.\n\nAfter further simplification, we obtain $\\frac{27!}{n!(26-n)!}=\\frac{27\\times26!}{14!}$.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the left-hand side is a binomial coefficient, and the right-hand side can be expressed as $\\binom{27}{n}$. Therefore, we have $\\binom{27}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$.\n\nThe sum of all integer values $n$ for which this equality holds is simply the sum of all possible values of $n$ that make the equation true. In this case, the only value that satisfies $\\binom{27}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$ is $n=14$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which the given equation holds is $14$.",
