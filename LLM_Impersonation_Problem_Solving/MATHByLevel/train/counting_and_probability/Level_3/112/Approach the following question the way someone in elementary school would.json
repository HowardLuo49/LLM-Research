    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{14}=\\binom{27}{14}$, so $n=14$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{27}{14}=\\binom{27}{27-14}=\\binom{27}{13}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{12}=\\binom{27}{13}$, so $n=12$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $12$ and $14$, so the sum is $12+14=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see what we can do to break down the problem:\n\n1. The combination formula $\\binom{n}{k}$ is used to find the number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ items without regard to the order in which the items are chosen. \n\n2. We are given the equation $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$ and we need to find the sum of all integer values $n$ that satisfy this equation. \n\n3. We know that $\\binom{n+1}{k+1} = \\binom{n}{k} + \\binom{n}{k+1}$ from Pascal's Identity, so we can rewrite the equation as $\\binom{27}{14}=\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{n}=\\binom{27}{13+1} + \\binom{26}{n}$\n\n4. Looking at the equation $\\binom{27}{13+1} + \\binom{26}{n}$ we see that $\\binom{27}{13+1}=\\binom{27}{14}$, so the equation simplifies to $\\binom{27}{14} + \\binom{26}{n} = \\binom{27}{14}$\n\n5. This means that the sum of all integer values $n$ that satisfy the equation is any integer value of $n$ that makes $\\binom{26}{n} = 0$.\n\n6. Since $\\binom{26}{n}$ is zero when $n$ is outside the range $0\\leq n\\leq 26$, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which the equation is satisfied is the sum of all the integers in this range. \n\n7. Therefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ that satisfy the equation is $0+1+2+...+26 = \\boxed{351}$.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$ is 351.",
