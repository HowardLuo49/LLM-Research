    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{14}=\\binom{27}{14}$, so $n=14$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{27}{14}=\\binom{27}{27-14}=\\binom{27}{13}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{12}=\\binom{27}{13}$, so $n=12$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $12$ and $14$, so the sum is $12+14=\\boxed{26}$.",

I'm not sure what those symbols mean, but I think we can figure it out by trying some different numbers. Let's start by finding out what $\\binom{26}{13}$ is. \n\nHmm... Well, I'm not exactly sure how to do that. Maybe we can ask a teacher for help! Let's try another number instead. How about we try $n=1$? \n\nSo now our equation looks like this:\n\n$\\binom{26}{13} + \\binom{26}{1} = \\binom{27}{14}$\n\nI'm not sure if that's right, but maybe we can try another number and see what happens. Let's ask our teacher to explain this to us.",
