    "solution": "There are two O's, two I's, two N's and eleven total letters, so the answer is $\\dfrac{11!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{4,\\!989,\\!600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So to find out how many ways we can arrange the letters in the word COMBINATION, we need to count all the different possibilities. Let's start by looking at how many letters are in the word. There are 11 letters in the word COMBINATION.\n\nNow, let's count how many times each letter appears in the word:\n- There are 2 O's\n- There are 2 I's\n- There are 2 N's\n\nSince there are repeated letters, we need to use a special formula to find the number of arrangements. The formula we can use is called the factorial formula:\n\nNumber of arrangements = 11! / (2! * 2! * 2!)\n\nThis means we take the factorial of the total number of letters (11!) and then divide by the factorials of the number of times each repeated letter appears.\n\nNow, we just need to do the math:\nNumber of arrangements = 39916800 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 4989600\n\nSo, there are 4,989,600 different ways to arrange the letters in the word COMBINATION. Whew, that's a lot of possibilities!",
