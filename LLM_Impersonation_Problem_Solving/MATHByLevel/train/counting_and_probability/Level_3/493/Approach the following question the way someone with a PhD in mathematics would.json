    "solution": "There are two O's, two I's, two N's and eleven total letters, so the answer is $\\dfrac{11!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{4,\\!989,\\!600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION, we first note that the word has 11 letters in total, with 2 occurrences of the letter 'O', 2 occurrences of the letter 'I', and the remaining letters appearing only once.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION can be calculated using the formula for permutations of a multiset:\n\n\\( \\frac{{11!}}{{2! \\cdot 2!}} \\)\n\nCalculating this expression, we find that there are 5,040 ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION.",
