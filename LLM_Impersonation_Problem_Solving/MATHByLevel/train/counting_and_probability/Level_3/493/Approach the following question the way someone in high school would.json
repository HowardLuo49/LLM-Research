    "solution": "There are two O's, two I's, two N's and eleven total letters, so the answer is $\\dfrac{11!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{4,\\!989,\\!600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so to figure out the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word COMBINATION, we first need to count the total number of letters. In this case, there are 11 letters in the word.\n\nNext, we need to see how many times each letter appears in the word. Here's a breakdown:\n- C appears 1 time\n- O appears 2 times\n- M appears 1 time\n- B appears 1 time\n- I appears 2 times\n- N appears 2 times\n- A appears 1 time\n- T appears 1 time\n\nNow, we can use the formula for finding the number of permutations of a word with repeated letters, which is n!/n1!*n2!*...*nk! where n is the total number of letters and n1, n2, etc. are the number of times each letter appears.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get:\n11! / (1!*2!*1!*1!*2!*2!*1!*1!) = 11! / 192 = 19,958,400\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word COMBINATION is 19,958,400.",
