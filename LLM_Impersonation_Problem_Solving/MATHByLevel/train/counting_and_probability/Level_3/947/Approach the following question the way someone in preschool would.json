    "solution": "Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three.  Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's try to make some cool numbers that look the same forwards and backwards! We can use the digits 7, 8, and 9 to make them. \n\nTo make a palindrome, the first three digits need to match the last three digits. So let's choose the first three digits and then just copy them to the end! \n\nWe can start by choosing 7, 8, or 9 for the first digit. Then we can choose 7, 8, or 9 for the second digit, and finally, for the third digit. Once we have those three digits, we can just copy them to the end to make a palindrome. \n\nSo, we have 3 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 3 choices for the third digit. That gives us 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 different palindromes we can make! \n\nI hope that was helpful! Let's keep making cool numbers together!",
