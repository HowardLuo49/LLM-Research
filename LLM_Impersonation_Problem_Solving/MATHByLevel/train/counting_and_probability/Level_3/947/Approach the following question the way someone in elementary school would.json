    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Using only the digits 7, 8 and 9, how many positive seven-digit integers can be made that are palindromes?",
    "solution": "Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three.  Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let me think. A palindromic number is the same forwards and backwards, right?\n\nSo if we want a seven-digit number to be a palindrome, the first and last digit have to be the same, the second and second to last digit have to be the same, and so on.\n\nSince we can only use the digits 7, 8, and 9, let's think about the possibilities.\n\nFor the first digit, we have 3 choices (7, 8, 9). Then for the second digit, we still have 3 choices. But for the third digit, it has to be the same as the first digit, so there's only 1 choice. The same goes for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh digits.\n\nSo we have 3 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and then 1 choice for each of the remaining 5 digits.\n\nMultiplying all those choices together, we get:\n\n3 * 3 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 9 possible palindromic numbers.\n\nSo there are 9 positive seven-digit palindromic integers that can be made using only the digits 7, 8, and 9.",
