    "solution": "Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three.  Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive seven-digit palindromic integers using only the digits 7, 8, and 9, we need to consider the structure of a palindrome.\n\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. In this case, a seven-digit palindrome will have the form ABCDDCBA, where A, B, C, and D are digits from the set {7, 8, 9}.\n\nTo count the number of such palindromes, we need to determine the possibilities for each digit:\n\n- The first digit A can be chosen from the set {7, 8, 9}, so there are 3 choices for A.\n- The second digit B can also be chosen from the set {7, 8, 9}, so there are 3 choices for B.\n- The third digit C can be chosen from the set {7, 8, 9}, so there are 3 choices for C.\n- The fourth digit D is determined by the choice of A, B, and C, since it must be the same as A. Therefore, there is only 1 choice for D.\n\nMultiplying the number of choices for each digit gives the total number of seven-digit palindromic integers:\n\n3 choices for A * 3 choices for B * 3 choices for C * 1 choice for D = 27\n\nTherefore, there are 27 positive seven-digit integers that can be made using only the digits 7, 8, and 9 that are palindromes.",
