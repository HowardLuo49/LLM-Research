    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Using only the digits 7, 8 and 9, how many positive seven-digit integers can be made that are palindromes?",
    "solution": "Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three.  Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To make a palindrome, the first three digits must be the same as the last three digits. So, we must choose three digits from {7, 8, 9} to form the first three digits, and the last three digits will be the same as the first three digits.\n\nThere are 3 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 3 choices for the third digit, making a total of 3*3*3 = 27 choices for the first three digits.\n\nTherefore, there are 27 positive seven-digit palindromes that can be made using only the digits 7, 8, and 9.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 81?: To make a palindrome, the first three digits must be the same as the last three digits. So, we must choose three digits from {7, 8, 9} to form the first three digits, and the last three digits will be the same as the first three digits.\n\nThere are 3 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 3 choices for the third digit, making a total of 3*3*3 = 27 choices for the first three digits.\n\nTherefore, there are 27 positive seven-digit palindromes that can be made using only the digits 7, 8, and 9.",
