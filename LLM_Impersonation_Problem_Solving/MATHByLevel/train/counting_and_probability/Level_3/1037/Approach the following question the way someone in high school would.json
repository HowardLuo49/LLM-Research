    "solution": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of getting at least one head when Mahmoud tosses three coins, we can first figure out the total number of possible outcomes. When tossing a coin, there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails) for each toss. Since Mahmoud is tossing three coins, there are 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of outcomes where Mahmoud gets at least one head. There are three ways Mahmoud can get at least one head: (H, T, T), (T, H, T), and (T, T, H). So, there are 3 outcomes where Mahmoud gets at least one head.\n\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes (3) by the total number of possible outcomes (8):\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\nProbability = 3 / 8\nProbability = 0.375\n\nTherefore, the probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head when tossing three coins is 0.375 or 37.5%.",
