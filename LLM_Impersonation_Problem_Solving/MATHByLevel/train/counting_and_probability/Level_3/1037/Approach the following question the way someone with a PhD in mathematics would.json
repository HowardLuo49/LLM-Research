    "solution": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head when tossing three coins, we can first determine the total number of possible outcomes. \n\nThere are 2 possible outcomes for each coin toss (heads or tails), so for three coins, there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes.\n\nTo find the probability of getting at least one head, we can calculate the probability of getting no heads (all tails) and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability of getting all tails is (1/2)^3 = 1/8, since each coin toss is independent and has a 1/2 probability of landing on tails.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least one head is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. Thus, the probability of Mahmoud getting at least one head when tossing three coins is 7/8 or 87.5%.",
