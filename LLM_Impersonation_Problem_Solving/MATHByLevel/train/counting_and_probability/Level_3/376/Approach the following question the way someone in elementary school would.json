    "solution": "After we choose the first vertex, there are 7 ways to choose the second.  There are only 2 of these that are adjacent to the first vertex, so the probability the two vertices are adjacent is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so an octagon is a shape with 8 sides. That means it has 8 vertices, which are the corners. \n\nTo find the probability that two vertices are adjacent (which means they are next to each other), we need to first figure out how many different pairs of vertices we can pick. Since there are 8 vertices, there are 8 choose 2 = 28 possible pairs.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of those pairs are adjacent. If we start with one vertex, there are 2 vertices that are adjacent to it. So for each of the 8 vertices, there are 2 pairs that are adjacent. That means there are 8*2 = 16 pairs that are adjacent.\n\nSo the probability that the two vertices chosen are adjacent is 16/28 = 4/7 or about 57%.",
