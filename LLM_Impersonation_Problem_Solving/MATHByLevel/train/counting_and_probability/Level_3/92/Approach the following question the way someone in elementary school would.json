The first ring of squares around this center square contains 8 unit squares. The second ring contains 16 unit squares.

    "solution": "The $n^{th}$ ring can be partitioned into four rectangles: two containing $2n+1$ unit squares and two containing $2n-1$ unit squares. So there are $$2(2n+1)+2(2n-1) = 8n$$ unit squares in the $n^{th}$ ring. Thus, the $100^{th}$ ring has $8 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{800}$ unit squares.",
