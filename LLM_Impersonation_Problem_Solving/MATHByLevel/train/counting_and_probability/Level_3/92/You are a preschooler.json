    "solution": "The $n^{th}$ ring can be partitioned into four rectangles: two containing $2n+1$ unit squares and two containing $2n-1$ unit squares. So there are $$2(2n+1)+2(2n-1) = 8n$$ unit squares in the $n^{th}$ ring. Thus, the $100^{th}$ ring has $8 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{800}$ unit squares.",

For example, the first ring has 8 unit squares which is the sum of the first 8 odd numbers: $1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15=64$. \\n\\nSimilarly, the second ring has 16 unit squares, which is the sum of the next 8 odd numbers:  $17+19+21+23+25+27+29+31=200$.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of unit squares in the $100^{th}$ ring can be calculated by summing the next 8 odd numbers after the ones we already used.\\n\\nSo, we start with the odd number immediately after 31, which is 33, and find the next 8 odd numbers after that.\\n\\n$33+35+37+39+41+43+45+47=320$\\n\\nTherefore, the $100^{th}$ ring would have 320 unit squares.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181044, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=227, prompt_tokens=202, total_tokens=429))",
