    "solution": "The solutions are $(1,29),(2,28),\\ldots,(28,2),(29,1)$. Each $a$ produces a unique $b$, and since there are 29 possibilities for $a$, there are $\\boxed{29}$ possibilities for $(a,b)$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we have the equation $a + b = 30$. We need to find some positive integers that add up to 30. Let's start listing out some possibilities:\n\n(1,29)\n(2,28)\n(3,27)\n...\n(29,1)\n\nIt looks like there is a pattern here - for every positive integer for $a$, there is a corresponding positive integer for $b$ that will make the total 30. Therefore, we have 29 distinct ordered-pair solutions $(a, b)$ that satisfy the equation.",
