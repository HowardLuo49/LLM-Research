    "solution": "The solutions are $(1,29),(2,28),\\ldots,(28,2),(29,1)$. Each $a$ produces a unique $b$, and since there are 29 possibilities for $a$, there are $\\boxed{29}$ possibilities for $(a,b)$.",

In this case, we are looking for the number of ways we can distribute 30 identical objects into 2 distinct boxes. This is a classic stars and bars problem in combinatorics, and the number of ways to do this is ${30+2-1 \\choose 2-1} = {31 \\choose 1} = 31$.\n\nHowever, since $a$ and $b$ are distinct integers, we need to consider the order of the pairs.
