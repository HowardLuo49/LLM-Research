A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's begin by calculating the total number of ways to choose the top card and the second card from a standard deck of 52 cards. \n\nFor the first card to be red, we have 26 red cards to choose from out of a total of 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of choosing a red card as the first card is $\\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAfter we have chosen a red card as the first card, we are left with 51 cards, out of which 26 are black. Therefore, the probability of choosing a black card as the second card, given that the first card was red, is $\\frac{26}{51}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the top card being red and the second card being black is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{26}{51} = \\frac{26}{102} = \\frac{13}{51}$$\n\nSo, the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black is $\\frac{13}{51}$.",
