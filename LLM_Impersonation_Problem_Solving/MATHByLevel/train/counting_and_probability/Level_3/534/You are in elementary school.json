Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
