    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many numbers are in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle (from the $0$th row to the $19$th row)?",
    "solution": "We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number. Each row has one more number than the previous row. Thus, we can see that row $n$ has $n+1$ numbers.\nSince we want the sum of numbers in the rows $0$ to $19$, we sum up every number from $1$ to $20$ to get $\\frac{(1+20)\\cdot 20}{2}=\\boxed{210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle, we need to add up all the numbers in each row. \n\nIn Pascal's Triangle, the $n$th row has $n+1$ numbers. So, the first row (which is the $0$th row) has $1$ number, the second row has $2$ numbers, the third row has $3$ numbers, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the total number of numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle is $1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 20$. \n\nTo find this sum, we can use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ positive integers: $\\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$. In this case, $n = 20$, so the total number of numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle is $\\dfrac{20 \\cdot 21}{2} = \\dfrac{420}{2} = 210$.\n\nSo, there are $210$ numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle.",
