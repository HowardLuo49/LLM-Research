    "solution": "We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number. Each row has one more number than the previous row. Thus, we can see that row $n$ has $n+1$ numbers.\nSince we want the sum of numbers in the rows $0$ to $19$, we sum up every number from $1$ to $20$ to get $\\frac{(1+20)\\cdot 20}{2}=\\boxed{210}$.",
