    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many numbers are in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle (from the $0$th row to the $19$th row)?",
    "solution": "We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number. Each row has one more number than the previous row. Thus, we can see that row $n$ has $n+1$ numbers.\nSince we want the sum of numbers in the rows $0$ to $19$, we sum up every number from $1$ to $20$ to get $\\frac{(1+20)\\cdot 20}{2}=\\boxed{210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In Pascal's Triangle, each number is generated by adding the two numbers directly above it. Starting from the $0$th row (which consists of only one number, $1$), each subsequent row will have one more number than the previous row.\n\nThe number of numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle can be found by summing the first $20$ positive integers. This can be done using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, we have $n = 20$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_{20} = 20$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$S = \\frac{20}{2}(1 + 20) = 10(21) = 210$\n\nTherefore, there are $210$ numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle.",
