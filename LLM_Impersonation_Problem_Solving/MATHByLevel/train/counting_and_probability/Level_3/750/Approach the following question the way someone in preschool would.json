    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Brent rolls a fair dodecahedral die with numbers $1,2,3,...,12$ on its faces. What is the expected number of digits in the number he obtains? Express your answer in a decimal.",
    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, first we need to see all the numbers we can get on the die. We have numbers from 1 to 12. Let's count the number of digits in each of them. \n\n1 has 1 digit.\n2 has 1 digit.\n3 has 1 digit.\n4 has 1 digit.\n5 has 1 digit.\n6 has 1 digit.\n7 has 1 digit.\n8 has 1 digit.\n9 has 1 digit.\n10 has 2 digits.\n11 has 2 digits.\n12 has 2 digits.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of digits we have on the die. \nWe have 9 numbers with 1 digit and 3 with 2 digits. So, that's $9 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 2 = 9 + 6 = 15$ total digits.\n\nTo find the expected number of digits, we divide the total number of digits by the total number of possibilities, which is 12 (since there are 12 numbers on the die).\n\nExpected number of digits = total digits / total possibilities = 15 / 12 = 1.25\n\nSo, the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains is 1.25.",
