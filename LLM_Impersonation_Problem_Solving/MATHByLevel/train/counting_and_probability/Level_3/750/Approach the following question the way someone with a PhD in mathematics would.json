    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Brent rolls a fair dodecahedral die with numbers $1,2,3,...,12$ on its faces. What is the expected number of digits in the number he obtains? Express your answer in a decimal.",
    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains when rolling the dodecahedral die, we can note that numbers $1-9$ have a single digit, numbers $10-99$ have two digits, and numbers $100-999$ have three digits. \n\nIn this case, there is a $9/12$ probability of obtaining a single digit number, a $2/12$ probability of obtaining a two-digit number, and a $1/12$ probability of obtaining a three-digit number.\n\nThus, the expected number of digits is given by:\n\\[ E = \\left( \\frac{9}{12} \\times 1 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{2}{12} \\times 2 \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{12} \\times 3 \\right) \\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{9}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12}\\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{16}{12}\\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{4}{3}\\]\n\\[ E = 1.333...\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains is $1.333...$ or $\\frac{4}{3}$.",
