    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected number of digits, we can list out all the possibilities of numbers Brent can roll on the dodecahedral die. \n\nThe numbers on the die are $1,2,3,...,12$. \n\nIf Brent rolls a number between $1$ and $9$, then the number he rolls will have only $1$ digit. This can happen $9$ out of $12$ times, since there are $9$ numbers between $1$ and $9$ on the die.\n\nIf Brent rolls a number between $10$ and $12$, then the number he rolls will have $2$ digits. This can happen $3$ out of $12$ times, since there are $3$ numbers between $10$ and $12$ on the die.\n\nSo, the expected number of digits is $(1 \\times \\frac{9}{12}) + (2 \\times \\frac{3}{12}) = \\frac{9}{12} + \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{15}{12} = 1.25$. \n\nTherefore, the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains is $1.25$.",
