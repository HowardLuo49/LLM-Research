    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains, we need to consider the range of possible outcomes and their probabilities.\n\nThe numbers on the die range from 1 to 12. Counting the number of digits in each number, we find:\n- Numbers 1-9 have 1 digit.\n- Numbers 10-12 have 2 digits.\n\nSince there are 9 numbers with 1 digit and 3 numbers with 2 digits, the probabilities of getting numbers with 1 or 2 digits are $\\frac{9}{12}=\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{12}=\\frac{1}{4}$, respectively.\n\nTo find the expected number of digits, we calculate:\n$E = \\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains is $1.25$.",
