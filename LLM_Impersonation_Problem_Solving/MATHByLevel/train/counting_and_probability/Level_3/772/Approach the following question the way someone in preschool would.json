    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! A palindrome is a number that reads the same backwards as it does forwards. So, like 12321 or 55555. To find five-digit palindromes, we need to figure out how many different combinations there are! Let's count together. We can start with the smallest five-digit palindrome, which is 10001, and go all the way up to the biggest one, which is 99999. That's a lot of numbers to count! Let's see if we can skip count instead. Let's count by twos. 10001, 10011, 10021...oh no, this might take a while! Maybe we can ask our teacher for help or use a calculator to figure it out faster. Keep trying, we'll get there eventually!",
