    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of five-digit palindromes, we first need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nIn a five-digit palindrome, the first digit must be the same as the last digit, and the second digit must be the same as the fourth digit. This means that there are only 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), as it cannot be 0 for a five-digit number. The same goes for the second digit, which also has 9 choices.\n\nTherefore, the total number of five-digit palindromes can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for the first digit (9) by the number of choices for the second digit (9), as well as keeping the third digit as the same as the first digit and the fifth digit as the same as the second digit. \n\nThis gives us a total of 9 * 9 = 81 five-digit palindromes.",
