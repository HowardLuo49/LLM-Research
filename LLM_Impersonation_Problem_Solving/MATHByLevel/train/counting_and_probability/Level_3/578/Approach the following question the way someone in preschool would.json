    "solution": "The probability of getting two tails followed by one head is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  The probability of getting a tail followed by a head followed by a tail is also $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  Finally, the probability of getting a head followed by two tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$ as well.  In total, the probability of getting two tails and one head is $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$.",

Let's take a penny, a nickel, and a quarter and throw them up in the air. If we have one head and two tails, it can be Tails-Heads-Tails or Tails-Tails-Heads. So there are two ways to get two tails and one head.\n\nSince there are a total of 8 possible outcomes (HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT), the probability is 2/8, which can be simplified to 1/4.\n\nYay!
