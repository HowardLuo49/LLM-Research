    "solution": "The probability of getting two tails followed by one head is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  The probability of getting a tail followed by a head followed by a tail is also $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  Finally, the probability of getting a head followed by two tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$ as well.  In total, the probability of getting two tails and one head is $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of getting two tails and one head when three coins are tossed, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when tossing three coins. \n\nWhen tossing one coin, there are 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). Since there are three coins being tossed, the total number of outcomes is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways we can get two tails and one head.
