    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first figure out how many ways the four students can stand next to each other. There are 4 students, so there are 4! (4 factorial) ways they can stand in a straight line.\nNext, we need to figure out how many ways the two students who refuse to stand next to each other can be arranged. Since there are 2 students and they can switch places, there are 2 ways they can stand next to each other.\nNow, we need to subtract the number of ways the two students can stand next to each other from the total number of ways the four students can stand in a line. Therefore, we have 4! - 2 = 22 different ways the four students can stand in a straight line if two of them refuse to stand next to each other.",
