    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's say the students are named A, B, C, and D. If A and B refuse to stand next to each other, we can think of it as A and B being mad at each other and not wanting to be close. So we need to figure out the different ways we can arrange the students without A and B standing next to each other.\n\nIf A is in the first spot, then B can't be in the second spot. So B can be in the third spot or the fourth spot. That's 2 ways.\n\nIf A is in the second spot, then B can't be in the first spot or the third spot. So B can only be in the fourth spot. That's 1 way.\n\nIf A is in the third spot, then B can't be in the second spot. So B can be in the first spot or the fourth spot. That's 2 ways.\n\nIf A is in the fourth spot, then B can't be in the third spot. So B can only be in the first spot. That's 1 way.\n\nAdding up all the ways, there are 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 different ways the students can stand in a straight line without A and B standing next to each other.",
