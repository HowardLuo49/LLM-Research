    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can consider all possible ways that the four students can stand in a straight line without any restrictions. There are 4! = 24 ways for the four students to stand in a straight line without any constraints.\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of ways that the two students who refuse to stand next to each other can be arranged. Let's denote the two students who refuse to stand next to each other as A and B. We can consider A and B as a single entity, so there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange A and B within the group.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the number of ways that the group of four students, including A and B as a single entity, can be arranged. This can be done in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways for the four students to stand in a straight line if two of them refuse to stand next to each other is given by:\n\nTotal number of ways = Total number of ways without any constraints - Number of ways to arrange the two students + Number of ways to arrange the group of four students\n= 24 - 6 + 6\n= 24.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 different ways that the four students can stand in a straight line if two of them refuse to stand next to each other.",
