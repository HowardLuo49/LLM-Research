    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \\}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's list out all the possible pairs of integers we can choose from the set: (-5, -8), (-5, 7), (-5, 4), (-5, -2), (-8, 7), (-8, 4), (-8, -2), (7, 4), (7, -2), (4, -2).\n\nNow, we have to determine which pairs have a product that is negative. A negative product occurs when one integer is positive and the other integer is negative.\n\nFrom our list, the pairs with a negative product are: (-5, 7), (-5, -2), (-8, 7), (-8, -2), (7, -2), (4, -2).\n\nThere are a total of 10 pairs, and 6 of them have a product that is negative. So, the probability that their product is negative is $\\frac{6}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
