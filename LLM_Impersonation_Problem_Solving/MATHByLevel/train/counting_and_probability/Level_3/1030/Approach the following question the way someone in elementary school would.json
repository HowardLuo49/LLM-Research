    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \\}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of the two numbers is negative, we first need to see how many ways we can choose two numbers that will give us a negative product. \n\nWe have 5 numbers in total, and we can choose 2 numbers from them in 5 choose 2 ways. That's like saying 5! / (2! (5-2)!).. umm.. ok, that's like 5 times 4 divided by 2 times 1 which is 10.\n\nOut of those 10 ways, we need to see which ones will give us a negative product. If we look at the numbers, there are 3 negative numbers and 2 positive numbers. \n\nIf we choose a negative number and a positive number, we will get a negative product. So, there are 3 ways to choose a negative number and 2 ways to choose a positive number. That's like.. 3 times 2 which is 6 ways.\n\nOk, so the probability that we get a negative product is 6 out of 10. And that's like.. umm.. 6/10. Yeah, that's it. So the probability is 6/10 which is the same as 3/5. Yay, we did it!",
