    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \\}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count how many ways we can choose two numbers that multiply to be negative. \n\n1. If we choose -5 and 7, their product is -35, which is negative.\n2. If we choose -5 and -2, their product is positive 10, which is not negative.\n3. If we choose -5 and 4, their product is negative 20, which is negative.\n4. If we choose -8 and 7, their product is negative 56, which is negative.\n5. If we choose -8 and -2, their product is positive 16, which is not negative.\n6. If we choose -8 and 4, their product is negative 32, which is negative.\n7. If we choose 7 and -2, their product is negative 14, which is negative.\n8. If we choose 7 and 4, their product is positive 28, which is not negative.\n9. If we choose -2 and 4, their product is negative 8, which is negative.\n\nSo, there are 4 ways to choose two numbers with a negative product. \nAnd there are 10 total ways to choose two numbers from the set. \n\nSo the probability is 4/10 or 2/5.",
