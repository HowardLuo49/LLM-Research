    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \\}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 integers from the set $\\{-5, -8, 7, 4, -2\\}$. This can be done using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$, and calculates the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. In this case, we have 5 elements and are choosing 2, so $\\binom{5}{2}=10$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways that the product of the two integers is negative. In order for the product to be negative, one of the numbers must be negative and the other must be positive. From the given set, we can see there are 3 negative integers and 2 positive integers. So, the total number of ways to choose one negative and one positive integer is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two integers is negative is given by the ratio of the number of ways the product is negative to the total number of ways the numbers can be chosen. So, the probability is $\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{3}{5}$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two integers chosen is negative is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
