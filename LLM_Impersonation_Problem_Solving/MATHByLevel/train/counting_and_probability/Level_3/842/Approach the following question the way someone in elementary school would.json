The probability that it rolls a 6 is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that it rolls any other number is $\\frac{1}{10}$. What is the expected value of the number shown when this die is rolled? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "solution": "The expected value is $$\\frac{1}{10}(1) + \\frac{1}{10}(2) + \\frac{1}{10}(3) + \\frac{1}{10}(4) + \\frac{1}{10}(5) + \\frac{1}{2}(6) = \\frac{15}{10} + 3 = \\boxed{4.5}. $$",

Since the probability of rolling a 6 is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling any other number is $\\frac{1}{10}$, we can find the probability of rolling each number by subtracting the probability of rolling a 6 from 1 and then dividing by 5 for the other numbers.\n\nFor a 6: $\\frac{1}{2}$\nFor any other number: $\\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{2}}{5} = \\frac{1}{10}$\n\nNow, we can find the expected value by multiplying each number by its probability and then summing them up.\n\nExpected value = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 + \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)$\nExpected value = $3 + \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 15$\nExpected value = $3 + 1.5$\nExpected value = $\\boxed{4.5}$\n\nSo, the expected value of the number shown when this die is rolled is 4.5.",
