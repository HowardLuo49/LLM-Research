    "solution": "Let's deal with the restriction first.\n\nThe restriction is that we have to place a math book on both ends.  We have 3 choices for the math book to place on the left end, and then 2 choices for the math book to place on the right end.\n\nThen we simply need to arrange the other 6 books in the middle.  This is a basic permutation problem, so there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 remaining books.\n\nSo there are a total of $3 \\times 2 \\times 6! = \\boxed{4,\\!320}$ ways to arrange the books on the bookshelf.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to make sure that there is a math book at the beginning and one at the end. That leaves us with 1 math book and 5 history books left to arrange in the middle. There are 5 choices for which history book goes first, then 4 choices for the next one, then 3 choices for the next one. So, there are 5 x 4 x 3 = 60 ways to arrange the history books in the middle. Then, we have to multiply that by the number of ways to arrange the math books at the ends, which is 1 x 1 = 1. So, there are 60 x 1 = 60 ways to arrange all the books on the bookshelf.",
