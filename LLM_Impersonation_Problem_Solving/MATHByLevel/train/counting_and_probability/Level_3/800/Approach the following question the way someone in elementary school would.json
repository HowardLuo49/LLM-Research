    "solution": "There are 5 steps to the right, and 4 steps up.  These 9 steps can be made in any order, so we can choose 4 of the 9 steps to be \"up\" in $\\binom{9}{4} = \\boxed{126}$ ways.",

Since we can only go up or to the right, we can go up 5 times and to the right 6 times to reach point B. So, we can make 6 right steps and 5 up steps in any order. This is the same as finding the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"RRRRRRUUUUU\". \n\nSo, the answer is the number of ways to arrange this word, which is $\\dfrac{11!}{6! \\cdot 5!} = 462$, which means there are 462 paths from point A to point B.",
