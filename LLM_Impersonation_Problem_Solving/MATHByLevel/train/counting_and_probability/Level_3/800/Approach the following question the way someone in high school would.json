    "solution": "There are 5 steps to the right, and 4 steps up.  These 9 steps can be made in any order, so we can choose 4 of the 9 steps to be \"up\" in $\\binom{9}{4} = \\boxed{126}$ ways.",

Since we have to take a total of $h-1$ steps up and $w-1$ steps to the right to get from $A$ to $B$, we can choose $h-1$ of these steps to be up, and the rest must be to the right.
