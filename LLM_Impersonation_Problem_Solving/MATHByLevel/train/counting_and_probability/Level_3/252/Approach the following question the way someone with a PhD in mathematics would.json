    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. \n\nWhen distributing 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can think of this problem as choosing which of the two boxes each ball will go into. \n\nFor each of the 4 balls, there are 2 choices of boxes to place it in. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the 4 balls into the 2 boxes is equal to 2^4 = 16. \n\nTherefore, there are 16 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 16?: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. \n\nWhen distributing 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can think of this problem as choosing which of the two boxes each ball will go into. \n\nFor each of the 4 balls, there are 2 choices of boxes to place it in.
