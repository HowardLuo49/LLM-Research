    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways we can put 4 balls into 2 boxes, we can try to imagine all the different ways we can divide the balls up. \n\nLet's think about it like this:\n\n- We can put all 4 balls in the first box and none in the second box. That's one way.\n- We can put 3 balls in the first box and 1 ball in the second box. That's another way.\n- We can put 2 balls in each box. That's a different way.\n- We can put 1 ball in the first box and 3 balls in the second box. That's one more way.\n- And we can put all 4 balls in the second box and none in the first box. That's the last way.\n\nSo, in total, there are 5 different ways we can put 4 balls into 2 boxes.",
