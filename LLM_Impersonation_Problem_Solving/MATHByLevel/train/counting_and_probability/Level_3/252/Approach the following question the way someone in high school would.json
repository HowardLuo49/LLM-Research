    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can think about each ball individually and decide which box to put it in. Since there are 4 balls, each ball has 2 options for which box to go in. This means there are 2 choices for the first ball, 2 choices for the second ball, 2 choices for the third ball, and 2 choices for the fourth ball. \n\nTo find the total number of ways to put the balls into the boxes, we can multiply the number of choices for each ball together. \n\n2 choices for the first ball x 2 choices for the second ball x 2 choices for the third ball x 2 choices for the fourth ball = 2^4 = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 different ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
