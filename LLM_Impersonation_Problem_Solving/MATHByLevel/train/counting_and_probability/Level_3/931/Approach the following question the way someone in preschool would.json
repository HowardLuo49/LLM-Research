    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

To make sure that the two-digit number and both digits are divisible by 3, the numbers can be 12, 21, 24, 33, 42, 51, 54, or 63. \n\nSo, out of all the possible outcomes when rolling two dice, we count how many times we get these special numbers. Then we divide that by the total number of outcomes we can get. That will give us our probability! Yay, let's keep rolling and counting to find the answer!",
