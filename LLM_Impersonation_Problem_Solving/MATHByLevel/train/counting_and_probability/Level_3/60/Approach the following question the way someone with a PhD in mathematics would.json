    "solution": "There are $\\binom{12}{3} = \\boxed{220}$ ways to pick any 3 points, which we assume to determine a unique plane.",
    "gpt_response": "In general, a set of n non-collinear points in space uniquely determines a maximum of n choose 3 (nC3) planes. This is because each combination of 3 points uniquely determines a plane.\n\nFor 12 points in space, the maximum number of planes that can be determined is given by 12C3, which is equal to 12! / (3! * (12-3)!), or 220.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space is 220.",
