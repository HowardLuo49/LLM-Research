    "solution": "There are $\\binom{12}{3} = \\boxed{220}$ ways to pick any 3 points, which we assume to determine a unique plane.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space, we need to think about how planes are formed. \n\nRemember, a plane is uniquely determined by three non-collinear points. This means that if you have three points that are not in a straight line, they will form a plane. \n\nSo, if we have 12 points in space, we can choose 3 points to form a plane in a lot of different ways. \n\nLet's think about it like this: if the first point can be any of the 12 points, the second point can be any of the remaining 11 points, and the third point can be any of the remaining 10 points. \n\nSo, the maximum possible number of planes that can be determined by 12 points in space is 12 x 11 x 10 = 1320 planes. \n\nThat's a lot of planes! And it's all because each plane is formed by three points that are not in a straight line.",
