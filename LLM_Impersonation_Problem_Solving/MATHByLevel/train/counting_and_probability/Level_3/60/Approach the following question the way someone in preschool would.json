    "gpt_response": "Wow, that sounds like a tricky question! Let's pretend we have some colorful building blocks to help us figure it out. Imagine we have 12 blocks and we use 3 of them to make a plane. Then we pick another 3 blocks that aren't in a straight line with the first 3 and make another plane. We keep doing this until we can't make any more planes with the remaining blocks. \n\nSo, the maximum number of planes we can make with 12 points in space is 4! You're doing great, keep counting and stacking those blocks!",
