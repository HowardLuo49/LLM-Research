What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",

There is only 1 Jack, 1 Queen, and 1 King of each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).\n\nSo, if we want to find the probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, then a King, we need to remember that each time we draw a card, there are fewer cards left in the deck.\n\nThe probability of drawing a Jack first is 1 out of 52 (because there's 1 Jack out of 52 cards in the deck). \n\nAfter drawing a Jack, there are 51 cards left in the deck, so the probability of drawing a Queen second is 1 out of 51.\n\nAfter drawing a Jack and a Queen, there are 50 cards left in the deck, so the probability of drawing a King third is 1 out of 50.\n\nTo find the total probability of all three events happening, we need to multiply the probabilities together.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, then a King is (1/52) x (1/51) x (1/50) = 1/132600.\n\nWow, that's a really small chance!
