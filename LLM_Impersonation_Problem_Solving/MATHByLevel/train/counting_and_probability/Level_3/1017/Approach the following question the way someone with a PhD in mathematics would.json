What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{4}{52} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} \\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{16575}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, and finally a King from a standard deck of 52 cards without replacement, we need to consider the number of ways these events can occur and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of ways to draw three cards from a deck of 52 cards without replacement. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nTotal number of ways = 52 choose 3 = 52! / (3!(52-3)!) = 52! / (3!49!) = (52 * 51 * 50) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 22100\n\nNext, let's determine the number of ways to draw a Jack, then a Queen, and finally a King. There is only one Jack, one Queen, and one King of each suit in a standard deck. Therefore, the number of ways to draw a Jack, then a Queen, and finally a King is 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of ways to draw a Jack, Queen, and King / Total number of ways = 1 / 22100 \u2248 0.000045\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, and finally a King from a standard deck of 52 cards without replacement is approximately 0.000045.",
