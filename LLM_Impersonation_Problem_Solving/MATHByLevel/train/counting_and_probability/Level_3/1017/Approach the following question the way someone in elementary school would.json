What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{4}{52} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} \\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{16575}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to find out how many Jacks, Queens, and Kings are in a deck of cards. There is 1 Jack, 1 Queen, and 1 King in each of the four suits. So that means there are 4 Jacks, 4 Queens, and 4 Kings in total.\n\nWhen we pick the first card, there are 52 cards in the deck and 4 of them are Jacks. So the probability of picking a Jack first is 4/52.\n\nNow, after we pick the Jack, there are 51 cards left in the deck and 4 of them are Queens. So the probability of picking a Queen second is 4/51.\n\nLastly, after we pick the Jack and the Queen, there are 50 cards left in the deck and 4 of them are Kings. So the probability of picking a King third is 4/50.\n\nTo find the overall probability of picking a Jack, then a Queen, then a King, we multiply the individual probabilities together:\n\n(4/52) x (4/51) x (4/50) = 16/132600 = 1/8288\n\nSo the probability of picking a Jack, then a Queen, then a King is 1/8288.",
