    "solution": "$\\underline{\\text{Method 1}}$\n\nMake a diagram and draw $4$ lines so that they intersect each other as shown.

The original rectangle without lines added is considered to be one section.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{Total number of lines added} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total number of sections} & 1 & 2 & 4 & 7 & ?\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$ Look for a pattern. Observe that the $1^\\text{st}$ added line results in increasing the preceding total of sections by $1,$ the $2^\\text{nd}$ added line increases the preceding total of sections by $2,$ the $3^\\text{rd}$ added line increases the preceding total sections by $3.$ It seems that the $4^\\text{th}$ added line will increase the preceding total of sections by $4$ and that there will be $7+4$ or $11$ sections. Examine the $4^\\text{th}$ line in the diagram below. When the $4^\\text{th}$ line intersects the first of the $3$ interior lines, it creates a new section. This happens each time the $4^\\text{th}$ line crosses an interior line. When the $4^\\text{th}$ line finally ends at a point on the rectangle, it creates a $4^\\text{th}$ new section. Thus the $4^\\text{th}$ line creates a total of $4$ new sections. The answer to the given problem is $\\boxed{11}.$\n\n(If a 5th line were added, it would increase the preceding total of sections by 5.)\n\n[asy]\n\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,4)--(0,4)--(0,0));\n\ndraw((2,0)--(4,4));\n\nlabel(\"4\",(4,4),N);\n\ndraw((4,0)--(2,4));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(2,4),NE);\n\ndraw((5.5,4)--(0,1.5));\nlabel(\"$1$\",(0,1.5),W);\n\ndraw((0,3)--(5,0));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(0,3), NW);\n\n[/asy]",
