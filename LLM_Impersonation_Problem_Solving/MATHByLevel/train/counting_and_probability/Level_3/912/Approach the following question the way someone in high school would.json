    "solution": "Because of the symmetric nature of the number 11, it is a divisor of many palindromes.  Expanding powers of $x+y$ (where $x = 10$ and $y = 1$) helps us see why the first few powers of 11 are all palindromes:  \\begin{align*}\n(x + y)^2 &= x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\\n11^2 &= 121 \\\\\n(x + y)^3 &= x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 \\\\\n11^3 &= 1331 \\\\\n(x + y)^4 &= x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4\\\\\n11^4 &= 14641 \\\\\n(x + y)^5 &= x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5 \\\\\n11^5 &= 161051 \\end{align*} Notice that each term of the form $x^i y^{n-i}$ ends up being a power of $10$, and the digits of $(x+y)^n$ end up being the binomial coefficients when these coefficients are less than $10$, as there is no carrying. Because of the identity $\\binom{n}{i}=\\binom{n}{n-i}$, the number is a palindrome whenever the coefficients are all less than $10$, which is true for powers less than 5. However, from the list above, we see that $(x+y)^5$ has coefficients at least 10, and indeed, we have $11^5 = \\boxed{161051}$, which is not a palindrome.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's find the powers of 11. We can start by multiplying 11 by itself to get 121, then 121 by 11 to get 1331, and so on. Let's keep going until we find a number that is not a palindrome. After checking a few numbers, we find that 1331 is both a power of 11 and not a palindrome. So, the smallest positive integer that fits both criteria is 1331.",
