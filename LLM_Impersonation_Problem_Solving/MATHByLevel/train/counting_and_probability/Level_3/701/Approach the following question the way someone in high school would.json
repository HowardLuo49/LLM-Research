    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first let's list out all the possible pairs of numbers we can choose without replacement: $(3,4)$, $(3,5)$, $(3,6)$, $(4,5)$, $(4,6)$, $(5,6)$. Next, let's determine which pairs will result in a product that is a multiple of 9. The only pairs that work are $(3,6)$ and $(4,6)$, so there are 2 favorable outcomes. Since there are a total of 6 possible outcomes, the probability that their product will be a multiple of 9 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
