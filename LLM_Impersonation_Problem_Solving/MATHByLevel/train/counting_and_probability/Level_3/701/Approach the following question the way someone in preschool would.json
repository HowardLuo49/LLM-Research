    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the numbers we have to choose from: 3, 4, 5, and 6. We need to pick 2 numbers to multiply together.\n\nFirst, let's find the numbers that are multiples of 9: 3 and 6. That means we need to pick at least one of these numbers in order for the product to be a multiple of 9.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of ways we can choose 2 numbers from the set: 4 choices for the first number and 3 choices for the second number. This gives us a total of $4 \\times 3 = 12$ ways to choose 2 numbers.\n\nNext, let's count the number of ways we can choose 2 numbers that include at least one of the multiples of 9: we can choose 3 first and then any of the other numbers, or we can choose 6 first and then any of the other numbers. That gives us a total of $2 \\times 3 = 6$ successful outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two chosen numbers will be a multiple of 9 is $\\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}$. So the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
