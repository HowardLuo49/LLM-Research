    "solution": "With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit. Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$. Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit. After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \\boxed{145}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember what factorials are. A factorial is when you multiply a number by all the numbers below it. For example, 5 factorial (written as 5!) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, which equals 120.\n\nSo, to find a three-digit integer that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits, we need to think about what numbers will satisfy this condition. Let's try some numbers:\n\n- If we try 100, the sum of the factorials of its digits would be 1! + 0! + 0! = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is not equal to 100.\n- If we try 101, the sum of the factorials of its digits would be 1! + 0! + 1! = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is also not equal to 101.\n- Let's try 145 next. The sum of the factorials of its digits would be 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145, which is equal to the number itself! So, the three-digit integer that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits is 145. Yay, we found it!",
