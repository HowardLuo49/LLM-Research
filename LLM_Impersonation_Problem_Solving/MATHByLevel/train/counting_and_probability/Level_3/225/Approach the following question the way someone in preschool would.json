    "solution": "With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit. Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$. Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit. After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \\boxed{145}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... to find the answer to this tricky question, we need to look at each digit of the three-digit number and see if it equals the sum of the factorials of its digits! Let's start by looking at the hundreds place. The largest factorial we can have for a single digit is 9! which equals 362,880. This means the hundreds digit can't be greater than 3 since 4! is 24. Next, let's move on to the tens digit. It can be any number from 0 to 9 since even the factorial of 9 is less than 100. Finally, let's check the ones place. The maximum factorial for a single digit is 9! which is 362,880, so the ones digit can't be greater than 3. Putting it all together, the only three-digit integer that fits all these conditions is 145. Yay, we did it!",
