The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, I have 6 different shirts, 4 different pants, and 6 different hats. I don't want them all to be the same color. So, first I can pick a shirt. Then I can pick a pair of pants, making sure it's not the same color as the shirt. Lastly, I can pick a hat, again making sure it's not the same color as the shirt or pants. \n\nSo, for each shirt, there are 4 pants I can choose from that are not the same color. Then, for each shirt and pants combo, there are 3 hats I can choose from that are not the same color. \n\nTherefore, I have a total of 6 shirts * 4 pants * 3 hats = 72 different outfit choices I can make! Yay, so many fun outfits to wear!",
