The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many outfit choices you have, you need to count all the possible combinations of shirts, pants, and hats that follow the rule of not having all three items be the same color.\n\nThere are 4 choices for pants (tan, black, blue, and gray). For each pair of pants, there are 5 choices for shirts (tan, black, blue, gray, white, and yellow) because you can't choose the same color as the pants. Finally, for each combination of pants and shirt, there are 5 choices for hats (tan, black, blue, gray, white, and yellow) because you can't choose the same color as either the pants or shirt.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outfit choices is 4 (pants) x 5 (shirts) x 5 (hats) = 100. So you have 100 choices for outfits!",
