The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",

So the total number of outfit combinations if all items are the same color is 4 x 6 x 6 = 144.\\n\\nHowever, we need to subtract the number of outfits where all items are the same color. There are 4 outfits where all items are tan, 4 outfits where all items are black, 4 outfits where all items are blue, and 4 outfits where all items are gray. So we need to subtract 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 from the total.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of possible outfit combinations where at least one item is a different color is 144 - 16 = 128. \\n\\nTherefore, you have 128 choices for outfits consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180433, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=204, prompt_tokens=99, total_tokens=303))",
