    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's count the even numbers on a die. We have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. That's 6 even numbers in total on each die.\n\nNow, Ben has 5 dice, so we need to find out how many ways we can choose 2 out of the 5 dice to show an even number. This is like picking out which dice are going to show even numbers.\n\nWe can use combination for this: 5 choose 2, which is 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10 ways.\n\nNow, for each of those 10 ways, we need to find the probability that those 2 dice show an even number. Since each die has 6 even numbers out of 12 total numbers, the probability for one die is 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nMultiplying the probabilities for each die, we get (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to choose 2 dice and the probability of each die showing an even number: 10 * 1/4 = 10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5.\n\nSo, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is 2.5.",
