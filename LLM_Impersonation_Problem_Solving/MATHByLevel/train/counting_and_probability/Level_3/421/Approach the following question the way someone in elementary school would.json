    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number, we first need to figure out how many ways this can happen.\n\nThere are 6 even numbers on each die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) and 6 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11). \n\nTo find the total number of ways to roll 5 dice, we need to use multiplication. Since each die has 12 sides, we multiply 12 by 12 by 12 by 12 by 12. This gives us a total of 12 x 12 x 12 x 12 x 12 = 248832 ways to roll the dice.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many ways we can get exactly two even numbers. We need to choose 2 even numbers out of 6 for the first two dice, and 3 odd numbers out of 6 for the remaining three dice. \n\nTo calculate this, we use combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers out of 6 is 6 choose 2, which is equal to 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 15. The number of ways to choose 3 odd numbers out of 6 is 6 choose 3, which is equal to 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 20.\n\nNow, we multiply these two numbers together to find the total number of ways to roll exactly two even numbers. 15 x 20 = 300.\n\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of ways to roll exactly two even numbers by the total number of ways to roll the dice. 300 / 248832 = 0.001204. \n\nSo, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is about 0.001 or 0.1%.",
