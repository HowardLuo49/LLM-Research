    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 fair 12-sided dice. Since each die has 12 faces, there are a total of 12^5 = 248,832 possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where exactly two of the dice show an even number. We can do this by calculating the number of ways to choose 2 out of the 5 dice to show an even number, which is given by the binomial coefficient (5 choose 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10. \n\nFor each of these 10 ways, we need to determine the number of ways to choose the specific even numbers that will appear on the two dice. Since there are 6 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12), there are 6^2 = 36 ways to choose the specific even numbers.\n\nFor the remaining 3 dice that must show an odd number, there are 6 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) to choose from, giving us 6^3 = 216 ways to choose the specific odd numbers. \n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 * 36 * 216 = 77760.\n\nFinally, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 77760 / 248832 \u2248 0.3125.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of the 5 dice show even numbers is approximately 0.3125, or 31.25%.",
