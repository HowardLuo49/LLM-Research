    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Ben rolls 5 fair 12-sided dice.  The 12 faces of each die are numbered from 1 to 12. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number, we can first calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling 5 12-sided dice.\n\nEach die has 12 sides, so the total number of outcomes when rolling one die is 12. Therefore, when rolling 5 dice, the total number of outcomes is 12^5.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose exactly two dice to show an even number out of the 5 dice. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!). In this case, n is 5 (number of dice) and k is 2 (number of dice showing even numbers). So, the number of ways to choose exactly 2 dice to show even numbers is C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10.\n\nThe probability of exactly two dice showing an even number is then the number of favorable outcomes (2 dice showing even numbers) divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 10 / 12^5 \u2248 0.0057 or 0.57%.",
