What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",

Since the chip is placed back into the bag and the total number of chips remains the same, the probability of selecting a yellow chip on the second draw is 3/8.\\n\\nSimilarly, the probability of selecting a yellow chip on the first draw is 3/8, and the probability of selecting a blue chip on the second draw is 5/8.\\n\\nTherefore, the total probability of selecting two chips of different colors is:\\n\\n(5/8) * (3/8) + (3/8) * (5/8) = 15/64 + 15/64 = 30/64 = 15/32\\n\\nSo, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is 15/32.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181573, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=246, prompt_tokens=74, total_tokens=320))",
