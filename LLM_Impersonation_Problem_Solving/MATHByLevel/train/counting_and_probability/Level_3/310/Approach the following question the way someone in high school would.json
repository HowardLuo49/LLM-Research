    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's find the total number of ways to draw two chips from the bag. Since there are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips, there are a total of 8 chips in the bag. So the total number of ways to draw two chips is 8*8 = 64.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to draw two chips of different colors. We could draw a blue chip first and then a yellow chip, or we could draw a yellow chip first and then a blue chip. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips, so there are 5*3 = 15 ways to draw two chips of different colors.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing two chips of different colors is 15/64.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{15?: Ok, so first let's find the total number of ways to draw two chips from the bag.
