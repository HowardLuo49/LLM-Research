    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors, we must first determine the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 8 total chips in the bag, so there are 8 choices for the first chip and 8 choices for the second chip, resulting in a total of 8*8 = 64 possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of outcomes where the two selected chips are of different colors. There are 5 choices for the first chip (blue), and 3 choices for the second chip (yellow), resulting in a total of 5*3 = 15 possible outcomes where the two chips are of different colors.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is 15/64.",
