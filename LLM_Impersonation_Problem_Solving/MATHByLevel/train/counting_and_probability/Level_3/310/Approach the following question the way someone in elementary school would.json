    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out the probability of picking two chips of different colors, we need to see how many total chips are in the bag. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips, so that makes 8 chips in total. \n\nNow, to find out the probability of picking one blue chip and one yellow chip, we first figure out the probability of picking a blue chip first. There are 5 blue chips out of 8 total chips, so the probability of picking a blue chip first is 5/8.\n\nThen we put the blue chip back in the bag and pick another chip. This time, there are still 8 total chips in the bag, but now there are only 3 yellow chips left. So the probability of picking a yellow chip second is 3/8.\n\nTo find the overall probability of picking one blue chip and one yellow chip, we multiply the probabilities together: (5/8) x (3/8) = 15/64.\n\nSo the probability of picking two chips of different colors is 15/64.",
