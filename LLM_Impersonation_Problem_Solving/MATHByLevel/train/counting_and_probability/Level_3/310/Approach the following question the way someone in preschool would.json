    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we have 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in the bag. First, we pick one chip and put it back. Then we pick another chip. We want to know the probability that the two chips are different colors.\n\nThere are a total of 8 chips in the bag, so the total number of outcomes is 8.\n\nTo find the probability of getting different colored chips, we need to find the number of ways we can choose one blue chip and one yellow chip.\n\nThere are 5 ways to choose a blue chip and 3 ways to choose a yellow chip. That gives us a total of 5 x 3 = 15 ways to choose different colored chips.\n\nSo, the probability of picking two chips of different colors is 15/8.\n\nYay! We did it! \ud83c\udf89 15/8 is the fraction we were looking for! Great job!",
