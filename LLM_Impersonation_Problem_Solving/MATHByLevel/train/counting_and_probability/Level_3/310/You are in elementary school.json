    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",

The total number of possible outcomes when drawing two chips is 8 x 8 = 64.\\n\\nNow, let's calculate the number of favorable outcomes, where the two selected chips are of different colors.\\n\\nFor the first draw, there are 5 blue chips out of 8 total chips, so the probability of drawing a blue chip is 5/8. Similarly, the probability of drawing a yellow chip on the first draw is 3/8.\\n\\nFor the second draw, the probability of drawing a blue chip is still 5/8, and the probability of drawing a yellow chip is still 3/8.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is:\\n\\n(5/8) x (3/8) + (3/8) x (5/8) = 2 x (5/8) x (3/8) = 30/64\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is 30/64 or 15/32.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181570, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=260, prompt_tokens=74, total_tokens=334))",
