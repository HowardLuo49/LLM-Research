    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
    "solution": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.  The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we can use a technique called stars and bars. Since the balls and boxes are not distinguishable, we can imagine the balls as stars and the boxes as bars. \n\nTo distribute 5 balls into 3 boxes using stars and bars, we need 5 stars and 2 bars to separate the boxes. This means the total arrangement will have 7 objects (5 stars + 2 bars). \n\nThe number of ways to arrange these objects can be calculated using the formula for combinations, which is C(n+r-1, r-1) where n is the number of stars (balls) and r is the number of bars (boxes). \n\nPlugging in our values, we get C(5+3-1, 3-1) = C(7, 2) = 21.\n\nTherefore, there are 21 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls and boxes are not distinguishable.",
