    "solution": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.  The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways we can put 5 balls in 3 boxes, we can use a fun game called musical chairs! Imagine each ball is a player in the game. When the music stops, each player has to sit in one of the boxes.\n\nSince the balls are not different from each other and the boxes are also the same, it doesn't matter which ball goes in which box. It's like everyone is happy to sit in any box!\n\nSo, for each ball, there are 3 choices of boxes to sit in. Since there are 5 balls, we just need to multiply 3 choices by itself 5 times (because there are 5 balls). This is called 3 to the power of 5, which equals 243.\n\nSo, there are 243 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes when the balls and boxes are not different from each other. Yay for math games!",
