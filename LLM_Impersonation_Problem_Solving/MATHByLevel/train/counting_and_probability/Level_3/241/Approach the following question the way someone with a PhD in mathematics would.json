    "solution": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.  The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" from combinatorics. Since the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes, we can imagine the problem as distributing 5 identical balls into 3 identical boxes.\n\nUsing the stars and bars method, we can represent the problem as placing 3 dividers (bars) among 5 stars (balls) to represent the distribution of balls into boxes. There will be 4 spaces between the bars where the balls can be placed (e.g. *|**|***). Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the balls into the boxes is given by the formula:\n\nC(n + r - 1, r - 1) = C(5 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(7, 2) = 21\n\nSo, there are 21 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes.",
