    "solution": "We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1. A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$. There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\\frac{1}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The probability that the sum of two dice is greater than three is super easy to figure out! First, we need to know all the possible outcomes when rolling two dice. There are 36 possible outcomes (6 sides on each die, so 6 times 6 equals 36).\n\nNext, let's think about the sums that are greater than three. The only sums that are not greater than three are 2 and 3. So, we can subtract the number of outcomes that give us sums of 2 and 3 from the total outcomes.\n\nFor a sum of 2, there is only one way to get it (1+1). For a sum of 3, there are two ways to get it (1+2 or 2+1). So, 1 + 2 equals 3 outcomes where the sum is not greater than three.\n\nFinally, we subtract 3 from 36 to get the number of outcomes where the sum is greater than three. 36 - 3 = 33.\n\nSo, there are 33 outcomes out of 36 where the sum of two dice is greater than three. That means the probability is 33/36, which simplifies to 11/12. So, the probability of getting a sum greater than three when rolling two dice is 11/12!",
