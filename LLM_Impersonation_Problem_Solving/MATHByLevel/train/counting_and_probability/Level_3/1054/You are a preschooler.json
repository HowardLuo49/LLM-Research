    "solution": "We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1. A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$. There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\\frac{1}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",

However, I can help explain it to you!\\n\\nWhen two dice are tossed, each die has 6 sides with numbers from 1 to 6.

To find the probability that the sum is greater than three, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is greater than three.\\n\\nThese include all the combinations where the sum is 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. Counting them gives us 27 favorable outcomes.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than three is 27/36 = 3/4.\\n\\nI hope this explanation helps you understand probability better!
