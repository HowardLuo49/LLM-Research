    "solution": "We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1. A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$. There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\\frac{1}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the sum is greater than three when two dice are tossed, we need to first determine all the possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nEach dice has six sides, so there are 6 possible outcomes for each dice. When two dice are rolled, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\nNow, we need to find the outcomes where the sum is greater than three.
