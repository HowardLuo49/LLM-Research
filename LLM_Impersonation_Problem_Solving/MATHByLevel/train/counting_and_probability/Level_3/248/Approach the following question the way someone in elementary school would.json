    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 5 and 17, inclusive.  What is the probability that their product is odd?",
    "solution": "There are 13 integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  In order for the product of two integers to be odd, both of the integers themselves must be odd. There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom72 = 21$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  Therefore, the desired probability is $\\dfrac{21}{78} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have to choose two numbers between 5 and 17. Let's list out all the odd numbers in that range: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. \nNow, let's think about when the product of two numbers is odd. An odd number times anything is always odd.\n\nSo if we choose two odd numbers to multiply, the product will be odd. \nThere are 7 odd numbers in the range of 5 to 17, so there are 7 choices for the first number and 6 choices left for the second number (since they have to be distinct). \nThat means there are 7 * 6 = 42 different pairs of odd numbers we could choose.\n\nThere are also 6 even numbers in that range (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16). If we choose an odd number and an even number to multiply, the product will be even.\n\nSo, the probability of choosing two odd numbers and their product being odd is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 42 pairs of odd numbers divided by all possible pairs of numbers, which is 13 numbers * 12 numbers = 156 pairs of numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability of their product being odd is 42/156 or 7/26.",
