    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 5 and 17, inclusive.  What is the probability that their product is odd?",
    "solution": "There are 13 integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  In order for the product of two integers to be odd, both of the integers themselves must be odd. There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom72 = 21$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  Therefore, the desired probability is $\\dfrac{21}{78} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's find the total number of possible pairs of distinct integers we can choose from 5 to 17. Since we are choosing two distinct integers, the total number of pairs is (17-5)(17-4) = 72.\n\nNow let's find the number of pairs that have an odd product. For the product of two numbers to be odd, at least one of the numbers must be odd. From 5 to 17, there are 7 odd numbers (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17) and 6 even numbers (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16). \n\nSo, for the product to be odd, we have two cases:\n1. We choose an odd number as the first number and any number as the second number (total 7 * 6 = 42 pairs)\n2. We choose an even number as the first number and an odd number as the second number (total 6 * 7 = 42 pairs)\n\nAdding these two cases together, we have a total of 42 + 42 = 84 pairs that give an odd product.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of pairs that give an odd product by the total number of pairs:\nProbability = 84 / 72 = 7 / 6\n\nSo the probability that the product of two distinct integers chosen from 5 to 17 is odd is 7/6.",
