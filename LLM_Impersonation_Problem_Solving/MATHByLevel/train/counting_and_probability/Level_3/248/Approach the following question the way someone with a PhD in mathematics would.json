    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 5 and 17, inclusive.  What is the probability that their product is odd?",
    "solution": "There are 13 integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  In order for the product of two integers to be odd, both of the integers themselves must be odd. There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom72 = 21$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  Therefore, the desired probability is $\\dfrac{21}{78} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of possibilities for choosing two distinct integers between 5 and 17. Since there are 13 integers between 5 and 17 (5, 6, 7, ..., 16, 17), the total number of ways to choose two distinct integers is given by the binomial coefficient (13 choose 2), which is calculated as:\n\nC(13, 2) = 13! / (2! * (13-2)!) = 78.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways in which the product of the two chosen integers is odd. A product is odd if and only if one or both of the factors are odd. Out of the 13 integers between 5 and 17, 7 of them are odd (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17).\n\nTo calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct odd integers, we use the binomial coefficient (7 choose 2), which is:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 21.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two chosen integers is odd is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is:\n\nP(product is odd) = 21 / 78 \u2248 0.2692.\n\nThus, the probability that the product of two distinct integers chosen between 5 and 17 is odd is approximately 0.2692.",
