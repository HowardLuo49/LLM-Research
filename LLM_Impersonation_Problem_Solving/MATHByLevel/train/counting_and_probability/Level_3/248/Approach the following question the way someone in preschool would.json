    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 5 and 17, inclusive.  What is the probability that their product is odd?",
    "solution": "There are 13 integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  In order for the product of two integers to be odd, both of the integers themselves must be odd. There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom72 = 21$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  Therefore, the desired probability is $\\dfrac{21}{78} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see, we have to pick two numbers between 5 and 17. How many numbers are there between 5 and 17? Let's count them together, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. That's 13 numbers! \n\nNow, we want to figure out if the product of two numbers will be odd. Do you remember what makes a number odd? Yes, odd numbers are the ones that end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. So, if we multiply two numbers together, will our answer be odd or even? Hmm.. let's try multiplying some numbers and see what happens.\n\nWhen we multiply an odd number with an even number, what do we get? Yes, we get an even number! But when we multiply two odd numbers together, what do we get? That's right, we get an odd number! \n\nSo, since we have 13 numbers to choose from, let's pick one odd number and one even number. The odd number choices are 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and the even number choices are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. Let's see how many ways we can pick one odd number and one even number.\n\nHmm, there are 7 odd numbers to choose from and 6 even numbers to choose from. So, if we multiply an odd number with an even number, we will get an odd product! \n\nDo you remember how to find probability? Yes, it's the number of ways something can happen divided by the total number of possibilities. So, the probability of choosing two distinct numbers between 5 and 17 and getting an odd product is 7 (odd numbers) multiplied by 6 (even numbers) divided by 13 (total numbers) times 12 (remaining numbers). \n\nLet's calculate that together... 7 times 6 is 42, and 13 times 12 is 156. So, the probability of choosing two distinct numbers between 5 and 17 and getting an odd product is 42/156. \n\nYay, we did it! Good job, friend!",
