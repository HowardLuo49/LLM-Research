    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

Since the only information we have about the number $N$ is that it has a ones digit of 3, we can consider all possible hundreds and tens digits without loss of generality. \\n\\nLet the hundreds digit be $x$ and the tens digit be $y$. Then, the number $N$ can be expressed as $100x + 10y + 3$.\\n\\nSince $N$ is a three-digit number, $1 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 9$ and $0 \\\\leq y \\\\leq 9$.\\n\\nTo find the total number of possibilities, we need to find the total number of values that $x$ and $y$ can take. Since $x$ can take 9 different values and $y$ can take 10 different values, there are a total of $9 \\\\cdot 10 = 90$ possibilities.\\n\\nNext, we need to find the number of possibilities where the sum of the digits of $N$ is divisible by 3. Since we know that the ones digit is 3, the sum of the digits of $N$ is $x + y + 3$. To make this sum divisible by 3, $x + y$ must be congruent to 0 modulo 3.\\n\\nWe can create a table to list all possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this condition:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\n\\\\hline\\nx & y & x+y \\\\pmod{3} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n1 & 2, 5, 8& 0 \\\\\\\\\\n2 & 1, 4, 7 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n3 & 0, 3, 6, 9 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n4 & 1, 4, 7 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n5 & 2, 5, 8 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n6 & 0, 3, 6, 9 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n7 & 1, 4, 7 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n8 & 2, 5, 8 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n9 & 0, 3, 6, 9 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hline\\n\\\\end{array}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nCounting the number of possibilities where $x + y \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{3}$, we find that there are $3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 30$ possibilities.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3 is $\\\\frac{30}{90} = \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{1}{3}}$.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181003, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=582, prompt_tokens=51, total_tokens=633))",
