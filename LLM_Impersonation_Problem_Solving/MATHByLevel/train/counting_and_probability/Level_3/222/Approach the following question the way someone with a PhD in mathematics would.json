    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N = 100a + 10b + 3$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits. Since $N$ is a three-digit positive integer, we have $1 \\leq a \\leq 9$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 9$. We want to find the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.
