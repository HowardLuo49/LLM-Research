    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

Since we know the ones digit of $N$ is 3, we need to find a two-digit number that ends in 3 and add a digit to the left of it to make the sum divisible by 3.\\n\\nThe two-digit numbers that end in 3 are 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, and 93.
