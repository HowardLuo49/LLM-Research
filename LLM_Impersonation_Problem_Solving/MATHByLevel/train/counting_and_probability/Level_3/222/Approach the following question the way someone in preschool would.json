    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out if the number is divisible by 3, we need to add up all the digits in the number. If the sum is divisible by 3, then the whole number is also divisible by 3.\n\nSince we know the ones digit is 3, we need to add two more digits to make a three-digit number. We can choose any digit from 0 to 9 for the tens place and again any digit from 0 to 9 for the hundreds place.\n\nFor example, if we choose the tens place to be 4 and the hundreds place to be 2, we get the number 243.\n\nTo find out how many three-digit numbers we can make with a ones digit of 3, we can count all the possibilities. There are 10 choices for the tens digit (0 through 9) and 10 choices for the hundreds digit (0 through 9), so there are a total of 10 x 10 = 100 possible numbers.\n\nNow we need to find how many of those numbers are divisible by 3. We can start by listing out the numbers from 100 to 999 that are divisible by 3 (103, 106, 109, ...).\n\nIf we count all of those numbers, we get a total of 300 numbers that are divisible by 3 (every third number is divisible by 3).\n\nSo, the probability that a three-digit positive integer with a ones digit of 3 is divisible by 3 is $\\frac{300}{100} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3$.",
