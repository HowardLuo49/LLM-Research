    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the ones digit of $N$ is 3, which means $N$ could be 103, 113, 123, 133, 143, ..., 993. \n\nThere are a total of 10 possible numbers that end in 3, out of 900 total three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999). \n\nTo find the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3, we need to see which of these numbers are divisible by 3. We can do this by adding up the digits and seeing if the sum is divisible by 3. \n\nFor example, 103 has a sum of 1+0+3=4, which is not divisible by 3. \n123 has a sum of 1+2+3=6, which is divisible by 3. \n133 has a sum of 1+3+3=7, which is not divisible by 3. \n\nOut of the 10 numbers ending in 3, 4 of them are divisible by 3. \n\nSo the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3 is $\\frac{4}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
