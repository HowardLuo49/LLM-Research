    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out if a number is divisible by 3, you have to add up all the digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. Since the ones digit is 3, the other two digits can be any number from 0 to 9. \n\nFirst, let's list out all the possible three-digit numbers with a ones digit of 3:\n103, 113, 123, 133, 143, 153, 163, 173, 183, 193\n\nNext, we need to find out which of these numbers are divisible by 3.
