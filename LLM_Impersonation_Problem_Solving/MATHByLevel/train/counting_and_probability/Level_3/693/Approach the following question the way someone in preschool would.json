    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Of the final five contestants in a television show, three are female and two are male. If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many ways we can choose two finalists, and then count how many ways both can be female. \n\nThere are a total of 5 contestants, so we have 5 choices for the first finalist and 4 choices for the second finalist. This gives us a total of 5 x 4 = 20 ways to choose two finalists.\n\nNow, let's count how many ways both finalists can be female. Since there are 3 female contestants, we have 3 choices for the first female finalist and 2 choices for the second female finalist. This gives us a total of 3 x 2 = 6 ways to choose two female finalists.\n\nSo, the probability that both finalists are female is 6/20, which simplifies to 3/10.",
