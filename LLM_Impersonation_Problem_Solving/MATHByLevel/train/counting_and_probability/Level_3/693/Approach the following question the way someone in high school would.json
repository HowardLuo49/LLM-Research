    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Of the final five contestants in a television show, three are female and two are male. If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both final contestants are female, we first need to find the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants out of the 5 remaining contestants. This can be done using combinations, which is calculated as nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of contestants and r is the number of contestants to be chosen.\n\nFor this problem, we have 5 contestants and we need to choose 2, so the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants out of the 5 is:\n\n5C2 = 5! / 2!(5-2)! = (5 x 4) / (2 x 1) = 10\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 female contestants out of the 3 remaining female contestants. This can be calculated in the same way:\n\n3C2 = 3! / 2!(3-2)! = (3 x 2) / (2 x 1) = 3\n\nFinally, the probability that both final contestants are female is the number of ways to choose 2 female contestants out of the 3, divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants out of the 5:\n\n3/10 = 3/10\n\nSo, the probability that both final contestants are female is 3/10.",
