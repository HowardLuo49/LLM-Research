    "solution": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can analyze the set of palindromes between 100 and 500. The smallest palindrome in this range is 101, and the largest palindrome is 499. We can list out the palindromes in this range:\n\n101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212, 222, 232, 242, 252, 262, 272, 282, 292, 303, 313, 323, 333, 343, 353, 363, 373, 383, 393, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484, 494\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these palindromes contain at least one 5. We see that the palindromes 151, 252, and 454 contain the digit 5. So, there are 3 palindromes out of 40 in total that contain at least one 5.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of palindromes containing at least one 5, we divide the number of palindromes containing 5 (3) by the total number of palindromes (40), and then multiply by 100%:\n\n(3/40) * 100% = 7.5%\n\nTherefore, 7.5% of the palindromes between 100 and 500 contain at least one 5.",
