    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A palindrome is an integer that reads the same forward and backward, such as 3663. What percent of the palindromes between 100 and 500 contain at least one 5?",
    "solution": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the palindromes between 100 and 500, first, we need to identify all three-digit palindromes. A three-digit palindrome looks like this: xyx, where x and y can be any number from 1 to 9.\n\nNext, we need to find how many of these palindromes contain at least one 5. The possible combinations which contain at least one 5 are 151, 252, 353, 454. So there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of three-digit palindromes between 100 and 500. The first digit can be any number from 1 to 5 (since we are looking for palindromes between 100 and 500), and the second and third digits can be any number from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are 5*10*10 = 500 three-digit palindromes between 100 and 500.\n\nTo find the percentage of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5, we can calculate (number of palindromes containing 5)/(total number of palindromes) * 100. So, (4/500) * 100 = 0.8%. Therefore, 0.8% of the palindromes between 100 and 500 contain at least one 5.",
