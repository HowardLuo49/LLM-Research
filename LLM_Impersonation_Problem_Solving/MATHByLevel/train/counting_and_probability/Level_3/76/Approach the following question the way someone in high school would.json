    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's start by choosing the six people who will be seated at the table. We can do this in 7 choose 6 ways, which is 7! / (6!1!) = 7 ways to choose the six people.\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of ways we can seat the six people at the table. Since two seatings that are rotations of each other are considered the same, we need to divide the total number of ways to seat them by 6 (the number of rotations). \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose six people and seat them at the table is 7 ways * 1/6 = 1 way.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only 1 way to choose six people and seat them at the circular table.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 840?: First, let's start by choosing the six people who will be seated at the table.
