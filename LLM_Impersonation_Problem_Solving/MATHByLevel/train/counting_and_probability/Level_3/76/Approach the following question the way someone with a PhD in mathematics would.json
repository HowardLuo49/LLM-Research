    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we are dealing with a problem of counting arrangements on a circular table. The total number of ways to choose and seat six people at a circular table with seven seats can be calculated using the concept of permutations.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will first choose six people out of the seven and arrange them in a line. This can be done in 7P6 ways, which is equivalent to 7! / (7-6)! = 7! ways.\n\nHowever, since the circular table is considered the same when rotated, we must correct our count to account for this. There are 6 possible rotations of a given arrangement on the circle (since once one person is seated, the arrangement is fixed). Therefore, the actual number of distinct seating arrangements is 7! / 6 = 720 / 6 = 120 ways.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there are 120 distinct ways to choose six people and seat them at the circular table under the given conditions.",
