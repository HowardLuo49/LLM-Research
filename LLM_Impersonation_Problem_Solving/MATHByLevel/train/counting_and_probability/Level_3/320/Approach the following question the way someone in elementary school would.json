    "solution": "The row that starts 1, 12 is the row $\\binom{12}{0}, \\binom{12}{1}, \\binom{12}{2},\\binom{12}{3}$, so the fourth number in this row is $\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\boxed{220}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fourth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12, we need to remember how Pascal's triangle works. Each number in a row is found by adding together the two numbers directly above it in the row above.\n\nSo, to find the fourth number in this row, we need to add together the second and third numbers in the row above. \n\nThe row above the one we are looking at starts with 1, 11, and 1. Adding 11 and 1 together gives us 12.\n\nTherefore, the fourth number in the row we are looking at is 12.",
