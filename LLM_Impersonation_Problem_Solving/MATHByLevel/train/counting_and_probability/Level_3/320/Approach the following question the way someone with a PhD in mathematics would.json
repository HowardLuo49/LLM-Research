    "solution": "The row that starts 1, 12 is the row $\\binom{12}{0}, \\binom{12}{1}, \\binom{12}{2},\\binom{12}{3}$, so the fourth number in this row is $\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\boxed{220}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fourth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12, we use the formula for calculating the nth number in the mth row of Pascal's triangle, given by the combinatorial expression: C(m-1, n-1), where C denotes the binomial coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the row starts with 1 and then 12, implying it is the 13th row of Pascal's triangle. Therefore, the fourth number in this row can be calculated as C(12, 3).\n\nUsing the formula for binomial coefficients, C(m, n) = m! / (n!(m-n)!), we can calculate C(12, 3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!) = 12! / (3!9!).\n\nSimplifying further, C(12, 3) = 12 * 11 * 10 / (3 * 2 * 1) = 220.\n\nTherefore, the fourth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12 is 220.",
