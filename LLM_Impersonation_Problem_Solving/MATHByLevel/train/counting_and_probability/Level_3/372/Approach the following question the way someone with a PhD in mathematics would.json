    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, let's consider the possible positions of Cara around the circular table. Since the table is circular, we can think of the arrangement as starting with any arbitrary person and then arranging the remaining people around the table in a circle. \n\nTherefore, there are 6 possible positions for Cara to sit as shown below:\n1. Cara sits between Person 1 and Person 2,\n2. Cara sits between Person 2 and Person 3,\n3. Cara sits between Person 3 and Person 4,\n4. Cara sits between Person 4 and Person 5,\n5. Cara sits between Person 5 and Person 1,\n6. Cara sits directly across from Person 1.\n\nHence, there are 5 possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between: (Person 1, Person 2), (Person 2, Person 3), (Person 3, Person 4), (Person 4, Person 5), and (Person 5, Person 1).",
