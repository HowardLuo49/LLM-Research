    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",
    "gpt_response": "Cara can be sitting between any two of her five friends. So, the number of possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between is 5 choose 2, which is equal to $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 different possible pairs of people that Cara could be sitting between.",
