    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to think about all the possible combinations of three-digit numbers that meet the given property. \n\nFirst, let's consider the possible values for the middle digit. Since the middle digit is the average of the first and last digits, it must be an integer value. This means that the average of the first and last digits must also be an integer. \n\nLet's break down the possible combinations:\n\nIf the middle digit is 0, then the average of the first and last digits must also be 0. This means the possible values for the first and last digits are (0, 0), giving us only one possibility - 000.\n\nIf the middle digit is 1, then the average of the first and last digits must be 1. This means the possible values for the first and last digits are (0, 2) or (2, 0), giving us two possibilities - 102 and 201.\n\nWe can continue this pattern and list out all the possible combinations and check how many three-digit numbers satisfy the given property. \n\nBy going through each possible value for the middle digit, we can determine that there are a total of 36 three-digit numbers that satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and last digits. \n\nSo, the answer is 36 three-digit numbers.",
