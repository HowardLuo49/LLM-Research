    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",

For each combination of A and C, there is only one possible value for B that satisfies the equation above.\\n\\nFor example, if A = 2 and C = 4, then B = (2 + 4)/2 = 3. \\n\\nTherefore, there are a total of 9 x 10 = 90 three-digit numbers that satisfy the given property.\\n\\nSo, as a preschooler, you could say that there are 90 three-digit numbers that have the middle digit as the average of the first and last digits.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180579, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=230, prompt_tokens=36, total_tokens=266))",
