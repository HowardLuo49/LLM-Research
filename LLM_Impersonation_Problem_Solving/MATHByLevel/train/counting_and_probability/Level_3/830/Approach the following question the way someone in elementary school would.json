    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break it down step by step. First, let's think about all the possible three-digit numbers. We can start at 100 and go all the way up to 999.\n\nNext, let's think about the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits. This means that the middle digit has to be right in between the first and last digits. For example, if the number is 345, the middle digit is 4, which is right in between 3 and 5.\n\nNow, let's think about all the possible combinations of numbers that satisfy this property. For each set of first and last digits (for example, 1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, etc.), there is only one possible middle digit that satisfies the property.\n\nSo, for each set of first and last digits, we have one three-digit number that satisfies the property.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 sets of first and last digits (1 and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, etc.), so there are 9 three-digit numbers that satisfy the property.\n\nSo, the answer is 9 three-digit numbers satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits.",
