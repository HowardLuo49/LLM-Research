    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many three-digit numbers satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits?",
    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, let's consider the three-digit number in general form as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits of the number.\n\nFrom the property given, we have the equation B = (A + C) / 2.\n\nSince A, B, and C are digits of the three-digit number, we have the following constraints:\n- A, B, and C are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive).\n- B must be an integer since it represents the middle digit.\n\nFrom the equation B = (A + C) / 2, we can rewrite it as 2B = A + C.\n\nWe can reexpress the equation in terms of B:\n- If B = 0, then A + C = 0.\n- If B = 1, then A + C = 2.\n- If B = 2, then A + C = 4.\n- If B = 3, then A + C = 6.\n- If B = 4, then A + C = 8.\n- If B = 5, then A + C = 10, but this is not possible since A and C are digits between 0 and 9.\n- If B = 6, then A + C = 12, which is not possible for the same reason.\n- If B = 7, then A + C = 14, which is also not feasible.\n- If B = 8, then A + C = 16, which is not possible.\n- If B = 9, then A + C = 18, which is also not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for B are B = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. There are 5 possible values for the middle digit B. Each of these values uniquely determines the values of A and C, resulting in a total of 5 three-digit numbers that satisfy the given property.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 5 three-digit numbers that satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits.",
