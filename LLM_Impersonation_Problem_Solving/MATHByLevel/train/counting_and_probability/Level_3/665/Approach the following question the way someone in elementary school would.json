    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If there's a 3 out of 4 chance of snow, that means there's a 1 out of 4 chance of no snow. \nSo to find the probability of no snow for all three days, we have to multiply the probability of no snow for each day: \n$\\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$\n\nSo the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{1?: If there's a 3 out of 4 chance of snow, that means there's a 1 out of 4 chance of no snow. \nSo to find the probability of no snow for all three days, we have to multiply the probability of no snow for each day: \n$\\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$\n\nSo the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
