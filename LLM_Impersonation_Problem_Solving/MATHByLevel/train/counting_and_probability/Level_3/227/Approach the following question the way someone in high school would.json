    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular octagon, we need to choose any 3 out of the 8 vertices to form a triangle. This can be done by using the combination formula which is denoted as nCr = n! / r!*(n-r)!, where n is the total number of objects to choose from and r is the number of objects to choose.\n\nSo, for this scenario, we have 8 vertices (n) and we want to choose 3 vertices to form a triangle (r).\n\nTherefore, the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular octagon is calculated as 8C3 = 8! / 3!(8-3)! = 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular octagon.",
