    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many triangles we can make from the vertices of an octagon, we need to think about how many different ways we can choose 3 vertices to make a triangle. \n\nFirst, let's think about how many total vertices an octagon has. An octagon has 8 vertices. \n\nTo make a triangle, we need to choose 3 vertices from the 8 total vertices. This is like picking out 3 friends to play with on the playground. \n\nTo find out how many ways we can choose 3 vertices from 8, we can use a combination formula. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r! * (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items you are choosing. \n\nIn this case, n is 8 (the total number of vertices in the octagon) and r is 3 (the number of vertices needed to make a triangle). \n\nSo, plugging in our numbers, 8C3 = 8! / 3! * (8-3)! = 8! / 3! * 5! = 56. \n\nSo, there are 56 different triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular octagon.",
