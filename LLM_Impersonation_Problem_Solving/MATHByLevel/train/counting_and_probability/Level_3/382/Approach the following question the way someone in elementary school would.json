If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have to find the probability that the distance between two cities is less than $7000$ miles. We can look at the chart and see which pairs of cities are less than $7000$ miles apart.\n\nThe pairs that are less than $7000$ miles apart are:\n- Bangkok and Cape Town\n- Bangkok and London\n- Cape Town and London\n- London and Bangkok\n\nSo there are $4$ possible pairs of cities that are less than $7000$ miles apart. \n\nNow, let's find the total number of pairs of cities we can choose from. There are $4$ cities in total, so the total number of ways to choose 2 cities is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen cities is less than $7000$ miles is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.
