If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",
    "gpt_response": "In high school, we would calculate the probability by finding all the pairs of cities where the distance is less than 7000 miles and then dividing that by the total number of pairs of cities.\n\nThe pairs of cities where the distance is less than 7000 miles are:\n1. Bangkok and Cape Town: 6300 miles\n2. Bangkok and London: 5944 miles\n3. Cape Town and London: 5989 miles\n\nSo, there are 3 pairs of cities with distances less than 7000 miles. \n\nNow, we need to find the total number of pairs of cities, which is given by how many ways we can choose 2 cities from the 4 cities in the chart. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $C(n, r)$, which is $\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.\n\nFor 4 cities, the total number of pairs is $C(4,2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the distance between two random cities is less than 7000 miles is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
