If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",

That's less than 7000 miles.\n\nBangkok and Honolulu are 6609 miles apart. That's less than 7000 miles.\n\nCape Town and London are 5989 miles apart. That's less than 7000 miles.\n\nHonolulu and London are 7240 miles apart. That's more than 7000 miles.\n\nSo, when we choose two cities at random, there are 3 ways they can be less than 7000 miles apart (Bangkok-Cape Town, Bangkok-Honolulu, Cape Town-London) and 4 total ways they can be chosen. \n\nSo the probability is $\\frac{3}{4}$.",
