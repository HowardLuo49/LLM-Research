There are 32 students in his class. In addition to the information in the Venn diagram, Jeremy knows half of the students have a dog, $\\frac{3}{8}$ have a cat, six have some other pet and five have no pet at all. How many students have all three types of pets (i.e. they have a cat and a dog as well as some other pet)?

    "solution": "Let's first look at the four things the question tells us: First, the number of dogs is $x+y+z+10=\\frac{32}{2}$, so $x+y+z=6.$ The number of cats is $w + x+ z +9= 32\\times\\frac{3}{8}$, so $w + x + z= 3$  Since 6 people have other pets, $w+y+z=4.$ The total number of people with pets is $$w+x+y+z+2+9+10=32-5,$$ so $w+x+y+z=6.$\n\nFrom here, we can subtract the third equation from the fourth, to find that $x=2$.  Plugging that into the first equation, we find $y+z=4$.  From the third equation, we can then see, $w=0$.  Finally, from the second equation, we find $z=1$. Thus, there is $\\boxed{1}$ student with cats, dogs, and other pets.",

The overlap between \"Cats\" and \"Other Pets\" has 2 students, denoted as $y$, and the overlap between \"Dogs\" and \"Other Pets\" has 10 students, denoted as $w$. The intersection of all three sets (representing students with all three types of pets) is denoted as $z$. \n\nGiven that $32$ students are in the class, we can set up the following equation based on the information provided:\n\\[32 = x + y + w + z + 9 + 2 + 10\\]\n\nAdditionally, we know that:\n- Half of the students have a dog, so $\\frac{32}{2} = 16$ students have a dog.\n- $\\frac{3}{8}$ of students have a cat, so $\\frac{3}{8} \\times 32 = 12$ students have a cat.\n- Six students have some other pet.\n- Five students have no pet at all.\n\nBased on the Venn diagram, we also have:\n\\[x + z = 9\\]\n\\[y + z = 2\\]\n\\[w + z = 10\\]\n\nUsing all of this information, we can set up and solve a system of linear equations to find the value of $z$, which represents the number of students who have all three types of pets.",
