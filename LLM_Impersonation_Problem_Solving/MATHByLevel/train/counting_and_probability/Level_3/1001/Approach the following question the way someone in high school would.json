There are 32 students in his class. In addition to the information in the Venn diagram, Jeremy knows half of the students have a dog, $\\frac{3}{8}$ have a cat, six have some other pet and five have no pet at all. How many students have all three types of pets (i.e. they have a cat and a dog as well as some other pet)?

    "solution": "Let's first look at the four things the question tells us: First, the number of dogs is $x+y+z+10=\\frac{32}{2}$, so $x+y+z=6.$ The number of cats is $w + x+ z +9= 32\\times\\frac{3}{8}$, so $w + x + z= 3$  Since 6 people have other pets, $w+y+z=4.$ The total number of people with pets is $$w+x+y+z+2+9+10=32-5,$$ so $w+x+y+z=6.$\n\nFrom here, we can subtract the third equation from the fourth, to find that $x=2$.  Plugging that into the first equation, we find $y+z=4$.  From the third equation, we can then see, $w=0$.  Finally, from the second equation, we find $z=1$. Thus, there is $\\boxed{1}$ student with cats, dogs, and other pets.",
