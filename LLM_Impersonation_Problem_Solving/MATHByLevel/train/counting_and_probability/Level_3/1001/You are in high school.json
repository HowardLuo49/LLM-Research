    "solution": "Let's first look at the four things the question tells us: First, the number of dogs is $x+y+z+10=\\frac{32}{2}$, so $x+y+z=6.$ The number of cats is $w + x+ z +9= 32\\times\\frac{3}{8}$, so $w + x + z= 3$  Since 6 people have other pets, $w+y+z=4.$ The total number of people with pets is $$w+x+y+z+2+9+10=32-5,$$ so $w+x+y+z=6.$\n\nFrom here, we can subtract the third equation from the fourth, to find that $x=2$.  Plugging that into the first equation, we find $y+z=4$.  From the third equation, we can then see, $w=0$.  Finally, from the second equation, we find $z=1$. Thus, there is $\\boxed{1}$ student with cats, dogs, and other pets.",
