    "solution": "A seven-sided polygon has seven vertices. There are ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$ ways to connect the pairs of these 7 points. But 7 of those pairs are pairs of consecutive vertices, so they are counted as sides. So, only $21 - 7 = \\boxed{14}$ of these segments are diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. A seven-sided polygon is also called a heptagon. To figure out how many diagonals it has, we can use the formula: n(n-3)/2, where n is the number of sides. So for a seven-sided polygon, we would plug in 7 for n.\n\nTherefore, the formula gives us 7(7-3)/2, which simplifies to 7(4)/2 = 28/2 = 14. So a regular seven-sided polygon contains 14 diagonals.",
