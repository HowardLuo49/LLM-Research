(Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the ways we can put the animals in cages!\nFirst, let's put all the chickens together. There are 4 chickens, so we can arrange them in 4! ways.\n\nNext, let's put all the dogs together. There are 2 dogs, so we can arrange them in 2! ways.\n\nLastly, let's put all the cats together. There are 5 cats, so we can arrange them in 5! ways.\n\nNow, since the chickens, dogs, and cats can go in any order, we need to multiply the number of ways we can arrange each group of animals together. So, we have:\n4! * 2! * 5! = 24 * 2 * 120 = 5760\n\nSo, there are 5760 ways to place the animals in a row of 11 cages in Happy Valley!",
