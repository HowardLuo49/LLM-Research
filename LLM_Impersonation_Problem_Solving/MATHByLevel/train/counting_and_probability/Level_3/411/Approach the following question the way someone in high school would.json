    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats.  (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to treat each type of animal as a single unit. Therefore, we can think of the 4 chickens as one unit, the 2 dogs as another unit, and the 5 cats as a third unit.\n\nNow, we have 3 units (chickens, dogs, cats) that we need to arrange in a row of 11 cages. We can arrange these units in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nWithin each unit, the animals can be arranged in a row in different ways. For the chickens, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the chickens, for the dogs, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the dogs, and for the cats, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the cats.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the 11 animals in a row of 11 cages is 6 x 24 x 2 x 120 = 34,560 ways.",
