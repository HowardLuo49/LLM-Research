    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out how many options we have for each position. \n\nQuarterback: 10 options because any of the 10 team members can play this position.\nRunning back: 9 options because we can't have the same player playing two positions.\nOffensive lineman: 3 options (since only 3 are strong enough).\nWide receiver: 7 options because we have used up 3 players for the other positions.\n\nTo find the total number of ways we can choose a starting lineup, we multiply the number of options for each position: 10 x 9 x 3 x 7 = 1,890. \n\nSo, there are 1,890 ways to choose a starting lineup for our football team.",
