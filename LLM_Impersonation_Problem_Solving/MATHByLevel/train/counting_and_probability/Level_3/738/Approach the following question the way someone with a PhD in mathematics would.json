    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways to choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver, we can break it down into steps. \n\nStep 1: Choose the offensive lineman\nSince there are only 3 strong enough players to play offensive lineman, there are 3 ways to choose an offensive lineman.\n\nStep 2: Choose the remaining players\nAfter choosing the offensive lineman, we have 9 remaining players to choose from for the quarterback, running back, and wide receiver positions. \nThere are 9 ways to choose the quarterback, \n8 ways to choose the running back (excluding the quarterback chosen in the previous step), and \n7 ways to choose the wide receiver (excluding the quarterback and running back chosen in the previous steps).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose the starting lineup is:\n3 (offensive lineman) * 9 (quarterback) * 8 (running back) * 7 (wide receiver) = 1512 ways. \n\nSo, there are 1512 ways to choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver from the 10 members of the football team.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 1512?: To find the number of ways to choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver, we can break it down into steps. \n\nStep 1: Choose the offensive lineman\nSince there are only 3 strong enough players to play offensive lineman, there are 3 ways to choose an offensive lineman.\n\nStep 2: Choose the remaining players\nAfter choosing the offensive lineman, we have 9 remaining players to choose from for the quarterback, running back, and wide receiver positions. \nThere are 9 ways to choose the quarterback, \n8 ways to choose the running back (excluding the quarterback chosen in the previous step), and \n7 ways to choose the wide receiver (excluding the quarterback and running back chosen in the previous steps).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose the starting lineup is:\n3 (offensive lineman) * 9 (quarterback) * 8 (running back) * 7 (wide receiver) = 1512 ways. \n\nSo, there are 1512 ways to choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver from the 10 members of the football team.",
