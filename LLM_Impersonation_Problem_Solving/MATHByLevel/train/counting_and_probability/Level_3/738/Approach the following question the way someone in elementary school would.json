    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have 10 football players on our team. Three of them can play as offensive lineman, and the rest can play any position.\n\nTo choose our starting lineup, we need to pick one quarterback, one running back, one offensive lineman, and one wide receiver.\n\nWe have 10 players to choose from for the quarterback position.\nWe have 9 players to choose from for the running back position (since we've already used one player for the quarterback).\nWe have 3 players to choose from for the offensive lineman position.\nWe have 6 players left to choose from for the wide receiver position.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose our starting lineup, we multiply the number of choices for each position:\n10 quarterbacks * 9 running backs * 3 offensive linemen * 6 wide receivers = 1,620 ways\n\nSo, there are 1,620 ways to choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver from our 10 football players.",
