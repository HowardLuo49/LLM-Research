    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ different pairs of marbles can be drawn, and the expected value of the sum is the average of the sums of each pair.  This is  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{10}((1+2)+(1+3)+(1+4)+(1+5)+(2+3)&\\\\\n+(2+4)+(2+5)+(3+4)+(3+5)+(4+5))&=\\frac{60}{10} = \\boxed{6}. \\end{align*}",

The possible sums of these pairs range from 3 (1 + 2) to 9 (4 + 5).\n\nTo calculate the expected value, we need to assign probabilities to each possible sum. \n\nThe probability of getting a sum of 3 (1 + 2) is 1/10 since there is only one pair that adds up to 3. The probability of getting a sum of 4 (1 + 3 or 2 + 2) is 2/10, and so on.\n\nThe expected value is then calculated as the sum of the products of each sum and its corresponding probability:\n\nExpected value = (3*1/10) + (4*2/10) + (5*2/10) + (6*2/10) + (7*2/10) + (8*1/10) + (9*0) \n\nExpected value = 3/10 + 8/10 + 10/10 + 12/10 + 14/10 + 8/10\n\nExpected value = 3.5\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the sum of the numbers on the marbles is 3.5.",
