    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ different pairs of marbles can be drawn, and the expected value of the sum is the average of the sums of each pair.  This is  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{10}((1+2)+(1+3)+(1+4)+(1+5)+(2+3)&\\\\\n+(2+4)+(2+5)+(3+4)+(3+5)+(4+5))&=\\frac{60}{10} = \\boxed{6}. \\end{align*}",

When you pick two marbles at random, you can get any of the following sums: 1+2, 1+3, 1+4, 1+5, 2+3, 2+4, 2+5, 3+4, 3+5, 4+5. \n\nAdding these up, you get 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 102\n\nSince there are 10 possible outcomes when picking two marbles, you divide 102 by 10 to get the expected value of the sum of the numbers on the marbles:\n\n102 / 10 = 10.2\n\nSo, the expected value of the sum of the numbers on the marbles is 10.2.",
