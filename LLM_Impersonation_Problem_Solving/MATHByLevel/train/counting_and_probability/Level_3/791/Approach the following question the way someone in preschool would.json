    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ different pairs of marbles can be drawn, and the expected value of the sum is the average of the sums of each pair.  This is  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{10}((1+2)+(1+3)+(1+4)+(1+5)+(2+3)&\\\\\n+(2+4)+(2+5)+(3+4)+(3+5)+(4+5))&=\\frac{60}{10} = \\boxed{6}. \\end{align*}",

The first marble could be any number from 1 to 5, and then the second marble could be any other number from 1 to 5. Let's think about all the different combinations we could get.\n\nFirst, let's think about the pairs we could pick:\n- 1 and 2\n- 1 and 3\n- 1 and 4\n- 1 and 5\n- 2 and 3\n- 2 and 4\n- 2 and 5\n- 3 and 4\n- 3 and 5\n- 4 and 5\n\nNow let's think about what the sum of each pair would be:\n- 1 + 2 = 3\n- 1 + 3 = 4\n- 1 + 4 = 5\n- 1 + 5 = 6\n- 2 + 3 = 5\n- 2 + 4 = 6\n- 2 + 5 = 7\n- 3 + 4 = 7\n- 3 + 5 = 8\n- 4 + 5 = 9\n\nSo, the possible sums we could get are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Now we need to figure out how likely each sum is to happen. \n\nThere are 10 different pairs we could pick, and each pair has the same chance of being picked, so each sum has a 1/10 chance of happening. \n\nNow, let's find the expected value of the sum by adding up all the possible sums multiplied by their probabilities:\n(3 * 1/10) + (4 * 1/10) + (5 * 1/10) + (6 * 1/10) + (7 * 1/10) + (8 * 1/10) + (9 * 1/10) = 5.5\n\nSo, the expected value of the sum of the numbers on the marbles is 5.5!",
