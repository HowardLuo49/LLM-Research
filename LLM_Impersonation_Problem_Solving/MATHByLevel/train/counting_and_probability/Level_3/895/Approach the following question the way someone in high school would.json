    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. We want to find the probability that a family with three children has at least one boy and one girl.\n\nTo do this, we can think about the possible combinations of children that could be in the family. There are 2^3 = 8 total possible outcomes: BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, GGG (where B represents a boy and G represents a girl).\n\nOut of these 8 possible outcomes, there are 7 outcomes that include at least one boy and one girl: BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, GGG.\n\nSo the probability that a family with three children includes at least one boy and one girl is 7/8.\n\nSo the answer is 7/8.",
