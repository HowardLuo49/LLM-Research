Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, what is the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about all the possible ways a family could have three children. The children could all be boys, all be girls, have two boys and one girl, or have two girls and one boy.\n\nSo, if we want to find the probability of having at least one boy and one girl, we need to figure out how many of these possibilities fit that criteria.\n\nThere are only two possibilities that fit our criteria: two boys and one girl, or two girls and one boy. So the probability of having at least one boy and one girl is 2 out of the total 4 possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 2/4, which simplifies to 1/2. So, our answer is 1/2.",
