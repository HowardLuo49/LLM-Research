Each team has an equal chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Precisely one team must win at least four games.  Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games, we need to think about all the possible outcomes. \n\nSince each team has an equal chance of winning each game, we can use a \"penny flip\" to represent each game. If the penny lands on heads, the Badgers win. If it lands on tails, the Cougars win.\n\nThere are a total of 2^7 = 128 possible outcomes for the series of seven games. To find the probability that the Badgers win at least four games, we need to add up all the outcomes where they win four, five, six, or all seven games.\n\n- For the Badgers to win exactly four games, there are 7 choose 4 = 35 possible outcomes.\n- For the Badgers to win exactly five games, there are 7 choose 5 = 21 possible outcomes.\n- For the Badgers to win exactly six games, there are 7 choose 6 = 7 possible outcomes.\n- For the Badgers to win all seven games, there is 1 possible outcome.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where the Badgers win at least four games is 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.\n\nSo the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is 64/128 = 1/2. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is 1/2.",
