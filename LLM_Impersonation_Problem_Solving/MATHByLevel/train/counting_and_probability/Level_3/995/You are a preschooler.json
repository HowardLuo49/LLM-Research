This can be done in (7 choose 4) = 35 ways.\\n\\nSimilarly, there are (7 choose 5) = 21 ways for the Badgers to win exactly 5 games, (7 choose 6) = 7 ways to win exactly 6 games, and only 1 way to win all 7 games.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of ways for the Badgers to win at least 4 games is 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.\\n\\nSo, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is 64/128 = 1/2. \\n\\nTherefore, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games in the series is 1/2.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181613, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=278, prompt_tokens=62, total_tokens=340))",
