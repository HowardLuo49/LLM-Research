Each team has an equal chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Precisely one team must win at least four games.  Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games in a series of seven basketball games against the Cougars, we can use the concept of binomial probability.\n\nLet X be the random variable denoting the number of games that the Badgers win out of the seven games. X follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 7 (number of games) and p = 0.5 (probability of winning each game).\n\nThe probability mass function of X is given by P(X=k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\nWe want to find the probability that the Badgers win at least four games, which is equivalent to finding P(X\u22654) = P(X=4) + P(X=5) + P(X=6) + P(X=7).\n\nSubstitute the values of n, p, and k into the probability mass function and calculate the probabilities:\n\nP(X=4) = C(7,4) * (0.5)^4 * (0.5)^(7-4) = 35 * 0.0625 * 0.125 = 0.2734\nP(X=5) = C(7,5) * (0.5)^5 * (0.5)^(7-5) = 21 * 0.03125 * 0.0625 = 0.1641\nP(X=6) = C(7,6) * (0.5)^6 * (0.5)^(7-6) = 7 * 0.015625 * 0.03125 = 0.0278\nP(X=7) = C(7,7) * (0.5)^7 * (0.5)^(7-7) = 1 * 0.0078125 * 0.0078125 = 0.000061\n\nTherefore, P(X\u22654) = 0.2734 + 0.1641 + 0.0278 + 0.000061 = 0.4654\n\nTherefore, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is 4654/10000 or 1163/2500.",
