    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In how many ways can 6 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet? (Note that two arrangements are the same if one can be rotated or reflected to produce the other.)",
    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of group theory. In this case, the group we are interested in is the dihedral group D6, which consists of all rotations and reflections that can be performed on a regular hexagon.\n\nThe total number of ways to place 6 distinct beads on a bracelet is equal to the number of orbits under the action of D6 on the set of all possible arrangements of the beads. \n\nTo calculate this, we can use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of orbits under the action of a group G on a set X is given by the average number of fixed points of elements of G acting on X. In our case, the number of fixed points represents the number of arrangements that are unchanged under a particular rotation or reflection.\n\nFor D6, there are a total of 12 elements: 6 rotations and 6 reflections. Let's calculate the number of fixed points for each element:\n\n- Identity: All arrangements remain fixed under the identity element, so there are 6! = 720 fixed points.\n- Rotations: There are 6 rotations, each with 6 fixed points (since the beads can be rotated to form the same arrangement), giving a total of 6 * 6 = 36 fixed points.\n- Reflections: There are 6 reflections, each with 3 fixed points (since the beads can be flipped to form the same arrangement), giving a total of 6 * 3 = 18 fixed points.\n\nNow we can use Burnside's Lemma to calculate the number of orbits:\n\nNumber of orbits = (1/12) * (720 + 6*36 + 6*18) = (1/12) * (720 + 216 + 108) = (1/12) * 1044 = 87.\n\nTherefore, there are 87 different ways to place 6 distinct beads on a bracelet, taking into account rotations and reflections.",
