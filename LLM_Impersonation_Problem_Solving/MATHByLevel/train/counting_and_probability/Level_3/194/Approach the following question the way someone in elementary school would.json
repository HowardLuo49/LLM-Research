    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's pretend we have 6 different colored beads that we want to put on a bracelet. We want to know how many ways we can put them on the bracelet so that it looks different each time.\n\nIf we start with one bead, we can put it in any of the 6 spots on the bracelet. Once we have put that bead on, we have 5 spots left to put the next bead. Then, we have 4 spots left for the third bead, and so on.\n\nTo figure out how many ways we can arrange the beads, we multiply all the numbers together: 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.\n\nSo, there are 720 different ways that we can arrange 6 distinct beads on a bracelet!",
