    "solution": "We first have to figure out the different groups of 4 one-digit numbers whose product is 12.  We obviously can't use 12 as one of the numbers, nor can we use 9, 8, or 7 (none divides 12).  We can use 6, in which case one of the other numbers is 2 and the other two are 1s.  So, we can have the number 6211, or any number we can form by reordering these digits.  There are $4!$ ways to order these four numbers, but we have to divide by $2!$ because the two 1s are the same, so $4!$ counts each possible number twice.  That gives us $4!/2!=12$ numbers that consist of 6, 2, and two 1s.\n\nNext, we note that we can't have a 5, so we think about 4.  If we have a 4, then the other three numbers are 3, 1, 1.  Just as there are 12 ways to order the digits in 6211, there are 12 ways to order the digits in 4311.  Finally, we check if there are any ways to get a product of 12 with digits that are 3 or less.  There's only one such group, the digits in 3221.  As with 6211 and 4311, there are 12 distinct ways to order the digits in 3221.\n\nCombining our three cases, we have $12+12+12=\\boxed{36}$ possible integers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct four-digit positive integers whose digits multiply to 12, we can use combinatorial techniques. \n\nFirst, let's list out the possible combinations of digits that multiply to 12:\n\n1*1*3*4 = 12  \n1*2*2*3 = 12  \n\nBased on these combinations, we can see that the following digits can be used in forming a four-digit integer whose digits multiply to 12: {1, 1, 3, 4} and {1, 2, 2, 3}.\n\nNow, for each of these sets of digits, we can arrange them in different permutations to form distinct four-digit positive integers.\n\nFor {1, 1, 3, 4}, there are 4! / (2! * 1! * 1!) = 12 distinct permutations, where we divide by 2! for the repeating digit 1.\n\nFor {1, 2, 2, 3}, there are 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6 distinct permutations, where we divide by 2! for the repeating digits 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct four-digit positive integers whose digits multiply to 12 can be calculated as the sum of these permutations, i.e., 12 + 6 = 18. \n\nHence, there are 18 distinct four-digit positive integers that satisfy the given condition.",
