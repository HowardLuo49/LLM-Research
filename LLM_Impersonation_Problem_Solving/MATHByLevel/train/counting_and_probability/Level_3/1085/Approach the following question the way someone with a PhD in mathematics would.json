    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
    "solution": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that both plates are the same color when randomly selecting two plates out of a total of 9 plates (5 red and 4 blue), we first need to determine the total number of ways we can choose 2 plates from the 9 available plates:\n\nThis can be calculated using the combination formula, which states that the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects is given by nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n! represents the factorial of n (n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... x 2 x 1).\n\nIn this case, the total number of ways to choose 2 plates from 9 plates is 9C2 = 9! / (2!(9-2)!) = 36.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways we can select 2 plates of the same color.
