    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
    "solution": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both plates are the same color, we first need to determine the total number of ways we can select two plates from the total of 9 plates.\n\nThe total number of ways to select two plates out of 9 plates is given by the combination formula: C(9,2) = 9! / (2! * (9-2)!) = 36.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of ways to select two red plates from the 5 red plates: C(5,2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to select two blue plates from the 4 blue plates is: C(4,2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select two plates of the same color is 10 (for red plates) + 6 (for blue plates) = 16.\n\nSo, the probability of randomly selecting two plates that are the same color is the number of ways to select two plates of the same color divided by the total number of ways to select two plates: 16/36 = 4/9.",
