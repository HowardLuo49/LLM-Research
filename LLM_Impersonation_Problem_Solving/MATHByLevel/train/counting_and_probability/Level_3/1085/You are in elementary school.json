    "problem_prompt": "You are in elementary school.\nI have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
    "solution": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",

This can be calculated using the combination formula:\\n\\nTotal number of ways to choose 2 plates out of 9 plates = 9 choose 2 = 9! / (2!(9-2)!) = 36\\n\\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways we can choose 2 plates of the same color. Since we have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates:\\n\\nNumber of ways to choose 2 red plates = 5 choose 2 = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10\\nNumber of ways to choose 2 blue plates = 4 choose 2 = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 plates of the same color = 10 (red) + 6 (blue) = 16\\n\\nSo, the probability that both plates are the same color = Number of ways to choose 2 plates of the same color / Total number of ways to choose 2 plates\\n= 16 / 36\\n= 4 / 9\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that both plates are the same color is 4/9.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180839, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=278, prompt_tokens=48, total_tokens=326))",
