    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
    "solution": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's count the red plates first. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now let's count the blue plates. 1, 2, 3, 4. So there are 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If we pick two plates randomly, we need to think about all the different combinations we can make. \n\nLet's pick a red plate first. There are 5 red plates to choose from. Then if we pick another plate, there are 4 red plates left to choose from. So the probability of picking two red plates is 5/9.\n\nNow let's pick a blue plate first. There are 4 blue plates to choose from. Then if we pick another plate, there are 3 blue plates left to choose from. So the probability of picking two blue plates is 4/9.\n\nSo the probability of picking two plates that are the same color is 5/9 + 4/9 = 9/9. Yay, we did it!",
