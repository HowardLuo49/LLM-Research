    "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to shade the tessellation shown, we must consider the concept of a \"vertex coloring\" of the tessellation. \n\nIn this context, a vertex coloring is a way of assigning colors to the vertices of the tessellation such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. In other words, if two tiles share a side in the tessellation, their corresponding vertices must have different colors.\n\nIn the given tessellation, each vertex has 4 neighboring vertices. Therefore, we need at least 5 different colors to ensure that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This can be seen by considering a complete graph on 5 vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge.\n\nHence, the least number of colors needed to shade the tessellation shown such that no two tiles sharing a side are the same color is 5.",
