    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$, we can use the binomial theorem. The coefficient of $x^r$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^n$ is given by the expression $\\binom{n}{r}(-1)^{n-r}$.\n\nIn this case, $n=9$ and $r=8$, so the coefficient of $x^8$ is $\\binom{9}{8}(-1)^{9-8} = 9(-1) = -9$.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is -9.",
