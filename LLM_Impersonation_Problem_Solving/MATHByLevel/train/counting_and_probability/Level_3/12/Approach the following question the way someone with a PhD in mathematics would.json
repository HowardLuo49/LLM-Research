    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$, we can use the binomial theorem. \n\nThe binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer $n$ and any real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have:\n\n$$(a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k$$\n\nIn this case, $a=x$ and $b=-1$, which means that the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ will look like:\n\n$$(x-1)^9 = \\sum_{k=0}^{9} \\binom{9}{k}x^{9-k}(-1)^k$$\n\nThe coefficient of $x^8$ will be found when $k=1$, since $9-1=8$. So we need to find the value of $\\binom{9}{1}(-1)^1$ in order to determine the coefficient of $x^8$:\n\n$$\\binom{9}{1}(-1)^1 = 9*(-1) = -9$$\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is $-9$.",
