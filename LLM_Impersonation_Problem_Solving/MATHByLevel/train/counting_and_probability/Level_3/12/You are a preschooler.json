The formula for the $k^{th}$ term in the expansion of $(a+b)^n$ is given by $\\\\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k$.\\n\\nIn this case, $a = x$ and $b = -1$, so the $k^{th}$ term in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is $\\\\binom{9}{k}x^{9-k}(-1)^k$.\\n\\nTo find the coefficient of $x^8$, we need to find the value of $k$ such that $9-k = 8$, which means $k=1$. Thus, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is $\\\\binom{9}{1}x^{9-1}(-1)^1 = 9x^8(-1) = -9x^8$.\\n\\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is $-9$.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181106, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=243, prompt_tokens=35, total_tokens=278))",
