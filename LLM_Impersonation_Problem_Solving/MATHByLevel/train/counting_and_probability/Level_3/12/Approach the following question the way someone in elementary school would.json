    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9, we can use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem says that when we expand $(x-1)^n$, the coefficient of $x^k$ is given by the expression $\\binom{n}{k}(-1)^{n-k}$. \n\nIn this case, $n = 9$ and we are looking for the coefficient of $x^8$. So, we have $k = 8$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:   $\\binom{9}{8}(-1)^{9-8} = \\binom{9}{8} (-1)^1 = 9(-1) = -9$ \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is $-9$.",
