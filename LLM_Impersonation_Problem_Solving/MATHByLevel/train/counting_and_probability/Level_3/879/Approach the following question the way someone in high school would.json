    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. You have $5$ red shirts, $5$ green shirts, $6$ pairs of pants, $8$ green hats and $8$ red hats, all of which are distinct. How many outfits can you make consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat without having the same color of shirts and hats?",
    "solution": "Consider two cases:\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: the person wears a red shirt and a green hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: the person wears a green shirt and a red hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\nSumming up the two cases, we have a total possibility of $240+240 = \\boxed{480}$ outfits.\n\nNotice that we can tackle this without considering cases. The person has $10$ choices for shirts. After a shirt is chosen, the person has $6$ choices for pants, but only $8$ choices of hat, since the hat color cannot match the shirt color, and no matter what shirt color is chosen, there are $8$ hats of the other color to choose from. So, there are $10\\times 6\\times 8 =\\boxed{480}$ outfits.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's consider the number of outfits where the shirt and hat are the same color. There are $5$ red shirts and $8$ red hats, so there are $5 \\times 8 = 40$ outfits with the same color shirt and hat. Similarly, there are $5$ green shirts and $8$ green hats, so there are $5 \\times 8 = 40$ outfits with the same color shirt and hat. \n\nTherefore, the total number of outfits with the same color shirt and hat is $40 + 40 = 80$. \n\nNow, let's consider the number of outfits where the shirt and hat are different colors. There are $5$ red shirts and $8$ green hats, so there are $5 \\times 8 = 40$ outfits where the shirt is red and the hat is green. Similarly, there are $5$ green shirts and $8$ red hats, so there are $5 \\times 8 = 40$ outfits where the shirt is green and the hat is red. \n\nTherefore, the total number of outfits with different color shirt and hat is $40 + 40 = 80$. \n\nTherefore, the total number of outfits you can make consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat without having the same color of shirts and hats is $80 + 80 = \\boxed{160}$.",
