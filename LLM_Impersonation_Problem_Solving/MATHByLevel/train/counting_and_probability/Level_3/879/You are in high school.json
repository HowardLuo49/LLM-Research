How many outfits can you make consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat without having the same color of shirts and hats?",
    "solution": "Consider two cases:\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: the person wears a red shirt and a green hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: the person wears a green shirt and a red hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\nSumming up the two cases, we have a total possibility of $240+240 = \\boxed{480}$ outfits.\n\nNotice that we can tackle this without considering cases. The person has $10$ choices for shirts. After a shirt is chosen, the person has $6$ choices for pants, but only $8$ choices of hat, since the hat color cannot match the shirt color, and no matter what shirt color is chosen, there are $8$ hats of the other color to choose from. So, there are $10\\times 6\\times 8 =\\boxed{480}$ outfits.",
