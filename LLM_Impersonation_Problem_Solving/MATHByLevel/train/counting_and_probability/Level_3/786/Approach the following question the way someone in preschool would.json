    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yay, rolling dice is so much fun! Let's see, we have a 6-sided dice with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on each side. If we roll two dice, we can add up the numbers to find the sum. \n\nSo, if we roll a 1 and a 4, the sum is 1 + 4 = 5 which is not a perfect square. Let's try again!\n\nIf we roll a 2 and a 3, the sum is 2 + 3 = 5 which is also not a perfect square. Let's try one more time!\n\nIf we roll a 2 and a 2, the sum is 2 + 2 = 4 which is a perfect square! Yay!\n\nNow, to find the probability of rolling a perfect square, we need to figure out all the ways we can roll a perfect square. \n\nLet's see, the perfect squares we can roll are 4, which can be made by rolling a 2 and a 2. So, there is only 1 way to roll a perfect square out of all the possible outcomes.\n\nSince there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, the probability of rolling a perfect square is 1/36.\n\nYay, we did it! Rolling dice is so much fun and we can learn about math too. Let's roll again and see what other sums we can get!",
