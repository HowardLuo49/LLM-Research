    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the sum rolled is a perfect square, we must first determine the total number of outcomes possible when rolling two standard 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 faces, so there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we need to identify the pairs of numbers that sum to a perfect square. The perfect squares that can be obtained by summing two numbers on a standard 6-sided die are 4, 9, and 16. \n\nTo achieve a sum of 4, the possible pairs are (1,3) and (3,1).\nTo achieve a sum of 9, the possible pairs are (3,6), (6,3), (4,5), and (5,4).\nTo achieve a sum of 16, the only possible pair is (6,10).\n\nCounting all the outcomes that result in a sum of a perfect square, we have a total of 10 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a sum that is a perfect square is given by:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes\nProbability = 10/36\nProbability = 5/18\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a sum that is a perfect square is 5/18.",
