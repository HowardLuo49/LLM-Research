    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to think about all the possible sums we can get when we roll two dice. The lowest sum we can get is 2 (if we roll two 1s) and the highest sum we can get is 12 (if we roll two 6s).\n\nNext, let's think about the perfect squares. The perfect squares between 2 and 12 are 4 and 9. So, we need to figure out how many ways we can get a sum of 4 or 9 when rolling two dice.\n\nTo get a sum of 4, we can roll a 1 and a 3, or a 3 and a 1. That's 2 ways.\n\nTo get a sum of 9, we can roll a 3 and a 6, a 6 and a 3, a 4 and a 5, or a 5 and a 4. That's 4 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of successful outcomes (rolls that result in a perfect square sum) is 2 + 4 = 6. \n\nNow, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. There are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a perfect square sum is 6/36 = 1/6 or about 16.67%.",
