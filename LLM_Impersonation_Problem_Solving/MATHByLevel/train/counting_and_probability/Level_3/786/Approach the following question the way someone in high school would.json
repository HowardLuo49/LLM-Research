    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of rolling a sum that is a perfect square, we first need to determine the possible outcomes that result in a perfect square. \n\nA perfect square is the product of a whole number multiplied by itself. The perfect squares that can result from rolling two dice are: 4, 9, 16. \n\nTo calculate the total number of outcomes when rolling two dice, we can use the formula 6 x 6 = 36, since each die has 6 sides. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of outcomes that result in a perfect square sum:\n- For a sum of 4, we can roll a 1 and a 3 or a 3 and a 1, which gives us 2 possible outcomes.\n- For a sum of 9, we can roll a 3 and a 6 or a 6 and a 3, which gives us 2 possible outcomes.\n- For a sum of 16, we can only roll double 6s, which gives us 1 possible outcome. \n\nAdding up all the possible outcomes that result in a perfect square sum, we get 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a sum that is a perfect square is 5/36.",
