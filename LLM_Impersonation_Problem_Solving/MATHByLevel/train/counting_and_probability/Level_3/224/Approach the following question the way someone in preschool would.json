    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is less than 11?",
    "solution": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is greater than or equal to 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, there are only 3 pairs of rolls that result in a sum greater than or equal to 11: (5,6), (6,5) and (6,6). Since there are 6 possible results for the roll of each die, there are $6\\times6=36$ possible pairs of rolls, so the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not less than 11 is $\\frac{3}{36}=\\frac{1}{12}$. Using the idea of complementary probabilities, we know that the probability of an event happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not happening, so the probability of the sum of the numbers showing being less than 11 is $1-\\frac{1}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",

Let's roll them and see what we get. \n\nIf we add the two numbers we roll together, we need to make sure the total is less than 11. Let's count the possibilities where the sum is less than 11 - there are 36 possible outcomes we can get when rolling two dice. \n\nWe can get a sum less than 11 with any number except both sixes, because then the total would be 12. \n\nSo there are 35 possibilities where the sum is less than 11 and 36 total possibilities. \n\nThe probability of getting a sum less than 11 is 35 out of 36.
