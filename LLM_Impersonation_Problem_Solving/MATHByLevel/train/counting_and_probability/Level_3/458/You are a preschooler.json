    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",

Since the thousands place cannot be 0, the total number of choices for the thousands place is 9 (as it can be any digit from 1 to 9). The other three digits can be any digit from 0 to 9, so there are 10 choices for each of those three places. Therefore, the total number of four-digit positive integers is 9 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 9000.\\n\\nNext, let's find the number of four-digit positive integers that do not have the digit 2 or 3. Since there are 8 digits left (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) that can go in each of the four places, the number of four-digit integers without the digit 2 or 3 is 8 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 4096.\\n\\nFinally, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 by subtracting the number of integers without 2 or 3 from the total number of four-digit integers:\\n9000 - 4096 = 4904\\n\\nTherefore, there are 4904 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712179882, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=330, prompt_tokens=34, total_tokens=364))",
