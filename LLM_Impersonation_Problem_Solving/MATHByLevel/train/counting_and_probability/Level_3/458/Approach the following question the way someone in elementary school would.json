    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3, we need to think about each place value.\n\nFor the thousands place, we have 9 choices (1-9) because we can't have a number that starts with 0.\n\nFor the hundreds, tens, and ones places, we have 2 choices for each digit: either a 2 or a 3.\n\nSo the total number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 is 9 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 72.\n\nTherefore, there are 72 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
