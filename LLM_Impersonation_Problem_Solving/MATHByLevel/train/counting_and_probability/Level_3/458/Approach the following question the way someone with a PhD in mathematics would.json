    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total number of four-digit positive integers, and then subtract the number of four-digit positive integers that do not contain the digits 2 or 3.\n\nThere are 9000 four-digit positive integers in total, ranging from 1000 to 9999.\n\nTo calculate the number of four-digit positive integers that do not contain the digits 2 or 3, we can consider the number of choices for each digit:\n\n- For the first digit, we have 7 choices (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n- For the remaining three digits, we have 8 choices each (0-9 excluding 2 and 3)\n\nTherefore, the total number of four-digit positive integers that do not contain the digits 2 or 3 is 7 * 8^3 = 3584.\n\nNow, we can find the number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 by subtracting the number of integers that do not contain 2 or 3 from the total number of four-digit positive integers:\n\n9000 - 3584 = 5416.\n\nTherefore, there are 5416 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
