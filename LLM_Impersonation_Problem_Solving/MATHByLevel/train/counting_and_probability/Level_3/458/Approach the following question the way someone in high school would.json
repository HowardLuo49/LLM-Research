    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, let's find the total number of four-digit positive integers. Since a four-digit integer ranges from 1000 to 9999, there are 9000 four-digit positive integers in total.\n\nNext, let's find the number of four-digit positive integers that do not have a 2 or a 3. To do this, we need to find how many choices we have for each digit in the integer. For the first digit (thousands place), we have 8 choices (1,4,5,6,7,8,9). For the remaining three digits (hundreds, tens, and ones places), we have 7 choices for each digit (0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9). Therefore, the total number of four-digit positive integers without a 2 or a 3 is 8*7*7*7 = 2744.\n\nFinally, to find the number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3, we subtract the number of integers without a 2 or a 3 from the total number of four-digit positive integers. Therefore, the number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 is 9000 - 2744 = 6256.\n\nTherefore, there are 6256 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
