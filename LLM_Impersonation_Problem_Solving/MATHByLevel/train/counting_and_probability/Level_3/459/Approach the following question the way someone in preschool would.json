    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Suppose I have a bag with 12 slips of paper in it.  Some of the slips have a 2 on them, and the rest have a 7 on them.  If the expected value of the number shown on a slip randomly drawn from the bag is $3.25$, then how many slips have a 2?",
    "solution": "We let $x$ denote the number of slips with a 2 written on them.  (This is the usual tactic of letting a variable denote what we're trying to solve for in the problem.)  Then there are $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them. The probability of drawing a 2 is $\\frac{x}{12}$ and the probability of drawing a 7 is $\\frac{12-x}{12}$, so the expected value of the number drawn is $$ E = \\frac{x}{12}(2) + \\frac{12-x}{12}(7) = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$But we are given that $E=3.25$, so we have the equation $$ 3.25 = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$This simplifies to $39 = 84 - 5x$, which means that $x = 9$. Thus $\\boxed{9}$ of the 12 slips have a 2 written on them.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have a bag with paper inside. Some have a 2, and some have a 7. If we pick one randomly, the number is $3.25$. Let's count how many 2's we have to find the answer. Let's count together: 1, 2, 3, 4. So, we have 4 slips with a 2 on them! Yay!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 9?: Okay, so we have a bag with paper inside. Some have a 2, and some have a 7.

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. The final solution is not 9, as the question asked for how many slips have a 2, not the sum of all numbers.",
