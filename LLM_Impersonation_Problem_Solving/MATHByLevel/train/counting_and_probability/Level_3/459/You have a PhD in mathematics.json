    "solution": "We let $x$ denote the number of slips with a 2 written on them.  (This is the usual tactic of letting a variable denote what we're trying to solve for in the problem.)  Then there are $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them. The probability of drawing a 2 is $\\frac{x}{12}$ and the probability of drawing a 7 is $\\frac{12-x}{12}$, so the expected value of the number drawn is $$ E = \\frac{x}{12}(2) + \\frac{12-x}{12}(7) = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$But we are given that $E=3.25$, so we have the equation $$ 3.25 = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$This simplifies to $39 = 84 - 5x$, which means that $x = 9$. Thus $\\boxed{9}$ of the 12 slips have a 2 written on them.",
