Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many ways the Democrats and Republicans can sit around the table! We have 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans, so we need to arrange them around the circle table.\n\nFirst, let's pick where to put the Democrats. Since the table is circular, we can fix one Democrat in a spot. Then we have 4 Democrats left to arrange around the table, so there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the Democrats.\n\nAfter placing the Democrats, there are 5 spots left for the Republicans. Since the Republicans are distinguishable, there are 5! = 120 ways to arrange the Republicans.\n\nSo, to find the total number of ways for everyone to sit around the circular table, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the Democrats by the number of ways to arrange the Republicans. That's 24 x 120 = 2880 ways for everyone to sit around the table!\n\nYay! We counted all the ways they can sit around the circular table!",
