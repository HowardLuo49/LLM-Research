The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's first figure out the pattern in the sum of the interior numbers. In the third row, there are no interior numbers, so the sum is 0. In the fourth row, the interior numbers are 1+1+1+1 = 4, and in the fifth row, the interior numbers are 1+2+2+1 = 6. \n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that the sum of the interior numbers in each row is 2 less than the row number. So, for the seventh row, the sum of the interior numbers would be 7-2 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row of Pascal's Triangle is 5.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 62?: Okay, so let's first figure out the pattern in the sum of the interior numbers.
