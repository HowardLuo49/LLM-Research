The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to figure out how to find the sum of the interior numbers in each row of Pascal's Triangle. In the fourth row, we have 1 interior number, which is 6. In the fifth row, we have 2 interior numbers, which add up to 14.\n\nNow, let's try to find a pattern. Each row of Pascal's Triangle has one more interior number than the row above it. So, in the sixth row, there should be 3 interior numbers. We can calculate their sum by finding the average of 14 (the sum of the interior numbers in the fifth row) and 6 (the sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row):\n\n(14 + 6) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10\n\nSo, the sum of the interior numbers in the sixth row is 10.\n\nNow, in the seventh row, there should be 4 interior numbers. We can find their sum in the same way:\n\n(10 + 6) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row of Pascal's Triangle is 8.",
