The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to understand the pattern in Pascal's Triangle. The interior numbers of each row are obtained by adding the two numbers directly above them in the previous row. \n\nFor example, in the fourth row, the interior numbers are obtained by adding 1 + 3 + 1, which equals 5. If we add the additional interior number at the beginning and end of the row, we get a sum of 6.\n\nIn the fifth row, the interior numbers are obtained by adding 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1, which equals 16. Subtracting the additional interior numbers at the beginning and end of the row, we get a sum of 14.\n\nTherefore, we can determine that the sum of the interior numbers of the sixth row is 28 (1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1). \n\nContinuing this pattern, the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row can be calculated as 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1, which equals 64. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row of Pascal's Triangle is 64.",
