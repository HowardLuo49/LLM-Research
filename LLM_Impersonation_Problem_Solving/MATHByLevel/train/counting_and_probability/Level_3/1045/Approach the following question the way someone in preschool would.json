    "solution": "Since for all $n \\ge 10$, $n!$ has (at least) two factors of 5, we know that $n!$ will end in two zeros.  Therefore, if $n\\ge 10$, then $n!$ contributes nothing to the last two digits of the sum. So we need only compute $5! = 120$, and hence our answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, that looks like a lot of numbers! Let's try to make it simpler. Let's look at just the last two digits of each number and add them up to find the last two digits of the sum. Let's start with $5!$. The last two digits of $5!$ are $20$, so we can write $5! \\equiv 20 \\pmod{100}$. \n\nNow let's move on to $10!$. The last two digits of $10!$ are $00$, so we can write $10! \\equiv 00 \\pmod{100}$. \n\nWe can see a pattern here - the last two digits of any factorial greater than $5$ will always end in $00$. So, when we add up all the factorials from $5!$ to $100!$, the last two digits will always be $20$.\n\nTherefore, the last two digits of the sum are $20$. Yay, we did it!",
