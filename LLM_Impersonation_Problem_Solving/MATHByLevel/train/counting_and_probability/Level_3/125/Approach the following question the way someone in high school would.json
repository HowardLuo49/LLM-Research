    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A library has six identical copies of a certain book. At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we have 6 identical books in the library and we need to figure out how many different ways they can be either in the library or checked out. \n\nFirst, let's think about the possibilities:\n- All 6 books are in the library\n- 5 books are in the library and 1 is checked out\n- 4 books are in the library and 2 are checked out\n- 3 books are in the library and 3 are checked out\n- 2 books are in the library and 4 are checked out\n- 1 book is in the library and 5 are checked out\n\nSo, there are 6 different ways the books can be either in the library or checked out.",
