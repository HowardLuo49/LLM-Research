At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities.",

Since they are all the same, we can't tell them apart. \n\nNow, we need to make sure at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out. \n\nLet's start by putting 1 book in the library. That means the remaining 5 books will be checked out. So, there is 1 way for this to happen. \n\nNext, we can put 2 books in the library. That means the remaining 4 books will be checked out. So, there is 1 way for this to happen as well. \n\nWe can keep going like this until we find all the ways. \n\nSo, in total, there are 6 ways for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out. \n\nGood job!
