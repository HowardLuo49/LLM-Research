Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{first two cards are red}) &= \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh! I love playing with cards! There are 52 cards in the deck, and 26 of them are red. We want to find the probability of drawing two red cards. First, we need to know how many ways we can pick 2 cards from a deck of 52. To do this, we use a formula we learned in school called combinations. It goes like this: \n$$\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 cards from 52} = {52\\choose 2}$$\nThis means we have 1326 ways to choose 2 cards from the deck.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many ways we can pick 2 red cards from the 26 red cards. So, we use combinations again:\n$$\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 red cards from 26} = {26\\choose 2}$$\nThis means we have 325 ways to pick 2 red cards from the deck.\n\nFinally, to find the probability of drawing 2 red cards, we divide the number of successful outcomes (getting 2 red cards) by the total number of outcomes (choosing any 2 cards from the deck). So, the probability is:\n$$\\text{Probability of drawing 2 red cards} = \\dfrac{{26\\choose 2}}{{52\\choose 2}} = \\dfrac{325}{1326} \\approx 0.245$$\nYay! So, the probability of drawing two red cards from the deck is about 0.245, which is super cool!",
