Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{first two cards are red}) &= \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the first two cards drawn are both red, we first need to figure out how many total ways we can choose 2 cards from the deck. \n\nThere are 52 cards in the deck, so the total number of ways to choose 2 cards is 52 choose 2, which is $\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2 \\times 1} = 1326$. \n\nNow, we need to figure out how many ways we can choose 2 red cards. There are 26 red cards in the deck (13 hearts and 13 diamonds), so the number of ways to choose 2 red cards is 26 choose 2, which is $\\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2 \\times 1} = 325$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the first two cards drawn are both red is $\\frac{325}{1326} = \\frac{25}{102} \\approx 0.245$. \n\nSo, the chance of drawing two red cards first is about 24.5%.",
