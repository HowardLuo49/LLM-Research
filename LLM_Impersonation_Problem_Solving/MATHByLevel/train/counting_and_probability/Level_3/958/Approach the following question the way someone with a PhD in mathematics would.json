Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{first two cards are red}) &= \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from a deck of 52 cards, which can be done using the combination formula:\n\n$$\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52!}{2!(52-2)!} = \\frac{52 \\cdot 51}{2 \\cdot 1} = 1326.$$\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 red cards from the 26 red cards in the deck. This can be done using the combination formula as well:\n\n$$\\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26!}{2!(26-2)!} = \\frac{26 \\cdot 25}{2 \\cdot 1}= 325.$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red can be calculated as:\n\n$$P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{\\text{number of ways to choose 2 red cards}}{\\text{total number of ways to choose 2 cards}} = \\frac{325}{1326} \\approx 0.245.$$\n\nThus, the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red is approximately 0.245 or 24.5%.",
