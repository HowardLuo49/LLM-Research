Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
