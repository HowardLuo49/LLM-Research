    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A standard deck of cards has 52 cards divided into 4 suits, each of which has 13 cards.  Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{first two cards are red}) &= \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red, we need to first determine the total number of ways two cards can be drawn from a deck of 52 cards. \n\nThe total number of ways to choose the first card is 52 (since there are 52 cards in the deck). Once the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck, so there are 51 ways to choose the second card. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw two cards is $52 \\times 51$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to draw two red cards. There are 26 red cards in the deck (13 hearts and 13 diamonds). So, the number of ways to draw two red cards is $26 \\times 25$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing two red cards is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}$. We can simplify this fraction to get the final answer.",
