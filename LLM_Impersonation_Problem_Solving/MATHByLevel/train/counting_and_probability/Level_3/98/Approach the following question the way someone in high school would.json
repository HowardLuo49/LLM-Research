    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we need only count the number of balls in the distinguishable boxes.  We can put 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 balls in Box 1 (and the rest go in Box 2).  So there are $\\boxed{6}$ different arrangements.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. Since the balls are not distinguishable, we don't need to worry about the order in which they are placed in the boxes. \n\nTo find the number of ways to distribute the balls into the two boxes, we can use the formula for combinations, which is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!).\n\nIn this case, we have 5 balls and 2 boxes. So, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 boxes out of 2 to place the balls in. This can be represented as 2C2.\n\nUsing the formula, we have:\n2C2 = 2! / (2!(2-2)!) = 2! / (2!*0!) = 2 / (2*1) = 1\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 way to distribute the 5 balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
