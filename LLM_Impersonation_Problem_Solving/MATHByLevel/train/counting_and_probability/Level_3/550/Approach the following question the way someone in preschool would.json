    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. John has five children.  What is the probability that at least half of them are girls? (We can assume a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, and vice-versa.)",
    "solution": "In all cases, at least half of John's kids will be boys or at least half will be girls.  Furthermore, since John has an odd number of children, these conditions are mutually exclusive--that is, they are never true at the same time.  Since a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, our answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's see! To find the probability, we need to think about all the different combinations of boys and girls that John could have. There are a total of 32 different combinations of boys and girls if John has exactly five children: BBBBG, BBBGB, BBGBB, BGBBB, GBBBB, BBBGG, BBGBG, BBGGB, BGBBG, BGGBB, GBGBB, GGBBB, BBGGG, BGBGG, BGGBG, GBBGG, GBGBG, GGBBG, GGBGB, GGBGB, GGGGB, BGGGG, GBGGG, GGBGG, GGGBG, GGGGB, GGGGG. \n\nNow, let's count how many of these combinations have at least three girls. That would be: BBBBG, BBBGB, BBGBB, BGBBB, GBBBB, BBBGG, BBGBG, BBGGB, BGBBG, BGGBB, GBGBB, GGBBB, BBGGG, BGBGG, BGGBG, GBBGG, GBGBG, GGBBG, GGBGB, GGBGB, GGGGB, BGGGG, GBGGG, GGBGG, GGGBG, GGGGB, GGGGG. There are 26 combinations with at least three girls. \n\nSo, out of the 32 total combinations, 26 of them have at least three girls. That means the probability that at least half of John's children are girls is 26/32, which simplifies to 13/16. So, the probability is 13/16 or about 81.25 percent! Yay! Go girls! Woohoo!",
