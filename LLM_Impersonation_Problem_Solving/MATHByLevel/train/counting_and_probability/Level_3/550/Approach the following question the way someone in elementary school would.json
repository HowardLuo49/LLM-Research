    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. John has five children.  What is the probability that at least half of them are girls? (We can assume a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, and vice-versa.)",
    "solution": "In all cases, at least half of John's kids will be boys or at least half will be girls.  Furthermore, since John has an odd number of children, these conditions are mutually exclusive--that is, they are never true at the same time.  Since a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, our answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's see. If John has five children, that means he could have 0 girls, 1 girl, 2 girls, 3 girls, 4 girls, or 5 girls. Half of five would be 2.5, but we can't have half a child, so we need to round up to 3 girls to be at least half. \n\nSo, for John to have at least half of his children be girls, he could have 3 girls or 4 girls or all 5 girls. That's 3 possibilities out of all the possibilities (0 girls, 1 girl, 2 girls, 3 girls, 4 girls, or 5 girls). \n\nSo, the probability that at least half of John's children are girls is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1 out of 2, or 0.5. So, the probability is 0.5, or 50%.",
