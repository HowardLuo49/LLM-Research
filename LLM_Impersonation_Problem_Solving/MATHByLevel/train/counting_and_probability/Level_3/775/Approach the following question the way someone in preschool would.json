What is the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$. The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$. Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's talk about coin flipping! So when we flip a coin, it can land on heads or tails. If we flip it 3 times, there are different ways it can land.\n\nWhen we flip it 3 times, the probability of it landing on heads exactly 2 times is 3/8. That means out of all the possible outcomes, 3 out of 8 times the coin will land on heads exactly 2 times.\n\nAnd the probability of it landing on heads all 3 times is 1/8. That means out of all the possible outcomes, 1 out of 8 times the coin will land on heads all 3 times.\n\nSo the positive difference between the two probabilities is 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4. Yay for math!",
