What is the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$. The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$. Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of a fair coin landing heads up, we need to remember that there are two possible outcomes - heads or tails. \n\nWhen flipping a fair coin, the probability of it landing heads up is 1/2. \n\nTo find the probability of landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips, we can use the combination formula. The formula is (n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of flips and k is the number of times we want heads to come up. \n\nSo, for 3 flips with exactly 2 heads, we get (3 choose 2) = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3. This means there are 3 ways for the coin to land heads up exactly twice in 3 flips. \n\nThe probability of landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is 3*(1/2)^2*(1/2) = 3/8.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips. This is just (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nThe positive difference between the two probabilities is 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4. \n\nSo, the positive difference between the probability of landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is 1/4.",
