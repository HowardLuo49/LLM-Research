What is the probability that the four dots will be collinear? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nsize(59);\nfor(int i = 0; i<4; ++i)\nfor(int j = 0; j<4; ++j)\ndot((i,j),linewidth(7));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "If all four of the dots are collinear, it is obvious that it must either be a horizontal line of dots, a vertical line of dots, or a diagonal line of dots. And inspection tells us that there are $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ such collinear sets of 4. And in total, there are ${16 \\choose 4} = \\frac{16\\cdot 15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 = 1820$. So, the probability is $\\frac{10}{1820} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{182}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the four points are collinear, we need to first determine the total number of ways we can choose 4 dots out of 16. This can be calculated using the combination formula, $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of dots and $r$ is the number of dots to be chosen.\n\nIn this case, $\\binom{16}{4} = \\frac{16!}{4!(16-4)!} = \\frac{16!}{4!12!} = \\frac{16\\times 15\\times 14\\times 13}{4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 1} = 1820$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways we can choose 4 collinear points. There are 6 possible directions of collinear points in the array: horizontal, vertical, and two diagonals in both directions. In each direction, there are 4 ways to choose 4 points if the collinear line contains the point chosen first.\n\nTherefore, there are $6\\times 4 = 24$ ways to choose 4 collinear points.\n\nFinally, the probability that the 4 points will be collinear is $\\frac{\\text{number of ways to choose 4 collinear points}}{\\text{total number of ways to choose 4 points}} = \\frac{24}{1820} = \\frac{6}{455}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the four dots randomly chosen from the array of 16 dots will be collinear is $\\frac{6}{455}$.",
