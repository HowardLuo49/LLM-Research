    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

There are two cases to consider:\\n\\nCase 1: Both numbers are even.\\nThere is only one even prime number, which is 2. So, we need to choose 2 and another even prime number, which can only be 2 as well. There is only 1 way to do this.\\n\\nCase 2: One number is even and the other is odd.\\nThere are 3 even prime numbers (2, 7, and 17) and 4 odd prime numbers (3, 5, 11, and 13), so there are 3*4 = 12 ways to choose one even and one odd prime number. However, we have to divide by 2 to avoid counting the same pair twice (e.g., 2 and 3 is the same as 3 and 2). So, there are 12/2 = 6 ways in this case.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select two distinct prime numbers whose sum is even is 1 (from Case 1) + 6 (from Case 2) = 7.\\n\\nSo, the probability that their sum is an even number is 7/21 = 1/3.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that the sum is an even number is 1/3.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180569, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=346, prompt_tokens=49, total_tokens=395))",
