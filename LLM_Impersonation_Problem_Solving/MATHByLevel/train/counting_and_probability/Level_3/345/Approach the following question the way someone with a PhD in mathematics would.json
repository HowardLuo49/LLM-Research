    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the first seven prime numbers. They are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nThere are a total of 7 prime numbers, so the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from the first seven prime numbers is given by the binomial coefficient C(7,2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = 21.\n\nNow we need to find the number of ways the sum of the two selected numbers is even. For the sum of two numbers to be even, either both numbers must be even or both numbers must be odd.\n\nThere are 4 even prime numbers (2, 5, 11, and 17) and 3 odd prime numbers (3, 7, and 13). So there are C(4,2) + C(3,2) = 6 + 3 = 9 ways to choose 2 even numbers or 2 odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the two selected numbers is even is 9/21 = 3/7.\n\nSo, the probability that their sum is an even number is 3/7.",
