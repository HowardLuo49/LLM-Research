    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "There are 7 prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nTo find the total number of possible pairs, we will use the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) where n is the total number of items (7 prime numbers) and r is the number of items to choose (2 distinct numbers).\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7-2)!)\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!)\nC(7, 2) = 7 * 6 / 2\nC(7, 2) = 21\n\nNow, let's find the number of pairs whose sum is an even number. \n\nAn even number can be obtained by adding two even numbers (like 2 and 2) or two odd numbers (like 3 and 5). \n\nThe possible even numbers we can choose are 2, 2, and 7.
