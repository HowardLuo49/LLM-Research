If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",

Since there are $7$ days in a week and Cory eats $1$ piece of fruit each day, we need to find the number of ways he can arrange the $7$ pieces of fruit. \n\nCory has $7$ pieces of fruit in total. Since the fruit within each category is indistinguishable, we can think of the problem as arranging the letters in the word \"AAAOOBB.\" Since there are $7$ letters in total, the number of ways we can arrange them is $7!$. \n\nSo, Cory can eat his fruit in $7! = 5040$ different orders.",
