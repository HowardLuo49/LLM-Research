If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways that Cory can eat his fruit, we first need to calculate the total number of ways in which the $7$ pieces of fruit can be arranged. Since the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, we can think of the problem as arranging the $7$ distinct slots where the fruit can be placed. \n\nThe total number of ways to arrange $7$ distinct objects is $7! = 5040$. \n\nWithin these $5040$ arrangements, we need to account for the fact that the $3$ apples are indistinguishable, the $2$ oranges are indistinguishable, and the $2$ bananas are indistinguishable. So, for each arrangement, there are $3! \\times 2! \\times 2! = 12$ ways to arrange the fruits themselves.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible orders in which Cory can eat his fruit is $\\frac{5040}{12} = 420$. So, there are $420$ possible orders in which Cory can eat his fruit over the course of a week.",
