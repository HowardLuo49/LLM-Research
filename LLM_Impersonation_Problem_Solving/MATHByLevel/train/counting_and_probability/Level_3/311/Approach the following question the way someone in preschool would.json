If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",

Since the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, we can think of this as a permutations problem. We have $7$ total pieces of fruit and we want to eat them one at a time for $7$ days. \n\nSo, the number of ways Cory can eat the fruit is $7!$ (7 factorial).\n\nLet's count them out loud now - $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 \\times 7 =$ [count together with the group]\n\nSo, Cory can eat his fruit in $5040$ different orders!
