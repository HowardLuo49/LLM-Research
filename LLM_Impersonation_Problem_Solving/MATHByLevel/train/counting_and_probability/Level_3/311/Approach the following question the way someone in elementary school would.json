If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we can use a little bit of math. Since Cory eats one piece of fruit per day for a week, that means he'll be eating a total of $7$ pieces of fruit. \n\nSince the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, we can just think about the total number of pieces of fruit eaten, which is $3+2+2=7.$ In math, this is called the \"multichoose\" function, which calculates the number of ways to choose k indistinguishable items from n distinguishable items. \n\nSo the number of ways Cory can eat his fruit is $\\binom{7+3-1}{3}=\\binom{9}{3}=\\boxed{84}.$\n\nSo, Cory can eat his fruit in $84$ different ways.
