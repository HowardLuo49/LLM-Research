    "solution": "We find the point which is equidistant from 0 and 4. Clearly, this occurs at 2. So, for all $x > 2$, $x$ is closer to 4 than 0. So, the probability is equal to the length of this region $\\frac{5-2}{5} = \\boxed{.6}$.",

If it's between 1 and 3, it's closer to 4. If it's between 3 and 4, it's closer to 4. And if it's between 4 and 5, it's closer to 4.\n\nSo there are 3 parts where the point is closer to 4 (1-3, 3-4, and 4-5), and 2 parts where it's closer to 0 (0-1 and 1-3). That means the probability is 3 out of 5, which can be expressed as 0.6 to the nearest tenth.",
