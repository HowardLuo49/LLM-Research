    "solution": "Each number from 1 to 6 has probability $\\dfrac16$ of being rolled, so the expected value is \\begin{align*}\nE &= \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times \\$1^2\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times \\$2^2\\right) + \\cdots + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6} \\times \\$6^2\\right) \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{6}(\\$1 + \\$4 + \\$9 + \\$16 + \\$25 + \\$36) \\\\\n&= \\$\\dfrac{91}{6} \\\\\n& \\approx \\boxed{\\$15.17}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's roll the dice and see what happens! If we roll a 1, we would win 1 dollar. If we roll a 2, we would win 4 dollars. If we roll a 3, we would win 9 dollars. If we roll a 4, we would win 16 dollars. If we roll a 5, we would win 25 dollars. And if we roll a 6, we would win 36 dollars. \n\nTo find the expected value, we add up all the possible winnings and divide by the number of outcomes. So, 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 = 91. Then, we divide 91 by 6 because there are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair 6-sided die. 91 \u00f7 6 = 15.16666667. \n\nSince we want our answer in dollars and cents, we round it to the nearest cent. So, the expected value of our win is $15.17! Wow, that's a lot of money! Let's roll the dice and see if we can win big!",
