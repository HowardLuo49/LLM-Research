Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup?",
    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways in which we can choose 6 starters for the volleyball team such that all three triplets are included in the starting lineup, we must first consider the number of ways in which we can select the remaining 3 starter positions from the remaining 11 players.\n\nSince the triplets Alicia, Amanda, and Anna must be included in the starting lineup, we are left with 11 players (excluding the triplets) from which we need to select 3 starters. This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula:\n\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11-3)!) = 165\n\nTherefore, there are 165 ways to choose the remaining 3 starters from the 11 non-triplet players. Once the remaining 3 starters have been chosen, the triplets Alicia, Amanda, and Anna will automatically fill the other 3 starting positions.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 165 ways in which we can choose 6 starters for the volleyball team such that all three triplets are included in the starting lineup.",
