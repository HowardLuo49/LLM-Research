    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, that's a big number! Let's count together! We already know that the triplets have to be in the starting lineup, so that's 3 of the 6 spots taken. Now we just need to choose the other 3 players from the remaining 11. Let's count them together! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11! That's 11 different players to choose from for the last 3 spots. So, the total number of ways we can choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup is 11 ways. Yay, we did it!",
