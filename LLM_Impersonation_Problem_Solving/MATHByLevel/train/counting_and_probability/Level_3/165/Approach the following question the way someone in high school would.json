    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways we can choose 6 starters with all three triplets in the lineup, we first need to consider that the triplets must be in the starting lineup. \n\nSince Alicia, Amanda, and Anna are triplets, they must all be in the starting lineup together. This means we are left with 11 players to choose from to fill the remaining 3 spots in the lineup.\n\nTo choose the remaining 3 starters from the 11 players left, we can use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / k!(n-k)!, where n is the total number of players left to choose from, and k is the number of players we want to choose.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways we can choose 3 starters from the remaining 11 players is C(11, 3) = 11! / 3!(11-3)! = 165 ways.\n\nSo, there are 165 ways to choose 3 additional starters from the 11 remaining players, along with the triplets Alicia, Amanda, and Anna, to make a total of 6 starters.",
