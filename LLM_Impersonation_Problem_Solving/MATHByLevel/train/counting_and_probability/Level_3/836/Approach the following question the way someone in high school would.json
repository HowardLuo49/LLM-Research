    "solution": "There are $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes.  The only way that they can roll an odd product is if both their rolls are odd.  Since 3 of the 6 faces on each die are odd, this can occur in $3 \\times 3 = 9$ ways.  So a even product can occur in $36-9= 27$ ways, and the probability is thus $\\dfrac{27}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac34}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of the numbers they roll is even, we need to consider the possible outcomes. \n\nThe product of two numbers is even if at least one of the numbers is even. \n\nOn a fair six-sided die, there are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) and three odd numbers (1, 3, 5).\n\nTo find the probability that the product is even, we can calculate the probability that at least one of the numbers is even and subtract the probability that both numbers are odd.\n\nThe probability that at least one number is even is: \nP(even number) = P(Geoff rolls even) + P(Trevor rolls even) - P(both roll even) \nP(even number) = 3/6 + 3/6 - 1/6 \nP(even number) = 5/6 \n\nThe probability that both numbers are odd is: \nP(odd number) = P(Geoff rolls odd) * P(Trevor rolls odd) \nP(odd number) = 3/6 * 3/6 \nP(odd number) = 9/36 \nP(odd number) = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the numbers rolled is even is: \nP(product is even) = P(even number) - P(odd number) \nP(product is even) = 5/6 - 1/4 \nP(product is even) = 10/12 - 3/12 \nP(product is even) = 7/12 \n\nSo, the probability that the product of the numbers Geoff and Trevor roll is even is 7/12.",
