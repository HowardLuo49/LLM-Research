    "solution": "There are $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes.  The only way that they can roll an odd product is if both their rolls are odd.  Since 3 of the 6 faces on each die are odd, this can occur in $3 \\times 3 = 9$ ways.  So a even product can occur in $36-9= 27$ ways, and the probability is thus $\\dfrac{27}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac34}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the product of the numbers rolled by Geoff and Trevor is even, we need to consider the possible outcomes for the roll of a fair six-sided die.\n\nThere are a total of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice (each die having 6 possible results). These outcomes are equally likely.\n\nFor the product of the two numbers to be even, at least one of the numbers rolled must be even. Since half of the numbers on the die are even (2, 4, 6), the probability of rolling an even number on a single die is 1/2.\n\nThe probability that both Geoff and Trevor roll an even number is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. This corresponds to the 2 possible outcomes where both numbers are even (2*2=4).\n\nTo calculate the probability that the product of the numbers rolled is even, we also need to consider the case where one of the numbers rolled is even and the other is odd. In this case, the product will be even. The probability of rolling an even and an odd number is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. This corresponds to the 6 possible outcomes where one number is even and the other is odd (2*1, 2*3, 2*5, 4*1, 4*3, 4*5).\n\nTherefore, the total probability that the product of the numbers rolled is even is 1/4 (both numbers even) + 1/4 (one even, one odd) = 1/2.",
