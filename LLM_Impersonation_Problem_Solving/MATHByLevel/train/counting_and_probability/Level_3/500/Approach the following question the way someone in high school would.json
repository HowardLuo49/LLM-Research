    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "There are 3 options (boxes) for each of the 4 balls, so the number of ways is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of combinations. Since the balls and boxes are distinguishable, we can treat this problem as arranging 4 distinct balls into 3 distinct boxes.\n\nTo calculate the number of ways, we can use the formula for distributing objects into boxes with repetition allowed, which is (n + r - 1) choose (r - 1), where n is the number of objects and r is the number of boxes. In this case, n = 4 (balls) and r = 3 (boxes).\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n(4 + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1) = 6 choose 2 = 15 ways\n\nTherefore, there are 15 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.",
