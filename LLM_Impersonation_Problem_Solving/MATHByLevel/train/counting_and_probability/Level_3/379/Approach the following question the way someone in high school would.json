    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant using the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$, I will first calculate the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed using these letters.\n\nSince we can repeat letters and any word is valid, there are 5 choices for each of the 4 positions in the word. Therefore, the total number of 4-letter words is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$.\n\nNow, I will find the number of 4-letter words that do not contain any consonants. Since all the consonants are $B$, $C$, and $D$, the only vowel is $A$. Therefore, the number of 4-letter words without consonants is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nTo find the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant, I will subtract the number of words without consonants from the total number of words. Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625 - 1 = 624$.",
