    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see how many 4-letter words we can make with the letters A, B, C, D, and E. \n\nFirst, let's count the total number of possible 4-letter words we can make using any combination of these letters. Since we have 5 choices for each letter (A, B, C, D, or E), we have a total of $5^4 = 625$ possible 4-letter words.\n\nNow, let's find the number of 4-letter words that contain only vowels (A or E). We have 2 choices for each letter (A or E), so there are $2^4 = 16$ 4-letter words that can be made with only vowels.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4-letter words that have at least one consonant is $625 - 16 = 609$. \n\nSo, there are 609 4-letter words that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E, with at least one consonant.",
