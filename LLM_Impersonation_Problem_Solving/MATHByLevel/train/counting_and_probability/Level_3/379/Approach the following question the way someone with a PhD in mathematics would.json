    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first count the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$, which is $5^4 = 625$. This includes words with all vowels.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of 4-letter words that include only the vowel $A$, which is $1^4 = 1$. Similarly, the number of words with only the vowel $E$ is $1^4 = 1$. Therefore, the total number of words with only vowels is $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nSubtracting the total number of words with only vowels from the total number of words gives us the number of words with at least one consonant. So, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625 - 2 = 623$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 609?: To solve this problem, we first count the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$, which is $5^4 = 625$.
