    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see! We have the letters A, B, C, D, and E. Let's try to put them together to make a 4-letter word with at least one consonant.\n\nOne way we can do this is by picking a consonant for our first letter. We have three consonants to choose from: B, C, and D. Then we can pick any letter for the second, third, and fourth letters. So, for each consonant we choose for the first letter, we have 5 choices for the second letter, 5 choices for the third letter, and 5 choices for the fourth letter.\n\nTo find out the total number of words we can make, we can add up the number of words we can make starting with B, with C, and with D.\n\nStarting with B: $1$ (for the first letter) $\\times 5$ (for the second letter) $\\times 5$ (for the third letter) $\\times 5$ (for the fourth letter) = $125$ words\nStarting with C: $1$ (for the first letter) $\\times 5$ (for the second letter) $\\times 5$ (for the third letter) $\\times 5$ (for the fourth letter) = $125$ words\nStarting with D: $1$ (for the first letter) $\\times 5$ (for the second letter) $\\times 5$ (for the third letter) $\\times 5$ (for the fourth letter) = $125$ words\n\nSo, we can make $125 + 125 + 125 = 375$ 4-letter words with at least one consonant using the letters A, B, C, D, and E.
