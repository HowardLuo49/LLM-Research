    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Tyler has entered a buffet line in which he chooses one kind of meat, two different vegetables and one dessert.  If the order of food items is not important, how many different meals might he choose?\n\n$\\bullet$  Meat: beef, chicken, pork\n\n$\\bullet$  Vegetables: baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes\n\n$\\bullet$  Dessert: brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream",
    "solution": "There are $3$ choices for the meat and $4$ for dessert.\n\nThere are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose $2$ of the $4$ vegetables, since we don't care about the order in which the vegetables are chosen.\n\nThe answer therefore is $3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6=\\boxed{72}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of different meals Tyler can choose in the buffet line, we can use the fundamental principle of counting. \n\nFirst, we determine the number of choices Tyler has for each category of food:\n- 3 choices for meat (beef, chicken, pork)\n- 4 choices for vegetables (baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes)\n- 4 choices for dessert (brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream)\n\nSince the order of food items is not important, we use the multiplication principle to combine the choices for each category. Therefore, the total number of different meals Tyler can choose is:\n\n3 (meat choices) * 4 (vegetable choices) * 4 (dessert choices) = 48 different meals. \n\nTherefore, Tyler can choose from 48 different meals in the buffet line.",
