    "solution": "There are 2 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in two different locations.  So the answer is $2^5 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can think of it as a combinatorial problem. We have 5 balls to distribute into 2 boxes, which can be thought of as a stars and bars problem.\n\nIf we imagine the balls as stars and the boxes as bars separating them, we have 4 spaces between the bars where we can place the stars (balls). Using the stars and bars formula, the number of ways to distribute 5 balls into 2 boxes is given by:\n\nC(5+2-1, 2-1) = C(6, 1) = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
