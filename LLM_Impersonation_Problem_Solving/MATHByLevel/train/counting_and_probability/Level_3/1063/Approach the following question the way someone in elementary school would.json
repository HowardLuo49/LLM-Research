    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many different sequences we can make, we need to break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Since each sequence must begin with L and end with Q, we can write out the sequences as _ _ _ _. The first and last letters are already decided.\n\nStep 2: We need to fill in the two middle slots with the remaining letters E, U, A, and S. Since no letter can appear more than once in a sequence, we need to choose a different letter for each slot.\n\nStep 3: For the first middle slot, we have 4 choices (E, U, A, or S). After choosing one letter, there are 3 letters left for the second middle slot.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the number of choices for each slot together: 4 choices for the first middle slot and 3 choices for the second middle slot equals 4 x 3 = 12.\n\nSo, there are 12 distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once.",
