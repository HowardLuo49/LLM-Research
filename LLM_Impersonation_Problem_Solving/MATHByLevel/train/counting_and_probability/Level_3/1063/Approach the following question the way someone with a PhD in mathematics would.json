    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will use permutations to determine the number of distinct sequences that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nWe are given that each sequence must begin with L and end with Q. Therefore, the two positions for L and Q are fixed and we only need to consider the arrangement of the remaining three letters (E, U, A, S).\n\nThere are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining three letters without any restrictions. However, since no letter can appear in a sequence more than once, we must consider the restrictions imposed by repeating letters.\n\nThere are 2 ways to choose a letter to be placed in the second position (after L) and 1 way to place the last remaining letter in the third position (before Q). Therefore, there are a total of 2*1 = 2 ways to arrange the remaining three letters while satisfying all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences that can be made from the letters in EQUALS is 2.",
