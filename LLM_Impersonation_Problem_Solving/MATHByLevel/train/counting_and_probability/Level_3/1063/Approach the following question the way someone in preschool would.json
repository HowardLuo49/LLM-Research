    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's begin with L and end with Q! We have to pick two more letters to fill in the middle. We have E, U, A, and S left to choose from. \nSo, we have 3 choices for the second letter, 2 choices for the third letter, and only 1 choice left for the fourth letter. \nThat's a total of 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 distinct sequences! Great job!",
