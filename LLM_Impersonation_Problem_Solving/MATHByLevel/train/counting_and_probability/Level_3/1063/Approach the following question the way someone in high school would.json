    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct sequences of four letters that meet the given conditions, we can list out the possibilities. Since each sequence must begin with L and end with Q, we already have two of the letters fixed. That leaves us with three positions to fill with the remaining letters in EQUALS: E, U, A, and S.\n\nFirst, let's organize the remaining letters:\n\nE, U, A, S\n\nNow, let's list out the possible sequences that satisfy the given conditions:\n\n1. L - E - A - Q\n2. L - E - U - Q\n3. L - E - S - Q\n4. L - U - E - Q\n5. L - U - A - Q\n6. L - U - S - Q\n7. L - A - E - Q\n8. L - A - U - Q\n9. L - A - S - Q\n10. L - S - E - Q\n11. L - S - U - Q\n12. L - S - A - Q\n\nThus, there are 12 distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once.",
