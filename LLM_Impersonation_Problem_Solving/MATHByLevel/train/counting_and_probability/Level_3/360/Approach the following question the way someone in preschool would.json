A very bizarre weighted coin comes up heads with probability $\\frac12$, tails with probability $\\frac13$, and rests on its edge with probability $\\frac16$.  If it comes up heads, I win 1 dollar.  If it comes up tails, I win 3 dollars.  But if it lands on its edge, I lose 5 dollars.  What is the expected winnings from flipping this coin?  Express your answer as a dollar value, rounded to the nearest cent.",
    "solution": "The expected value is $E = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\times\\$1\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\times\\$3\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times(-\\$5)\\right) = \\$\\dfrac{4}{6} =\\boxed{\\$\\dfrac23 \\approx \\$0.67}$.",

If it lands on tails, I win 3 dollars. But if it lands on its edge, I lose 5 dollars. \n\nTo find out how much money I'll probably end up with, I have to think about how likely each outcome is. Let's see... heads has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$, tails has a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$, and landing on its edge has a probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nSo, I'll win 1 dollar with a chance of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and 3 dollars with a chance of $\\frac{1}{3}$, and lose 5 dollars with a chance of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nTo find out how much money I'll probably have, I have to multiply my winnings by the probability of each outcome, and add them all up. So, I win $\\frac{1}{2}$ of 1 dollar, plus $\\frac{1}{3}$ of 3 dollars, and minus $\\frac{1}{6}$ of 5 dollars.\n\nLet's do the math... $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 - \\frac{1}{6} \\times 5 = \\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{9}{6} - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nSo, flipping this coin, I'd expect to end up with about 2/3 of a dollar.
