Three are Cubs, three are Red Sox, and two are Yankees. If teammates insist on sitting together, how many ways can the eight All-Stars be seated in a row?",
    "solution": "We first think of the Cubs forming a single block, denoted C, the Red Sox forming a single block R, and the Yankees forming a single block Y.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large CRY, CYR, RCY, RYC, YRC, YCR}.} $$Within each block, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the Cubs, $3!$ ways to arrange the Red Sox, and $2!$ ways to arrange the Yankees.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 3! \\times 3! \\times 2! = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = \\boxed{432} $$ways to seat all eight All-Stars.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together how many ways the All-Stars can sit in a row! First, we need to think about how many ways the Cubs can sit together. There are three Cubs, so they can sit together in 3! ways. Next, the Red Sox also have three players, so they can sit together in 3! ways too. And finally, the Yankees only have two players, so they can sit together in 2! ways.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of ways the All-Stars can sit together. We multiply the number of ways each group can sit together: 3! * 3! * 2! = 6 * 6 * 2 = 72.\n\nSo, there are 72 ways the eight All-Stars can be seated in a row if teammates insist on sitting together. Yay for teamwork!",
