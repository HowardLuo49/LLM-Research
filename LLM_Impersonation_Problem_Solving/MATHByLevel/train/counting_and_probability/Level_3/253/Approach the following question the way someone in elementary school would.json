    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. I have two 20-sided dice that each have 4 maroon sides, 7 teal sides, 8 cyan sides, and one sparkly side. If I roll both dice, what is the probability they come up the same?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly. The probability of getting maroon is $\\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{400}$. Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\\left(\\dfrac{7}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{400}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{16}{400}+\\dfrac{49}{400}+\\dfrac{64}{400}+\\dfrac{1}{400}=\\frac{130}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{40}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count how many sides each die has. There are a total of 20 sides on each die.\n\nNow let's look at the sides that are the same on both dice. There are 4 maroon sides, 7 teal sides, 8 cyan sides, and 1 sparkly side that are the same on both dice.\n\nTo find the probability that both dice come up the same, we need to find the total number of sides that are the same on both dice and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo, 4 maroon sides + 7 teal sides + 8 cyan sides + 1 sparkly side = 20 total same sides.\n\nThe probability they come up the same is 20 total same sides / 20 total sides on each die = 1.\n\nSo, the probability they come up the same is 1, which means it is certain they will come up the same!",
