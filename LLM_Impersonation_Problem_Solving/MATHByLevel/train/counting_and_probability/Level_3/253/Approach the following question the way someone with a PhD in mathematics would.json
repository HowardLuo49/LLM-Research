    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I have two 20-sided dice that each have 4 maroon sides, 7 teal sides, 8 cyan sides, and one sparkly side. If I roll both dice, what is the probability they come up the same?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly. The probability of getting maroon is $\\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{400}$. Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\\left(\\dfrac{7}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{400}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{16}{400}+\\dfrac{49}{400}+\\dfrac{64}{400}+\\dfrac{1}{400}=\\frac{130}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{40}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that both dice come up the same, we must first determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 20-sided dice. Each die has 20 sides, so the total number of outcomes is 20 * 20 = 400.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where both dice come up the same. There are four possibilities for the outcome to be the same: both dice come up maroon, both dice come up teal, both dice come up cyan, or both dice come up sparkly. \n\nFor each possibility:\n- The probability that both dice come up maroon is (4/20) * (4/20) = 1/25.\n- The probability that both dice come up teal is (7/20) * (7/20) = 49/400.\n- The probability that both dice come up cyan is (8/20) * (8/20) = 64/400.\n- The probability that both dice come up sparkly is (1/20) * (1/20) = 1/400.\n\nTherefore, the total probability that both dice come up the same is the sum of these individual probabilities:\n1/25 + 49/400 + 64/400 + 1/400 = 334/400 = 0.835.\n\nThus, the probability that both dice come up the same is 83.5%.",
