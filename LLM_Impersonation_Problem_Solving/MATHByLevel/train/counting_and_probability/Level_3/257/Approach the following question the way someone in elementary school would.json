Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct, we first need to figure out how many questions he needs to get right in order to have at least half correct. Since there are 15 questions total, Steve needs to get at least 8 questions correct to have more than half correct.\n\nTo find the probability of him getting exactly 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 questions correct, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(n-k))\n\nwhere n is the number of trials (15 questions), k is the number of successful trials (number of correct answers), p is the probability of success on each trial (1/2 since there are two choices for each question), and (n choose k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) is the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials.\n\nAdding up the probabilities of him getting 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 questions correct, we get the total probability of him getting at least half of the questions correct.\n\nCalculating this can be a little tricky, but don't worry! Just remember that you can split the problem into smaller parts and add them all up to get the final answer. And always remember, practice makes perfect! Good luck!",
