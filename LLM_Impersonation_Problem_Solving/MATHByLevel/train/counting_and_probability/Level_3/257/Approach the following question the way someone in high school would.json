Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Steve is guessing on a 15-question multiple choice test where each question has two choices: a correct one and an incorrect one. This means that he has a 1 in 2 chance of getting each question right.\n\nTo find the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct, we need to consider the different ways he can get exactly 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or all 15 questions right.\n\nThe total number of ways Steve can answer the questions is 2^15 because for each of the 15 questions, he has 2 choices. So there are a total of 2^15 = 32,768 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways he can get at least half of the questions correct:\n\n- For 7 correct answers: There are 15 choose 7 = 3003 ways he can get exactly 7 questions correct.\n- For 8 correct answers: There are 15 choose 8 = 6435 ways he can get exactly 8 questions correct.\n- For 9 correct answers: There are 15 choose 9 = 5005 ways he can get exactly 9 questions correct.\n- For 10 correct answers: There are 15 choose 10 = 3003 ways he can get exactly 10 questions correct.\n- For 11 correct answers: There are 15 choose 11 = 1365 ways he can get exactly 11 questions correct.\n- For 12 correct answers: There are 15 choose 12 = 455 ways he can get exactly 12 questions correct.\n- For 13 correct answers: There are 15 choose 13 = 105 ways he can get exactly 13 questions correct.\n- For 14 correct answers: There are 15 choose 14 = 15 ways he can get exactly 14 questions correct.\n- For all 15 correct answers: There is only 1 way he can get all 15 questions correct.\n\nSo, the total number of ways he can get at least half of the questions correct is 3003 + 6435 + 5005 + 3003 + 1365 + 455 + 105 + 15 + 1 = 19,387.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct is 19,387/32,768, which simplifies to 1211/2048.
