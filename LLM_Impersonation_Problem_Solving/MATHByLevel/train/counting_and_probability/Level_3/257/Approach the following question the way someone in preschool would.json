    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "gpt_response": "Ummmm... Steve can pick the right answer or the wrong answer for each question, so there are 2 choices for each question. Since there are 15 questions, that means there are 2^15 = 32,768 different ways he can answer the test.\n\nTo find out the probability that he gets at least half the questions correct, we need to count all the ways he can get half (or more) right. Since there are an odd number of questions, getting exactly half right means he has to get 8 questions right and 7 questions wrong, or 9 questions right and 6 questions wrong, or 10 questions right and 5 questions wrong, or 11 questions right and 4 questions wrong, or 12 questions right and 3 questions wrong, or 13 questions right and 2 questions wrong, or 14 questions right and 1 question wrong, or all 15 questions right.\n\nSo there are 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 92 ways for Steve to get at least half the questions right. \n\nTherefore, the probability that Steve gets at least half the questions right is 92/32,768. I think that reduces to 23/8192. That's a big number!",
