Only the winner of each game advances to the next round. In a particular such tournament there are 256 players. How many individual games must be played to determine the champion?",
    "solution": "A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\\boxed{255}$ games must be played.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the champion in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players, we need to figure out how many rounds will be played until we have just one winner. \n\nIn the first round, half of the players will be eliminated, which means there will be 128 winners.\nIn the second round, half of the players (64) will be eliminated.\nIn the third round, half of the players (32) will be eliminated.\nThis pattern continues until we narrow down to just 1 champion.\n\nSo, we need to calculate how many rounds will be played until we have 1 winner.\n\n256 players\n128 players\n64 players\n32 players\n16 players\n8 players\n4 players\n2 players\n1 champion\n\nIt will take 8 rounds to determine the champion in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players. \n\nIn each round, there will be 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 game played, respectively.\n\nSo, the total number of individual games that must be played to determine the champion is:\n\n128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 games\n\nTherefore, 255 individual games must be played to determine the champion in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players.",
