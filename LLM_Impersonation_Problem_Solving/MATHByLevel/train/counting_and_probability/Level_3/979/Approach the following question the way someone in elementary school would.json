    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. In a single-elimination tournament, each game is between two players. Only the winner of each game advances to the next round. In a particular such tournament there are 256 players. How many individual games must be played to determine the champion?",
    "solution": "A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\\boxed{255}$ games must be played.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many games must be played in the tournament, we need to figure out how many rounds there will be.\n\nSince each game has only one winner and the winner advances to the next round, we can think of each round as cutting the number of players in half. For example, in the first round, 256 players will play, and the winners will move on to the next round. After the first round, there will be 128 players left. Then 64 players, then 32 players, and so on.\n\nWe need to keep cutting the number of players in half until we reach just one player, the champion. \n\nIf we keep dividing 256 by 2, we get:\n\n256 \u00f7 2 = 128\n128 \u00f7 2 = 64\n64 \u00f7 2 = 32\n32 \u00f7 2 = 16\n16 \u00f7 2 = 8\n8 \u00f7 2 = 4\n4 \u00f7 2 = 2\n2 \u00f7 2 = 1\n\nSo, we need a total of 8 rounds to determine the champion in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players. In each round, there will be half as many games as there were players in the previous round. \n\nTo figure out how many individual games must be played to determine the champion, we add up the number of games in each round. \n\n1st round: 256 players / 2 = 128 games\n2nd round: 128 players / 2 = 64 games\n3rd round: 64 players / 2 = 32 games\n4th round: 32 players / 2 = 16 games\n5th round: 16 players / 2 = 8 games\n6th round: 8 players / 2 = 4 games\n7th round: 4 players / 2 = 2 games\n8th round: 2 players / 2 = 1 game\n\nSo, in total, we need to play 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 individual games to determine the champion in a tournament with 256 players.",
