    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. In a single-elimination tournament, each game is between two players. Only the winner of each game advances to the next round. In a particular such tournament there are 256 players. How many individual games must be played to determine the champion?",
    "solution": "A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\\boxed{255}$ games must be played.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! In the first round, half of the players will win and move on to the next round. So that means 256 divided by 2 equals 128 games in the first round. Then in the second round, half of the remaining players will win, so 128 divided by 2 equals 64 games. We keep doing this until we have a champion. So let's keep counting. \n\nAfter the second round, we have 64 players left, then 32 players in the third round, 16 players in the fourth round, 8 players in the fifth round, 4 players in the sixth round, 2 players in the seventh round, and finally 1 player left in the eighth round who will be our champion.\n\nSo if we add up all those individual games - 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 - we get a total of 255 games played to determine the champion. Yay, we did it!",
