Only the winner of each game advances to the next round. In a particular such tournament there are 256 players. How many individual games must be played to determine the champion?",
    "solution": "A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\\boxed{255}$ games must be played.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of individual games that must be played in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players, we can break it down by rounds. \n\nIn the first round, there are 256 players. Since each game consists of two players and only one player advances, there are 256/2 = 128 games played in the first round.\n\nIn the second round, there are 128 players remaining. Again, each game consists of two players and only one player advances, so there are 128/2 = 64 games played in the second round.\n\nThis pattern continues until there is only one player left, who is the champion. Therefore, we can see that we need to halve the number of players in each round until we have one champion. \n\nTo determine the total number of games played, we simply add up the number of games played in each round:\n\n128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255\n\nTherefore, in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players, a total of 255 individual games must be played to determine the champion.",
