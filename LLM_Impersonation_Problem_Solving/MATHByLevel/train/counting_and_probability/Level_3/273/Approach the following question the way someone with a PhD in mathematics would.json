    "solution": "Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order.  The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes, we can consider the problem using the stars and bars technique.\n\nLet's imagine representing the balls as stars and the boxes as bars. For example, if we have 4 balls and 3 boxes, we could arrange them as follows:\n\n* | * * | *\nThis arrangement corresponds to placing 1 ball in the first box, 2 balls in the second box, and 1 ball in the third box.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to distribute the balls, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the 4 stars and 2 bars (for 3 boxes) in a line. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations of n objects taken r at a time:\n\nC(n+r-1, r) = C(4+3-1, 3) = C(6, 3) = 20.\n\nTherefore, there are 20 ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes.",
