    "solution": "Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order.  The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use our imagination to think about this problem! Imagine we have 4 balls and 3 boxes. Since the balls and boxes all look the same, we can't tell them apart. So, let's put all 4 balls in the first box: that's one way. Another way is to put 3 balls in the first box and 1 ball in the second box. A third way is 2 balls in the first box and 2 balls in the second box. The last way is to put 1 ball in each of the first two boxes, and 2 balls in the last box. So, there are 4 different ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes when they all look the same.",
