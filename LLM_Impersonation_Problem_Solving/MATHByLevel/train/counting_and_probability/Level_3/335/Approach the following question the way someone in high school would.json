Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that Bertha has 6 daughters. Some of these daughters have 6 daughters of their own, and the rest have none. So, that means 3 of Bertha's daughters have 6 daughters each, and the other 3 daughters have none. \n\nSo, in total, Bertha has 6 daughters + (3 daughters x 6 daughters each) = 6 + 18 = 24 daughters and granddaughters who have daughters.\n\nWe know that Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters. So, to find out how many have no daughters, we need to subtract the 24 daughters and granddaughters who have daughters from the total.\n\n30 total - 24 with daughters = 6 daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters.\n\nTherefore, 6 of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters.",
