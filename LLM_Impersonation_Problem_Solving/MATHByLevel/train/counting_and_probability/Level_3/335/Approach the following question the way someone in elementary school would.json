Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's break this down! Bertha has 6 daughters and some of them have 6 daughters each, and the rest have none. That means that there are 6 daughters x 6 daughters = 36 granddaughters who have daughters, and the rest have no daughters. \n\nSo, out of the total 30 daughters and granddaughters, 36 have daughters, which means that 30 - 36 = -6 daughters do not have daughters. \n\nBut you can't have negative daughters! So, the answer is that none of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters since all of them have at least one daughter. Yay!",
