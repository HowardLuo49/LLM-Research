Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! Bertha has 6 daughters. Some of them have 6 daughters each, which means there are 6 x 3 = 18 granddaughters. The rest of her daughters have none, which means there are 6 - 3 = 3 daughters with no daughters. So, in total, there are 3 + 6 = 9 of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 26?: Let's count together! Bertha has 6 daughters. Some of them have 6 daughters each, which means there are 6 x 3 = 18 granddaughters. The rest of her daughters have none, which means there are 6 - 3 = 3 daughters with no daughters. So, in total, there are 3 + 6 = 9 of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters.",
