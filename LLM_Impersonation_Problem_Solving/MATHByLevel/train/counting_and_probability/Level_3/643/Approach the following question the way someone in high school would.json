    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Bicycle license plates in Flatville each contain three letters. The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "solution": "Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n\nIf two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, $100-60=\\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.\n\nNote: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made by adding two letters, we first need to figure out how many license plates can be made with the current sets of letters.\n\nFor the first set of letters $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ there are $5$ possible choices.\nFor the second set of letters $\\{A,I,O\\},$ there are $3$ possible choices.\nFor the third set of letters $\\{D,M,N,T\\},$ there are $4$ possible choices.\n\nTherefore, the total number of license plates that can be made with the current sets of letters is $5 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 60.$\n\nTo maximize the number of additional license plates that can be made, we need to add the two new letters to the sets with the fewest choices. Since the second set of letters has the fewest choices, we will add both new letters to that set. \n\nIf we add the letters $\\{X,Y\\}$ to the second set $\\{A,I,O\\},$ there will be $3+2=5$ possible choices for the second set of letters. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made by adding two letters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 100.$\n\nThus, by adding the letters $\\{X,Y\\}$ to the second set, an additional $100 - 60 = 40$ license plates can be made.",
