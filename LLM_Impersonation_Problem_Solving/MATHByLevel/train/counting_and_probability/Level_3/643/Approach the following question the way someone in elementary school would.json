    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Bicycle license plates in Flatville each contain three letters. The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "solution": "Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n\nIf two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, $100-60=\\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.\n\nNote: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.",
    "gpt_response": "In Flatville, the license plates each have three letters. The first letter can be C, H, L, P, or R. The second letter can be A, I, or O. The third letter can be D, M, N, or T. \n\nTo make more license plates, Flatville can add two new letters. They can add both letters to one set or add one letter to one set and another letter to a different set. \n\nLet's first see how many new license plates can be made by adding both new letters to one set. If we add two new letters to the set of first letters, there will be 5 (original letters) $\\times$ 2 (new letters) = 10 new license plates. If we add two new letters to the set of second letters, there will be 3 (original letters) $\\times$ 2 (new letters) = 6 new license plates. If we add two new letters to the set of third letters, there will be 4 (original letters) $\\times$ 2 (new letters) = 8 new license plates.\n\nNow, let's see how many new license plates can be made by adding one letter to one set and another letter to a different set. We can add one new letter to the first set and one new letter to the second set. There will be 2 (new letters) $\\times$ 3 (original letters) = 6 new license plates. We can also add one new letter to the first set and one new letter to the third set. There will be 2 (new letters) $\\times$ 4 (original letters) = 8 new license plates. Lastly, we can add one new letter to the second set and one new letter to the third set. There will be 2 (new letters) $\\times$ 3 (original letters) = 6 new license plates.\n\nThe largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made by adding two letters is 10, when adding both new letters to the set of first letters.",
