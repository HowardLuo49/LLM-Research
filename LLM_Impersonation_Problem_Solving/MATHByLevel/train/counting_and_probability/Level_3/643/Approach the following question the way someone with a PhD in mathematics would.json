The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "solution": "Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n\nIf two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, $100-60=\\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.\n\nNote: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.",
    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I approach this problem by considering the number of possible license plates before and after adding new letters.\n\nBefore adding any new letters, there are $5 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 60$ possible license plates in Flatville.\n\nNow, let's consider the different scenarios for adding two new letters:\n\n1. Adding both new letters to the same set:\nIf we add both new letters to the first set, we will have $6 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 72$ possible license plates.\nIf we add both new letters to the second set, we will have $5 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 100$ possible license plates.\nIf we add both new letters to the third set, we will have $5 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 90$ possible license plates.\n\n2. Adding one new letter to each of two sets:\nIf we add one new letter to the first set and one to the second set, we will have $6 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120$ possible license plates.\nIf we add one new letter to the first set and one to the third set, we will have $6 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 108$ possible license plates.\nIf we add one new letter to the second set and one to the third set, we will have $5 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 150$ possible license plates.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters is 150, which occurs when one new letter is added to each of two sets.",
