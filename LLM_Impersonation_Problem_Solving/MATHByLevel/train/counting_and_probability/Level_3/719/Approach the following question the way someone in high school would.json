    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many different four-digit numbers can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004, we need to consider the number of ways we can arrange these digits. \n\n2004 has 4 digits: 2, 0, 0, 4. Since there are repeated digits (two zeros), we need to account for that when calculating the number of arrangements. \n\nFirst, let's consider the options for the first digit:\n- We have 4 options for the first digit (2, 0, 0, 4).\n\nThen, for the second digit:\n- After choosing the first digit, there will be 3 options left for the second digit.\n\nNext, for the third digit:\n- After choosing the first two digits, there will be 2 options left for the third digit.\n\nFinally, for the fourth digit:\n- Since there's only one digit left after choosing the first three digits, the fourth digit is already determined.\n\nMultiplying the number of options for each digit, we have:\n\n4 options for the first digit x 3 options for the second digit x 2 options for the third digit x 1 option for the fourth digit = 24 different four-digit numbers that can be formed by rearranging the digits in 2004.",
