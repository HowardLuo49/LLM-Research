    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many different four-digit numbers we can make using the digits 2, 0, 0, and 4, let's try listing out all the possibilities! \n\nFirst, we can see that the number 0 can only be in the thousands place, because if it were in any other place it would not be a four-digit number. \n\nSo, we have 0 in the thousands place. Next, we have the options of putting 2, 0, or 4 in the hundreds place. After that, we have two options left for the tens place, and only one option left for the units place since we can't repeat any digits. \n\nSo, let's write out all the possible combinations:\n\n1. 2004\n2. 2040\n3. 2400\n4. 0204\n5. 0240\n6. 0420\n7. 4002\n8. 4020\n9. 4200 \n\nSo, there are 9 different ways we can arrange the digits 2, 0, 0, and 4 to make a four-digit number!",
