    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",

In order to find the number of different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging these digits, we can use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time, which is given by:\\n\\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\\n\\nFor the number 2004, we have n = 4 (the total number of digits) and r = 4 (the number of digits we are arranging). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\\n\\nP(4, 4) = 4! / (4 - 4)!\\n         = 4! / 0!\\n         = 4! / 1\\n         = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\\n         = 24\\n\\nTherefore, there are 24 different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180048, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=204, prompt_tokens=33, total_tokens=237))",
