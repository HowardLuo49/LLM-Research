    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many different four-digit numbers can be formed by arranging the four digits in 2004?",
    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004, we need to consider the number of permutations of the digits.\n\nThere are 4 digits in 2004 (2, 0, 0, and 4), and we want to arrange them to form a four-digit number. Since the digit 0 appears twice, we cannot simply use the formula for permutations with repeated elements.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider cases for arranging the digits. We can start by determining the total number of permutations of the 4 digits, which is given by 4!, or 4*3*2*1 = 24.\n\nSince the digit 0 appears twice, we need to account for the fact that these permutations will result in the same four-digit number. To do this, we divide the total number of permutations by the number of ways in which the zeros can be arranged, which is 2!. This accounts for the fact that the two zeros are indistinguishable.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004 is given by the formula:\nTotal number of permutations / Number of ways zeros can be arranged = 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004.",
