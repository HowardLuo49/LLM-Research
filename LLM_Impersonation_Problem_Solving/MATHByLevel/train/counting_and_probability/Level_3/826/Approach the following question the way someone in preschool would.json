    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A bin has 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.  If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
    "solution": "There are 5 green balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a green ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$. Similarly, the probability that a purple ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$. So the expected value is $$\\frac{5}{5+k}(2)+\\frac{k}{5+k}(-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ gives $20-4k=5+k$, or $15=5k$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count the balls in the bin. We have 5 green balls and some purple balls. Let's call the purple balls \"k\" because we don't know how many there are. \n\nNow, let's think about what happens when we pick a ball. If we pick a green ball, we win 2 dollars. But if we pick a purple ball, we lose 2 dollars. We want to figure out what the average amount we win is.\n\nSince we win 2 dollars for each green ball and lose 2 dollars for each purple ball, we want to find out how many purple balls we need so that the average amount we win is 50 cents. That means the total amount of money won should be 50 cents in the end.\n\nSo, let's calculate it like this: \n\nWe win 2 dollars for each green ball, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 dollars. \nWe lose 2 dollars for each purple ball, so that's k x 2 = 2k dollars. \n\nNow, we add those together and set it equal to the average amount we want to win, which is 50 cents or 0.50 dollars. \n\n10 - 2k = 0.50\n\nNow, we can solve for k:\n\n10 - 2k = 0.50\n10 - 0.50 = 2k\n9.50 = 2k\nk = 9.50 / 2\nk = 4.75\n\nSo, it looks like there are 4.75 purple balls in the bin. But since we can't have half a ball, we round up to the nearest whole number. So, there are 5 purple balls in the bin! Yay!",
