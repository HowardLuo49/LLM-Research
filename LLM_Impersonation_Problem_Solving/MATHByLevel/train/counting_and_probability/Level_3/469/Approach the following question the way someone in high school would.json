    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many different positive, six-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 5, 5, 9 and 9?",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 6 distinct digits, there would be $6! = 720$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, 2! for the repetition of the digit 5, and again 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in 2! ways).  So, our answer is $\\frac{6!}{2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 2!} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of different positive, six-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 5, 5, 9, and 9, we can use the concept of permutations.\n\nSince we have repeating digits (2, 2, 5, 5, 9, 9), we need to consider how many times each digit is repeated. In this case, the digits 2, 5, and 9 are repeated twice each.\n\nSo, the total number of different six-digit integers that can be formed using these digits can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrangements of all six digits by the number of arrangements of the repeated digits.\n\nThe total number of arrangements of all six digits is 6! (6 factorial) = 720.\n\nThe number of arrangements of the repeated digits (2, 2, 5, 5, 9, 9) is calculated as follows:\n- 2 is repeated twice and can be arranged in 2! ways (2 arrangements)\n- 5 is repeated twice and can be arranged in 2! ways (2 arrangements)\n- 9 is repeated twice and can be arranged in 2! ways (2 arrangements)\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements of the repeated digits is 2! * 2! * 2! = 8.\n\nNow, to find the total number of different positive, six-digit integers that can be formed, we divide the total number of arrangements of all six digits by the number of arrangements of the repeated digits:\n720 / 8 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 different positive, six-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 5, 5, 9, and 9.",
