    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Tim has 10 gray socks and 8 white socks. Let's count how many socks he has in total. Tim has 10 gray socks plus 8 white socks, which equals 18 socks in total. Now, let's think about how many ways he can pick a pair of matching socks. Tim can pick 2 gray socks (because they have the same color) or 2 white socks (because they also have the same color). So, there are 2 ways for Tim to pick a matching pair of socks. Next, let's find out the total number of ways Tim can pick any 2 socks from his drawer. There are 18 socks in total, so Tim can choose any 2 socks out of the 18 inC2 ways. That means the total number of ways he can pick any 2 socks is 18C2. Finally, let's find out the probability of Tim picking a matching pair of socks. The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the probability is 2 (favorable outcomes) divided by 153 (total outcomes). So, the probability of Tim picking a matching pair of socks is 2/153. Yay, we did it!",
