    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to figure out how many total socks Tim has. He has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks, so that's 10 + 8 = 18 socks total.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many ways he can pick a matching pair. He can either pick both gray-bottomed socks or both white-bottomed socks. Since there are 10 gray-bottomed socks, he can pick a matching pair of gray socks in C(10, 2) = 45 ways. Similarly, he can pick a matching pair of white socks in C(8, 2) = 28 ways.\n\nSo the total number of ways he can pick a matching pair is 45 + 28 = 73 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability that he picks a matching pair of socks is 73/ (18 choose 2) = 73/153 = 0.4771 or approximately 47.71%.",
