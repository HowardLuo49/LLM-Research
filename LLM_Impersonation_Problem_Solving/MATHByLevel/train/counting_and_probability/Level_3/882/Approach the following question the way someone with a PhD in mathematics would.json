    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate $A$, we start by considering the possible choices for the first digit of the four digit odd number. Since we want an odd number, the first digit must be one of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. There are 5 choices for the first digit.\n\nFor the second digit, there are 10 options (0-9) since we can have any digit between 0 and 9.\n\nFor the third digit and fourth digit, we also have 10 options for each.\n\nSo, the total number of four digit odd numbers is $5 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 5000$.\n\nNext, to calculate $B$, we consider the possible choices for the first digit of the four digit multiples of 5. Since the number needs to be a multiple of 5, the first digit can only be 1 or 2. There are 2 choices for the first digit.\n\nFor the second, third, and fourth digit, we have 10 options for each.\n\nTherefore, the total number of four digit multiples of 5 is $2 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 2000$.\n\nTo find $A+B$, we add the total number of four digit odd numbers and the total number of four digit multiples of 5: $5000 + 2000 = 7000$.\n\nTherefore, $A+B = 7000$.",
