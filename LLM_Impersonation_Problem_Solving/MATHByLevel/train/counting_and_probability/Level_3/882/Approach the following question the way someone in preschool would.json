    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! First, let's find the four digit odd numbers. To be odd, the last digit must be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. So there are 5 choices for the last digit. For the first three digits, we can choose any number from 0 to 9, so there are 10 choices for each of those digits.\n\nThat means there are $5 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 500$ four digit odd numbers.\n\nNext, let's find the four digit multiples of 5. Since a number is a multiple of 5 if it ends in 0 or 5, there are 2 choices for the last digit. And again, there are 10 choices for each of the first three digits.\n\nSo there are $2 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 200$ four digit multiples of 5.\n\nNow, let's add them up! $A + B = 500 + 200 = 700$\n\nSo, the answer is 700.
