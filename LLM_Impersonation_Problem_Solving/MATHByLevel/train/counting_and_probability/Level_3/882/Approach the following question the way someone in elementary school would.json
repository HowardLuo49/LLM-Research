    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of four digit odd numbers, we need to look at the last digit because all odd numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Since we want four digit numbers, the first digit can be anything except 0. So we have 9 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second digit, 10 choices for the third digit, and 5 choices for the last digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n\nSo $A$ equals $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 5$. \n\nTo find the number of four digit multiples of 5, we know that all multiples of 5 end in 0 or 5. So the last digit must be 0 or 5. We already know that the first digit can be anything except 0, so we have 9 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second digit, 10 choices for the third digit, and 2 choices for the last digit (0 or 5).\n\nSo $B$ equals $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 2$. \n\nTherefore, $A + B$ equals $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 5 + 9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 2$.
