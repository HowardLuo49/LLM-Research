    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $A$, we need to find the number of four digit odd numbers. Since an odd number always ends in either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, we have 5 choices for the units digit. \n\nFor the thousands digit, we have 9 choices (1-9), for the hundreds digit we have 10 choices (0-9) since any digit can be used, and for the tens digit we have 10 choices as well.\n\nTherefore, the total number of four digit odd numbers is $5 \\times 9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 4500$.\n\nTo find $B$, we need to find the number of four digit multiples of 5. Since a number is a multiple of 5 if it ends in 0 or 5, we have 2 choices for the units digit.\n\nFor the thousands digit, we have 9 choices (1-9), for the hundreds digit we have 10 choices (0-9), and for the tens digit we have 9 choices (since we have already used one of them for the units place).\n\nTherefore, the total number of four digit multiples of 5 is $2 \\times 9 \\times 10 \\times 9 = 1620$.\n\nNow, to find $A+B$, we add the number of four digit odd numbers and the number of four digit multiples of 5: $4500 + 1620 = \\boxed{6120}$.",
