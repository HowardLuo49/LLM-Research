    "solution": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits, we can use the concept of complement. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of three-digit whole numbers possible. Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for the hundreds place (1 to 9), and 10 choices for the tens and ones places (0 to 9). So, the total number of three-digit whole numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nNext, let's find the number of three-digit whole numbers that do not have a 7 or a 9 as digits. Since there are 8 possible digits (0-6, 8) for each place, there are 8 * 8 * 8 = 512 three-digit numbers without a 7 or a 9.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or 9 by subtracting the number of numbers without a 7 or 9 from the total number of three-digit whole numbers. So, 900 - 512 = 388 three-digit numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits.\n\nTherefore, there are 388 three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits.",
