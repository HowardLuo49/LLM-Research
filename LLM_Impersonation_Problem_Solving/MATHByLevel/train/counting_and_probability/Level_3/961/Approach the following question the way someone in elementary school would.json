Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters with no restrictions? (The triplets are treated as distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We are choosing 6 starters from 14 players, which can be done in $\\binom{14}{6} = \\boxed{3003}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways we can choose 6 starters, we have to use a special math called combinations. To do this, we can use the formula nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of players and r is the number of starters we want to choose. \n\nIn this case, n is 14 and r is 6. So, we just plug those numbers into the formula:\n\n14C6 = 14! / 6!(14-6)!\n14C6 = 3003\n\nSo, there are 3003 ways we can choose 6 starters from our school's girls volleyball team with no restrictions! Wow, that's a lot of possibilities!",
