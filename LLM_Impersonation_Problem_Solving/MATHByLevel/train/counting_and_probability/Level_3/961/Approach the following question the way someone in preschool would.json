In how many ways can we choose 6 starters with no restrictions? (The triplets are treated as distinguishable.)",

    "gpt_response": "Wow, we have a volleyball team with 14 players! That's so cool! And did you know we have triplets on the team? Their names are Alicia, Amanda, and Anna! They must be really good friends to all play volleyball together.\n\nNow, let's think about how many ways we can choose 6 starters for our team. Since there are no restrictions, that means we can pick any 6 players we want. So, we have 14 players to choose from, and we want to pick 6 of them. \n\nLet's count together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So many players to choose from! How many ways can we pick 6 of them? Let's see... \n\nMaybe we can try counting on our fingers! Let's start with 1 finger for the first player we pick, then add another finger for the second player, and so on until we've picked 6 starters for our team.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... wow, that was fun! So, we can choose 6 starters for our volleyball team in 3003 different ways. That's a lot of possibilities! I'm sure our team will do great with any of those combinations. Let's go, team!",
