Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters with no restrictions? (The triplets are treated as distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We are choosing 6 starters from 14 players, which can be done in $\\binom{14}{6} = \\boxed{3003}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out how many ways we can choose 6 starters from the 14 players on the team.\n\nThis is a combination problem, so we can use the formula for combination, which is nCr = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of players and r is the number of starters we want to choose.\n\nPlugging in our numbers, we get:\n\n14C6 = 14! / [6!(14-6)!] = 3003\n\nSo, there are 3003 ways to choose 6 starters from the 14 players on the team with no restrictions.",
