    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$. Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\dfrac{720}{8} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR, we first note that the word contains 6 letters, with 2 occurrences of the letter 'A' and 2 occurrences of the letter 'T'. \n\nBecause the letters 'A' and 'T' are repeated, we need to consider the symmetry in our arrangements. This means that the total number of arrangements will be less than the factorial of the total number of letters (6! = 720) because of the repetition.\n\nTo account for this, we use the formula for permutations with repeated elements:\n\nTotal number of arrangements = 6! / (2! * 2!) = 720 / 4 = 180\n\nTherefore, there are 180 ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR.",
