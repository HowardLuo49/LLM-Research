    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations, which is a fundamental concept in combinatorics. \n\nSince the order in which Karl selects the crayons does not matter, we are dealing with a combination rather than a permutation. \n\nThe formula for calculating the number of combinations of selecting r items from a set of n items is given by the formula C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n! denotes the factorial of n. \n\nIn this case, Karl wants to select 4 crayons out of the 12 different-colored crayons in the box. Therefore, the number of ways in which Karl can select the crayons can be calculated using the formula C(12,4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!) = 495 ways. \n\nTherefore, there are 495 ways in which Karl can select four crayons from the box without considering the order in which he selects them.",
