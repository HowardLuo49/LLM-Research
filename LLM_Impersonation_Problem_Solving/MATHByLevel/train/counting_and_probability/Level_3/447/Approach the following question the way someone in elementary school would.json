    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways Karl can select four crayons from the box, we can use a math problem called combinations. \n\nFirst, we need to know how many total crayons there are in the box. Since there are 12 different-colored crayons, we know that there are 12 total crayons.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many crayons Karl is going to select. Karl wants to select four crayons. \n\nNow we can use the combination formula to find out how many ways Karl can select four crayons from 12 total crayons:\n12 choose 4 = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!)\n            = 12! / (4! * 8!)\n            = (12*11*10*9) / (4*3*2*1)\n            = 495\n\nSo, Karl can select four crayons from the box in 495 different ways if the order doesn't matter.",
