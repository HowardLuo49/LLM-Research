    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six dice, we need to consider how many ways we can achieve this outcome.\n\nThere are 6 choices for the number on the first die, 5 choices for the number on the second die (since it must be different from the first), 4 choices for the third die, 3 choices for the fourth die, 2 choices for the fifth die, and 1 choice for the sixth die.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to roll six distinct numbers on six dice is 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720\n\nSince each die has 6 sides and there are 6 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6 = 46656\n\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of successful outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = 720/46656 = 5/324\n\nSo, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six dice is 5/324.",
