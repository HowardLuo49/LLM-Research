    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the different ways we can roll the dice! \n\nFirst, we need to know how many different outcomes we can have when rolling one dice. Since each dice has six sides, there are 6 different numbers we can roll.\n\nNow, let's think about rolling six different numbers with six dice. The first dice can be any number, so there are 6 options. The second dice must be a different number from the first one, so there are 5 options left. The third dice must be a different number from the first two, so there are 4 options left. And so on until the sixth dice, where there is only 1 option left.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to roll six distinct numbers with six dice is 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720.\n\nNow we need to find the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice, regardless of whether the numbers are distinct or not. Since each dice has 6 sides, there are 6^6 = 46656 total outcomes.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of rolling six distinct numbers by dividing the number of ways to roll six distinct numbers by the total number of possible outcomes. \n\nProbability = Number of ways to roll six distinct numbers / Total number of possible outcomes\nProbability = 720 / 46656\nProbability = 5 / 324\n\nSo, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers with six dice is 5/324.",
