    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six standard six-sided dice, we need to consider the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nThe total number of outcomes when rolling six dice is 6^6, since each die has 6 possible outcomes and they are independent of each other.\n\nFor the favorable outcomes, we need to choose 6 distinct numbers out of the 6 possible numbers on each die. The first die can be any of the 6 numbers, the second die can be any of the remaining 5 numbers, and so on. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 6! (6 factorial).\n\nThus, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six dice is:\n\nP = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes\nP = 6! / 6^6\n\nSince 6! = 720 and 6^6 = 46656, the probability can be simplified to:\n\nP = 720 / 46656\nP = 5 / 324\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six standard six-sided dice is 5/324.",
