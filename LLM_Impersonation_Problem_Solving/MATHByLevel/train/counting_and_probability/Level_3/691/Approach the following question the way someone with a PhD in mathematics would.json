    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of possible license plates that satisfy the given conditions, we first need to determine the number of choices for each position.\n\n1. The first position can either be G or K, so there are 2 choices.\n2. The second, third, and fourth positions can be filled with any of the remaining 10 letters (since S cannot be used), so there are 10 choices for each of these positions.\n3. The fifth position must be T, so there is only 1 choice.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible license plates that satisfy all conditions is:\n\n2 choices for the first position * 10 choices for the second position * 10 choices for the third position * 10 choices for the fourth position * 1 choice for the fifth position = 2 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 1 = 2000.\n\nSo, there are 2000 possible license plates of five letters that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no repeating letters.",
