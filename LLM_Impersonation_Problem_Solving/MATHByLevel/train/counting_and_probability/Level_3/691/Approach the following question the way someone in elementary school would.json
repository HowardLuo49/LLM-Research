    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to figure out how many choices we have for each position in the license plate.\n\n1. The first letter can be either G or K, so we have 2 choices.\n2. The second letter can be any of the remaining 10 letters (since we can't repeat letters or use S), so we have 10 choices.\n3. The third letter can be any of the remaining 9 letters (again, no repeats or S), so we have 9 choices.\n4. The fourth letter must be T, so we only have 1 choice.\n5. The fifth letter can be any of the remaining 8 letters (no repeats or S), so we have 8 choices.\n\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, we just need to multiply all of our choices together:\n\n2 choices x 10 choices x 9 choices x 1 choice x 8 choices = 1440 possible license plates\n\nSo, there are 1440 possible license plates that meet all of the conditions given.",
