    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see...we have the letters G, K, T that we need to use. We can't use S. So we have A, E, I, O, P, R, U, V to choose from for the middle two letters. Since the letters can't repeat, we have to choose different ones for each position.\n\nSo, we have 2 choices for the first letter (G or K), 1 choice for the last letter (T), 7 choices for the second letter, and 6 choices for the third letter. \n\nThat gives us 2 x 7 x 6 x 1 = 84 possible license plates.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 1008?: Let's see...we have the letters G, K, T that we need to use. We can't use S. So we have A, E, I, O, P, R, U, V to choose from for the middle two letters. Since the letters can't repeat, we have to choose different ones for each position.\n\nSo, we have 2 choices for the first letter (G or K), 1 choice for the last letter (T), 7 choices for the second letter, and 6 choices for the third letter. \n\nThat gives us 2 x 7 x 6 x 1 = 84 possible license plates.",
