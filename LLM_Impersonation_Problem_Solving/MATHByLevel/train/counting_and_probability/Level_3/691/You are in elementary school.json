Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",

The license plate must begin with either G or K.\\n2. The license plate must end with T.\\n3. The license plate cannot contain the letter S.\\n4. The license plate must have no repeated letters.\\n\\nFor the first requirement, the license plate can begin with either G or K. So there are 2 choices for the first letter.\\n\\nFor the second requirement, the license plate must end with the letter T. So there is only 1 choice for the last letter.\\n\\nFor the third requirement, the license plate cannot contain the letter S. Since we have already used one of the available letters for the first or last position, we are left with 10 letters to choose from (A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, U, V) for the three middle positions.\\n\\nFor the fourth requirement, we cannot have any repeating letters. So for the second letter, there are 11 choices (all letters except the one used for the first position), then 10 choices for the third letter, 9 choices for the fourth letter, and 8 choices for the fifth letter.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of possible license plates that meet all the requirements is:\\n\\n2 (choices for the first letter) * 10 (choices for the second letter) * 9 (choices for the third letter) * 8 (choices for the fourth letter) * 1 (choice for the last letter) = 1,440\\n\\nSo there are 1,440 possible license plates of five letters that meet all the given requirements.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181391, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=333, prompt_tokens=105, total_tokens=438))",
