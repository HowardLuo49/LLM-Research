    "solution": "We know that we must take a 7 unit path.  If we look at the grid a little more carefully, we can see that our path must consist of 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and we can take those steps in any order.  So in order to specify a path, we must choose 3 of our 7 steps to be `up' (and the other 4 steps will thus be `right').  Hence the number of paths is $$ \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{35}. $$",
