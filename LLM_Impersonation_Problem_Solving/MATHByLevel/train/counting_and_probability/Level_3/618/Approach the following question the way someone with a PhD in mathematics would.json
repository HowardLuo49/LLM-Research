    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of different convex quadrilaterals that can be formed using the 10 distinct points on the circumference of a circle, we must consider the combinations of these points that can form a convex quadrilateral. \n\nA convex quadrilateral requires exactly 4 points, so we need to choose 4 points from the total of 10 points on the circumference. This can be done using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of points and k is the number of points needed to form a quadrilateral.\n\nPlugging in n=10 and k=4, we get C(10, 4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!) = 210. \n\nTherefore, there are a total of 210 different convex quadrilaterals that can be formed using the 10 distinct points on the circumference of a circle.",
