    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Ten distinct points are identified on the circumference of a circle. How many different convex quadrilaterals can be formed if each vertex must be one of these 10 points?",
    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",
    "gpt_response": "1. A circle is a round shape that has a curved line all the way around it.\n\n2. Imagine that there are 10 points marked around the outside of the circle, kind of like a clock.\n\n3. A quadrilateral is a shape that has four sides and four corners.\n\n4. To make a quadrilateral, we need to choose four of the 10 points on the circle.\n\n5. Since the quadrilateral must be convex, this means that no two of the points can be next to each other on the circle.\n\n6. Let's start by choosing the first point. We have 10 choices for this point.\n\n7. Once we choose the first point, we have 9 choices left for the second point.\n\n8. After we choose the second point, we have 7 choices left for the third point (since it can't be next to the second point).\n\n9. Finally, for the fourth point, we have 6 choices left.\n\n10. So, we can form 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 = 504 different convex quadrilaterals using the 10 points on the circumference of the circle.",
