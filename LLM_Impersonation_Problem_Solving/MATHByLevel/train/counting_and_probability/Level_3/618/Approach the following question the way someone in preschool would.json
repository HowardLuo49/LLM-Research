    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",

Then we can choose another point as our second corner. Next, we can pick a third point and a fourth point to finish our shape. Let's use our fingers to show the different shapes we can make by moving them around the circle. Let's count together how many different shapes we can make! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
