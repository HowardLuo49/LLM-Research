    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
