    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of the arrangement reading XOXOX, we need to first calculate the total number of ways the five tiles can be arranged. Since there are 5 tiles, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways the desired arrangement XOXOX can occur. In this case, there is only 1 way to arrange the tiles as XOXOX.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the arrangement reading XOXOX is 1/5! = 1/120. So the probability is 1 out of 120.",
