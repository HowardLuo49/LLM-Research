    "solution": "Since the three triangles $ABP$, $ACP$, and $BCP$ have equal bases, their areas are proportional to the lengths of their altitudes.\n\nLet $O$ be the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$, and draw medians $\\overline{AOE}$ and $\\overline{BOD}$. Any point above $\\overline{BOD}$ will be farther from $\\overline{AB}$ than from $\\overline{BC},$ and any point above $\\overline{AOE}$ will be farther from $\\overline{AB}$  than from $\\overline{AC}.$ Therefore the condition of the problem is met if and only if $P$ is inside quadrilateral $CDOE.$\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,O;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(10,0);\nC=(5,8.7);\nD=(2.5,4.3);\nI=(7.5,4.3);\nF=(5,0);\nO=(5,2.3);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--I,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(B--D,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--F,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,SW);\n[/asy]\n\n\nIf $\\overline{CO}$ is extended to $F$ on $\\overline{AB}$, then $\\triangle ABC$ is divided into six congruent triangles, of which two comprise quadrilateral $CDOE$.
