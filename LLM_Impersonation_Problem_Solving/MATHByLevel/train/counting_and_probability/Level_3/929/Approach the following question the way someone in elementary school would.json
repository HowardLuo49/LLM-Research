    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Our water polo team has 15 members.  I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to choose the goalie from the 15 members. That's just 1 way. Then we need to choose the other 6 players for the team, but the order doesn't matter. So we need to figure out how many ways we can choose those 6 players from the remaining 14 players.\n\nTo do that, we can use a combination formula. The formula for choosing r items from n items is nCr = n! / [ r! * (n-r)! ]. In this case, n = 14 and r = 6.\n\nSo, 14C6 = 14! / [6! * (14-6)!] = 3003.\n\nThat means there are 3003 ways to choose the other 6 players. So, in total, there are 1 * 3003 = 3003 ways to choose your starting water polo team.",
