    "solution": "Look at the coefficients of the powers of 101: 1, -4, 6, -4, 1. You might recognize these as $\\binom40$, $-\\binom41$, $\\binom42$, $-\\binom43$, $\\binom44$. This suggests that the Binomial Theorem is in play. Indeed, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(101 + (-1))^4 &= \\binom40 \\cdot 101^{4} \\cdot (-1)^0 + \\binom41 \\cdot 101^{3} \\cdot (-1)^1 + \\\\\n&\\phantom{=} \\binom42 \\cdot 101^2 \\cdot (-1)^2 + \\binom43 \\cdot 101^1 \\cdot (-1)^3 + \\\\\n&\\phantom{=} \\binom44 \\cdot 101^0 \\cdot (-1)^4\\\\\n& = 101^{4} - 4 \\cdot 101^{3} + 6 \\cdot 101^2 - 4 \\cdot 101 + 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we have $(101 + (-1))^4 = 100^4 = \\boxed{100000000}$.",

Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n101^4 - 4 * 101^3 + 6 * 101^2 - 4 * 101 + 1 = (101 - 1)^4\n= 100^4\n= 100 * 100 * 100 * 100\n= 1,000,000,000\n\nSo, the value of the expression $101^{4} - 4 \\cdot 101^{3} + 6 \\cdot 101^2 - 4 \\cdot 101 + 1$ is 1,000,000,000.",
