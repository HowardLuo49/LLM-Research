    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box.  There is only $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5.  This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{462}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of drawing 5 white balls from the box, we need to consider the total number of ways to draw 5 balls out of the box and then determine the number of ways to draw 5 white balls. \n\nThere are a total of 11 balls in the box, so the total number of ways to draw 5 balls is given by the binomial coefficient (11 choose 5) which is equal to 11! / (5! * (11-5)!) = 462.\n\nThe number of ways to draw 5 white balls is simply the number of ways to choose 5 white balls from the 5 available white balls, which is given by the binomial coefficient (5 choose 5) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 5 white balls from the box is given by the ratio of the number of ways to draw 5 white balls to the total number of ways to draw 5 balls, which is 1 / 462 \u2248 0.0022 or 0.22%.",
