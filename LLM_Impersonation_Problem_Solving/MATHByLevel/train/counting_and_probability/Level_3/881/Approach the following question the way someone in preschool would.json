    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box.  There is only $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5.  This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{462}}$.",

Who would like to pick the first ball? Now, who wants to pick the second ball? Let's keep picking until we have 5 balls. \n\nNow, how many white balls do we have in our hands? Are they all white? Let's count together. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! We have all white balls! Yay!\n\nSo, the probability that we picked all 5 white balls is... 5 out of the total number of balls we have, which is 11. So, the probability is 5/11. Great job, friends!\"",
