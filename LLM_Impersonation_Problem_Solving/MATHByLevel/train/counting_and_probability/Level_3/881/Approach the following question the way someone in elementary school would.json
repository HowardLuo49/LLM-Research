    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box.  There is only $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5.  This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{462}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the chance of picking all white balls out of the box. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of balls in the box. There are 5 white balls and 6 black balls, so that is 5 + 6 = 11 balls in total.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of white balls we are picking. We want to pick 5 white balls.\n\nNow, we can find the probability by setting up a fraction. The number of ways to pick 5 white balls out of the 5 white balls is 5 choose 5, which equals 1. The number of ways to pick 5 balls out of 11 total balls is 11 choose 5, which equals 462.\n\nSo, the probability of picking all white balls is 1/462.\n\nYay, we did it! We found the answer!",
