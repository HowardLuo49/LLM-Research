    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",

This gives us a total of 9 * 10 = 90 integers.\\n- For integers with a tens digit of 9 and a units digit of 0 to 8, there are a total of 1 choice for the tens digit and 9 choices for the units digit. This gives us a total of 1 * 9 = 9 integers.\\n\\nTherefore, there are a total of 90 + 9 = 99 integers with different digits in the range of 10 to 99.\\n\\nThe probability of choosing an integer with different digits is given by:\\nNumber of integers with different digits / Total number of integers = 99 / 90 = 11 / 90\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that the randomly chosen integer has different digits is 11/90.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181506, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=277, prompt_tokens=38, total_tokens=315))",
