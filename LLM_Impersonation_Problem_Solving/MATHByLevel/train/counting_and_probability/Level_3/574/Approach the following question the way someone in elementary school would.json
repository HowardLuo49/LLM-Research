    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we first need to figure out how many numbers between 10 and 99 have different digits. \n\nWe can start by listing all the numbers that have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. There are 9 of these numbers.\n\nNow, we can count how many numbers have different digits by subtracting the numbers with the same digits from the total number of numbers between 10 and 99, which is 90.\n\nSo, the total number of numbers with different digits is 90 - 9 = 81.\n\nTherefore, the probability of choosing a number with different digits is 81/90, which simplifies to 9/10. \n\nSo, the probability of choosing an integer greater than 9 and less than 100 with different digits is 9/10.",
