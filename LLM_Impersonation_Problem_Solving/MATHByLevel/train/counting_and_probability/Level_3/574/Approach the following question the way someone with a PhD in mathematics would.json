    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the digits of the randomly chosen integer are different, we must first determine the total number of possible integers within the given range (greater than 9 and less than 100). \n\nThere are a total of 90 integers within this range (10, 11, 12,..., 98, 99). \n\nNext, we consider the number of integers with different digits. For a two-digit integer to have different digits, the tens digit and the units digit must be different. There are 9 choices for the tens digit (1-9) and 10 choices for the units digit (0-9, excluding the digit already chosen for the tens place). This gives a total of 9 * 10 = 90 integers with different digits.\n\nTherefore, the probability of randomly choosing an integer with different digits is 90/90 = 1.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that a randomly chosen integer greater than 9 and less than 100 has different digits is 1.",
