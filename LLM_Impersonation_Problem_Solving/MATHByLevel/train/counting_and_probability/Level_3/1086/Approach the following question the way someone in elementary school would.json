    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Jenna and her four friends want to ride the roller coaster. But only three people can ride in one car. So, let's see how many different groups of three they can make:\n\nFirst, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 1 and Friend 2.\nSecond, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 1 and Friend 3.\nThird, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 1 and Friend 4.\nFourth, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 1 and Friend 5.\nFifth, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 2 and Friend 3.\nSixth, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 2 and Friend 4.\nSeventh, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 2 and Friend 5.\nEighth, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 3 and Friend 4.\nNinth, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 3 and Friend 5.\nTenth, Jenna can be in a group with Friend 4 and Friend 5.\n\nSo, there are ten different groups of three that Jenna and her friends can make to ride the roller coaster.",
