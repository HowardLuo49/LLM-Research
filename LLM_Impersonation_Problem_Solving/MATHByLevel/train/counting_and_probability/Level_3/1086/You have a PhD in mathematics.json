    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$.",

The formula for finding the number of combinations of choosing k items from n items is given by:\\n\\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\\n\\nIn this case, n = 5 (Jenna and her four friends) and they want to choose k = 3 to ride the roller coaster. Plugging in the values into the formula:\\n\\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\\nC(5, 3) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1) * (2*1))\\nC(5, 3) = 120 / (6*2)\\nC(5, 3) = 120 / 12\\nC(5, 3) = 10\\n\\nTherefore, Jenna and her four friends can form 10 different groups of three to ride the roller coaster.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180013, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=239, prompt_tokens=56, total_tokens=295))",
