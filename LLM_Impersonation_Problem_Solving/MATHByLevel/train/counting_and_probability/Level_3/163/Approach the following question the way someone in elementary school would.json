    "solution": "We first factor 180 into three positive integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Since $180 > 5^3 = 125,$ at least one of the integers must be 6. Since $180 > 5^2\\cdot 6 = 150$, at least two integers must equal 6. Indeed, $180 = 5\\cdot6\\cdot6$ is the only such way to factor 180. Therefore, $(a,b,c) = (5,6,6), (6,5,6),(6,6,5)$ are the only possibilities for $a,b,c$. Each occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac16\\right)^3 = \\frac1{216}$, so the probability that $abc = 180$ is $3\\cdot \\frac1{216} = \\boxed{\\frac1{72}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about how we can get the numbers $a$, $b$, and $c to multiply to 180. We know that $180 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5$. So that means we need to get a 2, another 2, two 3s, and a 5.\n\nLet's start by thinking about how many ways we can get a 2 from rolling three dice. There are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 ways to get a 2 on one die. Since we want two 2s, that means we have 6 * 6 = 36 ways to get two 2s.\n\nNext, let's think about how many ways we can get two 3s. Again, there are 6 ways to get a 3 on one die, so that means there are 6 * 6 = 36 ways to get two 3s.\n\nLastly, we need to think about how many ways we can get a 5. There is only 1 way to get a 5 on one die. \n\nSo now we can multiply the number of ways we can get each number to get the total number of ways we can get $abc = 180$. This will be $36 * 36 * 1 = 1296$.\n\nNow we need to find the total number of ways we can roll three dice, which is $6 * 6 * 6 = 216$.\n\nSo the probability of getting $abc = 180$ is $\\frac{1296}{216} = \\frac{6}{1} = \\boxed{6}$.",
