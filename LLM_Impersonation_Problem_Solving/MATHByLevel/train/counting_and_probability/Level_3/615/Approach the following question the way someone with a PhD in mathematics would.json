    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many even three digit numbers are there such that the sum of the  tens and units digits is 10?",
    "solution": "There are nine possible digits that the hundreds digit could be. However, there are only four possible endings for the number: 46, 64, 28, and 82. Thus, there are $9 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{36}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's denote the tens digit as T and the units digit as U. We are looking for even three-digit numbers where T+U=10 and the number is divisible by 2. \n\nSince the number is even, the units digit U must be even. Thus, U can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. \n\nIf U=0, then T=10. But since T must be a digit, T cannot be 10. So U cannot be 0.\n\nIf U=2, then T=8. This gives us the number 820.\n\nIf U=4, then T=6. This gives us the number 640.\n\nIf U=6, then T=4. This gives us the number 460.\n\nIf U=8, then T=2. This gives us the number 280.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 4 even three-digit numbers such that the sum of the tens and units digits is 10.",
