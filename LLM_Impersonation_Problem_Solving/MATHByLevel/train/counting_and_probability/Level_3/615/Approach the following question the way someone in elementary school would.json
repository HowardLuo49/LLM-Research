    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many even three digit numbers are there such that the sum of the  tens and units digits is 10?",
    "solution": "There are nine possible digits that the hundreds digit could be. However, there are only four possible endings for the number: 46, 64, 28, and 82. Thus, there are $9 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{36}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the even three-digit numbers where the sum of the tens and units digits is 10. \n\nFirst, we know that the hundreds digit can be any number from 1 to 9 because we want a three-digit number.\n\nNext, we need to find the possible combinations of the tens and units digits that add up to 10:\n- 1 and 9\n- 2 and 8\n- 3 and 7\n- 4 and 6\n- 5 and 5\n- 6 and 4\n- 7 and 3\n- 8 and 2\n- 9 and 1\n\nSo there are 9 different combinations for the tens and units digits that add up to 10.\n\nSince we are looking for even numbers, the units digit must be either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nTherefore, we have 9 combinations for the tens and units digits, and for each combination, there are 5 possible units digits.\n\nSo the total number of even three-digit numbers where the sum of the tens and units digits is 10 is 9 (combinations) x 5 (units digits) = 45. \n\nTherefore, there are 45 even three-digit numbers that meet the criteria.",
