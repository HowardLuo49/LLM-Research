    "gpt_response": "Let's count the ways to put the balls into the boxes! We can put all 4 balls in one box, or we can put 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other box. Or we can put 2 balls in each box. And finally, we can put 1 ball in one box and 3 balls in the other box. So there are 4 different ways to put the balls into the boxes! Yay!",

We can put all 4 balls in one box, or we can put 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other box. Or we can put 2 balls in each box.
