    "solution": "In this problem, we only need to count the number of ways to split 4 items into two groups.  There are only 3 ways: $\\{4,0\\}$, $\\{3,1\\}$ and $\\{2,2\\}$.  Therefore, there are only $\\boxed{3}$ ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls in 2 indistinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about it like this, you have 4 balls and 2 boxes. You can put all 4 balls in one box or you can put 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other box. So there are 2 ways to put the balls into the boxes!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: Let's think about it like this, you have 4 balls and 2 boxes. You can put all 4 balls in one box or you can put 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other box. So there are 2 ways to put the balls into the boxes!",
