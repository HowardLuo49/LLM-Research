    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of different starting lineups for the Grunters, we first need to consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 players from the 10 non-All-Star players. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of players to choose from and r is the number of players to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (10 non-All-Star players) and r = 3 (3 players to choose). Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\n= 10! / (3! * 7!)\n= (10*9*8) / (3*2*1)\n= 120\n\nTherefore, there are 120 different starting lineups possible for the Grunters, given that Ace and Zeppo are already in the lineup.",
