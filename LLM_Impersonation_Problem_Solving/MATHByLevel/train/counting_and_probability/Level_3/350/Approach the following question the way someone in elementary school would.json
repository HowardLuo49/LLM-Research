    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many three-digit numbers have no 7's or 9's, let's break it down. There are 10 different digits we can use (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) since we can't use 7 or 9. \n\nFor the hundreds place, we have 8 options (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8), for the tens place, we also have 8 options, and for the ones place, we also have 8 options. To find out how many total numbers that is, we can multiply those options: 8 x 8 x 8 = 512.\n\nSo, there are 512 three-digit numbers that have no 7's or 9's as digits. Yay!",
