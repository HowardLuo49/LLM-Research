    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count all the numbers that don't have the numbers 7 and 9 in them. We can start with the hundreds place, it can be any number from 1 to 6, because we don't want any number 7 or 9. Then for the tens and ones place, they can be any number from 0 to 9 except 7 or 9. So we have 6 choices for the hundreds place, and 8 choices for the tens and ones places. \n\nTo get the total number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits, we just multiply these choices together: 6 x 8 x 8 = 384. So there are 384 three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits. Yay!",
