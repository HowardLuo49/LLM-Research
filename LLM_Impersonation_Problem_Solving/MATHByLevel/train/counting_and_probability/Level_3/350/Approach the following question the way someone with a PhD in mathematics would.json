    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits, we must first consider the possible combinations for each digit in the number.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, since we cannot have a 7 or a 9, we have 8 options (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0).\n\nFor the tens digit and units digit, we have 8 options each (0-6, 8). This is because we still have to exclude 7 and 9, as well as the digit chosen for the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits is 8 * 8 * 8 = 512. \n\nThus, there are 512 three-digit whole numbers that satisfy this condition.",
