    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits?",
    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, let's break it down into smaller steps. \n\nFirst, let's think about how many options we have for each digit in the three-digit number. Since we can't have 7's or 9's in any of the digits, we have 8 options for each digit from 0 to 6 and 8 to 8.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, we have 8 options. For the tens place, we also have 8 options. And for the ones place, we have 8 options.\n\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits, we multiply the number of options for each digit together: 8 * 8 * 8 = 512. \n\nTherefore, there are 512 three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits.",
