If there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, 6 students with blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes, how many students have blue eyes?",
    "solution": "Let the number of blue-eyed students be $x$, so the number of blond students is $2x$.  Since the number of blue-eyed blond students is $6$, the number of blue-eyed non-blond students is $x - 6$, while the number of blond non-blue-eyed students is $2x - 6$.  Since the number of non-blue-eyed non-blond students is $3$, we can add up these four exclusive categories (blond blue-eyed, blond non-blue-eyed, etc.) to sum to 30 students in the class.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Blue eyes\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Blond hair\", (80,74));\nlabel(\"Neither: 3\", (44,10));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$6$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$x-6$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x-6$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nSo $(x - 6) + (2x - 6) + 6 + 3 = 30$ and $x = \\boxed{11}$, which is the number of blue-eyed students.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this down. We know that there are 30 students in total. We also know that there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes. So if we call the number of students with blue eyes \"x\", then the number of students with blond hair would be 2x.\n\nWe also are given that there are 6 students with both blond hair and blue eyes. This means that out of the 2x students with blond hair, 6 of them also have blue eyes. So 2x - 6 students with blond hair do not have blue eyes.\n\nLastly, we are told that there are 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes. This means that out of the total 30 students, x (students with blue eyes) + (2x - 6) (students with blond hair but not blue eyes) + 3 (students with neither) adds up to 30.\n\nNow we can use this information to solve for x:\n\nx + 2x - 6 + 3 = 30\n3x - 3 = 30\n3x = 33\nx = 11\n\nSo there are 11 students in Mrs. Taylor's kindergarten class that have blue eyes.",
