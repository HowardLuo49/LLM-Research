I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose a letter for the first character. There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so there are 26 ways to choose the first character.\n\nStep 2: Choose a character for the middle character. The middle character can be a letter (26 choices) or a digit (10 choices), so there are 36 choices for the middle character.\n\nStep 3: Since we want the last character to be the same as one of the first two characters, there are 2 choices for the last character.\n\nMultiplying the number of choices for each step together, we get:\n26 (choices for the first character) x 36 (choices for the middle character) x 2 (choices for the last character) = 1,872\n\nSo, there are 1,872 ways for you to choose a license plate with these restrictions.",
