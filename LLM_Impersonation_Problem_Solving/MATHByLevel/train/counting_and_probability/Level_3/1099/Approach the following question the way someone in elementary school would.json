    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! First, we need to choose a letter for the first character. There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so we have 26 options for that. Next, we need to choose a letter or digit for the middle character. Since it can be either a letter or a digit, we have 26 letters + 10 digits to choose from, making a total of 36 options. Finally, we need to choose a digit for the last character. There are 10 digits to choose from for that. \n\nTo find out how many ways we can choose a license plate with these restrictions, we multiply the number of options for each character: 26 * 36 * 10 = 9,360 ways to choose a license plate with these restrictions. Wow, that's a lot of options!",
