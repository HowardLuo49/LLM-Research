    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into separate cases.\n\nCase 1: The middle character is the same as the first character.\nIn this case, we have 26 choices for the first character (26 letters), 1 choice for the middle character (since it must be the same as the first character), and 10 choices for the last character (10 digits). This gives us a total of 26 * 1 * 10 = 260 possible license plates.\n\nCase 2: The middle character is the same as the last character.\nIn this case, we have 26 choices for the first character, 10 choices for the middle character, and 1 choice for the last character. This gives us a total of 26 * 10 * 1 = 260 possible license plates.\n\nAdding up the results from Case 1 and Case 2, we get a total of 520 possible license plates that meet the given restrictions.",
