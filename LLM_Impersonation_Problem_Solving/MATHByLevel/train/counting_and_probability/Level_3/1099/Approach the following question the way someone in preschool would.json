I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. The first character can be any letter, so there are 26 choices for that. The middle character can be a letter or a digit, so there are 36 choices for that. And the last character must be a digit, so there are 10 choices for that. Since we want two of the characters to be the same, we can choose one of the characters to be the same and there are 3 ways to do that (the first and second character, the first and third character, or the second and third character). So the total number of ways to choose a license plate with these restrictions is 26 * 36 * 10 * 3 = 28,080 ways. Wow, that's a lot of different license plates to choose from!",
