A certain coin is weighted such that the chance of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the chance of flipping tails is $\\frac{2}{3}$.  Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/3$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $2/3$ chance of getting tails and losing 2 dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{3}(\\$3) + \\frac{2}{3}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of flipping tails is $\\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nIf we win $\\$3$ for flipping heads and lose $\\$2$ for flipping tails, the expected value is:\n$$E = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot (-2)\\right)$$\n$$E = 1 - \\frac{4}{3}$$\n$$E = \\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{4}{3}$$\n$$E = -\\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nSo, the expected value of our winnings after one flip is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ dollars.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to -\\frac{1?: Ok, so the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of flipping tails is $\\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nIf we win $\\$3$ for flipping heads and lose $\\$2$ for flipping tails, the expected value is:\n$$E = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot (-2)\\right)$$\n$$E = 1 - \\frac{4}{3}$$\n$$E = \\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{4}{3}$$\n$$E = -\\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nSo, the expected value of our winnings after one flip is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ dollars.",
