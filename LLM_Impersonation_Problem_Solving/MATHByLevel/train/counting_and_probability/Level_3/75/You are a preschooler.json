Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/3$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $2/3$ chance of getting tails and losing 2 dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{3}(\\$3) + \\frac{2}{3}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
