    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A certain coin is weighted such that the chance of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the chance of flipping tails is $\\frac{2}{3}$.  Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/3$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $2/3$ chance of getting tails and losing 2 dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{3}(\\$3) + \\frac{2}{3}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If we flip a heads, we get $\\$3$! Yay! But if we flip tails, we lose $\\$2$. Boo! Since we have a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance of flipping heads and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of flipping tails, we need to find the average value of our winnings.\n\nTo do this, we multiply the value of each outcome by its probability and add them together. \n\nOur expected value is: \n\n$\\left(\\$3 \\times \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(-\\$2 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\\right)$\n\nThis simplifies to: \n\n$\\frac{\\$3}{3} - \\frac{\\$4}{3} = \\frac{\\$3 - \\$4}{3} = -\\frac{\\$1}{3}$\n\nSo, our expected value, in dollars, after one flip is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$ dollars.
