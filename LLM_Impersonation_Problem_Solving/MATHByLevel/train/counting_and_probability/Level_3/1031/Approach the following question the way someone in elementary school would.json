    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Jason is trying to remember the five digit combination to his safe.  He knows that he only used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that every even digit was followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit was followed by an even digit.  How many possible combinations does Jason need to try?",
    "solution": "Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even.  If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit.  Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit.  Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on.  This would be a total of: $$3\\times2\\times3\\times2\\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit.  There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\\times3\\times2\\times3\\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\\boxed{180}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Jason has a safe and he needs to remember a five digit code with digits 1 through 5. If he always has an even digit followed by an odd digit, and an odd digit followed by an even digit, we can break it down like this:\n\n- If Jason starts with an even digit, he can choose from 2 or 4. Then he needs to follow it with an odd digit, so he can choose from 1, 3, or 5.\n- If Jason starts with an odd digit, he can choose from 1, 3, or 5. Then he needs to follow it with an even digit, so he can choose from 2 or 4.\n\nSo, for each digit Jason picks, he has a choice between two options: even followed by an odd, or odd followed by an even. Therefore, Jason needs to try 2 choices for each of the 5 digits in his code. \n\nTo calculate the total number of combinations, we simply multiply these choices together: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32. \n\nJason needs to try 32 possible combinations to figure out his five digit code. Good luck, Jason!",
