    "solution": "For positive integers $n$ greater than 4, $n!$ is divisible by 15.  Therefore, all the terms beyond $1!+2!+3!+4!$ do not affect the remainder of the sum when it is divided by 15.  The remainder when $1!+2!+3!+4!=33$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{3}$.",

That's what we use when we talk about factorials! \n\nSo $1!$ just means $1$, because the factorial of $1$ is $1$.  \nAnd $2!$ is $2 \\times 1 = 2$. \nAnd $3!$ is $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$. \n  \nI'm not sure what the rest are but we can use a calculator to figure them out.\n\nThen, we can add up all the numbers we find and divide the sum by $15$ to see what the remainder is.
