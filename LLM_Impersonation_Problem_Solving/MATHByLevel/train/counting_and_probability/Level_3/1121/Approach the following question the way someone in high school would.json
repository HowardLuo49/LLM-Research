    "solution": "For positive integers $n$ greater than 4, $n!$ is divisible by 15.  Therefore, all the terms beyond $1!+2!+3!+4!$ do not affect the remainder of the sum when it is divided by 15.  The remainder when $1!+2!+3!+4!=33$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hey guys, so we have to find the sum of $1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 49! + 50!$ and then divide that sum by $15$. \n\nFirst, let's find the sum of those factorials. We can start by calculating each of them:\n\n$1! = 1$\n$2! = 2$\n$3! = 6$\n...\n$49! = 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times \\cdots \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n$50! = 50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times \\cdots \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$\n\nThis will take a really long time to calculate all of them, so there must be a shortcut. Let's see if we can find a pattern.\n\nHmm, let's notice that $n!$ is $n$ times $(n-1)!$. So, if we find a way to calculate $(n-1)!$ for each $n$ from 1 to 50, we can easily calculate $n!$ without having to multiply all the numbers.\n\nAfter calculating those factorials, we add them up and divide by 15. Let's give it a try and see what we get!\n\nGood luck, guys!\u90ce",
