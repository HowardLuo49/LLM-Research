    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Alice and Bob play a game with a baseball. On each turn, if Alice has the ball, there is a 1/2 chance that she will toss it to Bob and a 1/2 chance that she will keep the ball. If Bob has the ball, there is a 2/5 chance that he will toss it to Alice, and if he doesn't toss it to Alice, he keeps it. Alice starts with the ball. What is the probability that Alice has the ball again after two turns?",
    "solution": "We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. If Alice tosses the baseball to Bob on the first turn, there is a 2/5 chance that Bob will toss it back to her on the next turn. On the other hand, if Alice keeps the baseball on the first turn, there is a 1/2 chance that she will also keep it on the second turn. The total probability is then $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{20}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to consider all the possible outcomes of the game. \n\nLet's start with Alice having the ball. If she tosses it to Bob, then Bob will have the ball and he will either toss it back to Alice or keep it. If he tosses it back to Alice, then Alice will have the ball again. \n\nIf Alice doesn't toss the ball, she will keep it and have it again. \n\nSo, the probability that Alice has the ball again after two turns is the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes:\n\n1/2 (Alice tosses to Bob) * 2/5 (Bob tosses back to Alice) = 1/5\n\n1/2 (Alice tosses to Bob) * 3/5 (Bob keeps it) = 3/10\n\n1/2 (Alice keeps the ball) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability that Alice has the ball again after two turns is 1/5 + 3/10 + 1/2 = 9/10.",
