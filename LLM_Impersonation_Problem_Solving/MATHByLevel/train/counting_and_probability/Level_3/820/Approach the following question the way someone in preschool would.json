    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Two different  numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. What is the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive. There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total. So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{15}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",

Now we need to find out the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is 2 or greater. \n\nWe can start by listing out all the pairs of numbers that have a positive difference of 2 or more:\n\n- (1, 3)\n- (1, 4)\n- (1, 5)\n- (1, 6)\n- (1, 7)\n- (2, 4)\n- (2, 5)\n- (2, 6)\n- (2, 7)\n- (3, 5)\n- (3, 6)\n- (3, 7)\n- (4, 6)\n- (4, 7)\n- (5, 7)\n\nThere are 15 pairs that satisfy the condition out of a total of $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ possible pairs we can pick.
