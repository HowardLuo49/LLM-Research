Two different  numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. What is the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive. There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total. So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{15}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater, we first need to determine the total number of ways two numbers can be selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. This can be done using combinations, specifically ${7 \\choose 2}$, which is equal to $\\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = 21$.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater. This can be done by considering the possible pairs of numbers that satisfy this condition. These are: $(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)$, $(3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7), (5,7)$. There are $15$ such pairs.\n\nTherefore, the probability is given by $\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$. Hence, the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater is $\\frac{5}{7}$.",
