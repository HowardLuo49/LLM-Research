    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to think about the different possibilities of side lengths for a triangle with a perimeter of 7. Since the side lengths must be integers and the perimeter is 7, we can start by considering the smallest possible side lengths for the triangle.\n\nThe smallest possible side length for a triangle with a perimeter of 7 is 1. In this case, the other two sides must add up to 6. Since the side lengths must be integers, the possibilities are (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 3).\n\nNext, we can consider a triangle with a side length of 2. In this case, the other two sides must add up to 5. The only possibility for integer side lengths is (2, 3, 2).\n\nLastly, we can consider a triangle with a side length of 3. In this case, the other two sides must add up to 4. The only possibility for integer side lengths is (3, 1, 3).\n\nTherefore, there are 3 non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 and integer side lengths: (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 3), and (2, 3, 2).",
