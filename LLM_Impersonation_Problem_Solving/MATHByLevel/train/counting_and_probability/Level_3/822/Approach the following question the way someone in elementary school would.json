    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 have integer side lengths, we can try out different combinations of integers until we find all the possibilities. \n\nLet's start with triangles with sides of length 1, 2, and 4. This adds up to a perimeter of 7, so this is one possibility. \n\nNext, we can try triangles with sides of length 2, 2, and 3. This also adds up to a perimeter of 7, so this is another possibility. \n\nLastly, we can try triangles with sides of length 1, 3, and 3. Again, this adds up to a perimeter of 7, so this is a third possibility. \n\nSo, in total, there are three non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 and integer side lengths.",
