    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the concept of a non-congruent triangle. Two triangles are considered congruent if they have the same size and shape. Therefore, non-congruent triangles are triangles that have different sizes and shapes.\n\nNext, we should consider the properties of triangles in terms of side lengths and perimeter. The perimeter of a triangle is defined as the sum of the lengths of its three sides. In this problem, we are given that the perimeter of the triangle is 7 units.\n\nTo find the number of non-congruent triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 7, we can consider the possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the given conditions. Since the triangle is non-congruent, the side lengths must be distinct and form a unique triangle.\n\nWe can start by considering the smallest possible side length for the triangle. Since the side lengths must be integers, the smallest possible side length is 1 unit. The next smallest side length can be 2 units, leaving 4 units for the third side to maintain a perimeter of 7 units.\n\nFrom here, we can consider the possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the conditions of forming a triangle with a perimeter of 7 units. By considering the properties of triangles, we can determine the unique combinations of side lengths that form non-congruent triangles.\n\nTherefore, a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics would approach this problem by systematically analyzing the properties of triangles and side lengths, considering all possible combinations, and applying mathematical principles to determine the number of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 and integer side lengths.",
