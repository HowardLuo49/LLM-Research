    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the ways we can get an odd number when we roll a die. The odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. \n\nOut of the six faces on the die, three of them are odd and three of them are even. So, when we roll the die once, the probability of getting an odd number is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1 out of 2.\n\nIf we roll the die six times, the probability of getting an odd number each time is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/64.\n\nSo, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 1/64.",
