    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to know that the numbers on a standard die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\nTo find the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd, we need to think about what happens when we multiply numbers together. When we multiply numbers together, if one of them is odd, then the product will also be odd. \n\nSince we want the product to be odd, we need to make sure that at least one of the numbers rolled is odd. From the numbers on the die, 1, 3, and 5 are odd numbers.\n\nSo, to find the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd, we need to find the probability of rolling an odd number at least once in six rolls.\n\nThere are a total of 6 rolls, and for each roll, there are 3 odd numbers and 3 even numbers. So the probability of rolling an odd number is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nTo find the probability of rolling an odd number at least once in six rolls, we can subtract the probability of not rolling an odd number at all from 1.\n\nThe probability of not rolling an odd number at all in six rolls is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling an odd number at least once in six rolls is 1 - 1/64 = 63/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 63/64.",
