    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, we need to figure out the probability of rolling an odd number on a standard die. Since there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an odd number is 3/6 or 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of the product of all six rolls being odd. Since we have to roll the die six times, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number each time. \n\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) \n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n1/64\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 1/64.",
