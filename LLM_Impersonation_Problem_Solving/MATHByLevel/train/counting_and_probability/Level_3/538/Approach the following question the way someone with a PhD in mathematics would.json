    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the outcome of each roll as a number from 1 to 6. In order to find the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd, we need to consider the possible combinations of odd and even numbers rolled.\n\nFor the product of all six rolls to be odd, each individual roll must be odd. Since an odd number multiplied by an odd number is always odd, we must consider the case where all six rolls result in odd numbers.\n\nThe probability of rolling an odd number on a standard six-sided die is 3/6 = 1/2. Since each roll is independent, the probability of rolling an odd number on all six rolls is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 1/64.",
