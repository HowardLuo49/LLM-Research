    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",

Since each roll has 6 possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes is 6^6 = 46656. \\n\\nNext, let's consider what makes a product odd. For a product to be odd, all the factors must be odd. Since the numbers on a standard die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we can see that only the odd numbers (1, 3, 5) will result in an odd product. \\n\\nWe need all six rolls to be odd in order to get an odd product. So the probability of rolling an odd number on one roll is 3/6 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd product on one roll is (1/2)^6 = 1/64. \\n\\nSo the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 1/64.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180779, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=232, prompt_tokens=43, total_tokens=275))",
