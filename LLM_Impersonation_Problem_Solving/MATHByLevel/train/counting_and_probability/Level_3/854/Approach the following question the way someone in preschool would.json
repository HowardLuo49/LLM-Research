    "solution": "None of $a,b,c$ are equal to 1 if and only if $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$. $a,b,c$ can only be $2,3,4,5,6$. The probability of this is $\\frac{5^3}{6^3}=\\boxed{\\frac{125}{216}}$.",

There are 6 possible numbers on each die, so there are $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$ different outcomes when we roll three dice. \n\nNow, let's think about the numbers we rolled. We got a 5, a 4, and a 2. We can see that none of these numbers are equal to 1, so the event that $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$ happened for this particular outcome. \n\nSo, in order to find the probability that this event happens, we need to find the number of outcomes where at least one of the numbers rolled is 1, and then subtract that from the total number of outcomes.\n\nLet's think about all the ways that at least one of the numbers can be 1:\n\n- One of the numbers is 1: There are 3 ways this can happen (1,2,2; 2,1,2; 2,2,1)\n- Two of the numbers are 1: There are 3 ways this can happen (1,1,2; 1,2,1; 2,1,1)\n- All three numbers are 1: There is 1 way this can happen (1,1,1)\n\nAdding all of these up, we have a total of 7 outcomes where at least one of the numbers is 1. \n\nTherefore, the probability that $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$ is $\\frac{216-7}{216} = \\frac{209}{216}$.
