    "solution": "None of $a,b,c$ are equal to 1 if and only if $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$. $a,b,c$ can only be $2,3,4,5,6$. The probability of this is $\\frac{5^3}{6^3}=\\boxed{\\frac{125}{216}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so when we roll three dice, we can get numbers from 1 to 6 on each die. Let's think about what it means for $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)$ to not be equal to 0. This means that none of the numbers minus 1 are equal to 0.\n\nIf $a$ is not 1, then $(a-1)$ will not be 0. The same goes for $b$ and $c$. So we need to find the probability that none of the numbers are 1 when we roll the dice.\n\nThere are a total of $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$ possible outcomes when we roll three dice. \n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where none of the numbers are 1. For each die, there are 5 outcomes where the number is not 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). So the number of outcomes where $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$ is $\\frac{125}{216}$.",
