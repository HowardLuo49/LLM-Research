    "solution": "If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not. So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, first we need to add the odds together: $3 + 4 = 7.$\n\nThen we can find the probability of not pulling the prize by dividing the number of ways to not pull the prize by the total number of ways: $4/7.$\n\nSo the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{4/7}.$",
