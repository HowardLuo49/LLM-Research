    "solution": "If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not. So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, we need to first find the probability of pulling the prize out of the box. The odds given are $3:4$, which means there are 3 favorable outcomes for pulling the prize out of the box and 4 total outcomes.\n\nSo, the probability of pulling the prize out of the box is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nTo find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, we subtract the probability of pulling the prize out of the box from 1 (since the sum of all possible outcomes must equal 1).\n\nTherefore, the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nSo, the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\frac{1}{4}$.",
