    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, what is the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not. So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, we first need to understand that the odds $a:b$ can be translated to the probability $P$ as follows:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{b}{a+b}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the odds are $3:4$, so $a = 3$ and $b = 4$. Therefore, the probability of pulling the prize out of the box is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{4}{3+4} = \\frac{4}{7}\n\\]\n\nSince we want to find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, we subtract this probability from 1:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{not pulling prize out}) = 1 - P = 1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\frac{3}{7}$.",
