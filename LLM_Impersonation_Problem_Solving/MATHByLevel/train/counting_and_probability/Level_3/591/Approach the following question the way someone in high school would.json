    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A club has $5$ members from each of $3$ different schools, for a total of $15$ members. How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
    "solution": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of ways to arrange the presidency meeting according to the given conditions, we need to break it down into steps.\n\nStep 1: Choose the hosting school\nThere are $3$ schools to choose from to host the meeting, so there are $3$ ways to pick the hosting school.\n\nStep 2: Choose the $2$ representatives from the hosting school\nSince the hosting school sends $2$ representatives, we need to choose $2$ members from the pool of $5$ members at that school. This can be done in $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways.\n\nStep 3: Choose the $1$ representative from each of the other two schools\nFor the remaining $4$ members, $2$ from each of the other two schools, we need to select $1$ member from each school. This can be done in $\\binom{5}{1} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1} = 5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ ways.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the number of ways from each step to find the total number of arrangements\nTo find the total number of arrangements that satisfy the given conditions, we multiply the number of ways from each step: $3 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 25 = 750$.\n\nTherefore, there are $750$ possible ways to arrange the presidency meeting according to the given conditions.",
