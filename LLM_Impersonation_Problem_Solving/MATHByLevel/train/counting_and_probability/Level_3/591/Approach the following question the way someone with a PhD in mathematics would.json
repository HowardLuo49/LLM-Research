    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A club has $5$ members from each of $3$ different schools, for a total of $15$ members. How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
    "solution": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: \n \n1. Choosing the school to host the meeting: Since there are $3$ schools, there are $3$ ways to choose the school to host the meeting. \n \n2. Selecting the representatives: \n- For the school hosting the meeting, there are ${5 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose the $2$ representatives. \n- For the other two schools, there are ${5 \\choose 1}$ ways to choose $1$ representative from each school. \n \nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the presidency meeting is: \n$$\n3 \\times {5 \\choose 2} \\times {5 \\choose 1} \\times {5 \\choose 1} = 3 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 750\n$$ \n\nSo, there are $750$ possible ways to arrange the presidency meeting under the given conditions.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 750?: To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: \n \n1.
