    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many combinations of pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents) and/or dimes (10 cents) are there with a total value of 25 cents?",
    "solution": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use generating functions. Let's represent the number of ways to obtain a total value of 25 cents using pennies, nickels, and dimes as the coefficient of x^25 in the expansion of the generating function:\n\nF(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...)(1 + x^5 + x^10 + x^15 + ...)(1 + x^10 + x^20 + ...)\n\nMultiplying out the generating function gives us:\n\nF(x) = (1 + x + x^2 + ...)(1 + x^5 + x^10 + ...)(1 + x^10 + ...)\n\nExpanding this out and looking at the coefficient of x^25 gives us the number of ways to make 25 cents using pennies, nickels, and dimes.\n\nThis approach allows us to systematically count the number of combinations without manually listing out each possibility.",
