    "solution": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations.",

Let's denote the number of pennies as p, nickels as n, and dimes as d. We have the following constraints:\\n\\n1. 1p + 5n + 10d = 25 (total value is 25 cents)\\n2. p, n, d >= 0 (non-negative integer values only)\\n\\nSolving these constraints will give us all possible combinations of pennies, nickels, and dimes that sum up to 25 cents.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180280, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=214, prompt_tokens=49, total_tokens=263))",
