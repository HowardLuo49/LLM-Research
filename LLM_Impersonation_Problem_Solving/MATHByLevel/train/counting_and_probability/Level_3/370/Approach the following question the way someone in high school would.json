    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many combinations of pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents) and/or dimes (10 cents) are there with a total value of 25 cents?",
    "solution": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, it's important to think about how each coin can contribute to the total value. Since the total value needs to be 25 cents, we can start by figuring out how many dimes could be included in a combination. If we have 0 dimes, we would need 0 nickels and 25 pennies to make a total of 25 cents. If we have 1 dime, we would need 0 nickels and 15 pennies. If we have 2 dimes, we would need 0 nickels and 5 pennies. Finally, if we have 3 dimes, we would need 0 nickels and 0 pennies.\n\nNow, let's think about combinations including nickels. If we have 0 dimes and 1 nickel, we would need 20 pennies. If we have 1 dime and 1 nickel, we would need 15 pennies. And if we have 2 dimes and 1 nickel, we would only need 5 pennies.\n\nThere are no combinations with dimes and nickels that would result in a total of 25 cents because the total value would exceed 25 cents.\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations of pennies, nickels, and dimes with a total value of 25 cents is 4.",
