    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Container I holds 8 red balls and 4 green balls; containers II and III each hold 2 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container I, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$ probability for a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ probability of getting green from Container I. Similarly for container II the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{9}$, and the same for container III. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we have to find out the chance of picking a green ball. Let's count the total number of green balls and balls altogether in each container.\n\nContainer I:\nTotal balls = 8 red + 4 green = 12 balls\nTotal green balls = 4 green balls\n\nContainers II and III:\nTotal balls = 2 red + 4 green = 6 balls\nTotal green balls = 4 green balls\n\nNow let's add up all the green balls from all containers:\nTotal green balls = 4 green balls + 4 green balls = 8 green balls\n\nSo the total number of green balls out of all the balls is 8 green balls + 8 red balls = 16 balls.\n\nNow we have to find the probability of picking a green ball. To do that, we take the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls:\nProbability = Total green balls / Total balls\nProbability = 16 green balls / 30 total balls\n\nSo the probability of picking a green ball is 16/30, which can be simplified to 8/15. Yay, we did it!",
