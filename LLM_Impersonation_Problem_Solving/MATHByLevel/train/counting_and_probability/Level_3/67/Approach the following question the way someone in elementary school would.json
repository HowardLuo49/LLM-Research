    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Container I holds 8 red balls and 4 green balls; containers II and III each hold 2 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container I, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$ probability for a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ probability of getting green from Container I. Similarly for container II the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{9}$, and the same for container III. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to find out how many green balls are in each container. In container I, there are 4 green balls out of 12 total balls. That means the probability of selecting a green ball from container I is 4/12, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nIn containers II and III, there are also 4 green balls out of 6 total balls. That means the probability of selecting a green ball from either container II or III is 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3.\n\nNow we need to find the overall probability of selecting a green ball. We can do this by adding the probabilities of selecting a green ball from each container and then dividing by the total number of containers.\n\n(1/3 + 2/3) / 3 = 3/3 / 3 = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a green ball is 1/3.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{5?: Ok, so first we need to find out how many green balls are in each container.
