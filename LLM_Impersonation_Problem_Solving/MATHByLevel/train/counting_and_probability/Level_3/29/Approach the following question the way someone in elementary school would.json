    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we have the letters A, B, C, D, and E. We need to make 4-letter words with at least one vowel. \n\nFirst, let's find out how many words can be made without any vowels. That would be choosing from the consonants B, C, and D. So, we have 3 choices for each of the 4 letters, giving us 3^4 = 81 words.\n\nNow, let's find out how many words can be made with at least one vowel. \n\nTo find the total number of 4-letter words we can make using any of the 5 given letters (A, B, C, D, E) without restriction, it would be 5 choices for each of the 4 letters, giving us 5^4 = 625 words.\n\nNow, we can subtract the number of words without any vowels from the total number of words to find the number of words with at least one vowel.\n\n625 - 81 = 544\n\nSo, there are 544 4-letter words with at least one vowel that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E.",
