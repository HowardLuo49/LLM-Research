    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can divide it into cases based on the number of vowels in the 4-letter word.\n\nCase 1: 1 Vowel\nThere are 2 vowels (A and E) to choose from and 3 consonants (B, C, and D). So, the number of ways to construct a 4-letter word with exactly 1 vowel is 2 * 3^3 = 54.\n\nCase 2: 2 Vowels\nThere are 2 ways to choose the placement of the vowels in the word (VVCC, VCV, or CVC). There are (2 choose 2) = 1 way to choose which vowels to use, and (3 choose 2) = 3 ways to choose which consonants to use. Therefore, the number of ways to construct a 4-letter word with exactly 2 vowels is 2 * 1 * 3 = 6.\n\nCase 3: 3 Vowels\nThere is only 1 way to choose the placement of the vowels in the word (VVVC or VCVC). There are (2 choose 3) = 0 ways to choose which vowels to use, and (3 choose 3) = 1 way to choose which consonant to use. Therefore, the number of ways to construct a 4-letter word with exactly 3 vowels is 1 * 0 * 1 = 0.\n\nCase 4: 4 Vowels\nThere is only 1 way to choose the placement of the vowels in the word (VVVV). There are (2 choose 4) = 0 ways to choose which vowels to use, and (3 choose 4) = 0 ways to choose consonants to use. Therefore, the number of ways to construct a 4-letter word with exactly 4 vowels is 1 * 0 * 0 = 0.\n\nIn total, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E is 54 (from Case 1) + 6 (from Case 2) = 60.",
