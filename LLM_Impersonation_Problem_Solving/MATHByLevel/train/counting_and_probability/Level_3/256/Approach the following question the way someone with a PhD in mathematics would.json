    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle would be the first four-digit number that appears in the triangle itself. To find this, we need to calculate the numbers in Pascal's triangle until we reach the first four-digit number.\n\nThe first few rows of Pascal's triangle are as follows:\n1\n1 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 6 4 1\n1 5 10 10 5 1\n\nContinuing to calculate the numbers in Pascal's triangle, we find that the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is 715, which appears in the sixth row. Thus, the answer is 715.",
