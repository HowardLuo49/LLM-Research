    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle, we need to look for a number that is greater than 1000 but smaller than all other four-digit numbers in the triangle.\n\nLet's start by looking at the first few rows of Pascal's triangle:\n\n1\n1 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 6 4 1\n1 5 10 10 5 1\n...\n\nWe can see that the first four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is 1001, which is greater than 1000. So, the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is 1001.",
