    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",

We have to find the second smallest four-digit number in that triangle. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, so the next smallest one must be 1001! Yay, we did it!",
