    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no zero as a digit can have for each of its five digits anything from 1 through 9 inclusive. There are $9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9=59,\\!049$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero as a digit is  $90,\\!000-59,\\!049=\\boxed{30,951}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many 5-digit numbers have at least one zero, we need to look at all the different possibilities.\n\nFirst, we can start by thinking about how many choices we have for each digit in the 5-digit number. Since we want at least one zero in the number, we can have 9 choices for the first digit (because it can't be zero) and 10 choices for the remaining 4 digits (since they can be any number from 0 to 9).\n\nTo find the total number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero, we can calculate the number of possibilities for each digit in the number:\n\n9 choices for the first digit * 10 choices for the remaining 4 digits = 9 * 10^4 = 90,000\n\nSo, there are a total of 90,000 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero.",
