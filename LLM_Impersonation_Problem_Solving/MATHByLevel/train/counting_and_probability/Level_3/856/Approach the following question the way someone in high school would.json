    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no zero as a digit can have for each of its five digits anything from 1 through 9 inclusive. There are $9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9=59,\\!049$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero as a digit is  $90,\\!000-59,\\!049=\\boxed{30,951}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we first need to determine how many 5-digit numbers there are in total. \n\nA 5-digit number can range from 10000 to 99999. To find the total possible 5-digit numbers, we can just subtract the smallest 5-digit number (10000) from the largest one (99999) and add 1:\n\n99999 - 10000 + 1 = 90000\n\nSo, there are 90000 total 5-digit numbers.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 5-digit numbers do not have any zeros. To form a 5-digit number without any zeros, each digit can be any number from 1-9. \n\nSo, there are 9 options for the first digit (since it can't be 0), then 9 options for the second digit, and so on. \n\nTherefore, the number of 5-digit numbers with no zeros is:\n\n9 x 9 x 9 x 9 x 9 = 59049\n\nFinally, to find the total number of 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero, we just need to subtract the number of 5-digit numbers with no zeros from the total:\n\n90000 - 59049 = 30951\n\nSo, there are 30951 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero.",
