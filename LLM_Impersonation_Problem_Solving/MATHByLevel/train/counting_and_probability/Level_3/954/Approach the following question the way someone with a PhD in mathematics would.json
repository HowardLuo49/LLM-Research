    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Tamika selects two different numbers at random from the set $\\{8,9,10\\}$ and adds them. Carlos takes two different numbers at random from the set $\\{3,5,6\\}$ and multiplies them. What is the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Tamika can get the numbers $8+9=17$, $8+10=18$, or $9+10=19$. Carlos can get $3\\times5=15$, $3\\times6=18$, or $5\\times6=30$. The possible ways to pair these are: $(17,15)$, $(17,18)$, $(17,30)$, $(18,15)$, $(18,18)$, $(18,30)$, $(19,15)$, $(19,18)$, $(19,30)$. Four of these nine pairs show Tamika with a higher result, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result, we must consider all possible pairs of numbers each could choose and compare the outcomes. \n\nTamika can choose any 2 numbers out of 3, which gives $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ possibilities. The sums of these pairs are 17, 18, and 19.\n\nCarlos can also choose any 2 numbers out of 3, giving $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ possibilities. The products of these pairs are 15, 18, and 30.\n\nNow we must compare the outcomes. Tamika's possible sums are greater than Carlos' possible products when the sums are 18 or 19. This gives us a total of 2 favorable outcomes.\n\nThe total number of outcomes is $3 \\times 3 = 9$ (since there are 3 choices for Tamika, and 3 choices for Carlos).\n\nTherefore, the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result is $\\frac{2}{9}$.",
