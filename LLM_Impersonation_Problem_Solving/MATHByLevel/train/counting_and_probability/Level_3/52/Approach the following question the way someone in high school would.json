    "solution": "$43$ appears in the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle, since $\\binom{43}{1} = 43$. Note that $43$ is prime, so the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $43$ is actually $43$. Therefore, the $43$rd row is the first row in which $43$ appears. Also note that all the other numbers in the $43$rd row are greater than $43$, with the exception of the $1$'s on the ends. As a result, all the numbers on the following rows will either be $1$ or greater than $43$, so $43$ only appears in the $43$rd row. Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ row of Pascal's Triangle contains the number $43$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of rows in Pascal's Triangle that contain the number $43$, we need to look for the row that has $43$ as one of the numbers. \n\nPascal's Triangle starts with a row of just 1. Then each subsequent row starts and ends with 1, and the numbers in between are found by adding the two numbers above and to the left and right.\n\nTo find $43$ in Pascal's Triangle, we can use the formula for the $n^{th}$ row of Pascal's Triangle, which is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the row number and $k$ is the position of the number in the row.\n\nLet's start by looking at the first few rows:\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 1 1\n- Row 3: 1 2 1\n- Row 4: 1 3 3 1\n\nWe can see that $43$ is not in the first few rows of Pascal's Triangle. \n\nTo calculate further rows, we can keep adding successive rows until we find $43$ in one of the rows.\n\nTherefore, we would need to continue calculating the rows of Pascal's Triangle until we find the row that contains the number $43$.",
