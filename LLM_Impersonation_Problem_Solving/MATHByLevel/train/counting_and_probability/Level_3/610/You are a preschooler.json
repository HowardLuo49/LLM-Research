    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",

Probability of drawing a 6 as the first card:\\nThere are 4 6s in a standard deck of 52 cards (one 6 in each suit). Therefore, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is 4/52 = 1/13.\\n\\n2.
