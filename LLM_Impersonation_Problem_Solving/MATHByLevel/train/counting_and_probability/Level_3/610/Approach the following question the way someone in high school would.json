    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of getting a 6 on the first card and a Queen on the second card.\n\nThere are 4 sixes in a standard deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing a 6 on the first card is 4/52.\n\nAfter drawing a 6, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, including 4 Queens. So the probability of drawing a Queen on the second card, given that a 6 was drawn first, is 4/51.\n\nTo find the overall probability of drawing a 6 and then a Queen, we multiply these probabilities together:\n\n(4/52) * (4/51) = 16/2652 \u2248 0.006\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a 6 on the first card and a Queen on the second card is approximately 0.006.",
