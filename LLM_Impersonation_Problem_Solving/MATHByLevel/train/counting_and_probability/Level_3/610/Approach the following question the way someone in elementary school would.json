    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many 6's are in a deck of cards. There is only one 6 of hearts and one 6 of clubs, so there are 2 6's in total in the deck.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many Queens are in a deck of cards. There are four Queens in total (one of each suit - hearts, clubs, spades, diamonds).\n\nSince there are 52 cards in a deck, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is 2/52 (since there are 2 6's in a deck of 52 cards).\n\nNow, if we draw a 6 as the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. The probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is 4/51 (since there are 4 Queens left in a deck of 51 cards).\n\nTo find the overall probability of drawing a 6 and then a Queen, we multiply the two probabilities together: (2/52) * (4/51) = 8/2652. \n\nSo, the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card and a Queen as the second card from a standard deck of 52 cards is 8/2652.",
