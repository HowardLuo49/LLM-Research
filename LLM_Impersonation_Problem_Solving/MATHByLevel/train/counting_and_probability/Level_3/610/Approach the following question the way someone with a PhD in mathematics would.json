Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first calculate the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card. There are 4 6's in a standard deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing a 6 as the first card is 4/52 or 1/13.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card. There are 4 Queens in a standard deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing a Queen as the second card is 4/51.\n\nSince these two events are independent (the outcome of drawing the first card does not affect the probability of drawing the second card), the overall probability of drawing a 6 as the first card and a Queen as the second card is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n(1/13) * (4/51) = 4/663.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen is 4/663.",
