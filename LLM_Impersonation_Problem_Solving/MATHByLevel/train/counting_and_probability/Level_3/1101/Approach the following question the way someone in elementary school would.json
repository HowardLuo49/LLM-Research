    "solution": "In eight of the twelve outcomes the product is even: $1\\times 2$, $2\\times\n1$, $2\\times 2$, $2\\times 3$, $3\\times 2$, $4\\times 1$, $4\\times 2$, $4\\times 3$. In four of the twelve, the product is odd: $1\\times 1$, $1\\times 3$, $3\\times 1$, $3\\times 3$. So the probability that the product is even is $\\frac{8}{12}$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\nOR\n\nTo get an odd product, the result of both spins must be odd. The probability of odd is $\\frac{1}{2}$ on Spinner $A$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ on Spinner $B$. So the probability of an odd product is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of an even product, then, is $1-\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

There are 2 even numbers on spinner A (2, 4) and 2 even numbers on spinner B (2, 3).\n\nIf we multiply an even number and any number, we always get an even number. So, there are 2 choices for spinner A and 3 choices for spinner B, which gives us a total of $2 \\times 3 = 6$ outcomes where the product is even.\n\nThe probability of the product being even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{6}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
