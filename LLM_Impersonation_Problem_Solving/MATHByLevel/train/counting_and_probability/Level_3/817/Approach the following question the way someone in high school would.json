    "solution": "Because the women are of different heights, any handshake will take place between two people, one of whom is taller than the other. Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself. Applying this logic to all of the pairs, there are $\\boxed{0}$ handshakes.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many handshakes took place at the party, we need to determine the number of possible pairs of women where one woman is taller than the other.\n\nLet's say the women are ranked from shortest to tallest (1-8). Woman 1 can only shake hands with women 2-8, woman 2 can only shake hands with women 3-8, and so on.\n\nSo, woman 1 can shake hands with 7 other women, woman 2 with 6 others, woman 3 with 5 others, and so on.\n\nThe total number of handshakes will be: 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, there were 28 handshakes at the party.",
