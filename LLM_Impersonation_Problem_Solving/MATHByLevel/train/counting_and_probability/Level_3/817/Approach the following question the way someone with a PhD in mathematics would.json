    "solution": "Because the women are of different heights, any handshake will take place between two people, one of whom is taller than the other. Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself. Applying this logic to all of the pairs, there are $\\boxed{0}$ handshakes.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. Let's label the women from 1 to 8 based on their heights, with woman 1 being the shortest and woman 8 being the tallest.\n\nSince each woman only shakes hands with women shorter than herself, woman 1 will not shake hands with anyone, woman 2 will shake hands with woman 1, woman 3 will shake hands with women 1 and 2, and so on.\n\nIn general, woman i will shake hands with women 1, 2, ..., i-1. Therefore, the total number of handshakes can be calculated by summing up the number of handshakes each woman participates in:\n\nNumber of handshakes = 0 (woman 1) + 1 (woman 2) + 2 (woman 3) + ... + 6 (woman 7) + 7 (woman 8)\n= 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7\n= 28\n\nTherefore, there will be a total of 28 handshakes taking place at the party.",
