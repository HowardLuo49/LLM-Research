    "solution": "Because the women are of different heights, any handshake will take place between two people, one of whom is taller than the other. Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself. Applying this logic to all of the pairs, there are $\\boxed{0}$ handshakes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the handshakes together with our fingers! If there are eight women, that means each woman will shake hands with seven other women because she won't shake hands with anyone taller than herself. So, if we count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 for each woman, we can see that there will be 7 handshakes for each woman. Since there are eight women at the party, we can multiply 7 by 8 to find out how many handshakes will take place in total. Let's count together... 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56! So, there will be 56 handshakes at the party. Yay, we did it!",
