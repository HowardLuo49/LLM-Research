    "solution": "Because the women are of different heights, any handshake will take place between two people, one of whom is taller than the other. Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself. Applying this logic to all of the pairs, there are $\\boxed{0}$ handshakes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, if there are 8 women and each woman only shakes hands with someone shorter than herself, that means the tallest woman won't shake hands with anyone. So, she won't have any handshakes.\n\nNext, the second tallest woman also won't shake hands with the tallest woman, but she will shake hands with the shortest woman. So, she will have 1 handshake.\n\nThe third tallest woman won't shake hands with the tallest or second tallest woman, but will shake hands with the shortest woman and the second shortest woman. So, she will have 2 handshakes.\n\nAnd so on...\n\nIf we keep going like this, we can figure out the number of handshakes for each woman. Then we can add them all up to find out the total number of handshakes at the party.",
