    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A teacher wants to arrange 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory on a bookshelf. In how many ways can he do that?",
    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways the teacher can arrange the books on the bookshelf, we can use the concept of permutations. \n\nSince there are 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory, there are a total of 3 + 4 = 7 books to arrange. \n\nThe total number of ways the teacher can arrange the books is given by 7!, which is the factorial of 7 (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nHowever, since there are 3 identical copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 identical copies of Introduction to Number Theory, we need to divide by the factorials of the number of duplicates to avoid overcounting.\n\nSpecifically, we need to divide by 3! (the factorial of 3) for the Introduction to Geometry copies and 4! (the factorial of 4) for the Introduction to Number Theory copies.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the teacher can arrange the books on the bookshelf is:\n\n7! / (3! * 4!) = 35, which is equal to 35 ways.",
