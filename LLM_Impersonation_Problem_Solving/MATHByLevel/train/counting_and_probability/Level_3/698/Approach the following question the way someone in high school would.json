    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A teacher wants to arrange 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory on a bookshelf. In how many ways can he do that?",
    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for permutations. \n\nThe formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time is:\nnPr = n! / (n-r)!\n\nIn this case, the teacher wants to arrange 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory on the bookshelf. \n\nSo, the total number of ways the teacher can arrange the books is:\n7! / 3!4!\n\n= 5040 / (6*24)\n= 5040 / 144\n= 35\n\nTherefore, the teacher can arrange the books in 35 different ways.",
