    "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, remember that when we see an exclamation point in math, it means factorial. So, if we see \\(N!\\), that means we multiply all the numbers from 1 up to \\(N\\).\n\nIn the numerator, we have \\((N-1)!\\times N\\). This means we multiply all the numbers from 1 up to \\(N-1\\) and then multiply that by \\(N\\).\n\nIn the denominator, we have \\((N+1)!\\). This means we multiply all the numbers from 1 up to \\(N+1\\).\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression. We can cancel out some of the terms. Specifically, we can cancel out \\(N\\) in the numerator and \\(N\\) in the denominator.\n\nSo, our expression becomes \\[\\frac{(N-1)!}{(N+1)}.\\]\n\nAnd that's the final answer!
