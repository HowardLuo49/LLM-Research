    "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's expand the factorials. $(N-1)! = (N-1)(N-2)(N-3)...(2)(1)$ and $N! = N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)...(2)(1)$. \n\nSo our expression becomes $\\frac{(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)...(2)(1)(N)}{N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)...(2)(1)}$.\n\nNotice that many of the terms cancel out. We are left with $\\frac{1}{N+1}$. And that's our final answer!",
