    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle, we need to first know what Pascal's triangle is! Pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. \n\nTo find the second smallest four-digit number, we need to look for a number in the triangle that is between 1000 and 9999. Let's look at the numbers in the first few rows of Pascal's triangle:\n\n1\n1 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 6 4 1\n\nThe second smallest four-digit number is 1001, because it is the first number in Pascal's triangle that is greater than 1000. So, the answer is 1001!",
