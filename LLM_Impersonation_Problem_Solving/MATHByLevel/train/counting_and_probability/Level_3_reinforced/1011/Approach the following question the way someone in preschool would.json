    "solution": "If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not. So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If we have 3 chances of getting a prize and 4 chances of not getting a prize, that means there are 7 total chances. To find the probability of not getting a prize, we divide the number of chances of not getting a prize by the total number of chances. That is $4$ out of $7$, which is $\\frac{4}{7}$. So the probability of not pulling a prize out of the box is $\\frac{4}{7}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{4?: If we have 3 chances of getting a prize and 4 chances of not getting a prize, that means there are 7 total chances. To find the probability of not getting a prize, we divide the number of chances of not getting a prize by the total number of chances. That is $4$ out of $7$, which is $\\frac{4}{7}$.
