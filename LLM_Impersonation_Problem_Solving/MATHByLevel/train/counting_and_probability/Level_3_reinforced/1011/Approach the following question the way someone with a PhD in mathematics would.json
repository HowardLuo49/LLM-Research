    "solution": "If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not. So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, we first need to calculate the probability of pulling the prize out. \n\nThe odds of pulling the prize out are given as $3:4$. This means that for every 3 successful outcomes (pulling the prize out) there are 4 total outcomes. Therefore, the probability of pulling the prize out is $\\frac{3}{3+4} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\n\nTo find the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box, we subtract the probability of pulling the prize out from 1 (since the probability of an event happening plus the probability of it not happening sum to 1). \n\nHence, the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $1 - \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{4}{7}$. \n\nTherefore, the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\frac{4}{7}$.",
