    "solution": "If the odds for pulling a prize out of the box are $3:4$, that means that 3 out of 7 times will result in a prize, while 4 out of 7 times will not. So the probability of not pulling the prize out of the box is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh boy, this is like a math problem we learned in school! So, if the odds are $3:4$, that means there are 3 chances to pull a prize out of the box and 4 chances to not pull a prize out. \n\nTo find the probability of not pulling a prize out of the box, we just need to use the number of chances of not pulling a prize out (4) and divide it by the total number of chances (3 + 4 = 7). \n\nSo, the probability of not pulling a prize out of the box is 4 out of 7, which can be written as a common fraction as $\\frac{4}{7}$.",
