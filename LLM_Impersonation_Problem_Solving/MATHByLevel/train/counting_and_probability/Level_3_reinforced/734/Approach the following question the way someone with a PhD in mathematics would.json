    "solution": "The solutions are $(1,29),(2,28),\\ldots,(28,2),(29,1)$. Each $a$ produces a unique $b$, and since there are 29 possibilities for $a$, there are $\\boxed{29}$ possibilities for $(a,b)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by looking at the possible values that $a$ and $b$ can take on. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the possible values they can take on range from 1 to 29, inclusive.\n\nWe can now consider the equation $a + b = 30$. For each value of $a$ from 1 to 29, there is a unique value of $b$ that satisfies the equation. For example, if $a = 1$, then $b = 29$, and if $a = 2$, then $b = 28$, and so on.\n\nTherefore, there are 29 distinct ordered-pair solutions $(a, b)$ that satisfy the equation $a + b = 30$.",
