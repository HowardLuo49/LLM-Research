    "solution": "The solutions are $(1,29),(2,28),\\ldots,(28,2),(29,1)$. Each $a$ produces a unique $b$, and since there are 29 possibilities for $a$, there are $\\boxed{29}$ possibilities for $(a,b)$.",

Let's use our counting skills to figure it out.\n\nLet's try some numbers. If we use 1 for $a$, how much is $b$? It's 29! If we use 2 for $a$, how much is $b$? It's 28! So, if we keep going like this, we can find all the pairs of numbers that add up to 30.\n\nSo, we start with $a = 1, b = 29$. Then $a = 2, b = 28$. We keep going until we hit $a = 15, b = 15$ because after that we will just be repeating the same numbers but in a different order. \n\nSo, there are 15 pairs of numbers that add up to 30. Yay, we solved the puzzle!",
