    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that the integer has to be greater than 9 and less than 100. That means it can be any number from 10 to 99. \n\nTo find the probability that its digits are different, we need to figure out how many numbers have different digits and divide that by the total number of possible numbers. \n\nSo let's start by counting how many numbers have different digits. We have 90 possible numbers from 10 to 99. \n\nFor the digits to be different, the tens digit and the ones digit cannot be the same. So for each tens digit (1, 2, 3, ..., 9), there are 9 choices for the ones digit (0, 1, 2, ..., 9) that are different from the tens digit. \n\nThat means there are 9 different choices for the ones digit for each of the 9 tens digits, so there are 9 x 9 = 81 numbers with different digits. \n\nNow we need to find the total number of possible numbers, which is 90. \n\nSo the probability that the digits are different is 81/90 = 9/10 or 0.9. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the integer chosen has different digits is 0.9 or 90%.",
