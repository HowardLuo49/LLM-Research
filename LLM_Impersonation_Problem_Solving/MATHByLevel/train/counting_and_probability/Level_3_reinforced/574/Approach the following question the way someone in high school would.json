    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the digits are different, we first need to determine how many two-digit numbers have different digits. \n\nThere are a total of 90 two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99). To find the number of numbers where the digits are different, we need to consider the possibilities for each digit.\n\nFor the first digit, we can choose any number from 1 to 9 (since the number cannot be 0), giving us 9 options.\n\nFor the second digit, we can choose any number from 0 to 9 (excluding the first digit we already chose), giving us 10 options.\n\nTherefore, the total number of two-digit numbers with different digits is 9 * 10 = 90.\n\nThe probability of choosing a number with different digits is the number of favorable outcomes (90) divided by the total number of outcomes (90). \n\nSo, the probability is 90/90 = 1. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the digits are different is 1.",
