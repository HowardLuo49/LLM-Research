    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that the chosen integer has different digits, we need to first calculate the total number of integers between 10 and 99 (inclusive). There are 90 integers in this range.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of integers in this range that have different digits. An integer with different digits has 2 distinct digits, with the constraint that the first digit cannot be 0. Therefore, there are 9 choices for the first digit (1 to 9) and 9 choices for the second digit (0 to 9, excluding the first digit). This gives us a total of 9*9 = 81 integers with different digits.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly chosen integer between 10 and 99 has different digits is 81/90 = 9/10 or 0.9.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that the chosen integer has different digits is 0.9.",
