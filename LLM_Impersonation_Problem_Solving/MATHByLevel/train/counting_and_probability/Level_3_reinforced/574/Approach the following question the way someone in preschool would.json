    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. An integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
    "solution": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's think about the numbers we can choose between 10 and 99. We can have numbers like 11, 22, 33, and so on where the digits are the same. And we can also have numbers like 12, 34, 56 and so on where the digits are different. So, let's count how many numbers have different digits. If we list them out, we have 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, and so on up to 98. That makes a total of 72 numbers that have different digits. And there are a total of 90 numbers between 10 and 99. So, the probability of choosing a number with different digits is 72 out of 90, which simplifies to 4 out of 5. So the probability is 4/5. Yay!",
