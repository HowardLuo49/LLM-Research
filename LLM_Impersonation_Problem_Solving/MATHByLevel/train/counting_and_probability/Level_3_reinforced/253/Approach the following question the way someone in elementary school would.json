    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. I have two 20-sided dice that each have 4 maroon sides, 7 teal sides, 8 cyan sides, and one sparkly side. If I roll both dice, what is the probability they come up the same?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly. The probability of getting maroon is $\\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{400}$. Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\\left(\\dfrac{7}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{400}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{16}{400}+\\dfrac{49}{400}+\\dfrac{64}{400}+\\dfrac{1}{400}=\\frac{130}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{40}}$.",

Each dice has 20 sides, so when you roll them both, there are 20 x 20 = 400 possible outcomes.\n\nTo find the probability that they come up the same, we need to first figure out how many ways they can both be maroon, both be teal, both be cyan, or both be sparkly.\n\nThere are 4 maroon sides on each dice, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 ways they can both be maroon.\n\nThere are 7 teal sides on each dice, so there are 7 x 7 = 49 ways they can both be teal.\n\nThere are 8 cyan sides on each dice, so there are 8 x 8 = 64 ways they can both be cyan.\n\nAnd there is 1 sparkly side on each dice, so there is 1 x 1 = 1 way they can both be sparkly.\n\nAdding all of those up, there are 16 + 49 + 64 + 1 = 130 ways they can come up the same.\n\nSo, the probability they come up the same is 130/400 = 13/40.",
