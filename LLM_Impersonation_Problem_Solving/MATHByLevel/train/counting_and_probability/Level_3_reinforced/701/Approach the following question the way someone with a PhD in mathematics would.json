    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of two randomly chosen numbers from $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ will be a multiple of 9, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are a total of ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways to choose two numbers without replacement from the set $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. These pairs are (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), and (5, 6).\n\nNext, we need to find the pairs whose product is a multiple of 9. A number is a multiple of 9 if and only if it contains at least one 3 and one 3 or 6. Therefore, the pairs whose product is a multiple of 9 are (3, 3), (3, 6), and (6,3), and (3, 9), (6, 9) and (3, 9).\n\nThere are ${2 \\choose 2} + {2 \\choose 1}{2\\choose 1} = 1 + 4 = 5$ pairs whose product is a multiple of 9.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of two randomly chosen numbers will be a multiple of 9 is $\\dfrac{5}{6}$.",
