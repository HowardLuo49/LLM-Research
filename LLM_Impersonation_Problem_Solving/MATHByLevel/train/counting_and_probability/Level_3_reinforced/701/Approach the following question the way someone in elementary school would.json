    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find all the ways to get a product that is a multiple of 9. The numbers that are multiples of 9 in our set are 3 and 6. \n\nTo get a product that is a multiple of 9, we can choose either 3 and 3, 3 and 6, or 6 and 6. \n\nThere are a total of $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose any two numbers from the set $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ without replacement.\n\nOut of these 6 ways, 3 ways will give us a product that is a multiple of 9.\n\nTherefore, the probability of choosing two numbers whose product is a multiple of 9 is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
