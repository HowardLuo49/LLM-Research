    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of two numbers chosen randomly without replacement from $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ is a multiple of 9, we first need to find all the pairs of numbers that will result in a multiple of 9 when multiplied.\n\nThe multiples of 9 in the set are 3 and 6. \n\nPossible pairs that result in a product multiple of 9 are (3, 3), (3, 6), and (6, 3).\n\nThere are a total of $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose two numbers from $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ without replacement.\n\nSo, the probability that the product of two randomly selected numbers is a multiple of 9 is $\\dfrac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.",
