    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",

Let's pick two numbers. \n\nFirst, let's see which numbers are multiples of 9: 3 and 6. \n\nIf we pick a 3 and a 3, the product is 9, which is a multiple of 9.\nIf we pick a 3 and a 6, the product is 18, which is also a multiple of 9.\nIf we pick two 6s, the product is 36, which is also a multiple of 9.\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to get a product that is a multiple of 9. \n\nNow, how many ways can we pick 2 numbers from the 4 numbers?\n\nWell, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways to choose 2 numbers from 4. \n\nSo, the probability is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nYay!
