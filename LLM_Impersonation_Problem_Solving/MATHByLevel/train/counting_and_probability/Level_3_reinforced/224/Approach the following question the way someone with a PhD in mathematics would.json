    "solution": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is greater than or equal to 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, there are only 3 pairs of rolls that result in a sum greater than or equal to 11: (5,6), (6,5) and (6,6). Since there are 6 possible results for the roll of each die, there are $6\\times6=36$ possible pairs of rolls, so the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not less than 11 is $\\frac{3}{36}=\\frac{1}{12}$. Using the idea of complementary probabilities, we know that the probability of an event happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not happening, so the probability of the sum of the numbers showing being less than 11 is $1-\\frac{1}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing on the dice is less than 11, we must first calculate all the possible outcomes where the sum is less than 11. \n\nThere are 36 total possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice. To determine the outcomes where the sum is less than 11, we can construct a table showing all the possible combinations and their sums:\n\nSums: 1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12\n# of ways: 1    2    3    4    5    6    5    4    3     2     1      0\n\nFrom the table, we can see that there are 27 possible outcomes out of 36 where the sum is less than 11.
