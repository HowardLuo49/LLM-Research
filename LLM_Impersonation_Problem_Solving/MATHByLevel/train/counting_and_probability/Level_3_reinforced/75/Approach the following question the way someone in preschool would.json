A certain coin is weighted such that the chance of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the chance of flipping tails is $\\frac{2}{3}$.  Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/3$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $2/3$ chance of getting tails and losing 2 dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{3}(\\$3) + \\frac{2}{3}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If we flip heads, we win $\\$3$. Since the chance of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$, we can find the amount we expect to win by multiplying $\\$3$ by $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nIf we flip tails, we lose $\\$2$. Since the chance of flipping tails is $\\frac{2}{3}$, we can find the amount we expect to lose by multiplying $\\$2$ by $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe expected value is the sum of the expected winnings and losses, which gives:\n\n$\\$3 \\times \\frac{1}{3} + (-\\$2) \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{\\$3}{3} - \\frac{\\$4}{3} = -\\frac{\\$1}{3}.$\n\nSo after one flip, our expected value is -$1/3$ dollars.",
