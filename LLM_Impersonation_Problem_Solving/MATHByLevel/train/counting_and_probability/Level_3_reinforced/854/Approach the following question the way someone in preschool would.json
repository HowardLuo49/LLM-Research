    "solution": "None of $a,b,c$ are equal to 1 if and only if $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$. $a,b,c$ can only be $2,3,4,5,6$. The probability of this is $\\frac{5^3}{6^3}=\\boxed{\\frac{125}{216}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's play a game with dice! We have three dice, and we roll them to get three numbers, a, b, and c. We want to find the probability that when we roll the dice, the numbers we get are not all 1. \n\nTo do this, we need to think about all the different possibilities for the numbers we can get when rolling the dice. Each die has numbers 1 through 6, so there are 6 possible outcomes for each die. \n\nTo find the total number of outcomes for all three dice, we need to multiply the number of outcomes for each die. So, there are $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$ total outcomes.\n\nNow, let's think about the outcomes where at least one of the numbers is not 1. To find this, we need to think about the total number of outcomes where all the numbers are 1 and subtract that from the total number of outcomes.\n\nIf all the numbers are 1, then $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) = 0$. The only way this can happen is if $a=1$, $b=1$, and $c=1$. There is only 1 way this can happen, so there is 1 outcome where all the numbers are 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes where at least one number is not 1 is $216 - 1 = 215$.\n\nTo find the probability that $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$, we need to divide the number of successful outcomes (where at least one number is not 1) by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability is $\\frac{215}{216}$. \n\nYay, we solved the problem! Great job rolling the dice and finding the probability!",
