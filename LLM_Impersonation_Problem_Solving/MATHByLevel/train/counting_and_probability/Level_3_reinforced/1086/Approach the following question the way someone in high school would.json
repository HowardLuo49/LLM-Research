    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Jenna is at a fair with four friends. They all want to ride the roller coaster, but only three people can fit in a car. How many different groups of three can the five of them make?",
    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many different groups of three Jenna and her friends can make, we can use combinations because the order in which they get in the car doesn't matter. We can use the combination formula, which is nCr = n! / r! (n-r)!, where n is the total number of people and r is the number of people in each group. \n\nIn this case, n = 5 (Jenna and her four friends) and r = 3 (the number of people in each group). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n5C3 = 5! / 3!(5-3)!\n5C3 = 5! / 3!2!\n5C3 = (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (3 x 2 x 1)(2 x 1)\n5C3 = (120) / (6)(2)\n5C3 = 10\n\nSo, Jenna and her friends can make 10 different groups of three to ride the roller coaster together.",
