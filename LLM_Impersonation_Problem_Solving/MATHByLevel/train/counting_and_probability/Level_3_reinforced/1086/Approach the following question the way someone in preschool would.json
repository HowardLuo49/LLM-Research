    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$.",

Then, her first friend can ride with her second friend or her third friend. That's two more groups. Finally, her second friend can ride with her third friend. So in total, they can make six groups of three. Yay, we did it!",
