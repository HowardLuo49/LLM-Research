    "solution": "Because of the symmetric nature of the number 11, it is a divisor of many palindromes.  Expanding powers of $x+y$ (where $x = 10$ and $y = 1$) helps us see why the first few powers of 11 are all palindromes:  \\begin{align*}\n(x + y)^2 &= x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\\n11^2 &= 121 \\\\\n(x + y)^3 &= x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3 \\\\\n11^3 &= 1331 \\\\\n(x + y)^4 &= x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4\\\\\n11^4 &= 14641 \\\\\n(x + y)^5 &= x^5 + 5x^4y + 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3 + 5xy^4 + y^5 \\\\\n11^5 &= 161051 \\end{align*} Notice that each term of the form $x^i y^{n-i}$ ends up being a power of $10$, and the digits of $(x+y)^n$ end up being the binomial coefficients when these coefficients are less than $10$, as there is no carrying. Because of the identity $\\binom{n}{i}=\\binom{n}{n-i}$, the number is a palindrome whenever the coefficients are all less than $10$, which is true for powers less than 5. However, from the list above, we see that $(x+y)^5$ has coefficients at least 10, and indeed, we have $11^5 = \\boxed{161051}$, which is not a palindrome.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first, let's find some integer powers of 11. When we raise 11 to the power of 1, we get 11. When we raise it to the power of 2, we get 121. When we raise it to the power of 3, we get 1331. So, the smallest positive integer that is an integer power of 11 is 11.\n\nNow, let's check if 11 is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. Since 11 reads the same forwards and backwards, it is a palindrome.\n\nSo, we need to find the next integer power of 11 that is not a palindrome. Let's try 11 to the power of 4. When we calculate that, we get 14641. This number is not a palindrome since it is not the same forwards and backwards.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that is both an integer power of 11 and is not a palindrome is 14641.",
