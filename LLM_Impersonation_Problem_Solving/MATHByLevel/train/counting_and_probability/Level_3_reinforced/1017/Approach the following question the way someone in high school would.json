What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{4}{52} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} \\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{16575}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so there are 52 cards in a deck, and we want to find the probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, and finally a King without replacing the cards back in the deck. \n\nFirst, there are 4 Jacks in a standard deck, so the probability of drawing a Jack on the first card is 4/52.\n\nThen, after drawing a Jack, there are 3 Queens left in the deck (because we already drew one card), so the probability of drawing a Queen on the second card is 3/51.\n\nFinally, after drawing a Jack and a Queen, there are 2 Kings left in the deck, so the probability of drawing a King on the third card is 2/50.\n\nTo find the probability of all three events happening, we multiply the probabilities together:\n\n(4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) = 0.00018088231\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, and finally a King in that order is approximately 0.00018088231 or about 0.0181%.",
