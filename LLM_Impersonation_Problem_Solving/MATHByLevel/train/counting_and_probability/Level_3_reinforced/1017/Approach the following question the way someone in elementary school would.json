What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{4}{52} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} \\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{16575}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we have to find out how many Jacks, Queens, and Kings are in a deck of cards. There are 4 of each kind, so that's 12 in total.\n\nNow, we need to think about how many total cards are in the deck. There are 52 cards in total.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a Jack first is 4 out of 52, because there are 4 Jacks in a deck of 52 cards.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a Queen second is 4 out of 51, because we didn't put the Jack back in the deck.\n\nFinally, the probability of drawing a King third is 4 out of 50, because we didn't put the Queen back in the deck.\n\nTo find the total probability, we just multiply all these probabilities together:\n\n(4/52) * (4/51) * (4/50) = 64/132600 = 8/16575\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a Jack, a Queen, and a King in that order is 8 out of 16,575.",
