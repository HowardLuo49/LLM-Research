What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",

    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's use our imagination to play a fun game! Pretend we have a big deck of cards with lots of different characters on them. Let's say we have a Jack, a Queen, and a King.\n\nNow, let's imagine we pick the first card and it's the Jack! Yay! There's only one Jack in the deck, so the probability of that happening is 1 out of 52.\n\nNext, let's pretend we pick the second card and it's the Queen! So exciting! There's only one Queen in the deck, so the probability of that happening is 1 out of 51 (since we already picked one card).\n\nFinally, let's imagine we pick the third card and it's the King! Hooray! There's only one King left in the deck, so the probability of that happening is 1 out of 50 (since we already picked two cards).\n\nTo find the overall probability of all three events happening, we just multiply the probabilities together: 1/52 * 1/51 * 1/50 = 1/132600.\n\nWow, that was so much fun pretending to pick cards! Great job playing along with me!",
