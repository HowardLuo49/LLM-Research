    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
    "solution": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. Let's count them together! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 red plates and 1, 2, 3, 4 blue plates. Now we need to pick two plates for dinner. If we want them to be the same color, we need to pick two red plates or two blue plates. So, let's count the total number of ways we can pick two plates - there are 9 plates in total, so there are 9 choose 2 ways to pick two plates. Now let's count how many ways we can pick two red plates - there are 5 choose 2 ways to pick two red plates. And there are 4 choose 2 ways to pick two blue plates. So, the probability that we pick two plates of the same color is (5 choose 2 + 4 choose 2) / (9 choose 2). Let's simplify it by counting out the ways and see what we get!",

Let's count them together! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 red plates and 1, 2, 3, 4 blue plates. Now we need to pick two plates for dinner.
