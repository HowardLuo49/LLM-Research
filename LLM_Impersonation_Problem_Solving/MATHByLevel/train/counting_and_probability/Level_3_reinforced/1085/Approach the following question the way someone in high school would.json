    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
    "solution": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay so first we need to figure out how many total combinations of plates we could have. Since we have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates, that gives us 9 total plates. \n\nNow we need to figure out how many ways we can choose 2 plates of the same color. If we choose red plates, there are 5 red plates to choose from, so that gives us 5 choose 2 ways. If we choose blue plates, there are 4 blue plates to choose from, so that gives us 4 choose 2 ways.\n\nSo the total number of ways to choose 2 plates of the same color is 5 choose 2 + 4 choose 2.\n\nThen to find the probability that we choose 2 plates of the same color, we divide that number by the total number of possible combinations (9 choose 2).\n\nSo the probability is (5 choose 2 + 4 choose 2) / (9 choose 2).",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{4?: Okay so first we need to figure out how many total combinations of plates we could have.
