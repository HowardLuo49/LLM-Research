    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
    "solution": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can start by considering the total number of ways we can choose 2 plates out of the 9 plates available (5 red plates and 4 blue plates). This can be calculated using the combination formula, which states that the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 plates out of the 9 available plates is given by C(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * 7!) = 36.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways we can choose 2 plates of the same color. We have two cases to consider: choosing 2 red plates or choosing 2 blue plates.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red plates out of the 5 available red plates is given by C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 2 blue plates out of the 4 available blue plates is given by C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 plates of the same color is 10 (for red plates) + 6 (for blue plates) = 16.\n\nFinally, the probability of choosing 2 plates of the same color is given by the number of ways to choose 2 plates of the same color divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 plates, i.e., 16/36 = 4/9.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of randomly selecting two plates of the same color is 4/9.",
