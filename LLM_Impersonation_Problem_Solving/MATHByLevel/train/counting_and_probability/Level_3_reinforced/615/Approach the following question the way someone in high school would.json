    "solution": "There are nine possible digits that the hundreds digit could be. However, there are only four possible endings for the number: 46, 64, 28, and 82. Thus, there are $9 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{36}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright guys, let's break down this question. We need to find three-digit numbers where the sum of the tens and units digits is 10.\n\nFirst, let's start by listing out all the possible combinations of the tens and units digits that add up to 10:\n- 19\n- 28\n- 37\n- 46\n- 55\n- 64\n- 73\n- 82\n- 91\n\nNow, we need to consider the hundreds digit. Since we want the number to be even, the hundreds digit must be even as well. So, our list of possible hundreds digits is:\n2, 4, 6, 8\n\nNow, we can pair up each of these hundreds digits with the combinations of tens and units digits:\n- 219\n- 428\n- 637\n- 846\n\nTherefore, there are 4 even three-digit numbers where the sum of the tens and units digits is 10.",
