    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many even three digit numbers are there such that the sum of the  tens and units digits is 10?",
    "solution": "There are nine possible digits that the hundreds digit could be. However, there are only four possible endings for the number: 46, 64, 28, and 82. Thus, there are $9 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{36}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many even three-digit numbers have the sum of the tens and units digits as 10, we first need to look at all the possible combinations of the tens and units digits that add up to 10. \n\nThe possible combinations are:\n- 1 and 9\n- 2 and 8\n- 3 and 7\n- 4 and 6 \n- 5 and 5\n\nFor each of these combinations, we have 5 choices for the hundreds digit (because it can't be 0), and 5 choices for the units digit (since it has to be even).  So for each combination of tens and units digits, there are 5x5=25 possible three-digit numbers. \n\nTherefore, there are 25 x 5 = 125 even three-digit numbers where the sum of the tens and units digits is 10.",
