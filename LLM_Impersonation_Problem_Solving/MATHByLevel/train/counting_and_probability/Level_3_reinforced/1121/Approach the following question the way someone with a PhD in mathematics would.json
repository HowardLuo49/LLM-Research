    "solution": "For positive integers $n$ greater than 4, $n!$ is divisible by 15.  Therefore, all the terms beyond $1!+2!+3!+4!$ do not affect the remainder of the sum when it is divided by 15.  The remainder when $1!+2!+3!+4!=33$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 49! + 50!$ when divided by $15$, we can first observe that for any integer $n \\geq 6$, $n!$ will be divisible by $15$ since both $3$ and $5$ divide $n!$ for all $n \\geq 5$. Therefore, the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5!$ will have a remainder when divided by $15$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5!$:\n\n$1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 = 153$\n\nSince $153$ has a remainder of $3$ when divided by $15$, the remainder when dividing $1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 49! + 50!$ by $15$ will also be $3$.",
