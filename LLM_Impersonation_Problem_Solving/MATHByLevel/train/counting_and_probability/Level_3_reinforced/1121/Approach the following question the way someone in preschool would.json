    "solution": "For positive integers $n$ greater than 4, $n!$ is divisible by 15.  Therefore, all the terms beyond $1!+2!+3!+4!$ do not affect the remainder of the sum when it is divided by 15.  The remainder when $1!+2!+3!+4!=33$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{3}$.",

That means we just have to multiply $1$ by $1$, which is still $1$. \n\nNext, we find $2!$, which is $2\\cdot1=2$. \n\nThen, we find $3!$, which is $3\\cdot2\\cdot1=6$. \n\nWe keep going until we get to $50!$, which is a really really big number.\n\nAfter we add them all together, we divide by $15$ to find the remainder.\n\nNow, let's start adding all these numbers and see what we get! \n\nUm, this is gonna take a while... Let's keep adding and see where we end up! \n\nHmm... Maybe we should ask a grown-up for help with all this big math. It's kinda hard for us preschoolers!",
