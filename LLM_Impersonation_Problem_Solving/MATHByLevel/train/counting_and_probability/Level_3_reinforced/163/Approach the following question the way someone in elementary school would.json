    "solution": "We first factor 180 into three positive integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Since $180 > 5^3 = 125,$ at least one of the integers must be 6. Since $180 > 5^2\\cdot 6 = 150$, at least two integers must equal 6. Indeed, $180 = 5\\cdot6\\cdot6$ is the only such way to factor 180. Therefore, $(a,b,c) = (5,6,6), (6,5,6),(6,6,5)$ are the only possibilities for $a,b,c$. Each occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac16\\right)^3 = \\frac1{216}$, so the probability that $abc = 180$ is $3\\cdot \\frac1{216} = \\boxed{\\frac1{72}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about all the ways we can get 180 by multiplying three numbers between 1 and 6. Since 180 is a big number, we know that one of the numbers has to be pretty big. The factors of 180 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, and 180. \n\nNext, we need to think about all the ways we can get these factors by rolling three dice. For example, we could get 180 by rolling a 6, a 5, and a 6 (6 x 5 x 6 = 180). \n\nNow, we need to think about all the possible outcomes when we roll three dice. There are 6 choices for the first dice, 6 choices for the second dice, and 6 choices for the third dice. So, there are $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$ total outcomes.\n\nFinally, we need to find the probability of getting 180. There are actually 3 ways to get 180: by rolling a 6, a 5, and a 6; by rolling a 5, a 6, and a 6; or by rolling two 6's and a 5. So, the probability is $\\frac{3}{216} = \\frac{1}{72}$. \n\nSo, the probability of getting 180 when rolling three dice is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{72}}$.",
