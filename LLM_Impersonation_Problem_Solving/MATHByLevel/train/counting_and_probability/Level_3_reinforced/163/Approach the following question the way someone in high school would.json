    "solution": "We first factor 180 into three positive integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Since $180 > 5^3 = 125,$ at least one of the integers must be 6. Since $180 > 5^2\\cdot 6 = 150$, at least two integers must equal 6. Indeed, $180 = 5\\cdot6\\cdot6$ is the only such way to factor 180. Therefore, $(a,b,c) = (5,6,6), (6,5,6),(6,6,5)$ are the only possibilities for $a,b,c$. Each occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac16\\right)^3 = \\frac1{216}$, so the probability that $abc = 180$ is $3\\cdot \\frac1{216} = \\boxed{\\frac1{72}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that $abc = 180$, we need to consider all the possible outcomes when three standard dice are tossed.\n\nThere are a total of $6^3 = 216$ possible outcomes when three standard dice are tossed.
