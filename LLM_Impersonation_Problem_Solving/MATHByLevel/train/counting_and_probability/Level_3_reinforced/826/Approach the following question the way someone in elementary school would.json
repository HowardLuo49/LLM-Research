A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.  If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
    "solution": "There are 5 green balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a green ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$. Similarly, the probability that a purple ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$. So the expected value is $$\\frac{5}{5+k}(2)+\\frac{k}{5+k}(-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ gives $20-4k=5+k$, or $15=5k$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have 5 green balls and some number of purple balls in the bin. If we draw a green ball, we win 2 dollars, and if we draw a purple ball, we lose 2 dollars. We want to figure out how many purple balls there are.\n\nTo find the expected amount won, we need to calculate the probability of drawing a green ball and multiply it by 2 (because we win 2 dollars) and the probability of drawing a purple ball and multiply it by -2 (because we lose 2 dollars).\n\nLet's say there are $k$ purple balls. The total number of balls in the bin is 5 (green) + $k$ (purple) = $k + 5$.\n\nThe probability of drawing a green ball is the number of green balls divided by the total number of balls: $\\frac{5}{k+5}$.\n\nThe probability of drawing a purple ball is the number of purple balls divided by the total number of balls: $\\frac{k}{k+5}$.\n\nWe know that the expected amount won is 50 cents, which is the same as 0.50 dollars. So our equation is:\n\n$0.50 = 2(\\frac{5}{k+5}) - 2(\\frac{k}{k+5})$\n\nNow, we solve this equation to find $k$.\n\n$0.50 = \\frac{10}{k+5} - \\frac{2k}{k+5}$\n\n$0.50 = \\frac{10-2k}{k+5}$\n\n$0.50(k+5) = 10-2k$\n\n$0.50k + 2.5 = 10-2k$\n\n$0.50k + 2.5 + 2k = 10$\n\n$2.5 + 2.50k = 10$\n\n$2.50k = 7.5$\n\n$k = 3$\n\nSo, there are 3 purple balls in the bin.",
