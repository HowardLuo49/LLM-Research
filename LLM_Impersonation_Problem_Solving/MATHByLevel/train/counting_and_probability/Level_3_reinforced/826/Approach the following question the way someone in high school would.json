A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.  If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
    "solution": "There are 5 green balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a green ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$. Similarly, the probability that a purple ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$. So the expected value is $$\\frac{5}{5+k}(2)+\\frac{k}{5+k}(-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ gives $20-4k=5+k$, or $15=5k$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find $k$, we need to calculate the expected amount won for playing the game and set it equal to 50 cents.\n\nThe probability of drawing a green ball is $\\frac{5}{5+k}$ because there are 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls in the bin. If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars.\n\nThe probability of drawing a purple ball is $\\frac{k}{5+k}$. If a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the expected amount won for playing the game is:\n$2\\left(\\frac{5}{5+k}\\right) - 2\\left(\\frac{k}{5+k}\\right) = \\frac{10}{5+k} - \\frac{2k}{5+k} = \\frac{10-2k}{5+k}$\n\nSince this expected amount is equal to 50 cents, we have:\n$\\frac{10-2k}{5+k} = 0.5$\n\nSolving for $k$, we get:\n$10-2k = 0.5(5+k)$\n$10-2k = 2.5 + 0.5k$\n$7.5 = 2.5k$\n$k = 3$\n\nTherefore, $k$ is 3.",
