    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A bin has 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.  If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
    "solution": "There are 5 green balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a green ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$. Similarly, the probability that a purple ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$. So the expected value is $$\\frac{5}{5+k}(2)+\\frac{k}{5+k}(-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ gives $20-4k=5+k$, or $15=5k$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, I love playing with balls! Let's count how many balls are in the bin first. There are 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls. That's a total of 5 + $k$ balls!\n\nNow, let's see how much money we can win or lose. If we draw a green ball, we win 2 dollars, but if we draw a purple ball, we lose 2 dollars. So, the total amount won or lost depends on the number of green and purple balls.\n\nIf we expect to win 50 cents on average, that means we need to find the average amount won per ball. To do this, we set up an equation:\n\n$(5/5+k)*(2) + (k/5+k)*(-2) = 0.50$\n\nSolving this equation will help us find the value of $k$. Let's see what we get! Yay, math is fun!",
