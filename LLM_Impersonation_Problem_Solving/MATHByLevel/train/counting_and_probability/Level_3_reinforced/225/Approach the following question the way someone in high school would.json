    "solution": "With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit. Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$. Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit. After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \\boxed{145}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to think about what factorials are. A factorial is the product of all positive integers up to a certain number. So, for example, 3! (read as \"3 factorial\") is equal to 3 x 2 x 1, which equals 6.\n\nNow, let's break down the question. We're looking for a three-digit number where the sum of the factorials of its individual digits is equal to the number itself. So, if our number is ABC, we need to find the sum of A!, B!, and C! and see if it equals ABC.\n\nLet's start by trying out some possibilities. We can quickly rule out numbers with 0 in them because 0! is equal to 1, and no other numbers factorials will be equal to 0. We can also eliminate numbers with 1 in them since 1! is equal to 1, and any number to the power of 1 will just be the number itself.\n\nLet's try the number 145. The factorial of 1 is 1, the factorial of 4 is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24, and the factorial of 5 is 120. Adding these together, we get 1 + 24 + 120 = 145. So, 145 is the three-digit integer that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits.\n\nHopefully, this helps you understand how to approach and solve this problem like a high school student. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
