    "solution": "With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit. Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$. Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit. After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \\boxed{145}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break down the question step by step:\n\nFirst, let's find the factorials of each digit:\n- The factorial of 1 is 1! = 1\n- The factorial of 2 is 2! = 2 x 1 = 2\n- The factorial of 3 is 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6\n\nNext, we need to find a three-digit number that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits. Let's try to find this number by trial and error:\n\n- For the first digit, let's try 1. The sum of the factorials of 1, 1, and 1 is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is not a three-digit number.\n- Let's try the digit 2. The sum of the factorials of 2, 2, and 2 is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is not a three-digit number either.\n\nIt seems like we haven't found the right number yet. Let's try the last digit, 3. The sum of the factorials of 3, 3, and 3 is 6 + 6 + 6 = 18. Since 18 is not a three-digit number, it seems like we made a mistake.\n\nLet's try again with a different approach. Let's try to find the sum of the factorials of three digits that are not the same. Let's look at the number 145:\n\n- The factorial of 1 is 1! = 1\n- The factorial of 4 is 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24\n- The factorial of 5 is 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120\n\nAdding these up, we get 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.\n\nSo the three-digit integer that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits is 145.",
