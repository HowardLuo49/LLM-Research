    "solution": "With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit. Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$. Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit. After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \\boxed{145}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let me think like a preschooler. Factorials are like when we count down from a number and keep multiplying. So if we have the number 123, the factorial of 1 is 1, the factorial of 2 is 2, and the factorial of 3 is 6. If we add them all together, we get 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. So the three-digit integer that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits is 123!",
