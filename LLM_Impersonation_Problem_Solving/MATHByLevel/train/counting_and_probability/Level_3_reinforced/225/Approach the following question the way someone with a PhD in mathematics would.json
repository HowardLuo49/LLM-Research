    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What three-digit integer is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits?",
    "solution": "With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit. Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$. Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit. After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \\boxed{145}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the three-digit integer be represented as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits in the hundreds, tens, and units place respectively. We are given that ABC = A! + B! + C!.\n\nNow, since A, B, and C are digits, they can only take on values from 0 to 9. Therefore, the maximum value for A! is 9! = 362,880, the maximum value for B! is 9! = 362,880, and the maximum value for C! is 9! = 362,880.\n\nConsidering the fact that the maximum possible sum of factorials of three digits is 3*(9!) = 1,088,640, which is a 7-digit number, it is evident that the sum of the factorials of the digits of the three-digit integer cannot exceed 1,000.\n\nHence, we proceed to find all possible combinations of A, B, and C such that A! + B! + C! is less than or equal to 1,000. By trying all possible combinations, we find that the only three-digit integer that satisfies the given condition is 145.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit integer that is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits is 145.",
