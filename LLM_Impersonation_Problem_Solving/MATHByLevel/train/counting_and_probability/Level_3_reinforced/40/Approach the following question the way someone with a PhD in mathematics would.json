    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits?",
    "solution": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's consider the total number of three-digit whole numbers first. There are 9 choices for the hundreds digit (1-9), 10 choices for the tens digit (0-9), and 10 choices for the units digit (0-9). Therefore, the total number of three-digit whole numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of three-digit whole numbers that do not have a 7 or a 9 as any of the digits. There are 7 choices for each digit (0-6, 8), so the number of three-digit whole numbers without a 7 or a 9 is 7 * 7 * 7 = 343.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits. We add the total number of three-digit whole numbers with a 7 (7 * 10 * 10 = 700), the total number of three-digit whole numbers with a 9 (9 * 10 * 10 = 900), and then subtract the number of three-digit whole numbers with both a 7 and a 9 (1 * 1 * 10 = 10) to avoid double counting.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits is 700 + 900 - 10 = 1590.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 1590 three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits.",
