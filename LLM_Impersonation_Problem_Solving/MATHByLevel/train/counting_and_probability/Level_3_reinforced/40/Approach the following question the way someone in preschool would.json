    "solution": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many three-digit numbers have a 7 or a 9 in them! \n\nFirst, let's look at numbers that have a 7 in them. There are 10 choices for the first digit (0-9), 10 choices for the second digit (0-9), and 1 choice for the third digit (7). So that's 10 x 10 x 1 = 100 numbers with a 7 in them. \n\nNext, let's look at numbers that have a 9 in them. Same as before, there are 10 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the third digit (9). So that's 10 x 10 x 1 = 100 numbers with a 9 in them. \n\nBut wait! We counted some numbers twice, like 797 and 979. So we need to subtract those duplicates. How many numbers have both a 7 and a 9 in them? There's only 1 number like that, which is 979. \n\nNow add up all the numbers: 100 (with a 7) + 100 (with a 9) - 1 (with both a 7 and a 9) = 199 three-digit numbers with at least one 7 or one 9 in them! Yay, we did it!",
