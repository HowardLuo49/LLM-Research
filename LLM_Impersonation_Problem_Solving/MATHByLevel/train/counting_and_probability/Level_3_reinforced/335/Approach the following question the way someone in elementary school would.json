Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so Bertha has 6 daughters. Some of them have 6 daughters each, and the others have none. So, let's figure out how many total granddaughters Bertha has.\n\n6 daughters x 6 granddaughters each = 36 granddaughters\n\nSo, Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters. That means she must have 6 daughters and 24 granddaughters (30 total - 6 daughters = 24 granddaughters).\n\nOut of the 24 granddaughters, we know that some of them have no daughters. Since all of Bertha's daughters are counted in the total of 30, we can know that the granddaughters without daughters are included in the total of 30 as well.\n\nSo, if Bertha has 6 daughters and 24 granddaughters, that means all the granddaughters have at least one daughter. Therefore, none of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters.",
