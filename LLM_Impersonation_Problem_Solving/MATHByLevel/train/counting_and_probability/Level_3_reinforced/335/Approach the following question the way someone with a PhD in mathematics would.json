    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Bertha has 6 daughters and no sons. Some of her daughters have 6 daughters, and the rest have none. Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of daughters that Bertha has who also have daughters. Then, 6 - x would be the number of daughters that Bertha has who do not have daughters. Since each daughter who has daughters has 6 daughters herself, the total number of granddaughters would be 6x.\n\nGiven that Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, we can write the equation:\n\nx + (6 - x) + 6x = 30\n6x + 6 - x = 30\n5x + 6 = 30\n5x = 24\nx = 4.8\n\nSince x must be a whole number, we see that x = 5. Therefore, Bertha has 5 daughters who have daughters, and 6 - 5 = 1 daughter who does not have daughters.\n\nHence, Bertha has 1 daughter and 6 granddaughters who have no daughters.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 26?: Let x be the number of daughters that Bertha has who also have daughters.
