Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Bertha has 6 daughters, and some of her daughters have 6 daughters, while the rest have none. So, that means 3 of her daughters have 6 daughters each, and the other 3 daughters have no daughters. \n\nTherefore, Bertha has a total of 3 daughters who have 6 daughters each, which equals 18 granddaughters (6 granddaughters for each daughter). And she also has 3 daughters who have no daughters, which means 3 daughters who are also granddaughters. \n\nSo, out of the total 30 daughters and granddaughters, 3 daughters have no daughters and 3 granddaughters have no daughters. So, Bertha has a total of 6 daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters.",
