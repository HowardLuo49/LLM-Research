At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use our counting skills to figure this out! \n\nWe know that there are 6 identical copies of the book. We also know that at least one book must be in the library and at least one book must be checked out. \n\nLet's start by figuring out how many ways we can have 1 book in the library and 5 books checked out. We can do this by choosing one book to be in the library from the 6 available, which can be done in 6 different ways.\n\nNext, let's figure out how many ways we can have 2 books in the library and 4 books checked out. We can do this by choosing 2 books to be in the library from the 6 available, which can be done in \"6 choose 2\" ways. \n\nFinally, let's figure out how many ways we can have 3 books in the library and 3 books checked out. We can do this by choosing 3 books to be in the library from the 6 available, which can be done in \"6 choose 3\" ways. \n\nSo, in total, there are 6 + \"6 choose 2\" + \"6 choose 3\" different ways in which some books can be in the library and the rest can be checked out.
