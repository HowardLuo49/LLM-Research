    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many triangles we can make, we need to think about the different combinations of integer side lengths that can add up to 7. We know that a triangle has three sides, so let's look at all the ways we can make 7 using three integers.\n\nWe can start by thinking about the smallest side length a triangle can have. The smallest integer is 1, so the smallest triangle we can make has sides of length 1, 1, and 5. We can also have sides of length 1, 2, and 4.\n\nNext, we can think about the next smallest side length, which is 2. The only way we can make a triangle with sides of length 2, 2, and 3.\n\nSo, in total, there are 3 different non-congruent triangles with perimeter 7 that have integer side lengths.",
