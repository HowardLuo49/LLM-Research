    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 and integer side lengths, we can approach this problem by considering the possibilities of side length combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.\n\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. In this case, the perimeter of the triangle is given as 7.\n\nLet's denote the side lengths of the triangle as a, b, and c. Since the perimeter is 7, we have the equation:\n\na + b + c = 7\n\nSince the side lengths must be integers, we can start by considering the smallest possible integer side lengths. The smallest integer side length is 1. Therefore, the possible integer side lengths are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nWe can start by considering the case when one side length is 1. In this case, the other two side lengths must sum up to 6. The possible combinations are (1,2,4) and (1,3,3).\n\nNext, we can consider the case when one side length is 2. In this case, the other two side lengths must sum up to 5. The only possible combination is (2,2,3).\n\nTherefore, there are 3 non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 and integer side lengths: (1,2,4), (1,3,3), and (2,2,3).",
