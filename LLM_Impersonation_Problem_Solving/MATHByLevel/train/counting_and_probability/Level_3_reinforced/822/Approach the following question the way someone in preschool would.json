    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",

We can use our fingers to count or draw some shapes on a paper. Remember, the sides need to be whole numbers! Let's see how many we can find!",
