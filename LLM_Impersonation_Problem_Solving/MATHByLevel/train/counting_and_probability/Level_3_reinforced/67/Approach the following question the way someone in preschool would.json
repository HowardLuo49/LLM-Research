    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Container I holds 8 red balls and 4 green balls; containers II and III each hold 2 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container I, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$ probability for a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ probability of getting green from Container I. Similarly for container II the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{9}$, and the same for container III. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out the probability of picking a green ball, we need to count all the green balls and divide by the total number of balls in all the containers.\n\nContainer I has 4 green balls,\nContainer II has 4 green balls,\nContainer III has 4 green balls.\n\nTotal number of green balls = 4 (from Container I) + 4 (from Container II) + 4 (from Container III) = 12\n\nTotal number of balls = 8 (red balls from Container I) + 4 (green balls from Container I) + 2 (red balls from Container II) + 4 (green balls from Container II) + 2 (red balls from Container III) + 4 (green balls from Container III) = 24\n\nSo, the probability of selecting a green ball is 12/24 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a green ball is 1/2.",
