    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Container I holds 8 red balls and 4 green balls; containers II and III each hold 2 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container I, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$ probability for a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ probability of getting green from Container I. Similarly for container II the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{9}$, and the same for container III. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So first, let's find out how many total balls are in each container:\n\nContainer I has 8 red + 4 green = 12 total balls\nContainer II has 2 red + 4 green = 6 total balls\nContainer III has 2 red + 4 green = 6 total balls\n\nNext, let's find the total number of balls in all the containers combined:\n12 (Container I) + 6 (Container II) + 6 (Container III) = 24 total balls\n\nNow, let's find out how many green balls there are in all the containers combined:\n4 (Container I) + 4 (Container II) + 4 (Container III) = 12 green balls\n\nSo the probability of selecting a green ball is:\n12 green balls / 24 total balls = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a green ball is 1/2.",
