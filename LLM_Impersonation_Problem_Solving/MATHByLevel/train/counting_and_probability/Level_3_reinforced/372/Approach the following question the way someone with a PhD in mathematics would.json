How many different possible pairs of people could Cara be sitting between?\n\n[asy]\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));\nlabel(\"$\\_$\",1.5dir(0));\nlabel(\"$\\_$\",1.5dir(60));\nlabel(\"Cara\",1.5dir(120));\nlabel(\"$\\_$\",1.5dir(180));\nlabel(\"$\\_$\",1.5dir(240));\nlabel(\"$\\_$\",1.5dir(300));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we consider the total number of ways we can choose two people to sit between Cara. Since there are 5 friends besides Cara, there are 5 ways to choose the first person and 4 ways to choose the second person. However, it's important to note that choosing person A and then person B is the same as choosing person B and then person A, so we must divide by 2 to account for this double counting.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between is given by:\n\n(5 * 4) / 2 = 10. \n\nSo, there are 10 different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between.",
