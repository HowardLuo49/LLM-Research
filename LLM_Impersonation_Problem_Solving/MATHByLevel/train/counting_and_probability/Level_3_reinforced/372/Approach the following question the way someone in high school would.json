    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so Cara is sitting at this circular table with her five friends. To find out how many different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between, we need to count the number of spaces between each pair of people.\n\nLet's start by counting by going around the table. So between Cara and the person to her right, there's one space. Then between Cara and the next person to her right, there are two spaces. We keep going around like this until we reach 5 spaces between Cara and the person to her left.\n\nSo, the possible pairs are:\n1 space, 2 spaces, 3 spaces, 4 spaces, 5 spaces\n\nThat makes a total of 5 different possible pairs of people Cara could be sitting between.",
