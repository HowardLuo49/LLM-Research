Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, what is the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have to figure out the probability of having at least one boy and one girl in a family of three children. Let's think about all the possible ways this could happen.\n\nFirst, let's look at the ways a family of three children could be all boys or all girls. This could happen in two ways - either all boys or all girls.\n\nSo now, let's think about the ways a family of three children could have at least one boy and one girl. This could happen in four ways - boy, girl, girl / girl, boy, girl / boy, girl, girl / boy, boy, girl.\n\nSo the probability of having at least one boy and one girl in a family of three children is 4 out of 8 possibilities. This simplifies to 1 out of 2 or 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/2.",
