    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",

There are four possibilities for the gender of the three children: BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, GGG. \nOut of these possibilities, three include at least one boy and one girl: BBG, BGB, GBB. \nSo, the probability of having at least one boy and one girl is 3 out of 4. \nThat means the answer is 3/4!
