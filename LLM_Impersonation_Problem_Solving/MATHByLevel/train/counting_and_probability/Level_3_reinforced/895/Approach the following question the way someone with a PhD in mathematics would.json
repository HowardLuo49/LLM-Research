Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, what is the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. \n\nLet's first calculate the probability that the three children in a family are all boys or all girls. \n\nThe probability of having all boys is (1/2)^3 = 1/8, since the probability of each child being a boy is 1/2 and the events are independent. Similarly, the probability of having all girls is also 1/8. \n\nTherefore, the probability of having either all boys or all girls is 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4. \n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the three children include at least one boy and one girl. This is equivalent to finding the complement of the event where all children are boys or all children are girls. \n\nSo, the probability that the three children include at least one boy and one girl is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl is 3/4.",
