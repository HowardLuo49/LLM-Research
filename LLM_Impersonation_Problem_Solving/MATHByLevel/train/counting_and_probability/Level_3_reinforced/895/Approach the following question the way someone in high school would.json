    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, what is the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about all the possible combinations for having three children: BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, GGB, GBG, BGG, and GGG.\n\nOut of these combinations, the ones that include at least one boy and one girl are: BBG, BGB, GBB, and GGB. This means there are 4 favorable outcomes out of the total 8 possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of having at least one boy and one girl in a family of three children is 4/8, which simplifies to 1/2. So, the probability is 1/2.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{3?: Okay, so let's think about all the possible combinations for having three children: BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, GGB, GBG, BGG, and GGG.\n\nOut of these combinations, the ones that include at least one boy and one girl are: BBG, BGB, GBB, and GGB.
