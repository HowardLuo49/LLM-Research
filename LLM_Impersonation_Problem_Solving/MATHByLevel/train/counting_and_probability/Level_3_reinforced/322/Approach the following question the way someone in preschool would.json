    "solution": "We first have to figure out the different groups of 4 one-digit numbers whose product is 12.  We obviously can't use 12 as one of the numbers, nor can we use 9, 8, or 7 (none divides 12).  We can use 6, in which case one of the other numbers is 2 and the other two are 1s.  So, we can have the number 6211, or any number we can form by reordering these digits.  There are $4!$ ways to order these four numbers, but we have to divide by $2!$ because the two 1s are the same, so $4!$ counts each possible number twice.  That gives us $4!/2!=12$ numbers that consist of 6, 2, and two 1s.\n\nNext, we note that we can't have a 5, so we think about 4.  If we have a 4, then the other three numbers are 3, 1, 1.  Just as there are 12 ways to order the digits in 6211, there are 12 ways to order the digits in 4311.  Finally, we check if there are any ways to get a product of 12 with digits that are 3 or less.  There's only one such group, the digits in 3221.  As with 6211 and 4311, there are 12 distinct ways to order the digits in 3221.\n\nCombining our three cases, we have $12+12+12=\\boxed{36}$ possible integers.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. To find out how many four-digit numbers have a product of 12 for their digits, we can start by listing out all the possible combinations of digits that multiply to equal 12. We can do this by breaking down 12 into its prime factors, which are 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the possible combinations of digits that multiply to equal 12 are:\n1, 1, 2, 6\n1, 2, 2, 3\n1, 3, 2, 2\n2, 1, 3, 2\n2, 2, 1, 3\n2, 3, 1, 2\n3, 1, 2, 2\n3, 2, 1, 2\n\nNow, we need to find out how many different ways we can arrange these digits to form a four-digit number. For example, for the combination 1, 1, 2, 6, there are 4!/(2!*1!*1!) = 12 different four-digit numbers we can make (1126, 1162, 1216, 1261, 1612, 1621, 2116, 2161, 2611, 6112, 6121, 6211).\n\nSo, by doing this for each possible combination of digits that multiply to 12, we can find all the distinct four-digit numbers that have a product of 12 for their digits. I'll need a lot of paper and crayons to figure this out!",
