Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup?",
    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 3 starters from the remaining 11 players. Since the order of selection does not matter, we can use combinations to calculate this. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 starters from 11 players is given by the combination formula: \n\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11-3)!) = 165\n\nNow, since all three triplets must be in the starting lineup, we need to account for the fact that they are already chosen. This means that we only need to choose 3 starters from the remaining 11 players. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 6 starters with all three triplets in the lineup is:\n\n165 ways to choose the remaining 3 starters * 1 way to choose the triplets = 165 ways. \n\nSo, there are 165 ways to choose 6 starters with all three triplets in the lineup.",
