    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have the three triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna. Let's think about getting them on the team first because they need to be starters. Once they are in, we need to choose 3 more players. So first, let's put the triplets on the team. Once they are on, we need to choose 3 more players from the remaining 11 players. That makes a total of 11 players to choose from to make up the rest of the starting lineup. So, the total number of ways to choose 6 starters with all three triplets is 11 choose 3, which is 165 ways. Yay for volleyball!",
