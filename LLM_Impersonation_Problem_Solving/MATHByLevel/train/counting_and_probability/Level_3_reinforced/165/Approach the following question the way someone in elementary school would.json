Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup?",
    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways we can choose 6 starters with all three triplets in the lineup, we first need to make sure Alicia, Amanda, and Anna are in the lineup. So that leaves us with 3 spots to fill with the remaining 11 players.\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose those 3 players from the remaining 11, we will use a combination formula. The formula is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!. In this case, n = 11 and r = 3.\n\nSo, 11C3 = 11! / 3!(11-3)! = 11! / 3!8! = (11 x 10 x 9) / (3 x 2 x 1) = 990 / 6 = 165.\n\nTherefore, there are 165 ways to choose the 3 additional starters once Alicia, Amanda, and Anna are already in the lineup. So overall, there are 165 ways to choose 6 starters with all three triplets in the lineup.",
