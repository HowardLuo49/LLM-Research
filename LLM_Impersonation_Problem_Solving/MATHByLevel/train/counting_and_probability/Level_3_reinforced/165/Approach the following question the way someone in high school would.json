    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we first need to choose the 3 triplets to be in the starting lineup. Since they all have to be in the lineup, there is only 1 way to choose them.\n\nThen, we need to choose the remaining 3 starters from the remaining 11 players who are not triplets. We can do this in \\(\\binom{11}{3} = 165\\) ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 6 starters with all three triplets in the lineup is 1 * 165 = 165 ways.",
