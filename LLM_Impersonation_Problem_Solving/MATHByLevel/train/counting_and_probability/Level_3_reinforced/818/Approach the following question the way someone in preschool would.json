    "solution": "Look at the coefficients of the powers of 101: 1, -4, 6, -4, 1. You might recognize these as $\\binom40$, $-\\binom41$, $\\binom42$, $-\\binom43$, $\\binom44$. This suggests that the Binomial Theorem is in play. Indeed, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(101 + (-1))^4 &= \\binom40 \\cdot 101^{4} \\cdot (-1)^0 + \\binom41 \\cdot 101^{3} \\cdot (-1)^1 + \\\\\n&\\phantom{=} \\binom42 \\cdot 101^2 \\cdot (-1)^2 + \\binom43 \\cdot 101^1 \\cdot (-1)^3 + \\\\\n&\\phantom{=} \\binom44 \\cdot 101^0 \\cdot (-1)^4\\\\\n& = 101^{4} - 4 \\cdot 101^{3} + 6 \\cdot 101^2 - 4 \\cdot 101 + 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we have $(101 + (-1))^4 = 100^4 = \\boxed{100000000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, that's a big number! Let's see if we can figure it out together. Let's start by looking at the pattern. Hmmm... I see that each term has 101 in it. Maybe we can use that to help us. \n\nLet's break it down. We can see that the expression is actually $(101-1)^4$. That means we can use the pattern (a-b)^4 = a^4 - 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 - 4ab^3 + b^4. \n\nIn this case, a = 101 and b = 1. So now we can substitute those values into the pattern. \n\n$(101-1)^4 = 101^4 - 4\\cdot101^3 \\cdot 1 + 6\\cdot101^2\\cdot1^2 - 4\\cdot101\\cdot1^3 + 1^4$\n\nNow, we can just simplify that expression. Since 1^4 = 1 and any number raised to the 1st power stays the same, the final answer is:\n\n$101^4 - 4\\cdot101^3 + 6\\cdot101^2 - 4\\cdot101 + 1 = (101-1)^4 = 100^4$ \n\nAnd that's our final answer! Yay, we did it! Great job!",
