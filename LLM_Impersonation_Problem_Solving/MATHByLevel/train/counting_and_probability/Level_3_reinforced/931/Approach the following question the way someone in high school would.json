    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",
