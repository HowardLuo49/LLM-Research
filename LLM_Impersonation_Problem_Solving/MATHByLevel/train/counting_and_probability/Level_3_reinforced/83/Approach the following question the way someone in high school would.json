    "solution": "In this problem, we only need to count the number of ways to split 4 items into two groups.  There are only 3 ways: $\\{4,0\\}$, $\\{3,1\\}$ and $\\{2,2\\}$.  Therefore, there are only $\\boxed{3}$ ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls in 2 indistinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to consider how many ways we can distribute the balls into the boxes. Since the balls are indistinguishable, the only thing that matters is how many balls are in each box.\n\nWe can have:\n- 0 balls in Box 1 and 4 balls in Box 2\n- 1 ball in Box 1 and 3 balls in Box 2\n- 2 balls in each box\n- 3 balls in Box 1 and 1 ball in Box 2\n- 4 balls in Box 1 and 0 balls in Box 2\n\nSo, there are 5 ways to distribute the balls into the boxes.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.",
