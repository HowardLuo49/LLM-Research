    "solution": "In this problem, we only need to count the number of ways to split 4 items into two groups.  There are only 3 ways: $\\{4,0\\}$, $\\{3,1\\}$ and $\\{2,2\\}$.  Therefore, there are only $\\boxed{3}$ ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls in 2 indistinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see... there are 4 balls and 2 boxes. Since the balls are all the same and the boxes are all the same, it doesn't matter which ball goes in which box. So, we can just think about how many balls are in each box. The options are: \n- 4 balls in one box and 0 balls in the other box\n- 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other box\n- 2 balls in each box\n- 1 ball in one box and 3 balls in the other box\n- 0 balls in one box and 4 balls in the other box\n\nSo, there are 5 different ways to put the 4 indistinguishable balls into the 2 indistinguishable boxes.",
