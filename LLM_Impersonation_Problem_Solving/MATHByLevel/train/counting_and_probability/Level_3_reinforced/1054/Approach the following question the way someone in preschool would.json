    "solution": "We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1. A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$. There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\\frac{1}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's see what we can learn about adding two dice together! First, we need to know what numbers are on a dice. There are numbers from 1 to 6 on each dice. When we add them together, the smallest sum we can get is 1+1=2.\n\nThe question asks us about the probability that the sum is greater than three. So we need to find out how many combinations of two dice will give us a sum greater than three. Let's count them together:\n\n- When we roll a 1 on one dice, the other dice can be 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's 4 combinations.\n- When we roll a 2 on one dice, the other dice can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's 5 combinations.\n- When we roll a 3 on one dice, the other dice can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's 6 combinations.\n- When we roll a 4 on one dice, the other dice can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's 6 combinations.\n- When we roll a 5 on one dice, the other dice can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. That's 6 combinations.\n- When we roll a 6 on one dice, the other dice can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. That's 6 combinations.\n\nLet's add up all these combinations: 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 33 combinations.\n\nSo, there are 33 combinations where the sum is greater than three. Now, let's find out the total number of possible combinations when rolling two dice. There are 6 options on the first dice and 6 options on the second dice, so the total number of combinations is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\nThe probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability that the sum is greater than three is 33/36, which simplifies to 11/12.\n\nYay, we did it! We learned all about adding two dice together and found the probability of getting a sum greater than three! Good job, friends!",
