    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The three-digit positive integer $N$ has a ones digit of 3. What is the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if a number is divisible by 3, we typically check if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. In this case, since the ones digit of $N$ is 3, we can express $N$ as $100a + 10b + 3$, where $a$ and $b$ represent the hundreds and tens digits, respectively.\n\nSince $N$ is a three-digit positive integer, $1 \\leq a \\leq 9$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 9$. Knowing that the sum of the digits of $N$ is $a + b + 3$, we need this sum to be divisible by 3 in order for $N$ to be divisible by 3.\n\nFor $a = 1$, $b$ can take on values 0 through 9, resulting in the following possibilities for $N$:\n103, 113, 123, 133, 143, 153, 163, 173, 183, 193\n\nOut of these 10 possibilities, only 7 have a sum of digits divisible by 3. Thus, the probability that a random three-digit positive integer with a ones digit of 3 is divisible by 3 is $\\frac{7}{10}$.",
