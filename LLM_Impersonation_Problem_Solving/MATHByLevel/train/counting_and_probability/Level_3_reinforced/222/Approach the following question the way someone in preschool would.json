    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find out how many three-digit numbers have a ones digit of 3. We can count them on our fingers: 103, 113, 123, 133, ..., 993. There are 10 of them in total.\n\nNext, let's see how many of those numbers are divisible by 3. To do that, we can add up all the digits: 1 + 0 + 3 = 4, 1 + 1 + 3 = 5, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, ..., 9 + 9 + 3 = 21. \n\nWe find that 6, 15, and 3 are divisible by 3, but 4, 5, and 21 are not. So, there are 3 out of 10 numbers that are divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the three-digit number $N$ is divisible by 3 is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
