    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{14}=\\binom{27}{14}$, so $n=14$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{27}{14}=\\binom{27}{27-14}=\\binom{27}{13}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{12}=\\binom{27}{13}$, so $n=12$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $12$ and $14$, so the sum is $12+14=\\boxed{26}$.",

The question is asking us to find the sum of all possible numbers for $n$ when the formula $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$ is true. First, we need to know what $\\binom{26}{13}$ and $\\binom{27}{14}$ are! Maybe we can use our counting fingers to help us. Can you help me count how many ways we can choose 13 things out of 26? Great! Let's do the same to find out how many ways we can choose 14 things out of 27. Hmm... now all we have to do is find out what values of $n$ make those two numbers add up to $\\binom{27}{14}$! Let's try out some numbers and see which ones work. I think we can do it if we count carefully together!",
