    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of five-digit palindromes, we need to think about what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a number that is the same forwards and backwards. \n\nFor example, 12321 is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nTo find the number of five-digit palindromes, we need to think about the structure of a palindrome. In a five-digit palindrome, the first two digits must be the same as the last two digits. \n\nSo, we can think of a five-digit palindrome as a three-digit number followed by the reverse of that three-digit number. \n\nFor example, if we have the three-digit number 123, the five-digit palindrome would be 12321. \n\nTo find the number of five-digit palindromes, we need to count the number of possible three-digit numbers. \n\nThere are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), 10 choices for the second digit (0-9), and 10 choices for the third digit (0-9). So there are 9 x 10 x 10 = 900 possible three-digit numbers. \n\nSince each three-digit number creates a unique five-digit palindrome, there are 900 five-digit palindromes. \n\nSo, the number of five-digit palindromes is 900.",
