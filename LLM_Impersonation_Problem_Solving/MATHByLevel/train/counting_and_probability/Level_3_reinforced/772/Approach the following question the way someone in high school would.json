    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of five-digit palindromes, we must first understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nIn a five-digit palindrome, the first and last digits must be the same, as well as the second and fourth digits. This means that the middle digit can be any number from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, the first digit has 9 options (1-9, as 0 is not allowed for the first digit), the second and fourth digits each have 10 options, and the last digit has 1 option (it must be the same as the first digit).\n\nTherefore, the total number of five-digit palindromes is 9 * 10 * 10 * 1 = 900.\n\nSo, there are 900 five-digit palindromes.",
