    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have 3 characters on the license plate. The first character has to be a letter, the last character has to be a digit, and the middle character has to be either a letter or a digit. Also, we want two characters on the license plate to be the same.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- For the first character, we have 26 options (A-Z).\n- For the last character, we have 10 options (0-9).\n- For the repeating character, we have 36 options (26 letters + 10 digits).\n- For the third character (middle), we have 35 options (36 options - 1 option already chosen).\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose a license plate with these restrictions, we multiply the number of options for each character:\n26 options * 36 options * 35 options = 32,760 ways\n\nSo, there are 32,760 ways for you to choose a license plate with these restrictions.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 520?: Okay, so we have 3 characters on the license plate. The first character has to be a letter, the last character has to be a digit, and the middle character has to be either a letter or a digit.
