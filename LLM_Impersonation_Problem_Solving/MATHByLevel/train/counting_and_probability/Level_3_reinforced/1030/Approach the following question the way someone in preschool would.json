    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \\}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see which pairs of numbers we can choose! We have -5, -8, 7, 4, and -2. If we pick two numbers, we can either multiply them to get a positive number or a negative number.\n\nTo get a negative number when we multiply, we need one number to be positive and one number to be negative. So let's see which pairs we can choose to get a negative product:\n\n-5 and 7,\n-8 and 4,\n-8 and -2.\n\nThat's 3 pairs out of all the possible pairs we can choose. So the probability of choosing two numbers that have a negative product is 3 out of the total number of pairs we can choose.\n\nSo, the probability is 3/10 because there are 3 pairs out of 10 possible pairs we can make.",
