    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \\}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we first need to see how many ways we can choose two numbers to multiply together to get a negative number. \n\nFirst, we see that if we choose two negative numbers, their product will be positive. So we can't choose two negative numbers.\n\nNext, if we choose a negative number and a positive number, their product will be negative. We have 3 negative numbers and 2 positive numbers to choose from, so there are 3 ways to choose one negative number and one positive number.\n\nSo, there are 3 ways to get a product that is negative. And there are a total of 5 choose 2, which is 10, ways to choose any pair of numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/10.",
