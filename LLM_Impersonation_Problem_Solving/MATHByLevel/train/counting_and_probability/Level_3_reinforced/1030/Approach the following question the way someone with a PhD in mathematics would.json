    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two different integers are randomly chosen from the set $$\\{ -5, -8, 7, 4, -2 \\}.$$ What is the probability that their product is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We don't consider the order that we choose integers in this problem, meaning that choosing a $-5$ and then a $-8$ is the same as choosing a $-8$ and then a $-5$. The product of two integers is negative if one integer is positive and the other is negative. There are three ways to choose a negative integer and two ways to choose a positive integer, for a total of $3\\cdot2=6$ ways to choose both integers. There are $$\\binom{5}{2}=\\frac{5!}{2!3!}=10$$ ways to choose any two different integers, so the probability that the two integers have a negative product is $6/10=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of two randomly chosen integers is negative, we first need to determine the total number of ways in which two integers can be selected from the given set.\n\nThere are a total of 5 integers in the set, so the total number of ways to choose 2 integers is given by the combination formula ${5 \\choose 2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of ways in which the product of the two integers is negative. For the product to be negative, we must select one negative integer and one positive integer.\n\nThe set contains 3 negative integers and 2 positive integers. Therefore, the number of ways to select one negative integer and one positive integer is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\nThus, the probability that the product of two randomly chosen integers is negative is $\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$.",
