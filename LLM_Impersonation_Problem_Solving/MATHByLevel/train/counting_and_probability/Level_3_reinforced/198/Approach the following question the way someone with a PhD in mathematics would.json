    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we calculate the weighted average of the outcomes multiplied by their probabilities.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the worth of a single coin flip. We have two possible outcomes: gaining $\\$3$ with probability $\\frac34$ and losing $\\$8$ with probability $\\frac14$. Thus, the expected value of $X$ is given by:\n\n$\\mathbb{E}[X] = (3)(\\frac34) + (-8)(\\frac14) = \\frac{9}{4} - 2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\frac{1}{4}$, which is equivalent to $\\$0.25$.",
