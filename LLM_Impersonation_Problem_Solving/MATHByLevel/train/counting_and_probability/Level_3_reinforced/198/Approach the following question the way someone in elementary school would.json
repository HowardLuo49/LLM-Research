A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the expected value of flipping heads and the expected value of flipping tails. \n\nThe expected value of flipping heads is $3 \\cdot \\frac34 = 2.25$.\n\nThe expected value of flipping tails is $-8 \\cdot \\frac14 = -2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the overall expected worth of a coin flip by adding the expected values together:\n\n$2.25 - 2 = 0.25$\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\$0.25$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\$0.25?: First, we need to find the expected value of flipping heads and the expected value of flipping tails. \n\nThe expected value of flipping heads is $3 \\cdot \\frac34 = 2.25$.\n\nThe expected value of flipping tails is $-8 \\cdot \\frac14 = -2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the overall expected worth of a coin flip by adding the expected values together:\n\n$2.25 - 2 = 0.25$\n\nSo, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\$0.25$.",
