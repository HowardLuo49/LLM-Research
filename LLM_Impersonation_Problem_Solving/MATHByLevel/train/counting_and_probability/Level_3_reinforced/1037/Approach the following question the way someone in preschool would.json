    "solution": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, let's first think about all the possible outcomes when Mahmoud tosses three coins. \n\nThere are 2 possibilities for each coin - either it's a head or a tail. So, if we toss three coins, there are 2*2*2 = 8 possible outcomes: \n\n1. HHH\n2. HHT\n3. HTH\n4. HTT\n5. THH\n6. THT\n7. TTH\n8. TTT\n\nNow, let's see which outcomes have at least one head:\n1. HHH\n2. HHT\n3. HTH\n4. THH\n\nThere are 4 out of 8 outcomes where Mahmoud will get at least one head. So, the probability of getting at least one head when tossing three coins is 4/8 = 1/2. \n\nSo, there is a 50% chance that Mahmoud will get at least one head when tossing three coins. Yay!",
