    "solution": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head, we need to consider all the possible outcomes when tossing three coins. \n\nThere are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes when tossing three coins (since each coin has 2 possible outcomes, heads or tails). \n\nOut of these 8 possibilities, the only outcome that does not have at least one head is when all three coins land on tails. There is only 1 way to get this outcome. \n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least one head is 1 - (1/8) = 7/8. \n\nSo, the probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head when tossing three coins is 7/8.",
