    "solution": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head when tossing three coins, we can consider the complementary event - the probability of getting no heads.\n\nWhen tossing a fair coin, the probability of getting a head or a tail is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of getting three tails when tossing three coins is (0.5)^3 = 0.125.\n\nThe complementary event to getting no heads is getting at least one head, so the probability of getting at least one head when tossing three coins is 1 - 0.125 = 0.875.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head when tossing three coins is 0.875 or 87.5%.",
