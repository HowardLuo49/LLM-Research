    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If the chance of snow is $\\frac{3}{4}$, that means the chance of no snow is $\\frac{1}{4}$. To find the probability of no snow for all three days, we need to multiply the probabilities together. \n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$\n\nSo the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",

To find the probability of no snow for all three days, we need to multiply the probabilities together. \n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$\n\nSo the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
