    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days, we first need to figure out the probability that it will snow each day. \n\nSince the probability of snow for each day is $\\frac{3}{4}$, that means the probability of not snowing each day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nTo find the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days, we need to multiply the probability of not snowing each day together. \n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$\n\nSo, the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
