    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so if the probability of snow for each of the next three days is $\\frac{3}{4}$, then the probability of no snow for each day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nTo find the probability of no snow at all during the next three days, we need to multiply the probabilities of no snow for each day together. \n\nSo, the probability of no snow for all three days is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{1?: Ok, so if the probability of snow for each of the next three days is $\\frac{3}{4}$, then the probability of no snow for each day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nTo find the probability of no snow at all during the next three days, we need to multiply the probabilities of no snow for each day together. \n\nSo, the probability of no snow for all three days is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
