    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we need to count how many ways we can draw one blue chip and one yellow chip. \n\nThere are 5 blue chips, so the probability of drawing a blue chip on the first draw is 5 out of 8 (5 blue chips out of a total of 8 chips).\n\nThen, after we place the first chip back in the bag, there are still 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips. So, the probability of drawing a yellow chip on the second draw is 3 out of 8 (3 yellow chips out of a total of 8 chips).\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together: \n(5/8) * (3/8) = 15/64 \n\nSo, the probability of drawing two chips of different colors is 15/64.",
