    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors, we need to consider the total number of ways to draw two chips and the number of ways to draw two chips of different colors.\n\nThere are 8 total chips in the bag, so there are 8 ways to choose the first chip. After replacing the first chip, there are still 8 total chips, so there are 8 ways to choose the second chip.\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose two chips of different colors, we need to consider the number of ways to choose one blue chip and one yellow chip. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in the bag, so there are 5 * 3 = 15 ways to choose one blue chip and one yellow chip.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is 15/64.",
