    "solution": "We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number. Each row has one more number than the previous row. Thus, we can see that row $n$ has $n+1$ numbers.\nSince we want the sum of numbers in the rows $0$ to $19$, we sum up every number from $1$ to $20$ to get $\\frac{(1+20)\\cdot 20}{2}=\\boxed{210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle, we first need to consider how many numbers are in each row. In the $n$th row, there are $n+1$ numbers. \n\nSo for the first row ($n=0$), there is $0+1=1$ number. \nFor the second row ($n=1$), there are $1+1=2$ numbers. \nFor the third row ($n=2$), there are $2+1=3$ numbers. \n\nWe can see that in general, the $n$th row has $n+1$ numbers. \n\nTo find the total number of numbers in the first $20$ rows, we need to sum up the numbers in each row from the $0$th row to the $19$th row. \n\nSo the total number of numbers is:\n$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 19 + 20$\n$= \\frac{20(20+1)}{2}$\n$= 10(21)$\n$= 210$\n\nTherefore, there are $210$ numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle.",
