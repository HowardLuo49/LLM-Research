    "solution": "We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number. Each row has one more number than the previous row. Thus, we can see that row $n$ has $n+1$ numbers.\nSince we want the sum of numbers in the rows $0$ to $19$, we sum up every number from $1$ to $20$ to get $\\frac{(1+20)\\cdot 20}{2}=\\boxed{210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number. Then we move to the $1$st row, which has $2$ numbers. Then the $2$nd row has $3$ numbers, and so on. We keep counting until we reach the $19$th row. Let's count out loud as we go along.  So if we count all the numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle, we will find out the total number of numbers. Let's start counting now!",
