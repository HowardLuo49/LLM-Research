    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Ben rolls 5 fair 12-sided dice.  The 12 faces of each die are numbered from 1 to 12. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we first need to know how many ways there are to roll 5 dice. \n\nThere are 12 choices for each die, so there are 12 x 12 x 12 x 12 x 12 = 12^5 total ways to roll 5 dice.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many ways we can roll exactly two even numbers. There are 6 even numbers on each die, so there are 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 = 6^5 ways to roll 5 dice with exactly two even numbers.\n\nFinally, we divide the number of ways to roll 5 dice with exactly two even numbers by the total number of ways to roll 5 dice to find the probability. \n\nSo, the probability is 6^5 / 12^5 = 7776 / 248832 = 0.03125 or about 3.125%.",
