    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "\"What is the probability that two of Ben's dice show an even number? Let's count the even numbers we can get on a 12-sided die. We have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. There are 6 even numbers out of 12 possible numbers. Now let's think about rolling 5 dice. Since we need exactly 2 even numbers, we can choose 2 out of the 5 dice to be even. The rest must be odd. That gives us 5 choose 2 options. Now all we have to do is multiply the probability of getting an even number (6/12) by the probability of getting an odd number (6/12) for the other dice. Finally, multiply that by the number of different ways we can get exactly 2 even numbers. That's our answer!\"",
