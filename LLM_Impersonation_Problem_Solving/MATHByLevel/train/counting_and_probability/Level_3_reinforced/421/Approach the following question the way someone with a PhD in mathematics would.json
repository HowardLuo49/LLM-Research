    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Ben rolls 5 fair 12-sided dice.  The 12 faces of each die are numbered from 1 to 12. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 12-sided dice.\n\nEach die has 12 sides, so the total number of outcomes for one die is 12. Therefore, for 5 dice, the total number of outcomes is 12^5.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose exactly 2 dice to show an even number. Since there are 5 dice in total, there are 5 choose 2 = 10 ways to choose 2 of them.\n\nFor each of these 10 ways, we need to calculate the probability that the chosen 2 dice show an even number. The probability of rolling an even number on one die is 6/12 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on exactly 2 out of 5 dice is (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^3 = 1/32.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to choose 2 dice by the probability of getting an even number on those dice, and then divide by the total number of outcomes to get the final probability:\n\nP(2 dice show an even number) = 10 * (1/32) / 12^5\n= 5 / 12^5\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is 5 / 12^5.",
