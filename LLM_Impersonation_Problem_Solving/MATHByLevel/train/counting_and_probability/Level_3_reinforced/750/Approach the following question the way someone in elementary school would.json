    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected number of digits when Brent rolls the die, we just need to see how many numbers have 1 digit and how many numbers have 2 digits.\n\nWell, the numbers 1 to 9 have 1 digit, and the numbers 10 to 12 have 2 digits. Since there are 9 numbers with 1 digit and 3 numbers with 2 digits, the probability of getting a number with 1 digit is $9/12$ and the probability of getting a number with 2 digits is $3/12$.\n\nTo find the expected number of digits, we multiply the probability of getting each type of number by the number of digits that type of number has, and then add those together.\n\n$E = (9/12 \\cdot 1) + (3/12 \\cdot 2) = 9/12 + 6/12 = 15/12 = 1.25$\n\nSo, the expected number of digits when Brent rolls the die is 1.25.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 1.25?: To find the expected number of digits when Brent rolls the die, we just need to see how many numbers have 1 digit and how many numbers have 2 digits.\n\nWell, the numbers 1 to 9 have 1 digit, and the numbers 10 to 12 have 2 digits.
