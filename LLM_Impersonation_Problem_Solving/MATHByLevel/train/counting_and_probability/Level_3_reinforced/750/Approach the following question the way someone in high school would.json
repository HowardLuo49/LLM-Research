    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "When Brent rolls the die, he can get numbers from 1 to 12. To find the expected number of digits in the number he gets, we need to calculate the average number of digits for each number from 1 to 12.\n\nNumbers 1 to 9 have 1 digit.\nNumbers 10 to 12 have 2 digits.\n\nThere are 9 numbers with 1 digit and 3 numbers with 2 digits.\n\nThe expected number of digits in the number he obtains is calculated as:\n$$\\left(\\frac{9}{12}\\cdot 1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{12}\\cdot 2\\right) = \\frac{9}{12} + \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{15}{12} = 1.25.$$\n\nSo, the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains is 1.25.",
