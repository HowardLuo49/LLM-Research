    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected number of digits, we need to look at each number on the die and count how many digits it has. \n\nLet's start with the numbers 1 to 9. These numbers have only one digit. So we have 9 numbers with 1 digit.\n\nNext, let's look at the numbers 10 to 99. These numbers have two digits. There are 3 numbers on the die that fall into this category: 10, 11, 12.\n\nSo, the expected number of digits is $\\frac{9\\cdot1 + 3\\cdot2}{12}=\\frac{9+6}{12}=\\frac{15}{12}=1.25$. \n\nSo, the expected number of digits in the number Brent obtains is 1.25.",
