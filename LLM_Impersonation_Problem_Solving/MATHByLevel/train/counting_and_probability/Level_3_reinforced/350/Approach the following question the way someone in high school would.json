    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits?",
    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits, we need to think about the possible choices for each digit.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, we have 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).\n\nFor the tens and units digits, we have 7 choices for each (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits is 8 * 7 * 7 = 392.\n\nSo, there are 392 three-digit whole numbers that fit these criteria.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 448?: To find the number of three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits, we need to think about the possible choices for each digit.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, we have 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).\n\nFor the tens and units digits, we have 7 choices for each (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits is 8 * 7 * 7 = 392.\n\nSo, there are 392 three-digit whole numbers that fit these criteria.",
