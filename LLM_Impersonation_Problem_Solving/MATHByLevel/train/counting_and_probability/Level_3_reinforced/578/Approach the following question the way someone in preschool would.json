    "solution": "The probability of getting two tails followed by one head is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  The probability of getting a tail followed by a head followed by a tail is also $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  Finally, the probability of getting a head followed by two tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$ as well.  In total, the probability of getting two tails and one head is $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If we throw three coins, there are eight possible outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT. \nAmong these outcomes, there are three ways to get two tails and one head: HTT, THT, TTH. \nSo the probability of getting two tails and one head is 3/8.",
