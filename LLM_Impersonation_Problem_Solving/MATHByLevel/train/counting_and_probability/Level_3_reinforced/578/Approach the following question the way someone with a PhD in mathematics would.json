    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If three coins are tossed at the same time, what is the probability of getting two tails and one head? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of getting two tails followed by one head is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  The probability of getting a tail followed by a head followed by a tail is also $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  Finally, the probability of getting a head followed by two tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$ as well.  In total, the probability of getting two tails and one head is $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and probability. \n\nWhen tossing three coins, there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes, as each coin can either show heads or tails. These outcomes are:\n\nHHH\nHHT\nHTH\nTHH\nHTT\nTHT\nTTH\nTTT\n\nOut of these 8 outcomes, we are interested in the outcomes where there are two tails and one head. These outcomes are:\n\nHTT\nTHT\nTTH\n\nThere are 3 favorable outcomes out of 8 total outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting two tails and one head when tossing three coins is given by:\nProbability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes\nProbability = 3/8\n\nSo, the probability of getting two tails and one head when tossing three coins is 3/8 or 0.375.",
