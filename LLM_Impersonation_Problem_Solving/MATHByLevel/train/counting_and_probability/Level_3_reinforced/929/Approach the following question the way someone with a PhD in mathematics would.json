I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The number of ways to choose a team of k players from a group of n players is given by the formula C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"n!\" denotes the factorial of n.\n\nIn this case, we have 15 players and we want to choose a starting team of 7 players, including one goalie. Therefore, we need to choose 1 player from the 15 to be the goalie, and then choose the remaining 6 players from the remaining 14 players.\n\nThe number of ways to choose the starting goalie is C(15,1) = 15! / (1!(15-1)!) = 15 ways.\n\nAfter selecting the goalie, we need to choose the remaining 6 players from the remaining 14 players. The number of ways to do this is C(14,6) = 14! / (6!(14-6)!) = 3003 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose the starting team is 15 * 3003 = 45,045 ways.",
