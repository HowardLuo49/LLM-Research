I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",

So that means we have 14 friends left to choose from for the other 6 spots. \n\nSo, to find out how many ways we can choose our starting team, we need to do some counting. Let's count together... 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. \n\nSo there are 14 x 13 x 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 = 87,712 ways we can choose our starting team! Yay, we did it!",
