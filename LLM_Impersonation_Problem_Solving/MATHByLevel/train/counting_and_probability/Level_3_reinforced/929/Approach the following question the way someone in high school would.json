    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Our water polo team has 15 members.  I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In high school, we would approach this question by first realizing that we need to choose 7 players from a total of 15. To account for the fact that one of the players must be the goalie, we will first choose the goalie and then choose the remaining 6 players.\n\nTo choose the goalie, we have 15 options. After choosing the goalie, we are left with 14 players from which to choose the remaining 6 players.\n\nThis means we have 15 choices for the goalie, and then 14 choose 6 ways to choose the remaining players.\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\n15C1 * 14C6 = 15 * 3003 = 45,045\n\nSo, there are 45,045 ways to choose a starting team with 1 goalie and 6 interchangeable players from a water polo team of 15 members.",
