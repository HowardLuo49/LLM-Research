So, to find the probability that they all are white, we need to see how many ways we can choose 5 white balls out of the total balls in the box. \n\nLet's see, there are 5 white balls and 6 black balls, so that's a total of 11 balls in the box. Now, how many ways can we choose 5 white balls out of 5 total white balls? \n\nHmm, it looks like there is only 1 way to choose 5 white balls out of 5 total white balls. So, the probability that they all are white is 1 out of 1.\n\nYay, we did it! All white balls!",
