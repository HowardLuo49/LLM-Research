    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box.  There is only $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5.  This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{462}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that all five balls drawn are white, we first need to calculate the total number of ways to draw 5 balls out of the box.\n\nThere are a total of 11 balls in the box, so there are 11 choose 5 ways to draw 5 balls out of the box, which is equal to 11! / (5! * 6!) = 462 ways.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to draw 5 white balls out of the box. There are 5 white balls in the box, so there are 5 choose 5 ways to draw all 5 white balls, which is equal to 1 way.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all five balls drawn are white is 1 out of 462, which simplifies to 1/462.",
