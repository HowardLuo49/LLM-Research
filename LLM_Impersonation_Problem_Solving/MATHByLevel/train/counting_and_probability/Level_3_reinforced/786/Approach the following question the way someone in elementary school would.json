    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of rolling a perfect square, we need to know the total possible outcomes and the outcomes that result in a perfect square.\n\nThere are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 different outcomes when rolling two standard 6-sided dice.\n\nNow, let's find the outcomes that result in a perfect square:\n- The possible perfect squares we can roll are 4 (2+2) and 9 (3+3).\n- So there are 2 outcomes that result in a perfect square.\n\nTo find the probability, we need to divide the number of favorable outcomes (2) by the total number of possible outcomes (36):\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\nProbability = 2 / 36\nProbability = 1/18\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a perfect square when rolling two standard 6-sided dice is 1/18.",
