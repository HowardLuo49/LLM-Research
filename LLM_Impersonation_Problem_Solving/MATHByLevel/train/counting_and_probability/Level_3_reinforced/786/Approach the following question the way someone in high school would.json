    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the probability of rolling a sum that is a perfect square, first we need to figure out all the ways we can get a sum that is a perfect square. \n\nThe perfect squares we can roll are 4 and 9. To get a sum of 4, we can roll (1,3), (2,2), or (3,1) which means there are 3 ways to roll a sum of 4. To get a sum of 9, we can roll (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), or (6,3) which means there are 4 ways to roll a sum of 9.\n\nNext, we need to find all the possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Since each die has 6 sides, there are 6*6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of rolling a sum that is a perfect square by dividing the number of ways we can roll a perfect square by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nSo the probability of rolling a sum that is a perfect square is (3+4)/36 = 7/36 or about 0.194 or 19.4%.",
