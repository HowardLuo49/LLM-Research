    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many three-digit numbers satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits?",
    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the three-digit number be represented as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit. The property given states that B = (A + C)/2. \n\nSince A, B, and C are digits of a three-digit number, they must be integers from 0 to 9. We can list out the possibilities for A, B, and C:\n\nA=0, B=0, C=0\nA=0, B=0, C=1\nA=0, B=0, C=2\n...\nA=9, B=9, C=9\n\nFrom these possibilities, we see that there are 10 values each for A, B, and C (from 0 to 9). Since B is uniquely determined by A and C if the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits, we only need to consider the combinations of A and C that satisfy the equation B = (A + C)/2.\n\nLet's consider some examples:\n- If A=1 and C=1, then B=1.\n- If A=2 and C=6, then B=4.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that the possible values for B will be integers if (A + C) is even. This implies that either both A and C are odd or both A and C are even.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible values for A and C can be calculated by considering the cases when both A and C are even or both are odd. There are 5 even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), giving us a total of 5*5 = 25 possible combinations.\n\nThus, there are 25 three-digit numbers that satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits.",
