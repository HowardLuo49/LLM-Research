    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many three-digit numbers have the middle digit as the average of the first and last digits, we need to think about all the possibilities. \n\nLet's start by thinking about the first digit. It can be any number from 1 to 9, because we want the number to be three digits. \n\nNext, let's think about the last digit. It can also be any number from 1 to 9.\n\nNow, since the middle digit is the average of the first and last digits, that means it has to be halfway between them. That means that it can only be one specific number for each pair of first and last digits. \n\nFor example, if the first digit is 1 and the last digit is 9, the middle digit has to be 5 (because 5 is halfway between 1 and 9). Similarly, if the first digit is 2 and the last digit is 8, the middle digit has to be 5 again.\n\nSo, for each pair of first and last digits, there is only one possibility for the middle digit. That means there is only one three-digit number that satisfies this property for each pair of first and last digits.\n\nSince there are 9 choices for the first digit and 9 choices for the last digit, that means there are 9 * 9 = 81 three-digit numbers that have the middle digit as the average of the first and last digits.",
