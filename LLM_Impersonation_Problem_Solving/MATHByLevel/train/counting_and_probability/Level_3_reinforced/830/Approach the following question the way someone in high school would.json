    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many three-digit numbers satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and last digits, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible values for the first and last digits. Since our number is three digits, both the first and last digits can be any number from 1 to 9.\n\nNext, we need to find the middle digit, which is the average of the first and last digits. If we add the first and last digits together and then divide by 2, we get the middle digit.\n\nFor example, if we have the number 231, the first digit is 2, the last digit is 1, and the middle digit should be (2+1)/2 = 1.5, which is not a whole number. So this number does not satisfy the property.\n\nWe need to find how many three-digit numbers have a whole number as the middle digit when it's the average of the first and last digits.\n\nLet's list down all the possible combinations for the first, middle, and last digits and see how many of them give a whole number as the middle digit.\n\nFor the first and last digits from 1 to 9:\n\n1 1 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n...\n9 8 9\n9 9 9\n\nFrom this list, we can see that there are 9 possible combinations where the middle digit is a whole number. Therefore, there are 9 three-digit numbers that satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and last digits.",
