    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 6 distinct digits, there would be $6! = 720$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, 2! for the repetition of the digit 5, and again 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in 2! ways).  So, our answer is $\\frac{6!}{2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 2!} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In high school we would approach this question by considering all the possible ways we can arrange the digits to form a six-digit integer.\n\nFirst, let's consider the different possibilities for the leading digit. It can be either 2, 5 or 9.\n\nIf the leading digit is 2, there are 5 remaining spots to fill with the digits 2, 5, 5, 9 and 9. We have two 2's, two 5's and two 9's so there are a total of 5!/(2!2!) = 30 ways to arrange these digits.\n\nSimilarly, if the leading digit is 5 or 9, we also have 30 ways to arrange the remaining digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different positive, six-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 5, 5, 9 and 9 is 3 x 30 = 90.",
