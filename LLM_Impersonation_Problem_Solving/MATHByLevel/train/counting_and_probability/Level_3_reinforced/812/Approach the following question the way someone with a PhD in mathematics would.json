    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. To take quizzes, each of 30 students in a class is paired with another student. If the pairing is done randomly, what is the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend, Irma? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Among the 29 equally likely possibilities for Margo's partner, Irma is one of them.  Therefore, the probability that Margo's partner is Irma is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{29}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first determine the total number of possible pairings of the 30 students. This can be calculated using combinatorics, specifically the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of students (30 in this case) and k is the number of students in each pairing (2 in this case).\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible pairings is:\n\nC(30, 2) = 30! / (2! * (30-2)!) = 435\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways Margo can be paired with her best friend, Irma. Since each student is randomly paired with another student, the probability of Margo being paired with her best friend is simply 1 out of the total number of possible pairings (435).\n\nTherefore, the probability that Margo is paired with Irma is:\n\n1/435\n\nThus, the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend, Irma, is 1/435.",
