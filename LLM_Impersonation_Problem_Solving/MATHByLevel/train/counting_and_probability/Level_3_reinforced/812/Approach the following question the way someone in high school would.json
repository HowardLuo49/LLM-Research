If the pairing is done randomly, what is the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend, Irma? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Among the 29 equally likely possibilities for Margo's partner, Irma is one of them.  Therefore, the probability that Margo's partner is Irma is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{29}}$.",

We need to find out the probability that she's paired with her bestie, Irma.\n\nSince the pairing is done randomly, there are 29 other students Margo could be paired with. And out of those 29 students, only 1 of them is Irma. \n\nSo, the probability of Margo being paired with Irma is 1 out of 29, which can be simplified to 1/29.\n\nHope that helps!",
