If the pairing is done randomly, what is the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend, Irma? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Among the 29 equally likely possibilities for Margo's partner, Irma is one of them.  Therefore, the probability that Margo's partner is Irma is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{29}}$.",

Since the pairing is done randomly, there are 29 other students that she could be paired with. \n\nNow, we know that Margo has a best friend named Irma. So out of those 29 other students, only one of them is Irma. That means there is 1 way for Margo to be paired with Irma out of a total of 29 possible ways for her to be paired with any other student.\n\nSo the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend, Irma, is 1/29. Yay, we did it!",
