    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $A$ equal the number of four digit odd numbers.  Let $B$ equal the number of four digit multiples of 5.  Find $A+B$.",
    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find out how many four-digit odd numbers there are. We know that an odd number always ends in an odd digit, which means it can't end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since there are 5 choices for the units digit, we have 5 options for the last digit of our number.\n\nFor the thousands place, we have 9 choices (1-9), for the hundreds place we have 10 choices (0-9), and for the tens place we have 10 choices as well. So overall, we have $9\\cdot10\\cdot10\\cdot5=4500$ four-digit odd numbers.\n\nNext, let's find out how many four-digit multiples of 5 there are. Since multiples of 5 always end in 0 or 5, we have 2 choices for the units digit. \n\nFor the thousands place, we have 9 choices, for the hundreds place we have 10 choices, and for the tens place we have 10 choices. So overall, we have $9\\cdot10\\cdot10\\cdot2=1800$ four-digit multiples of 5.\n\nTherefore, $A+B=4500+1800=6300$. This is the final answer - 6300.",
