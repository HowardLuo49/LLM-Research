    "solution": "$43$ appears in the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle, since $\\binom{43}{1} = 43$. Note that $43$ is prime, so the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $43$ is actually $43$. Therefore, the $43$rd row is the first row in which $43$ appears. Also note that all the other numbers in the $43$rd row are greater than $43$, with the exception of the $1$'s on the ends. As a result, all the numbers on the following rows will either be $1$ or greater than $43$, so $43$ only appears in the $43$rd row. Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ row of Pascal's Triangle contains the number $43$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many rows of Pascal's Triangle contain the number $43$, we can look at each row one by one. We start by looking at the first row, which only has the number $1$. Then, we move on to the second row, which has the numbers $1$ and $1$. We keep going row by row until we find a row that contains the number $43$. \n\nAfter checking a few rows, we see that the number $43$ first appears in row $15$ of Pascal's Triangle. So, there are $15$ rows of Pascal's Triangle that contain the number $43$.",
