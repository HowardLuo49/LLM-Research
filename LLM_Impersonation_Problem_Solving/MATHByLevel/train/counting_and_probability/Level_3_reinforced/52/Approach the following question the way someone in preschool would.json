    "solution": "$43$ appears in the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle, since $\\binom{43}{1} = 43$. Note that $43$ is prime, so the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $43$ is actually $43$. Therefore, the $43$rd row is the first row in which $43$ appears. Also note that all the other numbers in the $43$rd row are greater than $43$, with the exception of the $1$'s on the ends. As a result, all the numbers on the following rows will either be $1$ or greater than $43$, so $43$ only appears in the $43$rd row. Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ row of Pascal's Triangle contains the number $43$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, to find out how many rows of Pascal's Triangle contain the number $43$, we can start by looking at the very top row which contains the number $1$. Then we can see if $43$ appears in any of the rows below. Let's count together - 1, 1... hmm, no $43$ yet. Let's keep going - 1, 2, 1... still no $43$. Let's keep going and see if $43$ shows up in any of the rows. Remember, each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it, so we have to add them up to find $43$. Let's keep counting and looking for $43$ together!",
