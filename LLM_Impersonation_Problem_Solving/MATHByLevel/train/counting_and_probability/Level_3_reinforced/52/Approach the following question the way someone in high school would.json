    "solution": "$43$ appears in the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle, since $\\binom{43}{1} = 43$. Note that $43$ is prime, so the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $43$ is actually $43$. Therefore, the $43$rd row is the first row in which $43$ appears. Also note that all the other numbers in the $43$rd row are greater than $43$, with the exception of the $1$'s on the ends. As a result, all the numbers on the following rows will either be $1$ or greater than $43$, so $43$ only appears in the $43$rd row. Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ row of Pascal's Triangle contains the number $43$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many rows of Pascal's Triangle contain the number $43$, we can use the formula for the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle, which is ${n-1 \\choose k-1}$, where $n$ is the row number and $k$ is the position within the row. \n\nIf we start from the top of Pascal's Triangle, we see that $43$ appears in the $43$rd row at the $2$nd position. Therefore, the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle contains the number $43$. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that there is only $1$ row of Pascal's Triangle that contains the number $43$.",
