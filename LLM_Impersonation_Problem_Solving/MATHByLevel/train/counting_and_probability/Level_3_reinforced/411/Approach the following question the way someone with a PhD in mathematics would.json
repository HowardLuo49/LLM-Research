(Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can think of it as arranging the animals within their respective species first, and then arranging the species themselves. \n\nFirst, let's consider the chickens. We have 4 chickens and we want to arrange them in a row of 4 cages. There are 4! = 24 ways to do this.\n\nNext, we consider the dogs. We have 2 dogs and we want to arrange them in a row of 2 cages. There are 2! = 2 ways to do this.\n\nFinally, we consider the cats. We have 5 cats and we want to arrange them in a row of 5 cages. There are 5! = 120 ways to do this.\n\nNow, we have arranged the animals within their species. To arrange the species themselves in the row of 11 cages, we have 3! = 6 ways to do this (since there are 3 species).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to place the animals in a row of 11 cages such that all animals of the same species are in adjacent cages is given by:\n\n24 * 2 * 120 * 6 = 34,560 \n\nTherefore, there are 34,560 ways to place the 11 animals in a row of 11 cages according to the conditions given.",
