    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats.  (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the chickens first! Since there are 4 chickens, they can be placed in 4! = 24 ways.\n\nNext, let's count the dogs! Since there are 2 dogs, they can be placed in 2! = 2 ways.\n\nFinally, let's count the cats! Since there are 5 cats, they can be placed in 5! = 120 ways.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to place the animals in a row of cages, we multiply the number of ways for each type of animal: 24 * 2 * 120 = 5,760 ways.\n\nSo, there are 5,760 ways to place the 11 animals in a row of cages! Yay!",
