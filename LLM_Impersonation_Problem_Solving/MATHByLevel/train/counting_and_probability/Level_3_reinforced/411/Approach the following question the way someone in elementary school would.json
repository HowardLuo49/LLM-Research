(Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$.",

That's 11 groups in total.\n\nNow, let's think about how many ways we can arrange these groups. We can arrange them in 11! (11 factorial) ways.\n\nBut within each group, the animals are distinguishable. So, we need to consider how many ways we can arrange the animals within each group. \n\nFor the chickens, there are 4! ways to arrange them within their group.\nFor the dogs, there are 2! ways to arrange them within their group.\nFor the cats, there are 5! ways to arrange them within their group.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange all the animals in a row of cages is 11! x 4! x 2! x 5! = 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 95,126,304,000. \n\nThat's a really big number!
