    "solution": "Each number from 1 to 6 has probability $\\dfrac16$ of being rolled, so the expected value is \\begin{align*}\nE &= \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times \\$1^2\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times \\$2^2\\right) + \\cdots + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6} \\times \\$6^2\\right) \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{6}(\\$1 + \\$4 + \\$9 + \\$16 + \\$25 + \\$36) \\\\\n&= \\$\\dfrac{91}{6} \\\\\n& \\approx \\boxed{\\$15.17}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's play with a fun dice! If I roll a 1, I get 1 dollar. If I roll a 2, I get 4 dollars. If I roll a 3, I get 9 dollars. If I roll a 4, I get 16 dollars. If I roll a 5, I get 25 dollars. And if I roll a 6, I get 36 dollars! Let's see what we get!\n\nTo find out our expected value, we add up all the possible wins and then divide by the total number of outcomes. So, our expected value is:\n\n(1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36) / 6 = 91 / 6 \u2248 15.17\n\nSo, my expected win is about $15.17 if we play this fun game! Yay!",
