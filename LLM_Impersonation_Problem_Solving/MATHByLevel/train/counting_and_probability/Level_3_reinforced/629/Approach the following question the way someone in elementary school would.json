    "solution": "Each number from 1 to 6 has probability $\\dfrac16$ of being rolled, so the expected value is \\begin{align*}\nE &= \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times \\$1^2\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times \\$2^2\\right) + \\cdots + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6} \\times \\$6^2\\right) \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{1}{6}(\\$1 + \\$4 + \\$9 + \\$16 + \\$25 + \\$36) \\\\\n&= \\$\\dfrac{91}{6} \\\\\n& \\approx \\boxed{\\$15.17}.\n\\end{align*}",
