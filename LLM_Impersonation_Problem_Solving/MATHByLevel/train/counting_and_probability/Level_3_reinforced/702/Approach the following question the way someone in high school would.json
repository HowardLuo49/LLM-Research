    "solution": "Since $12^n = 2^{2n} \\cdot 3^n$, we are looking for the largest value of $n$ such that $2^{2n}$ and $3^n$ are divisors of $20!$. $$ \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\qquad \\qquad \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\qquad \\qquad \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \\qquad \\qquad \\frac{2}{2} = 1 $$ The largest power of 2 that divides $20!$ is $2^{(10 + 5 + 2 + 1)} = 2^{18}$. $$ \\frac{20}{3} = 6 \\frac{2}{3} \\qquad \\qquad \\frac{6}{3} = 2 $$ The largest power of 3 that divides $20!$ is $3^{(6 + 2)} = 3^8$.  Since there are 18 powers of 2 and 8 powers of 3 in $20!$, we want the largest value of $n$ such that $2n \\le 18$ and $n \\le 8$, so $\\boxed{8}$ is the answer and $12^8$ is the largest power of 12 that divides $20!$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer $n$ for which $12^n$ evenly divides $20!$, we need to determine the number of times that the prime factor 2 appears in $20!$ and compare it to the number of times that the prime factor 3 appears in $20!$.\n\nFirst, let's find the exponent of 2 in $20!$. To do this, we divide 20 by 2 and keep track of the quotient:\n\n$\\frac{20}{2} = 10$\n$\\frac{10}{2} = 5$\n$\\frac{5}{2} = 2$\n$\\frac{2}{2} = 1$\n\nAdding up the quotients, we get $10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 18$. So, the exponent of 2 in $20!$ is 18.\n\nNext, let's find the exponent of 3 in $20!$. To do this, we divide 20 by 3 and keep track of the quotient:\n\n$\\frac{20}{3} = 6$\n$\\frac{6}{3} = 2$\n$\\frac{2}{3} = 0$ (Note: We stop at 0 because the next quotient is less than the divisor)\n\nAdding up the quotients, we get $6 + 2 = 8$. So, the exponent of 3 in $20!$ is 8.\n\nSince the prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3$, the largest $n$ would be limited by the least exponent among 2 and 3. In this case, the largest $n$ is 8, so the largest integer $n$ for which $12^n$ evenly divides $20!$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
