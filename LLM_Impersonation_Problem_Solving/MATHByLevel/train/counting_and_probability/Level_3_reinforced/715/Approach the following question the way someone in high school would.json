    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. I have 6 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 6 hats. The pants come in tan, black, blue, and gray. The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many outfit choices you have, you need to start by looking at the different color options for each item of clothing. \n\nFor shirts, you have 6 choices. \nFor pants, you have 4 choices. \nFor hats, you have 6 choices. \n\nHowever, you don't want to wear an outfit where all three items are the same color. So you need to subtract the outfits where all three items are the same color from the total number of outfit choices. \n\nTo calculate how many outfits have all items the same color, you need to multiply the number of choices for each category by the number of colors available:\n6 shirts x 1 pants x 1 hats = 6 outfits\n1 shirts x 4 pants x 1 hats = 4 outfits\n1 shirts x 1 pants x 6 hats = 6 outfits\n\nAdding these up, you have 6 + 4 + 6 = 16 outfits where all items are the same color. \n\nNow subtract this from the total number of possible outfits:\n6 shirts x 4 pants x 6 hats = 144 total outfits\n144 total outfits - 16 outfits with all items the same color = 128 different outfit choices.\n\nSo you have a total of 128 different outfit choices to choose from!",
