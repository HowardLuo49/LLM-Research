    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I have 6 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 6 hats. The pants come in tan, black, blue, and gray. The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the total number of outfits and then subtract the number of outfits where all items are the same color.\n\nThere are 4 colors of pants, 6 colors of shirts, and 6 colors of hats, for a total of 4 * 6 * 6 = 144 possible outfits. \n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of outfits where all items are the same color. There are 4 such outfits (one for each color of pants), so we subtract 4 from our total.\n\nHowever, we have also subtracted some outfits multiple times. Specifically, the outfits where the shirt and hat are the same color but the pants are different were subtracted twice. There are 2 outfits like this for each color of pants, for a total of 8 outfits. We need to add these back in.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unique outfits is 144 - 4 + 8 = 148.",
