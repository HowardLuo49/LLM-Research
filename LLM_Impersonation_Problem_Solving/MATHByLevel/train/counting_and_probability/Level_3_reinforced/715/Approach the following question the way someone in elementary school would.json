    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. I have 6 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 6 hats. The pants come in tan, black, blue, and gray. The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so I have 6 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 6 hats. That's a lot of choices! But I can't wear all three items in the same color, so I need to make sure I pick different colors for each item. \n\nLet's start by figuring out how many total outfits I could make if I didn't have that rule. I could wear any shirt with any pants and any hat, so that would be 6 shirts x 4 pants x 6 hats = 144 possible outfits. \n\nBut now we need to take out the outfits where all three items are the same color. There are 4 colors for pants, 6 colors for shirts, and 6 colors for hats. So for each color, there is only 1 outfit where all three items are that color. That's 4 colors x 1 outfit per color = 4 outfits we need to take out. \n\nSo if we subtract those 4 outfits from the total, we get 144 total outfits - 4 outfits = 140 outfits that I can wear where all three items are not the same color. \n\nThat's a lot of choices! I could wear a different outfit every day for almost half a year!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 140?: Okay, so I have 6 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 6 hats. That's a lot of choices!
