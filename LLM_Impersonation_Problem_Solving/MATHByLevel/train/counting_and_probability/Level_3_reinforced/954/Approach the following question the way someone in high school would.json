    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Tamika selects two different numbers at random from the set $\\{8,9,10\\}$ and adds them. Carlos takes two different numbers at random from the set $\\{3,5,6\\}$ and multiplies them. What is the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Tamika can get the numbers $8+9=17$, $8+10=18$, or $9+10=19$. Carlos can get $3\\times5=15$, $3\\times6=18$, or $5\\times6=30$. The possible ways to pair these are: $(17,15)$, $(17,18)$, $(17,30)$, $(18,15)$, $(18,18)$, $(18,30)$, $(19,15)$, $(19,18)$, $(19,30)$. Four of these nine pairs show Tamika with a higher result, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the possible outcomes, we need to consider all combinations of numbers that Tamika and Carlos could choose.\n\nFor Tamika, she could choose 8 and 9, 8 and 10, or 9 and 10. These sum up to 17, 18, and 19, respectively.\n\nFor Carlos, he could choose 3 and 5, 3 and 6, or 5 and 6. These multiply to 15, 18, and 30, respectively.\n\nNow let's compare the possible sums and products:\n- If Tamika chooses 8 and 9 (summing to 17), she beats Carlos' products of 15 and 18.\n- If Tamika chooses 8 and 10 (summing to 18), she only ties with Carlos' products of 18.\n- If Tamika chooses 9 and 10 (summing to 19), she beats Carlos' product of 18.\n\nSo, out of the 9 possible outcomes (3 ways for Tamika and 3 ways for Carlos), 5 outcomes result in Tamika's sum being greater than Carlos' product. Therefore, the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result is $\\frac{5}{9}$.",
