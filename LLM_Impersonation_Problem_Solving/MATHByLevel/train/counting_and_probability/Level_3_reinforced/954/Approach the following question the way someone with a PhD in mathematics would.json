    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Tamika selects two different numbers at random from the set $\\{8,9,10\\}$ and adds them. Carlos takes two different numbers at random from the set $\\{3,5,6\\}$ and multiplies them. What is the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Tamika can get the numbers $8+9=17$, $8+10=18$, or $9+10=19$. Carlos can get $3\\times5=15$, $3\\times6=18$, or $5\\times6=30$. The possible ways to pair these are: $(17,15)$, $(17,18)$, $(17,30)$, $(18,15)$, $(18,18)$, $(18,30)$, $(19,15)$, $(19,18)$, $(19,30)$. Four of these nine pairs show Tamika with a higher result, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine all possible outcomes for both Tamika and Carlos. \n\nTamika can choose any two numbers from the set $\\{8,9,10\\}$, which gives us a total of ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ possible outcomes. The sum of these outcomes are 17, 18, and 19.\n\nCarlos can choose any two numbers from the set $\\{3,5,6\\}$, which gives us a total of ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ possible outcomes. The product of these outcomes are 15, 18, and 30.\n\nNext, we determine the favorable outcomes where Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result. Tamika's possible outcomes are 17, 18, and 19, while Carlos' outcomes are 15, 18, and 30. \n\nThe favorable outcomes are when Tamika gets 17 with the product of 15 (17>15) and 19 with products of 15 and 18 (19>15 and 19>18). Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of Tamika's result being greater than Carlos' result is $\\frac{3}{3 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.",
