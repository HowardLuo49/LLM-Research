If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",
