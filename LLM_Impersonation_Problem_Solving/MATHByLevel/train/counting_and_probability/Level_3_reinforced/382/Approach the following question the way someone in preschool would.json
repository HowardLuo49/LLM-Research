If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the distance between two cities is less than 7000 miles, we need to look at the distances in the chart and see which pairs of cities meet this condition.\n\nLet's see, if we look at Bangkok, the distances to other cities are 6300, 6609, and 5944. None of these distances are less than 7000 miles, so Bangkok doesn't work for us.\n\nCape Town has distances of 6300, 11535, and 5989. The distance between Cape Town and Bangkok is 6300, which is less than 7000 miles. So, Cape Town and Bangkok are a good pair.\n\nFor Honolulu, the distances are 6609, 11535, and 7240. The distance between Honolulu and Bangkok is 6609, which is also less than 7000 miles. So, Honolulu and Bangkok are another good pair.\n\nLastly, for London, the distances are 5944, 5989, and 7240. The distance between London and Bangkok is 5944, which is less than 7000 miles. So, London and Bangkok make another good pair.\n\nSo, out of the possible pairs of cities, 3 of them have a distance less than 7000 miles. There are a total of $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of cities that can be chosen.\n\nThe probability that the distance between two randomly chosen cities is less than 7000 miles is $\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$.",
