If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pairs of cities that have an air distance of less than $7000$ miles and then divide by the total number of possible pairs of cities. \n\nLet's first identify the pairs of cities that have an air distance of less than $7000$ miles:\n\n1. Bangkok - Cape Town: $6300$ miles\n2. Bangkok - Honolulu: $6609$ miles\n3. Bangkok - London: $5944$ miles\n4. Cape Town - London: $5989$ miles\n\nThere are $4$ pairs of cities with an air distance of less than $7000$ miles. \n\nTo calculate the total number of possible pairs of cities, we need to count the total number of entries in the chart, excluding the diagonal. The total number of entries is $12$, and since each pair of cities is counted twice (once for each city), the total number of pairs of cities is $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen cities is less than $7000$ miles is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nSo, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
