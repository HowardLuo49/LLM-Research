If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen cities is less than 7000 miles, we need to count the number of city pairs with a distance less than 7000 miles and then divide by the total number of possible city pairs.\n\nLooking at the chart, the city pairs with distance less than 7000 miles are:\n1. Bangkok-Honolulu (6609 miles)\n2. London-Bangkok (5944 miles)\n3. London-Cape Town (5989 miles)\n4. Bangkok-London (5944 miles)\n\nSo, there are 4 city pairs with a distance less than 7000 miles. \n\nNow, we need to find the total number of possible city pairs. There are 4 cities, so the total number of possible pairs is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen cities is less than 7000 miles is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nSo, the answer is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
