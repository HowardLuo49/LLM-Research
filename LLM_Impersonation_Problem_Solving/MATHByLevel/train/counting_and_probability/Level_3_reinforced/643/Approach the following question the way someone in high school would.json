    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Bicycle license plates in Flatville each contain three letters. The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "solution": "Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n\nIf two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, $100-60=\\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.\n\nNote: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made, we need to maximize the number of combinations that can be created by adding two new letters to the existing sets.\n\nCurrently, there are $5$ choices for the first letter, $3$ choices for the second letter, and $4$ choices for the third letter, giving a total of $5 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 60$ possible combinations.\n\nTo maximize the number of additional license plates, we should add one new letter to the set with the fewest choices (set with $3$ letters) and one new letter to the set with the most choices (set with $5$ letters).\n\nIf we add one new letter to the set $\\{A,I,O\\}$ and one new letter to the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R,X\\},$ we will have $5$ choices for the first letter, $4$ choices for the second letter, and $5$ choices for the third letter, giving a total of $5 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 100$ possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, by adding two new letters in this way, the largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made is $100 - 60 = \\boxed{40}.$",
