The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "solution": "Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n\nIf two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, $100-60=\\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.\n\nNote: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the number of additional license plates that can be made by adding two letters, we want to add the letters to the sets that originally had the fewest choices. This will allow us to increase the number of possible combinations the most.\n\nInitially, the sets had 5, 3, and 4 letters each, for a total of $5 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 60$ license plates.\n\nBy adding two new letters to the set with only 3 letters, we will increase the total number of license plates the most. If we add two new letters to the set $\\{A,I,O\\}$, we will now have 5 choices for the second letter and 4 choices for the third letter, for a total of $5 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 100$ license plates. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made by adding two letters is $100 - 60 = 40$ additional license plates.",
