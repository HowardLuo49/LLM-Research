    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Bicycle license plates in Flatville each contain three letters. The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "solution": "Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n\nIf two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, $100-60=\\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.\n\nNote: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see... we have to pick three letters for each license plate. First we had 5 choices for the first letter, 3 choices for the second letter, and 4 choices for the third letter. That's 5 times 3 times 4 equals 60 license plates.\n\nNow if we add two new letters, we can add both of them to one set or put one in one set and the other in another set. So we can add them to the sets $\\{C,H,L,P,R,S,U\\},$ $\\{A,I,O,G\\},$ and $\\{D,M,N,T,F\\}.$\n\nIf we add both new letters to one set, we have 6 choices for the first letter, 3 choices for the second letter, and 4 choices for the third letter. That's 6 times 3 times 4 equals 72 new license plates.\n\nIf we add one new letter to one set and the other to another set, we have 5 choices for the first letter, 4 choices for the second letter, and 5 choices for the third letter. That's 5 times 4 times 5 equals 100 new license plates.\n\nSo the largest possible number of additional license plates that can be made by adding two letters is 100. Yay, more license plates for Flatville!",
