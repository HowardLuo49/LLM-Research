    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both numbers chosen are prime, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose 2 integers from 1 through 20 inclusive, which is given by the binomial coefficient \"20 choose 2\", denoted as C(20,2).\n\nC(20,2) = 20! / (2!(20-2)!) = 190\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways we can choose 2 prime numbers from 1 through 20. The prime numbers in this range are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. There are 8 prime numbers in total, so the number of ways to choose 2 prime numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \"8 choose 2\", denoted as C(8,2).\n\nC(8,2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28\n\nTherefore, the probability that both numbers chosen are prime is C(8,2) / C(20,2) = 28 / 190 = 14 / 95.\n\nSo, the probability is 14/95.",
