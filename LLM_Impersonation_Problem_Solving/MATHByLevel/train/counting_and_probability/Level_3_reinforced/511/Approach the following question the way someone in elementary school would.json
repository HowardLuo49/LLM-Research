    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both numbers are prime, we first need to figure out how many prime numbers there are between 1 and 20.\n\nThe prime numbers between 1 and 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. That's 8 prime numbers.\n\nThere are a total of 20 numbers to choose from, so the probability of choosing a prime number the first time is 8/20.\n\nAfter choosing a prime number for the first time, there are only 19 numbers left to choose from, with 7 prime numbers. So the probability of choosing a prime number the second time is 7/19.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the two probabilities together:\n(8/20) * (7/19) = 56/380 = 14/95\n\nSo the probability that both numbers chosen are prime is 14/95.",
