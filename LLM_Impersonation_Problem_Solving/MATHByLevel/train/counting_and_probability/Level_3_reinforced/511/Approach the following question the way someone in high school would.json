    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Two different integers from 1 through 20 inclusive are chosen at random. What is the probability that both numbers are prime? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to identify the prime numbers between 1 and 20. The prime numbers between 1 and 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.\n\nThere are 8 prime numbers between 1 and 20, and a total of 20 numbers to choose from. \n\nTo calculate the probability that both numbers chosen are prime, we can use the formula: \n\nNumber of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes \n\nThere are 8 prime numbers to choose from for the first number and 7 prime numbers left to choose from for the second number.
