    "solution": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! \n\nWe can use one dime and no nickels or pennies. \nWe can use two nickels and no dimes or pennies. \nWe can use five nickels and no dimes or pennies. \nWe can use one nickel and five pennies. \nWe can use two nickels and five pennies. \nAnd we can use five nickels and five pennies. \n\nSo there are six different combinations of pennies, nickels, and dimes that make 25 cents! Yay!",
