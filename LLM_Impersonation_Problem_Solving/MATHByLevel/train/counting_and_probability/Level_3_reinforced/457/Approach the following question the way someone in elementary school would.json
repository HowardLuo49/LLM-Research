    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$. Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\dfrac{720}{8} = \\boxed{90}$.",

There are 6 letters in total.\n\nSince there are 6 letters, we can arrange them in 6! (6 factorial) ways. \n\n6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720\n\nSo, there are 720 different ways we can arrange the letters in the word TARTAR. Cool, right?",
