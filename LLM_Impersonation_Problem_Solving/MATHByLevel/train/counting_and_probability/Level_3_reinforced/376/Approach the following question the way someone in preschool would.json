    "solution": "After we choose the first vertex, there are 7 ways to choose the second.  There are only 2 of these that are adjacent to the first vertex, so the probability the two vertices are adjacent is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$.",

Let's imagine an octagon with vertices (corner points) like this: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. \n\nNow we want to pick 2 vertices randomly. We can pick any 2 vertices out of the 8. There are a total of 8 choose 2 ways to pick 2 vertices out of 8, which is 28 ways.\n\nTo find the probability that the 2 vertices are adjacent (beside each other), we need to count the number of ways we can pick adjacent vertices. \n\nThere are 8 ways to pick adjacent vertices: (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, E), (E, F), (F, G), (G, H), (H, A).\n\nSo the probability of picking 2 adjacent vertices out of an octagon is 8/28, which simplifies to 2/7.\n\nYay, we did it!
