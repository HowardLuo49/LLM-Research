    "solution": "After we choose the first vertex, there are 7 ways to choose the second.  There are only 2 of these that are adjacent to the first vertex, so the probability the two vertices are adjacent is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first consider the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct vertices from an octagon. Since there are 8 vertices in an octagon, the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct vertices is given by the binomial coefficient \"8 choose 2\", which is equal to 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 28.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 adjacent vertices from an octagon. Since each vertex is adjacent to 2 other vertices in an octagon, there are 8 possible pairs of adjacent vertices in an octagon. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 adjacent vertices is 8.\n\nThus, the probability of choosing 2 adjacent vertices from an octagon is given by the ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 adjacent vertices to the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct vertices, which is 8/28 = 2/7.\n\nTherefore, the probability that 2 distinct vertices chosen at random from an octagon are adjacent is 2/7.",
