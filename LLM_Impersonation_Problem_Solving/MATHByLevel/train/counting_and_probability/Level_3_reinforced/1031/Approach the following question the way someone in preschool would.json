    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Jason is trying to remember the five digit combination to his safe.  He knows that he only used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that every even digit was followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit was followed by an even digit.  How many possible combinations does Jason need to try?",
    "solution": "Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even.  If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit.  Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit.  Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on.  This would be a total of: $$3\\times2\\times3\\times2\\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit.  There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\\times3\\times2\\times3\\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\\boxed{180}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... Jason has a safe with a special code. The numbers are only 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. But wait, there's a pattern! It's like a game! Even numbers have to be followed by odd numbers, and odd numbers have to be followed by even numbers. So, let's think. \n\nFirst, let's pick an even number. There are two even numbers in the code, 2 and 4. Now we need to pick an odd number. There are three odd numbers in the code, 1, 3, and 5. So we have 2 choices for even and 3 choices for odd. \n\nNow let's do it again for the next number. We just used an odd number, so now we need to pick an even number. There are two even numbers left, 2 and 4. And then we need to pick an odd number. There are three odd numbers left, 1, 3, and 5. \n\nSo, we have 2 choices for even, 3 choices for odd, 2 choices for even, and 3 choices for odd. Multiplying all those choices together, we get 2 x 3 x 2 x 3 = 36. So Jason needs to try 36 possible combinations to open his safe! Yay!",
