    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Two different  numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. What is the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive. There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total. So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{15}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
