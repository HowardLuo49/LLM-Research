    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Two different  numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. What is the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive. There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total. So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{15}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Let's see which pairs have a positive difference of 2 or greater.\n\nPairs with a difference of 2:\n(1, 3)\n(1, 4)\n(1, 5)\n(1, 6)\n(1, 7)\n(2, 4)\n(2, 5)\n(2, 6)\n(2, 7)\n(3, 5)\n(3, 6)\n(3, 7)\n(4, 6)\n(4, 7)\n(5, 7)\n\nThere are 15 pairs that have a positive difference of 2 or greater. \n\nNow, to find the total number of different pairs we can make, we can use combinations. There are 7 numbers and we are choosing 2, so the total number of pairs is $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is 2 or greater is $\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$. \n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
