    "solution": "If we expand this using the binomial theorem, we get a bunch of terms with $\\sqrt3$ in them. To avoid painful estimation, we use the following trick: Add $(2-\\sqrt3)^4$ to this expression. We know that $(2-\\sqrt3)^4$ is small, since $2-\\sqrt3<1$. When we add these together, the $\\sqrt3$ terms magically cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem,  $$(2+\\sqrt3)^4=2^4+4\\cdot2^3\\cdot(\\sqrt3)+6\\cdot2^2\\cdot(\\sqrt3)^2+4\\cdot2\\cdot(\\sqrt3)^3+(\\sqrt3)^4$$ whereas $$(2-\\sqrt3)^4=2^4-4\\cdot2^3\\cdot(\\sqrt3)+6\\cdot2^2\\cdot(\\sqrt3)^2-4\\cdot2\\cdot(\\sqrt3)^3+(\\sqrt3)^4$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(2^4+6\\cdot2^2(\\sqrt3)^2+(\\sqrt3)^4)=2(16+72+9)=194$$ Since the term we added, $(2-\\sqrt3)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\\boxed{194}$ is the closest integer to $(2+\\sqrt3)^4$.",

First, we need to expand it by multiplying it 4 times like this: \n\n$(2+\\sqrt3)^4 = (2+\\sqrt3)(2+\\sqrt3)(2+\\sqrt3)(2+\\sqrt3)$\n\nNow let's multiply them together:\n\n$(2+\\sqrt3)(2+\\sqrt3) = 4 + 2\\sqrt3 + 2\\sqrt3 + 3 = 7 + 4\\sqrt3$\n\nNow multiply that by $(2+\\sqrt3)$ again:\n\n$(7+4\\sqrt3)(2+\\sqrt3) = 14 + 7\\sqrt3 + 8\\sqrt3 + 12 = 26 + 15\\sqrt3$\n\nFinally, multiply that by $(2+\\sqrt3)$ one more time:\n\n$(26+15\\sqrt3)(2+\\sqrt3) = 52 + 26\\sqrt3 + 30\\sqrt3 + 45 = 97 + 56\\sqrt3$\n\nSo, $(2+\\sqrt3)^4 = 97 + 56\\sqrt3$.\n\nNow let's see what the nearest integer to that is. Hmm... 97 is already an integer, but $56\\sqrt3$ isn't. So, we can round it to the nearest whole number since 56.424 is closer to 56 than 57.\n\nTherefore, the nearest integer to $(2+\\sqrt3)^4$ is $\\boxed{97}$. Yay, we did it!",
