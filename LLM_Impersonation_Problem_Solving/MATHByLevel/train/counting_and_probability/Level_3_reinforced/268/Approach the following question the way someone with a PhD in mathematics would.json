The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the pattern of the interior numbers in Pascal's Triangle. In Pascal's Triangle, the nth row contains n numbers. The interior numbers of the nth row are the numbers in the row excluding the first and the last numbers.\n\nWe can observe that the sum of the interior numbers in the third row (1+1=2) is determined by the number of elements in the row minus 1. So, in general, the sum of the interior numbers in the nth row is n-1.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row would be 7-1 = 6.\n\nHence, the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row is 6.",
