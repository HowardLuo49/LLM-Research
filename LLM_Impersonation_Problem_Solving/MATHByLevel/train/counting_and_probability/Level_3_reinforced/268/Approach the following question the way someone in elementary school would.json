The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember that Pascal's Triangle starts with a 1 at the top, and each row below is created by adding together the two numbers above it. So let's write out the beginning of Pascal's Triangle:\n\n1\n1 1\n1 2 1\n\nNow we know that the interior numbers start in the third row. So let's write out the next row:\n\n1 3 3 1\n\nNow we know that the sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. So let's add them up: 3 + 3 = 6. \n\nNext let's write out the fifth row:\n\n1 4 6 4 1\n\nWe know that the sum of the interior numbers in the fifth row is 14. So let's add them up: 4 + 6 + 4 = 14.\n\nNow we need to find the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row. Let's write out the seventh row:\n\n1 6 15 20 15 6 1\n\nNow we can add up the interior numbers: 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 = 62\n\nSo, the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row is 62.",
