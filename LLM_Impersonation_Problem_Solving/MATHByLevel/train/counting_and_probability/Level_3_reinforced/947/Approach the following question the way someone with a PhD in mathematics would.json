    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Using only the digits 7, 8 and 9, how many positive seven-digit integers can be made that are palindromes?",
    "solution": "Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three.  Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive seven-digit palindromic integers that can be formed using only the digits 7, 8, and 9, we first need to consider the structure of palindromic numbers.\n\nA seven-digit palindrome can be represented in the form abcccba, where a, b, and c are the digits 7, 8 or 9. Since the first and last digits are fixed by being the same, there are only three choices for each of them (7, 8, or 9).\n\nThe middle digit, c, can be any of the three choices as well (7, 8, or 9). Therefore, there are a total of 3 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, and 3 choices for the third digit, giving us a total of 3*3*3 = 27 choices for the three middle digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive seven-digit palindromic integers that can be formed using only the digits 7, 8, and 9 is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81.",
