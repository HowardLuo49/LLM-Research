    "solution": "Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three.  Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's seeeee, to make a palindrome, we need the same numbers on both sides. So, we can try different numbers for the middle digit and then repeat them on the other side. \n\nFor the middle digit, we have 7, 8, and 9 to choose from. So we can make 3 different palindromes with each of those numbers in the middle. \n\nThat means we can make a total of 3 palindromes with 7, 3 palindromes with 8, and 3 palindromes with 9. \n\nSo, in all, we can make 9 different positive seven-digit palindrome integers using only the digits 7, 8, and 9. Yayyy!",
