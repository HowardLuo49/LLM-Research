    "solution": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.  The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the number of ways to put 5 balls into 3 boxes when the balls and boxes aren't distinguishable, we can use a combination formula.\n\nSince the balls and boxes aren't distinguishable, we can think of this as a stars and bars problem. We need to find the number of ways to distribute 5 identical balls among 3 identical boxes. This can be solved using the formula for combination with repetition, which is (n + r - 1) choose (r - 1).\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (number of balls) and r = 3 (number of boxes), so the formula becomes (5 + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1) = 7 choose 2 = 21 ways.\n\nTherefore, there are 21 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls and boxes are not distinguishable.",
