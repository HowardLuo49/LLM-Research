    "solution": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.  The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We have 5 balls and 3 boxes. Let's try putting one ball in each box at a time. \n\n- First, we can put one ball in each box. That's 1 ball in each of the 3 boxes.\n- Then, we can put two balls in one box and one ball in another box. That's 2 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box.\n- Next, we can put three balls in one box. That's 3 balls in one box and none in the other two boxes.\n- We can put four balls in one box and one ball in another box. That's 4 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other box.\n- Lastly, we can put all 5 balls in one box.\n\nSo, there are 5 different ways we can put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls and boxes are not distinguishable. Yay, we did it!",
