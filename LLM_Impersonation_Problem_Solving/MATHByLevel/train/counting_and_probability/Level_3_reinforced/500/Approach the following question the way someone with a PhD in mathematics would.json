    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
    "solution": "There are 3 options (boxes) for each of the 4 balls, so the number of ways is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes, we consider a combinatorial problem involving distributing distinct objects into distinct containers.\n\nLet's denote the 3 boxes as Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3. For each ball, there are 3 choices of which box to place it in. Since there are 4 balls, there are a total of 3^4 = 81 ways to distribute the balls into the boxes.\n\nTherefore, there are 81 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 81?: To determine the number of ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes, we consider a combinatorial problem involving distributing distinct objects into distinct containers.\n\nLet's denote the 3 boxes as Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3.
