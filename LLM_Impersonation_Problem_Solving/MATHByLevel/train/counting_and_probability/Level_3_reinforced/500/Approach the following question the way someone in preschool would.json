    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many ways we can put the 4 balls into the 3 boxes! We can put the first ball in any of the 3 boxes. Then we can put the second ball in any of the 3 boxes as well. Same with the third and fourth ball! So, we have 3 possibilities for the first ball, 3 possibilities for the second ball, 3 possibilities for the third ball, and 3 possibilities for the fourth ball. To find the total number of ways, we just need to multiply these possibilities together! 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81 ways to put the 4 balls in the 3 boxes! Wow, that's a lot of possibilities!",
