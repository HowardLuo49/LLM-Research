    "solution": "There are 3 options (boxes) for each of the 4 balls, so the number of ways is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",

Then we can put the second ball in any of the 3 boxes, and so on for the third and fourth balls.\n\nSo to find the total number of ways to put the balls in the boxes, we just multiply the number of choices for each ball.\n\n3 choices for the first ball x 3 choices for the second ball x 3 choices for the third ball x 3 choices for the fourth ball = 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81 ways.\n\nSo there are 81 different ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes.",
