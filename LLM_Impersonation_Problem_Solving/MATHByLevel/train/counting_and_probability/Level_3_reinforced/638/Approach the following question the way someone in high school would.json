    "solution": "A seven-sided polygon has seven vertices. There are ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$ ways to connect the pairs of these 7 points. But 7 of those pairs are pairs of consecutive vertices, so they are counted as sides. So, only $21 - 7 = \\boxed{14}$ of these segments are diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of diagonals in a regular seven-sided polygon, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides. \n\nFor a seven-sided polygon, we plug in \\( n = 7 \\) into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{7(7-3)}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{7 \\times 4}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{28}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of diagonals} = 14 \\]\n\nSo, a regular seven-sided polygon contains 14 diagonals.",
