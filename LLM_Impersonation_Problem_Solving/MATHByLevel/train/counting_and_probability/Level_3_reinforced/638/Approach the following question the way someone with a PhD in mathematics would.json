    "solution": "A seven-sided polygon has seven vertices. There are ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$ ways to connect the pairs of these 7 points. But 7 of those pairs are pairs of consecutive vertices, so they are counted as sides. So, only $21 - 7 = \\boxed{14}$ of these segments are diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "A regular polygon with n sides has n(n-3)/2 diagonals. For a seven-sided polygon, this formula gives us 7(7-3)/2 = 7(4)/2 = 28/2 = 14 diagonals. Thus, a regular seven-sided polygon contains 14 diagonals.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 14?: A regular polygon with n sides has n(n-3)/2 diagonals. For a seven-sided polygon, this formula gives us 7(7-3)/2 = 7(4)/2 = 28/2 = 14 diagonals. Thus, a regular seven-sided polygon contains 14 diagonals.",
