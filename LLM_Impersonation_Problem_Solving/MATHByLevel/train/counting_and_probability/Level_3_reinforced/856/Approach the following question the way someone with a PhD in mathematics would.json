    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no zero as a digit can have for each of its five digits anything from 1 through 9 inclusive. There are $9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9=59,\\!049$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero as a digit is  $90,\\!000-59,\\!049=\\boxed{30,951}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero, we can first determine the total number of 5-digit numbers and then subtract the number of 5-digit numbers with no zeros.\n\nThere are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9) and 10 choices for each subsequent digit (0-9). Therefore, there are a total of 9*10*10*10*10 = 90,000 5-digit numbers.\n\nNext, we can find the number of 5-digit numbers with no zeros. Since we cannot have a zero in the first digit, there are 9 choices. For the remaining digits, we have 9 choices each. Therefore, there are 9*9*9*9*9 = 59,049 5-digit numbers with no zeros.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the number of 5-digit numbers with no zeros from the total number of 5-digit numbers to find the number of 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero:\n\n90,000 - 59,049 = 30,951\n\nTherefore, there are 30,951 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero.",
