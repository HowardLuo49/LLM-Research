    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no zero as a digit can have for each of its five digits anything from 1 through 9 inclusive. There are $9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9=59,\\!049$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero as a digit is  $90,\\!000-59,\\!049=\\boxed{30,951}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many 5-digit numbers have at least one zero, we need to think about all the different ways we can arrange the numbers.\n\nFirst, we know that a 5-digit number can have any number from 0 to 9 in each place. So let's think about all the possibilities.\n\nWe can have a zero in just the first place, or just the second place, or just the third place, and so on. We can also have a zero in more than one place.\n\nTo make it easier to count, let's think about how many 5-digit numbers don't have any zeros at all. Since we can't have a zero in the first place, there are 9 options for that place. And for the other 4 places, we can have any number from 1 to 9. So that's 9 x 9 x 9 x 9 x 9 = 59,049 numbers without any zeros.\n\nTo find out how many 5-digit numbers have at least one zero, we can subtract the numbers without zeros from all the possible 5-digit numbers. There are 10 options for each place, so that would be 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 100,000 total numbers.\n\nSo, to find the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero, we do 100,000 - 59,049 = 40,951.\n\nWe have 40,951 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero. Yay!",
