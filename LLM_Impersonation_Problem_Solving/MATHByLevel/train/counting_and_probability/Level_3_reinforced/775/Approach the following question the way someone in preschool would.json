What is the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$. The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$. Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive difference between the two probabilities, we have to first figure out the probability of each event happening. \n\nFirst, let's find the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips. To do this, we can use the formula for binomial probability, which is (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of flips, k is the number of heads we want, and p is the probability of getting heads on a single flip.\n\nFor getting exactly 2 heads out of 3 flips, we have n=3, k=2, and p=0.5 (since it's a fair coin). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n(3 choose 2) * (0.5)^2 * (0.5)^(3-2) = 3 * (0.25) * (0.5) = 0.375\n\nSo, the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is 0.375.\n\nNext, let's find the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips. Since there is only one way for all 3 flips to be heads, the probability is simply (0.5)^3 = 0.125.\n\nFinally, we can find the positive difference between the two probabilities by subtracting the smaller probability from the larger probability:\n\n0.375 - 0.125 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between the two probabilities is 1/4.",
