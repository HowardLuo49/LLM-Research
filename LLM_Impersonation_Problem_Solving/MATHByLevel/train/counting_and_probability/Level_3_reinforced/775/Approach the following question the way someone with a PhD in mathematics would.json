What is the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$. The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$. Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probabilities of these events, we can use the binomial probability formula. \n\nThe probability of getting exactly 2 heads in 3 flips of a fair coin is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(2 heads) = (3 choose 2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^(3-2) = 3 * (1/4) * (1/2) = 3/8.\n\nThe probability of getting all 3 heads in 3 flips is given by:\n\nP(3 heads) = (3 choose 3) * (1/2)^3 = 1 * (1/8) = 1/8.\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and getting all 3 heads is:\n\nP(2 heads) - P(3 heads) = 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the positive difference between the two probabilities is 1/4.",
