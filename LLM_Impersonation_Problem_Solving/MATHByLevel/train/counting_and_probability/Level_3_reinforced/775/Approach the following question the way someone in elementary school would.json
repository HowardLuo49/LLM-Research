What is the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$. The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$. Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, first we need to remember that the probability of getting heads on a fair coin flip is 1/2. \n\nSo, for the first situation of landing heads 2 times out of 3 flips, we need to consider the different possible outcomes: HHT, HTH, THH. Each of these outcomes has a probability of (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8. Since there are 3 possible outcomes, the total probability is 3 * 1/8 = 3/8.\n\nFor the second situation of landing heads 3 times out of 3 flips, there is only one possible outcome: HHH. The probability of this happening is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\nTo find the positive difference between these two probabilities, we subtract the second probability from the first: 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the positive difference in probability between the two situations is 1/4.",
