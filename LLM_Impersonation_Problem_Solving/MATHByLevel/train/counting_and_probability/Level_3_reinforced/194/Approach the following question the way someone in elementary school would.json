    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about all the different ways we can put the beads on the bracelet! We have 6 beads that are all different, so we need to figure out how many different ways we can arrange them.\n\nFirst, let's imagine that the bracelet is a circle. This means that we can rotate the bracelet around and the beads will still be in the same order. We can also flip the bracelet over and the beads will still be in the same order. These are called rotations and reflections.\n\nTo figure out how many ways we can arrange the beads, we can use a formula called the symmetry group. For a bracelet with 6 beads, the symmetry group is 6. This means that there are 6 different ways we can arrange the beads on the bracelet.\n\nSo, there are 6 different ways we can place the 6 distinct beads on the bracelet!",
