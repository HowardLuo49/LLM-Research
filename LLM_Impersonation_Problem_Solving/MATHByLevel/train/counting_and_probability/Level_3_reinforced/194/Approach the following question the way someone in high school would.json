    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the number of ways to place 6 distinct beads on a bracelet, we can think about it in terms of permutations. \n\nSince the beads are distinct, there are 6 choices for the first bead, 5 choices for the second bead, 4 choices for the third bead, and so on. This means there are 6! (6 factorial) ways to arrange the beads on the bracelet without considering rotations or reflections.\n\nHowever, we need to take into account that some arrangements may be the same if one can be rotated or reflected to produce another. \n\nTo account for this, we can divide the total number of arrangements by the number of ways each arrangement can be rotated or reflected. In this case, each arrangement can be rotated in 6 different ways (by rotating the bracelet to align with each of the 6 beads) or reflected in 2 different ways. \n\nTherefore, the total number of unique ways to place 6 distinct beads on a bracelet is given by: \n\n6! / (6*2) = 720 / 12 = 60 \n\nSo, there are 60 different ways to place 6 distinct beads on a bracelet, taking into account rotations and reflections.",
