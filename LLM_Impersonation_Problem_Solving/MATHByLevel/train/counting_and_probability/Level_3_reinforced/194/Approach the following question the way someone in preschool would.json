    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. In how many ways can 6 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet? (Note that two arrangements are the same if one can be rotated or reflected to produce the other.)",
    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many ways we can put 6 pretty beads on a bracelet!\n\nFirst, let's pick one bead to start with. We can put it anywhere on the bracelet, so that's 1 way.\n\nNext, let's pick another bead to add. We can put it next to the first bead, or we can skip a space and put it there. So that's 2 ways.\n\nFor the third bead, we can put it next to the first two beads, or skip a space and put it there, or skip two spaces and put it there. That's 3 ways.\n\nAnd for the fourth bead, we can put it next to the first three beads, or skip a space and put it there, or skip two spaces and put it there, or skip three spaces and put it there. That's 4 ways.\n\nFor the fifth bead, we can put it next to the first four beads, or skip a space and put it there, or skip two spaces and put it there, or skip three spaces and put it there, or skip four spaces and put it there. That's 5 ways.\n\nFinally, for the sixth bead, we can put it next to the first five beads, or skip a space and put it there, or skip two spaces and put it there, or skip three spaces and put it there, or skip four spaces and put it there, or skip five spaces and put it there. That's 6 ways.\n\nSo we have 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 720 ways to place 6 distinct beads on a bracelet, taking into account rotations and reflections. Wow, that's a lot of pretty bracelets we can make!",
