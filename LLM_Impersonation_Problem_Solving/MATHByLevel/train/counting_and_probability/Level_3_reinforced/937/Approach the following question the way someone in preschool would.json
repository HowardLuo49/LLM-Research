To see this, subtract the $n$ consecutive pairs of vertices from the $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of vertices:  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{n}{2}-n&=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-n \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n}{2}-\\frac{2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n-2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-3n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}.\n\\end{align*} An octagon has $8(8-3)/2=\\boxed{20}$ diagonals.",
