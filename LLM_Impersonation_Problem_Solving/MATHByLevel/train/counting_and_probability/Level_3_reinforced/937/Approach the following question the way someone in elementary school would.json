    "solution": "An $n$-gon has $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals.  To see this, subtract the $n$ consecutive pairs of vertices from the $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of vertices:  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{n}{2}-n&=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-n \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n}{2}-\\frac{2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n-2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-3n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}.\n\\end{align*} An octagon has $8(8-3)/2=\\boxed{20}$ diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many diagonals a regular octagon has, we first need to know how many vertices it has. An octagon has 8 vertices, so we can calculate the number of diagonals by using the formula:\n\nNumber of diagonals = n(n-3) / 2\n\nWhere n is the number of vertices.\n\nPlugging in the number of vertices for an octagon (8), we get:\n\nNumber of diagonals = 8(8-3) / 2\nNumber of diagonals = 8(5) / 2\nNumber of diagonals = 40 / 2\nNumber of diagonals = 20\n\nSo, a regular octagon has 20 diagonals.",
