    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's see how many choices we have for each position:\n\n- Quarterback: Any of the 10 team members can be the quarterback since all positions can be played by anyone.\n- Running back: Any of the 10 team members can be the running back since all positions can be played by anyone.\n- Offensive lineman: We have 3 strong enough players to choose from.\n- Wide receiver: Any of the 10 team members can be the wide receiver since all positions can be played by anyone.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose a starting lineup, we multiply the number of choices for each position together. So, the total number of ways to choose a starting lineup is:\n\n10 (choices for quarterback) * 10 (choices for running back) * 3 (choices for offensive lineman) * 10 (choices for wide receiver) = 3,000 ways. \n\nTherefore, there are 3,000 ways to choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver from our football team with 10 members.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 1512?: First, let's see how many choices we have for each position:\n\n- Quarterback: Any of the 10 team members can be the quarterback since all positions can be played by anyone.\n- Running back: Any of the 10 team members can be the running back since all positions can be played by anyone.\n- Offensive lineman: We have 3 strong enough players to choose from.\n- Wide receiver: Any of the 10 team members can be the wide receiver since all positions can be played by anyone.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose a starting lineup, we multiply the number of choices for each position together.
