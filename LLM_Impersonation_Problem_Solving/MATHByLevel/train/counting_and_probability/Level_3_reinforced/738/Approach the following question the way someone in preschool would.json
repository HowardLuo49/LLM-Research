Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have 10 friends on our football team. Three of them are really strong and can play offensive lineman, and the rest can play any position. We need to choose a starting lineup with a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver. \n\nLet's start by picking the offensive lineman. We have 3 choices for that position. Then, we can pick the quarterback, running back, and wide receiver from the remaining 9 players. \n\nSo, the number of ways we can choose the starting lineup is 3 (for the offensive lineman) multiplied by 9 (for the quarterback, running back, and wide receiver) which equals 27 ways. \n\nThat's a lot of ways to make a starting lineup! We can make different lineups for each game and have lots of fun playing football with our friends!",
