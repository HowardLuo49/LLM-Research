    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many options we have for each position.\n\nFor the quarterback position, we have 10 options to choose from any of the team members.\n\nFor the running back position, we now have 9 options left to choose from (since we already chose the quarterback).\n\nFor the offensive lineman position, we have 3 options to choose from the strong players.\n\nFor the wide receiver position, we have 9 options left (since we already chose the quarterback and the running back).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways we can choose a starting lineup is:\n\n10 (options for quarterback) * 9 (options for running back) * 3 (options for offensive lineman) * 9 (options for wide receiver) = 2,430 ways. \n\nSo, there are 2,430 ways to choose a starting lineup.",
