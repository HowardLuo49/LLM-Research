Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{first two cards are red}) &= \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}.\n\\end{align*}",

Let's imagine we are picking two cards from the deck to see if they are both red. \n\nFirst, there are 26 red cards out of 52 total cards in the deck. So, we have a 26 out of 52 chance of drawing a red card for the first pick. \n\nIf we draw a red card for the first pick, there are now 25 red cards left out of 51 total cards in the deck for the second pick. So, we have a 25 out of 51 chance of drawing a red card for the second pick.\n\nTo find the probability of both picks being red, we multiply the probabilities of the two events. So, the probability of drawing two red cards in a row is:\n\n$\\dfrac{26}{52} \\times \\dfrac{25}{51} = \\dfrac{1300}{2652} = \\dfrac{50}{102} = \\dfrac{25}{51}$\n\nSo, the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red is $\\dfrac{25}{51}$ or about 0.4902.",
