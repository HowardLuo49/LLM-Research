Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{first two cards are red}) &= \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red, we need to consider the total number of ways to draw 2 cards from the deck and the number of ways to draw 2 red cards.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to draw 2 cards from the deck. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted $\\binom{n}{k}$, which gives the number of ways to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements without regard to order. In this case, we have 52 cards to choose from and we want to choose 2 cards, so the total number of ways to draw 2 cards from the deck is $\\binom{52}{2}$.\n\nNext, let's find the number of ways to draw 2 red cards from the deck. There are 26 red cards in the deck (13 hearts and 13 diamonds), so the number of ways to draw 2 red cards is $\\binom{26}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red is given by the ratio of the number of ways to draw 2 red cards to the total number of ways to draw 2 cards:\n$$P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{\\binom{26}{2}}{\\binom{52}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{26!}{2!24!}}{\\frac{52!}{2!50!}} = \\frac{\\frac{26*25}{2}}{\\frac{52*51}{2}} = \\frac{26*25}{52*51} = \\frac{13*5}{26*3} = \\frac{65}{78}.$$\n\nSo, the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red is $\\frac{65}{78}$.",
