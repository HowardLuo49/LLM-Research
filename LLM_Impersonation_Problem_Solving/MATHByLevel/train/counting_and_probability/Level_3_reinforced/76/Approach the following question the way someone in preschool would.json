    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let me think about this. Okay, so first we need to choose the six people to sit at the table. There are seven people to choose from, so that's 7 choose 6, which is 7! / (6! * 1!), which is just 7.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many ways we can seat the six people at the table. Since two seatings that are rotations of each other are considered the same, we just need to think about the different ways the first person can sit. After that, the other five people will just rotate around the table.\n\nSo, there is only 1 way to seat the first person, and then the other five people can sit in 5! ways.\n\nSo, we multiply the number of ways to choose the people (7) by the number of ways to seat them (5!), and we get 7 * 5! = 7 * 120 = 840. \n\nSo, there are 840 different ways we can choose six people and seat them at the table. Yay, we did it!",
