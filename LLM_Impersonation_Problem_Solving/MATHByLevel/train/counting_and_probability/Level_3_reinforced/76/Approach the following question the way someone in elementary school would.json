    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so there's seven people but only room for six at the table. That means one person has to sit out each time. So we need to see how many ways we can choose six people out of the seven. \n\nFirst, let's think about it without any restrictions. Choosing six out of seven is like saying, \"Who's going to sit out?\" So there are seven choices for who sits out.\n\nBut since two seatings that are rotations of each other are the same, we have to divide by the number of rotations possible. Since it's a circular table, there are six ways to rotate the people around the table without changing who is sitting next to whom.\n\nSo the answer is 7/6 = 1 way to choose six people and seat them at the table.",
