    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can imagine one person sitting down first, and then the other five people sitting down in different ways around the table, following the first person.\n\nSince rotations of the same seating arrangement are considered the same, we can fix one person in a seat and arrange the other five people around the table relative to that fixed person. This can be done in 5! = 120 ways. \n\nHowever, since any of the seven people could have been the first to sit down, we need to multiply the number of arrangements by 7 to account for all the possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose six people and seat them at the table is 7 * 5! = 7 * 120 = 840 ways.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 840?: To solve this problem, we can imagine one person sitting down first, and then the other five people sitting down in different ways around the table, following the first person.\n\nSince rotations of the same seating arrangement are considered the same, we can fix one person in a seat and arrange the other five people around the table relative to that fixed person.
