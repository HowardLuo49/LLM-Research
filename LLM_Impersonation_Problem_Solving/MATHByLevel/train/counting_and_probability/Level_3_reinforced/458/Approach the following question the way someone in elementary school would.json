    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many four-digit numbers have at least one 2 or 3, we can think about it like this:\n\nFirst, let's count how many four-digit numbers there are in all. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, and the largest four-digit number is 9999. \n\nTo find out how many numbers there are in between, we can subtract the smallest from the largest: 9999 - 1000 = 8999.\n\nNow, let's think about how many four-digit numbers do not have a 2 or a 3. Since we have 10 different digits (0-9), there are 8 digits left (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) that are not 2 or 3.\n\nSo, for each digit in the four-digit number, there are 8 options if it is not a 2 or 3. Since there are four digits, we multiply 8 by 8 by 8 by 8 to get the total number of four-digit numbers without a 2 or 3: 8 x 8 x 8 x 8 = 4096.\n\nNow, if there are 4096 four-digit numbers without a 2 or 3, then the total number of four-digit numbers with a 2 or 3 must be the total minus the number without: 8999 - 4096 = 4903.\n\nSo, there are 4903 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
