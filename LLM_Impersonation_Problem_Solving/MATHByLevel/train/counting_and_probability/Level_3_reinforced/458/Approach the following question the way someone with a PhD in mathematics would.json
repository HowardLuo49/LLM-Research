    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3, we can consider the complement of this set of integers, i.e. the set of four-digit positive integers that do not have a 2 or a 3 in any of their digits.\n\nFor a four-digit positive integer to not have a 2 or a 3 in any of its digits, each digit must be chosen from the set {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Since the first digit cannot be zero, there are 8 choices for the first digit (it cannot be 0), and 7 choices for the remaining three digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of four-digit positive integers that do not have a 2 or a 3 in any of their digits is:\n\n8 * 7 * 7 * 7 = 2744\n\nThe total number of four-digit positive integers is:\n\n9 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 9000\n\nSo, the number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 is:\n\n9000 - 2744 = 6256\n\nHence, there are 6256 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
