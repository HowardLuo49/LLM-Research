    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of four-digit positive integers and subtract the number of four-digit positive integers that do not have any 2s or 3s in them.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of four-digit positive integers. Since the smallest four-digit number is 1000 and the largest is 9999, we have a total of 9999 - 1000 + 1 = 9000 four-digit positive integers.\n\nNext, let's find the number of four-digit positive integers that do not have any 2s or 3s. Since there are 7 digits left (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) to choose from for each of the four digits, the total number of four-digit positive integers without 2s or 3s is 7^4 = 2401.\n\nFinally, to find the number of four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3, we can subtract the number of four-digit positive integers without 2s or 3s from the total number of four-digit positive integers:\n\n9000 - 2401 = 6599\n\nSo, there are 6599 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
