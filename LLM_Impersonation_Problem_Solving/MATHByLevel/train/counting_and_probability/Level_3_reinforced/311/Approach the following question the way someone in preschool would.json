If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! First, how many ways can Cory choose his first piece of fruit to eat? Since he has $7$ days, he could choose any of the $3$ apples, $2$ oranges, or $2$ bananas. That's $3 + 2 + 2 = 7$ choices for the first day.\n\nNow, how many choices does Cory have for the second day? Since the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, once he's chosen which type of fruit to eat, there's only $1$ choice left. So for the second day, he only has $1$ choice.\n\nFor the rest of the days, he also only has $1$ choice each day, since he's already eaten $1$ piece of fruit from each category.\n\nSo, overall, the total number of orders Cory can eat the fruit is $7 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 7$. \n\nCory has $7$ different orders he can eat his fruit in!
