If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can think of arranging the letters representing the fruits in a line, where the repetition of the same letter means that Cory is eating that fruit on that day. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways Cory can eat his fruits without any restrictions. This can be done by finding the number of permutations of all the letters, which is $\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!} = 210$.\n\nHowever, for each type of fruit, the order in which the fruit is eaten doesn't matter. This means that for the $3$ apples, there are $3!$ ways to arrange them in terms of order. Similarly, there are $2!$ ways to arrange the $2$ oranges and $2$ bananas. \n\nTo account for this, we divide the total number of ways by $3!2!2!$, resulting in $\\frac{210}{3!2!2!} = 35$.\n\nTherefore, Cory can eat his fruit in $35$ different orders.",
