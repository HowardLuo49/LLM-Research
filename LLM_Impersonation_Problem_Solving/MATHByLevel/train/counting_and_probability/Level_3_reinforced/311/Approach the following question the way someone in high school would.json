If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the total number of ways Cory can eat his fruit, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange the $7$ pieces of fruit he eats over the course of a week.\n\nSince the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, we can think of this problem as a permutations problem. We want to find the number of permutations of $3$ apples, $2$ oranges, and $2$ bananas, which is given by the formula $\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!} = 210$.\n\nTherefore, Cory can eat his fruit in $210$ different orders.",
