If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",
    "solution": "There are a total of $7$ fruits, so there are $7!$ ways to arrange them. However, since the fruits in each category are indistinguishable, we must divide out the repeats: $$\\frac{7!}{3!2!2!}=7\\times6\\times5=\\boxed{210}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count all the ways Cory can eat his fruit over the week!\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many total pieces of fruit Cory has. Cory has $3$ apples, $2$ oranges, and $2$ bananas, so he has a total of $3 + 2 + 2 = 7$ pieces of fruit.\n\nSince Cory eats one piece of fruit each day, there are $7$ days in the week, and Cory will eat $1$ piece of fruit each day. This means Cory will have to eat all $7$ pieces of fruit by the end of the week.\n\nWe can think of this problem as arranging the $7$ pieces of fruit in a row, where the order matters. We can use the concept of permutations to help us count the number of ways Cory can eat his fruit.\n\nSince there are $7$ total pieces of fruit and $3$ of them are apples, $2$ are oranges, and $2$ are bananas, we have a total of $7!$ ways to arrange the fruit. However, since we have indistinguishable pieces within each category (apples, oranges, bananas), we need to divide out the number of ways that the pieces within each category can be arranged as well.\n\nFor the apples: Since Cory has $3$ apples and they are indistinguishable, we need to divide by $3!$ to account for the different ways the apples can be arranged among themselves.\n\nFor the oranges: Since Cory has $2$ oranges and they are indistinguishable, we need to divide by $2!$ to account for the different ways the oranges can be arranged among themselves.\n\nFor the bananas: Since Cory has $2$ bananas and they are indistinguishable, we need to divide by $2!$ to account for the different ways the bananas can be arranged among themselves.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways Cory can eat his fruit over the week is $$\\frac{7!}{3! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420.$$\n\nSo, there are $420$ different orders in which Cory can eat his fruit.",
