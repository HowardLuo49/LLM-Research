    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we have the letters L, E, Q, U, A, and S. We need to make a sequence with four letters, starting with L and ending with Q. We can't repeat any letters.\n\nFirst, we put L at the beginning and Q at the end. Then we have three letters left to choose from - E, U, A, and S. Let's see how many ways we can arrange those three letters.\n\nWe can choose the second letter from 3 options, the third letter from 2 options, and the fourth letter from 1 option. So, the total number of distinct sequences we can make is 3 x 2 x 1 = 6.\n\nSo, there are 6 distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear more than once. Yay, we did it!",
