    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many sequences we can make, let's start by lining up the letters in EQUALS: E, Q, U, A, L, S. Since the sequence must start with L and end with Q, we already know our first and last letters: L _ _ Q.\n\nNow we need to figure out which letters can go in the middle two spots. We have 4 letters left: E, U, A, S. Since no letter can be repeated in a sequence, we have to choose two different letters from these four.\n\nWe can choose our first middle letter in 4 ways (E, U, A, S), and once we choose that letter, we only have 3 left to choose from for the second middle letter.\n\nSo the total number of distinct sequences of four letters that can be made is 4 (choices for first middle letter) * 3 (choices for second middle letter) = 12 sequences.\n\nSo there are 12 different sequences that can be made from the letters in EQUALS, following the given rules.",
