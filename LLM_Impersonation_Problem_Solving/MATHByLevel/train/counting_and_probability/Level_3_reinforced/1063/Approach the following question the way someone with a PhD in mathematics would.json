    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of distinct sequences meeting the specified requirements, we need to consider the total number of ways to fill in the two remaining positions in the sequence after the letters L and Q have been placed.\n\nWe have the letters E, U, A, and S remaining. Since each letter can only appear once in a sequence, we have 4 options for the third position and 3 options for the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences meeting the specified requirements is:\n\nNumber of sequences = 1 (for L) * 4 (for the third position) * 3 (for the fourth position) = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 distinct sequences of four letters that can be made from the letters in EQUALS, where each sequence begins with L, ends with Q, and no letter appears more than once.",
