    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. \n\nThere are 4 balls that need to be placed into 2 boxes. Since the balls are distinguishable, we can consider each ball independently. \n\nFor the first ball, there are 2 choices of boxes to place it in. For the second ball, there are also 2 choices of boxes to place it in, and so on for the remaining 2 balls. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes is given by:\n\n2 choices for the first ball * 2 choices for the second ball * 2 choices for the third ball * 2 choices for the fourth ball = 2^4 = 16\n\nTherefore, there are 16 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
