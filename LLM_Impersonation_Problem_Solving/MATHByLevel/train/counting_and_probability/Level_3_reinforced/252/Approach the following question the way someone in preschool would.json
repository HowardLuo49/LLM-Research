    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We have 4 balls (let's say they are red, blue, green, and yellow) and 2 boxes (let's say they are box 1 and box 2). We can put the red ball in box 1 or box 2, then the blue ball in box 1 or box 2, the green ball in box 1 or box 2, and finally the yellow ball in box 1 or box 2. So, we have 2 choices for each ball, which means there are 2x2x2x2 = 16 ways to put the 4 distinguishable balls into the 2 distinguishable boxes! Wow, that's a lot of ways!",

We have 4 balls (let's say they are red, blue, green, and yellow) and 2 boxes (let's say they are box 1 and box 2).
