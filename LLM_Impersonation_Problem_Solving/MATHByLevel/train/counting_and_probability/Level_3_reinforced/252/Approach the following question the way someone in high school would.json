    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since the balls and boxes are distinguishable, we need to find all the possible ways to arrange the 4 balls into the 2 boxes.\n\nThe first ball can go into either box, so there are 2 choices for the first ball. The second ball also has 2 choices for which box to go into. Similarly, the third and fourth balls each have 2 choices for which box to go into.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to put the 4 distinguishable balls into the 2 distinguishable boxes is:\n\n2 choices for the first ball * 2 choices for the second ball * 2 choices for the third ball * 2 choices for the fourth ball\n\n= 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 \n\n= 16 ways\n\nSo, there are 16 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
