    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see how many ways Karl can choose four crayons from the box. First, Karl can choose any one of the 12 different-colored crayons. Then, he can choose another one from the remaining 11 crayons. After that, he can choose another one from the remaining 10 crayons. Finally, he can choose the last one from the remaining 9 crayons. So, that means Karl can choose four crayons in 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 = 11,880 ways! Isn't that a lot of ways to choose crayons? Let's get coloring!",
