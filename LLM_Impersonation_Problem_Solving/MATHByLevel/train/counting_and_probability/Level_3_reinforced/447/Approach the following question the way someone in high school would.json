    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways Karl can select four crayons from the 12 different-colored crayons in the box without taking the order into account, we can use combination. \n\nThe formula for combination is: nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nWhere n is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 12 different-colored crayons) and r is the number of items to choose (in this case, 4 crayons).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n12C4 = 12! / 4!(12-4)!\n12C4 = 12! / 4!*8!\n12C4 = (12x11x10x9)/(4x3x2x1)\n12C4 = 495\n\nTherefore, Karl can select four crayons from the box in 495 different ways without considering the order in which he selects them.",
