A ball is taken from the bag, its color recorded, then placed back in the bag.  A second ball is taken and its color recorded.  What is the probability the two balls are the same color?",
    "solution": "We could have either two greens or two reds. The probability of drawing two greens is $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{9}{25}$. The probability of drawing two reds is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{4}{25}$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{9}{25} + \\dfrac{4}{25} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{25}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... If we have six green balls and four red balls in the bag, that means there are ten balls altogether. So the first ball could be either green or red. If it's green, then there are five green balls left and three red balls left in the bag. If it's red, then there are six green balls left and three red balls left in the bag. \n\nSo, the probability of picking two balls of the same color would be (6/10) * (5/10) + (4/10) * (3/10). \n\nI think this means... we need to add 6/10 and 5/10 first, then multiply that answer by 5/10. After that, we need to add 4/10 and 3/10 and then multiply those numbers together too. Finally, we need to add those two products together to find the answer. \n\nLet's do the math!",
