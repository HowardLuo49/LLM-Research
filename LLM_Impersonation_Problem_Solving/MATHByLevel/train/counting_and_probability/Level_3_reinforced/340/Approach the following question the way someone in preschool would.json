    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Paco uses a spinner to select a number from 1 through 5, each with equal probability. Manu uses a different spinner to select a number from 1 through 10, each with equal probability. What is the probability that the product of Manu's number and Paco's number is less than 30? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "A little casework seems like the simplest approach. First, if Paco spins a 1 or 2, it does not matter what Manu spins; the product is less than 30 regardless. If Paco spins a 3, the product will be 30 or greater only if Manu spins a 10, and both of these will be true with probability $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{50}$. If Paco spins a 4, Manu's spins of 8, 9 or 10 will tip us over the 30 barrier, and this with probability $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3}{50}$. If Paco spins a 5, Manu will break the 30 threshold with a 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, probabilities being $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}$. The total probability for these three cases is $\\frac{1+3+5}{50} = \\frac{9}{50}$. But, we want the probability that the product is less than 30, so we subtract our fraction from 1 and get $\\boxed{\\frac{41}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. Paco can get 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. And Manu can get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. So, we need to find out how many of their numbers when multiplied together will be less than 30.\n\nLet's make a list:\n1 x 1 = 1\n1 x 2 = 2\n1 x 3 = 3\n1 x 4 = 4\n1 x 5 = 5\n2 x 1 = 2\n2 x 2 = 4\n2 x 3 = 6\n2 x 4 = 8\n3 x 1 = 3\n3 x 2 = 6\n4 x 1 = 4\n5 x 1 = 5\n\nSo, there are 13 combinations where the product is less than 30.\n\nNow, let's find the total possible combinations. Paco can get 5 different numbers, and Manu can get 10 different numbers. So, the total possible combinations are 5 x 10 = 50.\n\nTo find the probability, we need to divide the favorable outcomes (13) by the total possible outcomes (50):\n13/50\n\nSo, the probability that the product of Manu's number and Paco's number is less than 30 is 13/50.
