If there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, 6 students with blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes, how many students have blue eyes?",
    "solution": "Let the number of blue-eyed students be $x$, so the number of blond students is $2x$.  Since the number of blue-eyed blond students is $6$, the number of blue-eyed non-blond students is $x - 6$, while the number of blond non-blue-eyed students is $2x - 6$.  Since the number of non-blue-eyed non-blond students is $3$, we can add up these four exclusive categories (blond blue-eyed, blond non-blue-eyed, etc.) to sum to 30 students in the class.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Blue eyes\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Blond hair\", (80,74));\nlabel(\"Neither: 3\", (44,10));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$6$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$x-6$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x-6$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nSo $(x - 6) + (2x - 6) + 6 + 3 = 30$ and $x = \\boxed{11}$, which is the number of blue-eyed students.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count how many students have blond hair! We know that there are 6 students with both blond hair and blue eyes. That means there are 6 students with blond hair and blue eyes. And since there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, that means there are 12 students with blond hair!\n\nNow, we also know that there are 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes. So, if there are 30 students in total and we have counted 12 students with blond hair, that leaves us with 6 students remaining. These 6 students must have blue eyes since they are the only students left!\n\nSo, there are 6 students in Mrs. Taylor's kindergarten class with blue eyes! Yay!",
