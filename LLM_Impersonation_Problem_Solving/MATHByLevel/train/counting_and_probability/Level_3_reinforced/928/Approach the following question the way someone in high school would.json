    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. There are 30 students in Mrs. Taylor's kindergarten class.  If there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, 6 students with blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes, how many students have blue eyes?",
    "solution": "Let the number of blue-eyed students be $x$, so the number of blond students is $2x$.  Since the number of blue-eyed blond students is $6$, the number of blue-eyed non-blond students is $x - 6$, while the number of blond non-blue-eyed students is $2x - 6$.  Since the number of non-blue-eyed non-blond students is $3$, we can add up these four exclusive categories (blond blue-eyed, blond non-blue-eyed, etc.) to sum to 30 students in the class.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Blue eyes\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Blond hair\", (80,74));\nlabel(\"Neither: 3\", (44,10));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$6$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$x-6$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x-6$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nSo $(x - 6) + (2x - 6) + 6 + 3 = 30$ and $x = \\boxed{11}$, which is the number of blue-eyed students.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break it down. First, we know that there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes. That means if we have X students with blue eyes, we have 2X students with blond hair.\n\nNext, we know that there are 6 students with both blond hair and blue eyes. So, if we add up all the students with blond hair (2X) and all the students with blue eyes (X), then subtract the students with both, we should get the total number of students with either blond hair or blue eyes. \n\nSo, 2X + X - 6 = 30 - 3\n\nNow we can solve for X:\n\n3X - 6 = 27\n\n3X = 33\n\nX = 11\n\nSo, there are 11 students with blue eyes in Mrs. Taylor's kindergarten class.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 11?: Ok, so let's break it down. First, we know that there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes.
