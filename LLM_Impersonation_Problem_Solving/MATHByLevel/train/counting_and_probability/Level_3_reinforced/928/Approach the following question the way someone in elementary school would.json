If there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, 6 students with blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes, how many students have blue eyes?",
    "solution": "Let the number of blue-eyed students be $x$, so the number of blond students is $2x$.  Since the number of blue-eyed blond students is $6$, the number of blue-eyed non-blond students is $x - 6$, while the number of blond non-blue-eyed students is $2x - 6$.  Since the number of non-blue-eyed non-blond students is $3$, we can add up these four exclusive categories (blond blue-eyed, blond non-blue-eyed, etc.) to sum to 30 students in the class.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Blue eyes\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Blond hair\", (80,74));\nlabel(\"Neither: 3\", (44,10));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$6$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$x-6$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x-6$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nSo $(x - 6) + (2x - 6) + 6 + 3 = 30$ and $x = \\boxed{11}$, which is the number of blue-eyed students.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so in Mrs. Taylor's class there are 30 students. Some of them have blond hair and some have blue eyes. We know that there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes. We also know that there are 6 students that have both blond hair and blue eyes. \n\nNow, we also know that there are 3 students that don't have blond hair or blue eyes. So, let's do some math. \n\nIf we let the number of students with blue eyes be x, then the number of students with blond hair would be 2x since there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes. \n\nWe also know that there are 6 students with both blond hair and blue eyes. \n\nSo, the total number of students with blond hair is 2x, and the number of students with blue eyes is x. \n\nWe also know that there are 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes. \n\nSo, the total number of students in the class is 30. \n\nTherefore, we can set up an equation to solve for x: \n\n2x + x - 6 + 3 = 30\n3x - 3 = 30\n3x = 33\nx = 11\n\nSo, there are 11 students in Mrs. Taylor's class that have blue eyes.",
