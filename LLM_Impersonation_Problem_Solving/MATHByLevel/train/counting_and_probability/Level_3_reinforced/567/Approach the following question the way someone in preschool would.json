    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the sides of the rectangle! We know the perimeter is 64 inches, so if we add up all the sides it should equal 64. \n\nLet's start with the first side. It can be any number from 1 to 31 because the other side will have to match it. So let's try 1. \n\nNow we have 3 more sides left to add up to 64. If the first side is 1, that means the other side has to be 1 too. So we have 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nNow we have 2 sides with a total of 2, which means we have 62 left to add up. The third side can be any number from 1 to 30, so let's try 1. \n\nNow we have 3 sides with a total of 3, which means we have 61 left to add up. The last side has to be the same as the third side to make a rectangle, so it will also be 1. \n\nNow we have a rectangle with sides 1, 1, 1, and 1. \n\nSo, there is only 1 non-congruent rectangle that meets these criteria.",
