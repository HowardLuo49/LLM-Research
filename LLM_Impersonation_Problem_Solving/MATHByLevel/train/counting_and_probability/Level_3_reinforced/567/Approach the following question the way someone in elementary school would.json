    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of non-congruent rectangles with an integer length on each side and a perimeter of 64 inches, we need to think about the factors of 64. \n\nFirst, we know that the formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + width). Since the perimeter is 64 inches, we can set up the equation: 64 = 2(length + width).\n\nSince the sides of the rectangle must be integers, we need to think about the factors of 64. The factors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\n\nWe can pair up the factors to find the possible combinations that meet the criteria. The pairs are (1, 64), (2, 32), (4, 16), and (8, 8).\n\nTherefore, there are 4 non-congruent rectangles that meet the criteria.",
