    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A rectangle has a perimeter of 64 inches and each side has an integer length. How many non-congruent rectangles meet these criteria?",
    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations using the information given. Let the length of one side of the rectangle be represented by x inches, and the other side by y inches.\n\nSince the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to twice the sum of its length and width, we have the equation:\n\n2x + 2y = 64\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx + y = 32\n\nSince both x and y represent integer lengths, we can analyze the possible integer solutions to this equation. The pairs of integers that satisfy this equation and represent valid side lengths for the rectangle are (1, 31), (2, 30), (3, 29), ..., (31, 1). \n\nHowever, we must remember that the sides of a rectangle are interchangeable, so we must consider the different combinations of sides that result in non-congruent rectangles. \n\nFor instance, the pair (1, 31) can also be written as (31, 1), resulting in only one unique rectangle. This analysis can be extended to all possible pairs of integer side lengths whose sum is 32.\n\nTherefore, the total number of non-congruent rectangles that meet the given criteria is 16, as there are 16 unique pairs of integer side lengths that sum up to 32.",
