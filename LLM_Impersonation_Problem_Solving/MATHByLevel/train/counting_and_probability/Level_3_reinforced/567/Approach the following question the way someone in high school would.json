    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all the sides. In this case, the perimeter is 64 inches.\n\nSince we know that a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 2 and set up an equation:\n\n2 * (length + width) = 64\n\nNow we need to find pairs of integers that add up to 32 (since 64 divided by 2 is 32). We can start by listing out pairs of integers that add up to 32:\n\n1 + 31\n2 + 30\n3 + 29\n...\n15 + 17\n\nAfter listing out all the pairs, we see that there are a total of 15 pairs that add up to 32. However, we need to remember that these pairs can form multiple different rectangles. For example, a rectangle with sides of length 1 and width 31 is different from a rectangle with sides of length 31 and width 1. This means that there are actually 15 * 2 = 30 different non-congruent rectangles that meet the criteria.",
