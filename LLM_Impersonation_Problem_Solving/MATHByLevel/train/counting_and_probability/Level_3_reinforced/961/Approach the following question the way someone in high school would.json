    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters with no restrictions? (The triplets are treated as distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We are choosing 6 starters from 14 players, which can be done in $\\binom{14}{6} = \\boxed{3003}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways we can choose 6 starters with no restrictions, we can use the combinations formula. \n\nThe formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of players and r is the number of players we want to choose. \n\nIn this case, n = 14 (total players) and r = 6 (number of starters we want to choose). \n\nSo, the number of ways we can choose 6 starters with no restrictions is:\n\n14C6 = 14! / 6!(14-6)!\n      = 3003 \n\nTherefore, there are 3003 ways we can choose 6 starters for our girls volleyball team with no restrictions.",
