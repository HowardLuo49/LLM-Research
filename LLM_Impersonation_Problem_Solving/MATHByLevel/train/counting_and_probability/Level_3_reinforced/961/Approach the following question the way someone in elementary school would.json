Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters with no restrictions? (The triplets are treated as distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We are choosing 6 starters from 14 players, which can be done in $\\binom{14}{6} = \\boxed{3003}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to count how many choices we have for the 6 spots on the team. Since there are 14 players total, we can use \"14 choose 6\" to find the number of ways to choose 6 starters out of 14 players.\n\n\"14 choose 6\" is calculated by the formula 14! / (6! * (14-6)!).\n\nAfter calculating, we find that there are 3003 ways to choose 6 starters with no restrictions on who can be chosen.",
