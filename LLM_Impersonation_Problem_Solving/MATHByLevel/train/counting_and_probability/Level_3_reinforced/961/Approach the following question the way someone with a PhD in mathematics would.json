Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters with no restrictions? (The triplets are treated as distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "We are choosing 6 starters from 14 players, which can be done in $\\binom{14}{6} = \\boxed{3003}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations in which the order of selection does not matter. We want to choose 6 starters out of 14 players, so we can calculate this as follows:\n\n14 players choose 6 starters = 14C6\n\nThis can be calculated using the formula for combinations, which is:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nPlugging in the values for our specific problem, we get:\n\n14C6 = 14! / 6!(14-6)!\n     = 3003\n\nTherefore, there are 3003 ways to choose 6 starters from the 14 players on the girls volleyball team.",
