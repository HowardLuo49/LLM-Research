    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd, we need to consider the individual probabilities of rolling an odd number versus an even number on a standard die.\n\nOn a standard die, there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6). \n\nThe probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling an even number is also 1/2.\n\nSince the product of any even number with any other number will always be even, in order to have an odd product, each of the six rolls must result in an odd number.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting an odd number on each of the six rolls is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nThus, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 1/64.",
