    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, a die has numbers from 1 to 6 on it. If we roll it six times, we need to figure out if the product of all those rolls is odd. \n\nHmm, let's think about it. To get an odd number, we need to have at least one odd number in our product because when we multiply even numbers, we get an even number. So, we need to find out the probability of getting at least one odd number.\n\nThere are a total of 6 outcomes when we roll the die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Out of these, there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6).\n\nTo find the probability of getting at least one odd number in six rolls, we can use the complementary probability. This means finding the probability of getting all even numbers and then subtracting it from 1.\n\nThe probability of getting all even numbers in six rolls is (3/6)^6 = (1/2)^6 = 1/64\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least one odd number in six rolls is 1 - 1/64 = 63/64\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 63/64. Yay!",
