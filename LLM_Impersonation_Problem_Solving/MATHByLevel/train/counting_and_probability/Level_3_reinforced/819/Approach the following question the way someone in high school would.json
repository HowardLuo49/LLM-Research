What is the probability that the four dots will be collinear? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nsize(59);\nfor(int i = 0; i<4; ++i)\nfor(int j = 0; j<4; ++j)\ndot((i,j),linewidth(7));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "If all four of the dots are collinear, it is obvious that it must either be a horizontal line of dots, a vertical line of dots, or a diagonal line of dots. And inspection tells us that there are $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ such collinear sets of 4. And in total, there are ${16 \\choose 4} = \\frac{16\\cdot 15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 = 1820$. So, the probability is $\\frac{10}{1820} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{182}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so there are a total of 16 dots in the square array. To find the probability that the four dots chosen at random will be collinear, we first need to figure out how many ways we can choose four dots that are in a line.\n\nIf we think about it, there are only two ways we can choose four dots that are collinear: either horizontally or vertically.\n\nFor a horizontal line, there are four rows to choose from, and once we choose a row, there are 4C4 = 1 way to choose four dots in that row. So, there are 4 ways to choose four dots that are collinear horizontally.\n\nFor a vertical line, there are four columns to choose from, and once we choose a column, there are 4C4 = 1 way to choose four dots in that column. So, there are 4 ways to choose four dots that are collinear vertically.\n\nThis means there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 ways to choose four collinear dots.\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways we can choose any four dots out of the 16, we need to calculate 16C4:\n\n16C4 = (16*15*14*13)/(4*3*2*1) = 1820\n\nSo, the probability that the four dots chosen at random will be collinear is:\n\n8/1820 = 1/227\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/227 that the four dots will be collinear.",
