What is the probability that the four dots will be collinear? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nsize(59);\nfor(int i = 0; i<4; ++i)\nfor(int j = 0; j<4; ++j)\ndot((i,j),linewidth(7));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "If all four of the dots are collinear, it is obvious that it must either be a horizontal line of dots, a vertical line of dots, or a diagonal line of dots. And inspection tells us that there are $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ such collinear sets of 4. And in total, there are ${16 \\choose 4} = \\frac{16\\cdot 15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 = 1820$. So, the probability is $\\frac{10}{1820} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{182}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In this square array of 16 dots, we have a total of $\\binom{16}{4}$ ways to choose 4 dots out of the 16.\n\nTo determine the number of ways in which the 4 chosen dots will be collinear, we consider the following cases:\nCase 1: All 4 dots are in the same row. There are 4 rows, so there are $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways for this to occur.\nCase 2: All 4 dots are in the same column. There are 4 columns, so there are $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways for this to occur.\nCase 3: All 4 dots lie on the main diagonal. There is only 1 main diagonal, so there is $\\binom{1}{1} = 1$ way for this to occur.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways in which the 4 chosen dots will be collinear is $4+4+1 = 9$.\n\nHence, the probability that the four dots will be collinear is $\\frac{9}{\\binom{16}{4}} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{16!}{4!12!}} = \\frac{9 \\times 4!12!}{16!} = \\frac{3}{560}$.",
