    "solution": "It may not be obvious how to proceed with this problem, but a little experimentation might lead you to determine the possible values of $m.$\n\nSince $0 < m^2 < 22,$ we can see that $m$ must be one of $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ or $4.$ So let's use these as our cases.\n\nCase 1: When $m=1$, we must have $n < 22-1 = 21.$ Thus there are $20$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=1.$\nCase 2: When $m=2,$ we must have $n < 22-4 = 18.$ Thus there are $17$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=2.$\nCase 3: When $m=3,$ we must have $n < 22-9 = 13.$ Thus there are $12$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=3.$\nCase 4: When $m=4,$ we must have $n < 22-16 = 6.$ Thus there are $5$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=4.$\n\nSo to get the total number of pairs of positive integers satisfying the inequality, we add up all of our possible cases, and see that there are $20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = \\boxed{54}$ possible pairs.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ that satisfy the inequality $m^2 + n < 22$, we will first determine the possible values of $m$ and $n$.\n\nSince $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, $m^2\\geq 1$ and $n\\geq 1$. Therefore, the largest value $m^2 + n$ can take on is when $m=4$ and $n=1$, which gives $m^2 + n = 4^2 + 1 = 17$. \n\nFor $m^2 + n$ to be less than 22, we have the following possibilities:\n- when $m=1$, $n$ can take values from 1 to 12 inclusive ($1^2 + 1 = 2$ to $1^2 + 12 = 13$)\n- when $m=2$, $n$ can take values from 1 to 7 inclusive ($2^2 + 1 = 5$ to $2^2 + 7 = 11$)\n- when $m=3$, $n$ can take values from 1 to 2 inclusive ($3^2 + 1 = 10$ to $3^2 + 2 = 11$)\n- when $m=4$, $n$ can only be 1 ($4^2 + 1 = 17$)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $12 + 7 + 2 + 1 = 22$ pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ that satisfy $m^2 + n < 22$.",
