    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of different convex quadrilaterals that can be formed with the given conditions, we need to consider the different ways in which the 4 chosen points can form a convex quadrilateral.\n\nLet's denote the 10 distinct points on the circumference of the circle as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.
