    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Ten distinct points are identified on the circumference of a circle. How many different convex quadrilaterals can be formed if each vertex must be one of these 10 points?",
    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the different types of convex quadrilaterals we can make!\n\n1. Start by picking 4 points from the 10 on the circle.\n2. Connect each point to the other 3 points to make a quadrilateral.\n3. There are 10 choices for the first point, 9 choices for the second point, 8 choices for the third point, and 7 choices for the fourth point.\n4. But since the order we pick the points doesn't matter in a quadrilateral, we have to divide by 4! (4 factorial) to get rid of the extra counting.\n5. So the total number of quadrilaterals we can make is 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 / 4! = 210.\n6. So there are 210 different convex quadrilaterals we can make with 10 points on the circumference of a circle.\n7. Some quadrilaterals may look similar, but they are considered different because they are made up of different combinations of points.\n8. It's fun to try and find all the different types of quadrilaterals you can make with these 10 points!\n9. See if you can draw them out and count them all up.\n10. Have fun exploring shapes and geometry with the points on the circle!",
