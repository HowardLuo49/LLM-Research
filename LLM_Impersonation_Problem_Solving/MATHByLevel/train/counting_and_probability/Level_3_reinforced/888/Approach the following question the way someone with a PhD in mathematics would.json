    "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the minimum number of colors needed to shade the given tessellation, we can consider each distinct tile as a vertex and each shared side as an edge in a graph. We then want to find the chromatic number of this graph, which represents the minimum number of colors needed to color each vertex such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nIn this case, we can see that all the vertices in the graph have degree 3, meaning that each vertex touches exactly three edges (i.e. it shares a side with exactly three other tiles). Because the degree of every vertex is the same, we know that the chromatic number of the graph is either 3 or 4.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of colors needed to shade the tessellation, we must look for cycles of length 3 or 4 in the graph. In this tessellation, we can see that there are cycles of length 3, indicating that the chromatic number of the graph is 3.
