    "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",

We can alternate between two colors for each tile, like black and white. This way, no two tiles sharing a side will be the same color. So, the least number of colors needed is 2.",
