    "solution": "Clearly one color isn't enough; $\\boxed{2}$ colors will work because the tessellation shown is topologically identical to a chessboard (that is, imagine straightening out the diagonal lines to form an array of squares. This process doesn't change which tiles share a side.).",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have this tessellation with some hexagonal tiles. To figure out how many colors we need to shade it, we need to make sure that no two tiles sharing a side have the same color. Let's start with one tile and give it a color, let's say red. Then any tile sharing a side with the red tile can't be red, so let's color those blue. Then we can keep going, alternating colors until we cover the whole tessellation. \n\nIn this case, it looks like we only need two colors - red and blue. So, the least number of colors needed to shade this tessellation is 2.",
