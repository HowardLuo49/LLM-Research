    "solution": "By Pascal's Identity, we have $\\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{8}{4} = \\binom{9}{4}$.  However, we also have $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{9-4} = \\binom{9}{5}$.  There are no other values of $n$ such that $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{n}$, so the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... okay, let's see. We need to find the largest number we can make by adding two numbers together. The first number is $\\binom{8}{3}$, which means choosing 3 things out of 8. So that's 56. The second number is $\\binom{8}{4}$, which means choosing 4 things out of 8. So that's 70. Now we need to find what number we can choose out of 9 to make the biggest sum. Let's try adding some numbers. If we choose 9 things out of 9, that's 1. So let's try that. We get $\\binom{9}{9} = 1$. That's the biggest number we can make, so $n$ is 9. Yay, we did it!",
