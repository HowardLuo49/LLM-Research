    "solution": "By Pascal's Identity, we have $\\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{8}{4} = \\binom{9}{4}$.  However, we also have $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{9-4} = \\binom{9}{5}$.  There are no other values of $n$ such that $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{n}$, so the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first recall the formula for binomial coefficients: \n\n$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n\nUsing this formula, we can rewrite the given equation as:\n\n$$\\frac{8!}{3!5!} + \\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \\frac{9!}{n!(9-n)!}$$\n\nNow we simplify the left side of the equation by expanding the factorials:\n\n$$\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} + \\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{n!(9-n)!}$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$56 + 70 = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{n!(9-n)!}$$\n\n$$126 = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{n!(9-n)!}$$\n\nBy comparing the left and right sides of the equation, we can see that in order for the equation to be true, the right side must equal 126. \n\nAfter calculating the right side of the equation, we find:\n\n$$\\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{n!(9-n)!} = \\frac{3024}{n!(9-n)!} = 126$$\n\nFrom this equation, we can deduce that:\n\n$$3024 = 126n!(9-n)!$$\n\n$$n!(9-n)! = \\frac{3024}{126} = 24$$\n\nWe know that $n$ must be an integer, so we can list the factors of 24 as pairs ($n$, $9-n$) to see which pair adds up to 9. \n\nThe pairs are: (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6)\n\nFrom these pairs, it is clear that the pair (4, 6) adds up to 9.
