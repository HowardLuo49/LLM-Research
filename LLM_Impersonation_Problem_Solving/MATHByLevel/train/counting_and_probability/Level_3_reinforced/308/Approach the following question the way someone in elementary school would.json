    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the probability, we need to see how many different ways we can arrange the tiles. Since there are 5 tiles in total, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them. \n\nNow we need to see how many ways we can arrange the tiles to make the word XOXOX. There is only one way to arrange the tiles to get XOXOX. \n\nSo the probability of getting the arrangement XOXOX is 1 out of 5!, which is 1/120.",
