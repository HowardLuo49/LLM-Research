    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX, we need to consider the total number of possible arrangements of the five tiles. The total number of ways to arrange 5 tiles is 5 factorial, denoted as 5!. This is equal to 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the 3 X tiles and 2 O tiles to get XOXOX. The arrangement XOXOX can be achieved by fixing the position of the X in the first, third, and fifth slots, and the O in the second and fourth slots. The number of ways to arrange the Xs and Os in this specific order is 3 factorial (3!), which is equal to 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is 6/120 = 1/20.\n\nSo, the probability of randomly arranging the tiles to read XOXOX is 1/20.",
