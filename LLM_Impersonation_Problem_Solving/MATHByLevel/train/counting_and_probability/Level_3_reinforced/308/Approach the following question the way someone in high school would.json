    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of getting the arrangement XOXOX, we need to determine the total number of possible arrangements first. Since there are 5 tiles and they are all different, the total number of possible arrangements is 5! (5 factorial) which is equal to 120.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways we can arrange the tiles to get XOXOX. There is only one way to arrange the tiles to get XOXOX, so the number of successful outcomes is 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting the arrangement XOXOX is 1/120.",
