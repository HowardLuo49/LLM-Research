    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that Tim picks a matching pair of socks, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes. \n\nTim can choose any of the 18 socks as his first pick, and then any of the remaining 17 socks as his second pick. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 18 * 17 = 306.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes, which in this case is picking a matching pair of socks. Tim can either pick 2 gray-bottomed socks (10 choose 2 ways) or 2 white-bottomed socks (8 choose 2 ways), so the number of favorable outcomes is 10 choose 2 + 8 choose 2 = 45 + 28 = 73.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Tim picks a matching pair of socks is 73/306 \u2248 0.24 or 24%.",
