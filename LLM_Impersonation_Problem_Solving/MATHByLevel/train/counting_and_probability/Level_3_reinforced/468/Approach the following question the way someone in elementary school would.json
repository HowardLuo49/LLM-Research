Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, Tim has 18 socks in his drawer. To find the probability of picking a matching pair, we need to figure out how many ways he can do that.\n\nFirst, let's see how many ways he can pick two gray-bottomed socks. He has 10 gray-bottomed socks, so he can pick 2 out of 10 in 10 choose 2 ways = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = 45 ways.\n\nNext, let's see how many ways he can pick two white-bottomed socks. He has 8 white-bottomed socks, so he can pick 2 out of 8 in 8 choose 2 ways = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) = 8! / (2! * 6!) = 28 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways he can pick two socks that match is 45 (gray-bottomed socks) + 28 (white-bottomed socks) = 73 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a matching pair of socks is Total Number of Ways to Get a Matching Pair / Total Number of Ways to Pick 2 Socks = 73 / (18 choose 2) = 73 / (18! / (2! * (18-2)!)) = 73 / 153 = 0.477 or 47.7%.",
