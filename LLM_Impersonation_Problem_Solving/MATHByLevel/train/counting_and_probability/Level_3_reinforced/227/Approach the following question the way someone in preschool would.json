    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the triangles! I see that there are 8 vertices on the octagon, so we can choose any 3 of them to make a triangle. Let's start with the first vertex - we can connect it to any of the other 7 vertices to make a triangle. Since we have 7 choices for the second vertex, and 6 choices for the third vertex, we have 7 x 6 = 42 possible triangles with the first vertex. But wait! We also need to consider starting with the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth vertices. So we need to multiply 42 by 8 to find the total number of triangles we can make. That's 42 x 8 = 336 triangles in total. Wow, that's a lot of triangles with the vertices of an octagon!",
