    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so to find the number of triangles that can be formed with the vertices of a regular octagon, we need to use a formula. \n\nFor any polygon with n sides, the number of triangles that can be formed with its vertices is given by the formula: nC3, where nC3 represents \"n choose 3.\"\n\nSince our regular octagon has 8 sides, we can plug in 8 for n in the formula: 8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56.\n\nSo, there are 56 triangles that can be formed with the vertices of a regular octagon.",
