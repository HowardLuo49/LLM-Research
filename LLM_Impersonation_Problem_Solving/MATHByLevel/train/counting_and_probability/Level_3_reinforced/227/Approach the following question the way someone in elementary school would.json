    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many triangles we can make with an octagon, we need to remember that a triangle has 3 sides and 3 vertices. \n\nAn octagon has 8 vertices, so let's try choosing 3 of those vertices to make a triangle. \n\nIf we choose any 3 vertices, we can make a triangle. But we need to make sure we're not counting the same triangle more than once. \n\nFor example, if we choose vertices A, B, and C, we get triangle ABC. If we choose vertices B, C, and D, we get triangle BCD. These triangles are different. \n\nSo, we need to be careful not to count triangles that are the same, just in a different order. \n\nLet's count: we choose 1 vertex, then 2nd vertex, then the 3rd vertex. So the number of triangles we can make is 8C3. \n\n8C3 = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56 \n\nSo, we can make 56 different triangles using the vertices of a regular octagon.",
