    "solution": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many palindromes between 100 and 500 have at least one 5, we can start by listing out all the palindromes in that range: 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212, 222, 232, 242, 252, 262, 272, 282, 292, 303, 313, 323, 333, 343, 353, 363, 373, 383, 393, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484, and 494.\n\nNow, let's see which of these palindromes contain at least one 5: 151, 252, and 353.\n\nThere are 3 palindromes that have at least one 5 out of a total of 40 palindromes between 100 and 500. To find the percentage, we divide the number of palindromes with a 5 by the total number of palindromes and multiply by 100: (3/40) x 100 = 7.5%.\n\nSo, the percentage of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5 is 7.5%.",
