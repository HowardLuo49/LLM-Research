    "solution": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the percentage of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5, we first need to determine how many palindromes are there in this range.\n\nA palindrome is a number of the form XYX, where X and Y are digits. Since we are looking at numbers between 100 and 500, X can be any digit from 1 to 4 (as we are not considering numbers less than 100), and Y can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, the total number of palindromes between 100 and 500 is given by the product of the number of choices for X, Y, and X: 4 * 10 * 4 = 160.\n\nNow, let's consider how many of these palindromes contain at least one 5. There are three different cases to consider:\n\n1. X = 5, Y = any digit from 0 to 9, X = 5: There are 10 choices for Y (0-9), so 1 * 10 * 1 = 10 palindromes in this case.\n2. X = 1, 2, 3, 4, Y = 5, X = 1, 2, 3, 4: There are 4 choices for X, so 4 * 1 * 4 = 16 palindromes in this case.\n3. X = 5, Y = any digit from 0 to 9, X = 1, 2, 3, 4: There are 10 choices for Y (0-9) and 4 choices for X, so 1 * 10 * 4 = 40 palindromes in this case.\n\nAdding up the palindromes in each case, we get a total of 10 + 16 + 40 = 66 palindromes that contain at least one 5.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5 is given by (66/160) * 100% \u2248 41.25%.",
