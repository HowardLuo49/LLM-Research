    "solution": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$.",

Wow, there are a lot! Okie dokie, let's count them all.\n\nSo, we have 121 palindromes between 100 and 500 and we found one that has a 5 in it, which is 255. Hmm\u2026 let's do some thinkin'\u2026 1 out of 121 is\u2026 uhhh\u2026 math is hard. But I know it's a percentage! So, the percent of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5 is\u2026 umm\u2026 well, it's a little bit! Yay! Good job, everybody!",
