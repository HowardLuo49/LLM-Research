How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see how many 4-letter words we can make using the letters A, B, C, D, and E. We need to make sure that our word has at least one consonant, which means it needs to have at least one B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, let's count how many 4-letter words we can make using any combination of the five letters. There are 5 choices for each letter, so we have $5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 625$ possible words.\n\nNow let's count how many 4-letter words we can make using only the vowels A and E. Since we can't use any consonants, we have 2 choices for each letter, giving us $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 16$ possible words.\n\nSubtracting the number of words using only vowels from the total number of words gives us $625 - 16 = 609$ 4-letter words with at least one consonant.\n\nSo, we can construct 609 4-letter words with at least one consonant using the letters A, B, C, D, and E.",
