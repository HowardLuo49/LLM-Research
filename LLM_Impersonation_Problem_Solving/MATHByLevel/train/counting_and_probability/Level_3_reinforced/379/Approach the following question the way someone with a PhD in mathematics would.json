    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first calculate the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed using the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. Since we have 5 choices for each of the 4 positions, the total number of 4-letter words is $5^4 = 625$.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of 4-letter words with all vowels, i.e., using only the letter $A$ and $E$. Since we have 2 choices for each of the 4 positions, the number of such words is $2^4 = 16$.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is the difference between the total number of 4-letter words and the number of words with all vowels: $625 - 16 = 609$.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 609 4-letter words with at least one consonant that can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E.",
