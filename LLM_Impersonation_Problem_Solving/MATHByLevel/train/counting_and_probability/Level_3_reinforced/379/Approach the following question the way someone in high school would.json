How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",

    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 609?: To find the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant that can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$, we can use the complementary method.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed from these 5 letters:\n\n$5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$\n\nNext, we find the number of 4-letter words that only consist of vowels (in this case, only the letter $A$ and $E$):\n\n$2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$\n\nTherefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant that can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ is:\n\n$625 - 16 = 609$",
