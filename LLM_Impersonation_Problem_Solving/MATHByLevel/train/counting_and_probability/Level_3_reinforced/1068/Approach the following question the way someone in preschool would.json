    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. Choosing 3 out of 12 is $\\binom{12}{3}=\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count the triangles together! A triangle is formed by connecting three points. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, there are 12 vertices to choose from. \n\nTo make a triangle, we need to choose 3 vertices. The first point can be chosen in 12 ways, the second in 11 ways, and the third in 10 ways. However, we have to divide by 3! (3 factorial) because the order in which we choose the points doesn't matter. \n\nSo, the total number of triangles that can be formed is:\n\n12 * 11 * 10 / 3! = 220 / 6 = 36 \n\nWe can make 36 triangles using the vertices of a regular dodecagon! Yay, we did it!",
