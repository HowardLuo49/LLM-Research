    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. Choosing 3 out of 12 is $\\binom{12}{3}=\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many triangles can be made using the vertices of a regular dodecagon, we need to use some math! \n\nFirst, let's count how many vertices a dodecagon has. Since \"dodeca\" means 12 in Greek, we know that a dodecagon has 12 sides and 12 vertices. \n\nNow, to make a triangle, we need to choose 3 vertices out of the 12. We can do this by using a combination formula to find out how many ways we can choose 3 vertices from 12. \n\nThe combination formula is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items we want to choose, and ! means factorial, which is multiplying all the numbers before it. \n\nSo if we plug in the numbers for our dodecagon, we get:\n12C3 = 12! / 3!(12-3)! = 12! / 3!9! = 12 x 11 x 10 / 3 x 2 x 1 = 220\n\nSo there are 220 different triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular dodecagon. Yay math!",
