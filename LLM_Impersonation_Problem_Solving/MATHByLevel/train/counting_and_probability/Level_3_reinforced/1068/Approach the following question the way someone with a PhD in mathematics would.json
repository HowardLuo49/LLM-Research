    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. Choosing 3 out of 12 is $\\binom{12}{3}=\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular dodecagon, we first need to consider the number of ways we can choose 3 vertices out of the 12 vertices of the dodecagon. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of vertices (12 in this case) and k is the number of vertices we want to choose to form a triangle (3 in this case).\n\nUsing this formula, we get:\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!)\n         = 12! / (3! * 9!)\n         = 12 * 11 * 10 / (3 * 2 * 1)\n         = 220\n\nTherefore, there are 220 triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular dodecagon.",
