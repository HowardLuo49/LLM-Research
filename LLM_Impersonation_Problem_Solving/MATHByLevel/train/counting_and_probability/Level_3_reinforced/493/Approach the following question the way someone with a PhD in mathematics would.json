    "solution": "There are two O's, two I's, two N's and eleven total letters, so the answer is $\\dfrac{11!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{4,\\!989,\\!600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION, we first calculate the total number of letters in the word, which is 11. \n\nNext, we note that the word contains repeated letters: 2 Os, 2 Is, and 2 Ns. Therefore, we must account for these repetitions when calculating the number of arrangements.\n\nThe total number of ways to arrange the letters without considering repetition would be 11! (11 factorial), or 39916800.\n\nTo adjust for the repeated letters, we divide by the factorials of the number of repetitions for each letter:\n- For the Os: 2! = 2 (2 factorial)\n- For the Is: 2! = 2 (2 factorial)\n- For the Ns: 2! = 2 (2 factorial)\n\nTherefore, the number of unique ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION is:\n11! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 39916800 / 8 = 4989600\n\nSo, there are 4,989,600 distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION.",
