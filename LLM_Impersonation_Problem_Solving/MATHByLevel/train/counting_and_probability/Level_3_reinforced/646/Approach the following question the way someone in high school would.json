Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so in a circular table seating arrangement, the number of ways to arrange a group of people is (n-1)!, where n is the number of people. In this case, we have 10 politicians in total, so there are (10-1)! = 9! ways to arrange them around the table.\n\nHowever, since the politicians are split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, we have to take into account that the order of the Democrats and Republicans does not matter. So we have to divide by 2 to account for this, since there are 5! ways to arrange just the Democrats and 5! ways to arrange just the Republicans.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table without restrictions is (9!)/(2*5!*5!).",
