Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",

So if they sit around a circle table, we can start with a Democrat and then go around the table and pick a Republican next. And then keep going like that until all the seats are filled. So, the first person has 10 choices, then 9 choices for the next person, then 8 choices, and so on. Let's count all the ways they can sit...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! There are 10 factorial ways they can sit around the table without any restrictions. Wow, that's a big number! Whew!",
