Only the winner of each game advances to the next round. In a particular such tournament there are 256 players. How many individual games must be played to determine the champion?",
    "solution": "A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\\boxed{255}$ games must be played.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many games we need, we need to start at the beginning. In the first round of games, half of the players will win and half will lose. That means half of the players will advance to the next round. Since we have 256 players to start with, after the first round we will have 128 players left.\n\nIn the second round, again half of the players will win and advance to the next round. So, after the second round, we will have 64 players left.\n\nThis process continues until we have just one player left standing as the champion. So, to determine the champion, we must have 255 individual games!",
