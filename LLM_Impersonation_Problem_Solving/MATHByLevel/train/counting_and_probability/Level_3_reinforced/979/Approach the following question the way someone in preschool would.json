Only the winner of each game advances to the next round. In a particular such tournament there are 256 players. How many individual games must be played to determine the champion?",
    "solution": "A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\\boxed{255}$ games must be played.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, if there are 256 players in the tournament, that means in the first round there will be 128 games, as each game is between two players. Then in the second round, there will be 64 games, as half of the winners from the first round will advance. In the third round, there will be 32 games, then 16 games, then 8 games, then 4 games, then 2 games, and finally the championship game! So, if we add up all those games, we get: 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 games. So, a total of 255 individual games must be played to determine the champion! Yay, let's play!",
