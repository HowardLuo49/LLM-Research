    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that $(x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^{k}$.\n\nIn this case, $x = x$ and $y = -1$. So we have $(x-1)^9 = \\sum_{k=0}^{9} \\binom{9}{k} x^{9-k}(-1)^{k}$.\n\nTo find the coefficient of $x^8$, we need to find the term where $k=1$ because $9-1=8$. Plugging in $k=1$ into the equation above, we get $\\binom{9}{1} x^{9-1}(-1)^{1} = \\binom{9}{1} x^8(-1) = -9x^8$.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is $-9$.",
