    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any non-negative integer $n$ and any real numbers $a$ and $b$, the expansion of $(a+b)^n$ can be written as: \n\n$(a+b)^n = \\binom{n}{0}a^n b^0 + \\binom{n}{1}a^{n-1}b^1 + \\binom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^2 + \\ldots + \\binom{n}{n}a^0 b^n$\n\nIn this case, $a = x$ and $b = -1$, so we have:\n\n$(x-1)^9 = \\binom{9}{0}x^9(-1)^0 + \\binom{9}{1}x^8(-1)^1 + \\binom{9}{2}x^7(-1)^2 + \\ldots + \\binom{9}{9}x^0(-1)^9$\n\nNow we only need to look for the term with $x^8$ in it. In this case, that term is $\\binom{9}{1}x^8(-1)^1$, which simplifies to $-9x^8$. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is $-9$.",
