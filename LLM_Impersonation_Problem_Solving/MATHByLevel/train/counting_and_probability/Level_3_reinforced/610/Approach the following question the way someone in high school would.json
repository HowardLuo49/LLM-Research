    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of the first card being a 6 and the second card being a Queen, we need to first determine the total number of ways to choose two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards.\n\nThere are 4 suits in a deck, so there are 4 ways to choose the first card as a 6 (one 6 in each suit). After the first card is selected, there are 4 Queens in the deck, so there are 4 ways to choose the second card as a Queen.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose a 6 and then a Queen is 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any two cards from a deck of 52 cards is given by 52 choose 2, which is calculated as (52 * 51) / (2 * 1) = 1326.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a 6 and then a Queen from a standard deck of 52 cards is 16 / 1326 \u2248 0.0120 or about 1.20%.",
