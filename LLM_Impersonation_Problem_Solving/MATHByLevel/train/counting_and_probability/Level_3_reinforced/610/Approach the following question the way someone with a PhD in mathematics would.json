Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen, we must consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nFirstly, there are 52 cards in a standard deck, so the total number of possible outcomes is \\(52 \\times 51 = 2652\\).\n\nThere are four 6's in a deck (one for each suit), so the probability of drawing a 6 on the first card is \\(4/52 = 1/13\\).\n\nAfter drawing a 6 on the first card, there are 51 cards left in the deck. There are 4 Queens in a deck (one for each suit), so the probability of drawing a Queen on the second card is \\(4/51\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a 6 first and a Queen second is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{51}\\right) = \\frac{4}{663} \\approx 0.0060\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of drawing a 6 on the first card and a Queen on the second card is approximately 0.0060.",
