    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh! Let's see, there are 52 cards in the deck. And if we want the first card to be a 6, there are 4 sixes in the deck. So the probability of getting a 6 for the first card is 4 out of 52.\n\nNow, after we pick a first card, there are only 51 cards left in the deck. And since we want the second card to be a Queen, there are 4 Queens left in the deck. So the probability of getting a Queen for the second card is 4 out of 51.\n\nTo find the total probability of getting a 6 and then a Queen, we just multiply the probabilities together! So, 4/52 times 4/51 equals...hmm...let's see, that's 1/13 times 4/51...oh my, maths is hard. Let's ask a grown-up for help with this one!",
