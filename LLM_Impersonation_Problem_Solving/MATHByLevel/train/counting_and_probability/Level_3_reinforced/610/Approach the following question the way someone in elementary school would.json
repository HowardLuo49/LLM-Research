    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So first, we need to figure out how many 6s and Queens are in a deck of cards. There is only one 6 of hearts in the deck and there are four Queens (one of each suit). \n\nNext, we need to figure out how many total ways we can choose two cards from the deck. Since there are 52 cards in total, we have 52 choices for the first card and 51 choices for the second card.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose two cards is 52 * 51.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many ways we can choose a 6 of hearts for the first card and a Queen for the second card. There is only one 6 of hearts and four Queens, so there is only 1 * 4 = 4 ways to choose these two cards.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a 6 and then a Queen is 4 / (52 * 51).\n\nI hope that helps!",
