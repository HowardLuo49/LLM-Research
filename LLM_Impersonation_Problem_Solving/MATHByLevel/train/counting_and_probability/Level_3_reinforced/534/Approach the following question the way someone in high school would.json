    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that there are 26 red cards (13 hearts and 13 diamonds) out of the total 52 cards. So the probability of drawing a red card first is $\\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAfter drawing a red card, there are now 25 red cards left out of the remaining 51 cards. And since there are 26 black cards in total (13 spades and 13 clubs), the probability of drawing a black card second is $\\frac{26}{51}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red card first and a black card second is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{26}{51} = \\frac{13}{51}$.\n\nSo the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black is $\\frac{13}{51}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\dfrac{13?: Okay, so we know that there are 26 red cards (13 hearts and 13 diamonds) out of the total 52 cards.
