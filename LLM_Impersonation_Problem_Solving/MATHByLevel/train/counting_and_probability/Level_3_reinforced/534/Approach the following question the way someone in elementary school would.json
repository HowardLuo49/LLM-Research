A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so there are 52 cards in a deck. Half of them are black (26 black cards) and half are red (26 red cards). \n\nTo find the probability that the first card is red and the second card is black, we need to think about it like this: \n- Since half of the cards are red, the probability that the first card is red is 26/52 or 1/2.\n- After we choose a red card, there are now only 25 red cards and 26 black cards left in the remaining 51 cards.\n- So the probability of choosing a black card next is 26/51.\n\nNow, to find the total probability, we multiply the probabilities together:\n(1/2) * (26/51) = 26 / 102 = 13 / 51\n\nSo, the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black is 13/51.",
