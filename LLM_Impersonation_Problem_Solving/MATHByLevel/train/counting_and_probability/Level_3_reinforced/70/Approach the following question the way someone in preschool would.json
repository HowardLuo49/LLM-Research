    "solution": "There are 2 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in two different locations.  So the answer is $2^5 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We have 5 balls and we can put each ball in one box or the other. So we can put the first ball in box 1 or box 2, then the second ball in box 1 or box 2, and so on until all 5 balls are in one of the boxes. Let's try to count the different ways to do this. 1st ball: 2 choices, 2nd ball: 2 choices, 3rd ball: 2 choices, 4th ball: 2 choices, 5th ball: 2 choices. So, by counting all the choices for each ball, we find that there are 2x2x2x2x2 = 32 different ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes. Wow, that's a lot of ways!",
