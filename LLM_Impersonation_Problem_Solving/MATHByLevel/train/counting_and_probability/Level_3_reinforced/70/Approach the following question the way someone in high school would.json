    "solution": "There are 2 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in two different locations.  So the answer is $2^5 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes, we can think about each ball and decide which box to put it in. Since the balls are distinguishable, we can think of the balls as labeled or numbered.\n\nFor the first ball, we have 2 choices of which box to put it in. For the second ball, we also have 2 choices. Continuing this pattern, for each of the 5 balls, we have 2 choices of which box to put it in.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes is 2^5, which equals 32 ways.",
