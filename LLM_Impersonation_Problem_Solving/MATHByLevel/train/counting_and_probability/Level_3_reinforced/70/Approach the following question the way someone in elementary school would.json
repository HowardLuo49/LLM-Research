    "solution": "There are 2 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in two different locations.  So the answer is $2^5 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways we can put the balls in the boxes, let's start by looking at each ball. We can choose to put each ball in either box 1 or box 2. \n\nFor the first ball, there are 2 choices (box 1 or box 2). \nFor the second ball, there are also 2 choices (box 1 or box 2). \nAnd the same for the third, fourth, and fifth balls.\n\nSince there are 2 choices for each of the 5 balls, we can think of it as multiplying 2 choices together 5 times: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32.\n\nSo, there are 32 different ways to put 5 balls into 2 boxes if the balls and boxes are distinguishable.",
