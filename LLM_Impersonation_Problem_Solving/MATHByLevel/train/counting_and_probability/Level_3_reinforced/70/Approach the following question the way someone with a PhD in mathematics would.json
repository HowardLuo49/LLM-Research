    "solution": "There are 2 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in two different locations.  So the answer is $2^5 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can use the principle of combinations. \n\nFirst, consider the number of ways to distribute each ball individually. Since each ball has 2 choices of boxes to go into, there are 2*2*2*2*2 = 2^5 = 32 ways to distribute the 5 balls.\n\nHowever, this count includes cases where all 5 balls are in one box. To account for this, we subtract the case where all balls are in the same box from the total count. There are 2 ways for this to happen (all balls in box 1 or all balls in box 2).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes is 32 - 2 = 30 ways.",
