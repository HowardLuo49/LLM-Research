    "solution": "Let's deal with the restriction first.\n\nThe restriction is that we have to place a math book on both ends.  We have 3 choices for the math book to place on the left end, and then 2 choices for the math book to place on the right end.\n\nThen we simply need to arrange the other 6 books in the middle.  This is a basic permutation problem, so there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 remaining books.\n\nSo there are a total of $3 \\times 2 \\times 6! = \\boxed{4,\\!320}$ ways to arrange the books on the bookshelf.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! First, we choose a math book for the left end. There are 3 choices for that. Then, we choose a math book for the right end. There are 2 choices left for that. After that, we can arrange the remaining math book and history books in any order we want. So, we have 3 choices for the first math book, 2 choices for the second math book, and 5 choices for the history books. That gives us 3 x 2 x 5 = 30 different ways to arrange the books on the shelf. Yay!",
