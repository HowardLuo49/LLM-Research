    "solution": "Let's deal with the restriction first.\n\nThe restriction is that we have to place a math book on both ends.  We have 3 choices for the math book to place on the left end, and then 2 choices for the math book to place on the right end.\n\nThen we simply need to arrange the other 6 books in the middle.  This is a basic permutation problem, so there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 remaining books.\n\nSo there are a total of $3 \\times 2 \\times 6! = \\boxed{4,\\!320}$ ways to arrange the books on the bookshelf.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to figure out how many ways we can arrange just the 3 different math books. Since there are 3 math books, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange them. That's 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many ways we can arrange just the 5 different history books. Since there are 5 history books, there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them. That's 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 ways.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many ways we can arrange the math and history books altogether on the shelf. Since there are 6 ways to arrange the math books and 120 ways to arrange the history books, we just need to multiply those together. 6 x 120 = 720 ways.\n\nSo, there are 720 ways to arrange 3 different math books and 5 different history books on your bookshelf, with a math book on both ends.",
