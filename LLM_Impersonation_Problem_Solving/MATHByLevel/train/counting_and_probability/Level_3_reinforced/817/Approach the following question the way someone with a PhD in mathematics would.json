    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Eight women of different heights are at a party. Each woman decides to only shake hands with women shorter than herself. How many handshakes take place?",
    "solution": "Because the women are of different heights, any handshake will take place between two people, one of whom is taller than the other. Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself. Applying this logic to all of the pairs, there are $\\boxed{0}$ handshakes.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must consider the conditions given. Let's denote the heights of the women as h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, and h8, where h1 is the shortest and h8 is the tallest. Since each woman only shakes hands with women shorter than herself, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Woman at height h1 shakes hands with 0 women\n- Woman at height h2 shakes hands with 1 woman (h1)\n- Woman at height h3 shakes hands with 2 women (h1 and h2)\n- Woman at height h4 shakes hands with 3 women (h1, h2, and h3)\n- Woman at height h5 shakes hands with 4 women (h1, h2, h3, and h4)\n- Woman at height h6 shakes hands with 5 women (h1, h2, h3, h4, and h5)\n- Woman at height h7 shakes hands with 6 women (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6)\n- Woman at height h8 shakes hands with 7 women (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, and h7)\n\nThus, the total number of handshakes that take place at the party can be calculated as:\n\n0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 28 handshakes that take place at the party.",
