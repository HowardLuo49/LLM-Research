    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six standard six-sided dice, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes. Since each die has 6 sides, the total number of outcomes for rolling one die is 6. Thus, the total number of possible outcomes for rolling six dice is 6^6.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways we can roll six distinct numbers on the six dice. The first die can be any number from 1 to 6. The second die can be any number except the one already rolled on the first die, so there are 5 favorable outcomes. The third die can be any number except the two already rolled, so there are 4 favorable outcomes. Similarly, the fourth, fifth, and sixth dice have 3, 2, and 1 favorable outcomes, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six standard six-sided dice is given by:\n\n\\[\\frac{720}{6^6} = \\frac{720}{46656} = \\frac{5}{324}\\]\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\frac{5}{324}\\).",
