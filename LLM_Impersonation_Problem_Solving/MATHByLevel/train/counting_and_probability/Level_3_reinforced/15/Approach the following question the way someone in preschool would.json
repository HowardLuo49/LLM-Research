    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. Well, there are 6 sides on each dice, right? So, for the first dice, there are 6 choices. And for the second dice, there are 5 choices left since we can't repeat the number. And for the third dice, there are 4 choices left, and so on. So, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers would be 6/6 * 5/6 * 4/6 * 3/6 * 2/6 * 1/6 which simplifies to 1/6! Oh, I mean 1/720!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{5?: Hmm, let's see. Well, there are 6 sides on each dice, right? So, for the first dice, there are 6 choices. And for the second dice, there are 5 choices left since we can't repeat the number. And for the third dice, there are 4 choices left, and so on. So, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers would be 6/6 * 5/6 * 4/6 * 3/6 * 2/6 * 1/6 which simplifies to 1/6! Oh, I mean 1/720!",
