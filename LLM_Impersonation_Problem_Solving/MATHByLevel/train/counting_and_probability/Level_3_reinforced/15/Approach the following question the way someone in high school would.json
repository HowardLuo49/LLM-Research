    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six standard six-sided dice, we need to consider how many ways this can happen compared to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 6 choices for the first roll, 5 choices for the second roll (since we want distinct numbers), 4 choices for the third roll, and so on until the sixth roll, which only has 1 choice left. Therefore, there are 6! = 720 ways to roll six distinct numbers on six dice.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice is 6^6 = 46656.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six dice is 720/46656 = 5/324.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/324.",
