    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can treat it as a combination problem in combinatorics. Since Ace and Zeppo are already guaranteed to be in the starting lineup, we need to choose 3 players to fill the remaining spots from the remaining 10 players on the team.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 players from 10 without considering the order is given by the combination formula:\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nPlugging in the values for n = 10 and k = 3, we get:\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!)\n          = 10 * 9 * 8 / (3 * 2 * 1)\n          = 120\n\nTherefore, there are 120 different starting lineups possible for Coach Grunt to choose from.",
