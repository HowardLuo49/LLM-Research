    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so Coach Grunt needs to pick 3 more players to join Ace and Zeppo in the starting lineup. That means he needs to choose 3 players from the remaining 10 players on the team. So, to find out how many different starting lineups are possible, we just need to figure out how many ways Coach Grunt can choose those 3 players.\n\nTo do that, we can use combinations. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of players to choose from and r is the number of players we want to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (the remaining players) and r = 3 (the number of players to choose). So, the number of different starting lineups possible is:\n\n10C3 = 10! / 3!(10-3)! = 120\n\nSo, Coach Grunt can make 120 different starting lineups for the Grunters basketball team!",
