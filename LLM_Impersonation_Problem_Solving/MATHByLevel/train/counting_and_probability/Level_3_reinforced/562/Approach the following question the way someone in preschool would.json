There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie, let's count the different starting lineups for Coach Grunt's team! We know that Ace and Zeppo are definitely going to be in the lineup, so we have to pick 3 more players from the other 10 players on the team. Hmm... let me think... So we have to choose 3 out of 10, right? Let's see... 1, 2, 3... There are 10 ways to pick the first player, and then 9 ways left to pick the second player, and 8 ways left to pick the third player. Let's do some counting... 10 times 9 times 8 equals... umm... 720! So, there are 720 different starting lineups possible for the Grunters! Yay, we did it! Go team Grunters!",
