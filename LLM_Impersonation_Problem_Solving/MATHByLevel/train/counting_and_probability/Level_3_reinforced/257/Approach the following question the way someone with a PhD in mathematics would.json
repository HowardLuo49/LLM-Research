    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct, we can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X \u2265 k) = \u2211 from k to n of (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of questions (15 in this case), k is the minimum number of correct answers to consider (8 in this case, since half of 15 is 7.5, rounded up to 8), p is the probability of getting a question correct (1/2), and ( n choose k) is the number of ways to choose k correct answers out of n total questions.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nP(X \u2265 8) = \u2211 from 8 to 15 of (15 choose k) * (1/2)^k * (1/2)^(15-k)\n\nCalculating this sum and simplifying, we find:\n\nP(X \u2265 8) = 6435/32768\n\nTherefore, the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct is 6435/32768.",
