Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let's see. Steve has 15 questions to answer and there's only 2 choices for each question. That means he has a 1 in 2 chance of getting each question right. \n\nTo find the probability of getting at least half the questions correct, we need to consider all the possible ways he could get half of them right or more. \n\nSo with 15 questions, half would be 7 or more correct answers. \n\nLet's think about it this way: If Steve gets all 15 questions wrong, that's only one way he could fail. \n\nIf he gets 7 questions correct and 8 questions wrong, there are 15 choose 7 ways he could do that. \n\nIf he gets 8 questions correct and 7 questions wrong, there are 15 choose 8 ways he could do that. \n\nAnd so on...\n\nBut since we want to find the probability of him getting at least half the questions right, we need to add up all those possibilities. \n\nThat sounds like a lot of math for us little kids. Maybe we can ask a grown-up for help with this one. Or maybe we can just watch a fun movie instead! Yay!",
