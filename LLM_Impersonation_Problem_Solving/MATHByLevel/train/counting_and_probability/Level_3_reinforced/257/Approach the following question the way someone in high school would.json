Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct, we need to consider the different ways he can get exactly half and more than half of the questions correct.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of getting exactly half of the questions correct. Since there are 15 questions, getting exactly half correct means Steve would need to get 7 questions correct and 7 questions incorrect. The probability of getting exactly 7 questions correct is (1/2)^7 and the probability of getting exactly 7 questions incorrect is (1/2)^7 as well. We need to account for all possible ways he can get 7 questions correct, which can be calculated using binomial coefficient.\n\nNumber of ways of choosing 7 questions out of 15 = 15 choose 7 = 15C7 = 6435\n\nSo, the probability of getting exactly half of the questions correct is:\n\n6435 * (1/2)^7 * (1/2)^7 = 6435/2^14 = 6435/16384\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of getting more than half of the questions correct. This means Steve needs to get 8 or more questions correct. We can sum up the probabilities of getting 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 questions correct.\n\nProbability of getting at least 8 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^8 * (1/2)^7 * 15C8 = 3003/2^15\n\nProbability of getting at least 9 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^9 * (1/2)^6 * 15C9 = 1140/2^15\n\nProbability of getting at least 10 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^10 * (1/2)^5 * 15C10 = 300/2^15\n\nProbability of getting at least 11 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^11 * (1/2)^4 * 15C11 = 54/2^15\n\nProbability of getting at least 12 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^12 * (1/2)^3 * 15C12 = 6/2^15\n\nProbability of getting at least 13 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^13 * (1/2)^2 * 15C13 = 1/2^15\n\nProbability of getting at least 14 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^14 * (1/2) * 15C14 = 1/2^15\n\nProbability of getting all 15 questions correct:\n\n(1/2)^15 = 1/2^15\n\nNow, we calculate the total probability of getting more than half of the questions correct:\n\n3003/2^15 + 1140/2^15 + 300/2^15 + 54/2^15 + 6/2^15 + 1/2^15 + 1/2^15 + 1/2^15 = 4506/2^15\n\nTherefore, the total probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct is:\n\n6435/16384 + 4506/2^15 = 22941/32768\n\nSo, the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct is 22941/32768.",
