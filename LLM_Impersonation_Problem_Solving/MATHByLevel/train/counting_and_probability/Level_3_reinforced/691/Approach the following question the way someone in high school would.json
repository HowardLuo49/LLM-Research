    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's break this down step by step like we do in math class. \n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many options we have for the first letter of the license plate. Since it can start with either G or K, we have 2 options.\n\nNext, we need to determine the options for the last letter of the license plate, which must be T. So, we only have 1 option for the last letter.\n\nThen, we need to calculate the options for the three middle letters. Since we can't have any repeats and we can't have the letter S, we have 10 options for the second letter, 9 options for the third letter, and 8 options for the fourth letter.\n\nNow, we multiply all these options together to find the total number of possible license plates:\n2 (options for first letter) x 10 (options for second letter) x 9 (options for third letter) x 8 (options for fourth letter) x 1 (option for last letter) = 1440\n\nSo, there are 1440 possible license plates of five letters that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no repeating letters.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 1008?: Okay, let's break this down step by step like we do in math class. \n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many options we have for the first letter of the license plate.
