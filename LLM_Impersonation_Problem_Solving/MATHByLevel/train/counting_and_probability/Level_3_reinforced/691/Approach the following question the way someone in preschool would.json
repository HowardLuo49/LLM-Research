    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count the letters in the Rotokas alphabet. There are twelve letters \u2013 A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many different license plates we can make using these letters. \n\nFirst, we know that the license plate must have 5 letters. \n\nSince the license plate must start with either G or K, we have 2 choices for the first letter. \n\nSince the license plate must end with T, we only have 1 choice for the last letter. \n\nBecause the license plate cannot contain S, we cannot use that letter. \n\nSince the license plate must have no repeating letters, we must choose different letters for each position. \n\nConsidering all of these conditions, let's see how many possible license plates we can create. \n\nFirst letter: 2 choices (G or K)\nSecond letter: 10 choices (all letters except S)\nThird letter: 9 choices (all letters except S and the one used for the second letter)\nFourth letter: 8 choices (all letters except S and the two used for the previous letters)\nFifth letter: 1 choice (T)\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible license plates meeting all the conditions is:\n2 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 1 = 1440\n\nSo, there are 1440 possible license plates that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no repeating letters. Yay, we did it!",
