    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's break it down step by step!\n\nFirst, we want to find out how many license plates can begin with either G or K. Since we have two choices for the first letter (G or K), there are 2 possibilities.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many choices we have for the other three letters in the middle of the license plate. We cannot use S, so we have 10 letters left to choose from (A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, T, U, V). Since we can't repeat any letters, our choices for the second letter will be 10, for the third will be 9, and for the fourth will be 8.\n\nLastly, the last letter has to be T, so there is only 1 choice for that.\n\nTo find the total number of license plates that meet all the criteria, we multiply the number of choices for each position together: 2 (choices for the first letter) x 10 (choices for the second letter) x 9 (choices for the third letter) x 8 (choices for the fourth letter) x 1 (choice for the last letter) = 1440 possible license plates.\n\nSo, there are 1440 license plates of five letters that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no repeated letters!",
