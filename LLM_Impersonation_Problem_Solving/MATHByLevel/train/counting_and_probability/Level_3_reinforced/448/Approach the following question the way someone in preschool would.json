    "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! Let's find the answer to this problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see what the exclamation mark means. In math, it's called a factorial. It means you multiply all the numbers up to that number. For example, 5! (which is read as \"5 factorial\") is equal to 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.\n\nNow, let's look at the problem. We have (N-1)!, which means we multiply all the numbers up to N-1, and we have N!, which means we multiply all the numbers up to N, and we have (N+1)!, which means we multiply all the numbers up to N+1.\n\nSo, let's compute it step by step:\n\n(N-1)! = (N-1) x (N-2) x ... x 2 x 1\nN! = N x (N-1) x (N-2) x ... x 2 x 1\n(N+1)! = (N+1) x N x (N-1) x (N-2) x ... x 2 x 1\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the fraction:\n\n\\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!} = \\frac{(N-1) x (N-2) x ... x 2 x 1 x N}{(N+1) x N x (N-1) x (N-2) x ... x 2 x 1}\\]\n\nNow we can cancel out some terms in the numerator and denominator:\n\n= \\[\\frac{1}{N+1}\\]\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is 1/(N+1).\n\nYay! We did it! Great job, everyone!",
