    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A teacher wants to arrange 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory on a bookshelf. In how many ways can he do that?",
    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we can use the formula for permutations of a set of items. In this case, we have a total of 7 books to arrange (3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory). \n\nThe formula for permutations is n! / (n1! * n2! * ...), where n is the total number of items and n1, n2, etc. are the number of each type of item. \n\nPlug in the numbers:\n7! / (3! * 4!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / (3*2*1 * 4*3*2*1)\n= 5040 / (6 * 24)\n= 5040 / 144\n= 35 \n\nSo, there are 35 different ways the teacher can arrange the books on the bookshelf.",
