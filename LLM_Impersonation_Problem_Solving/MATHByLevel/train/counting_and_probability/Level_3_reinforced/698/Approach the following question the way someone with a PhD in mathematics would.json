    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A teacher wants to arrange 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory on a bookshelf. In how many ways can he do that?",
    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations with repetitions. \n\nThere are a total of 7 books to be arranged, with 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory. Therefore, the total number of ways the teacher can arrange the books is given by:\n\nTotal number of ways = 7! / (3! * 4!)\n\n= (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / (3*2*1 * 4*3*2*1)\n\n= 5040 / (6 * 24)\n\n= 5040 / 144\n\n= 35\n\nTherefore, the teacher can arrange the books in 35 different ways on the bookshelf.",
