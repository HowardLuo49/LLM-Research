    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A teacher wants to arrange 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory on a bookshelf. In how many ways can he do that?",
    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! First, let's arrange the copies of Introduction to Geometry. We have 3 copies, so we can arrange them in 3 ways. Now, let's arrange the copies of Introduction to Number Theory. We have 4 copies, so we can arrange them in 4 ways. \n\nTo find the total number of ways the teacher can arrange the books, we just need to multiply the number of ways to arrange Introduction to Geometry (3 ways) by the number of ways to arrange Introduction to Number Theory (4 ways).\n\nSo, 3 ways to arrange Introduction to Geometry * 4 ways to arrange Introduction to Number Theory = 12 ways in total.\n\nThere are 12 ways the teacher can arrange the books on the bookshelf! Great job counting!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 35?: Let's count together! First, let's arrange the copies of Introduction to Geometry.
