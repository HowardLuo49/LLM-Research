    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways the teacher can arrange the books, we have to use math. We can use something called combinations to help us. \n\nFirst, we need to add up all the copies of the books. There are 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory. So, there are 3 + 4 = 7 books in total.\n\nNext, we use a formula to find out the number of ways we can arrange the books. The formula is n! / (r1! * r2! * ... * rk!), where n is the total number of books and r1, r2, ... rk are the number of copies of each type of book.\n\nUsing our numbers, we get 7! / (3! * 4!) = 5040 / (6 * 24) = 35. \n\nSo, the teacher can arrange the books in 35 different ways.",
