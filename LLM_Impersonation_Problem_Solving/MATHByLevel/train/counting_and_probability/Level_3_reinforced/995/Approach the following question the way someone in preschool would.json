Each team has an equal chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Precisely one team must win at least four games.  Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's count the games the Badgers might win. So, if they win 4 games, they could also win 5, 6, or all 7 games. That's 4 different ways the Badgers could win at least 4 games. And remember, each team has an equal chance of winning, so the probability of the Badgers winning at least 4 games is 4/7. Go Badgers!",
