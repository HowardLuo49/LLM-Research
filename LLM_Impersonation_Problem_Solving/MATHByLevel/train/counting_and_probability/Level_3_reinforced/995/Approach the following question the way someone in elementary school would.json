Each team has an equal chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Precisely one team must win at least four games.  Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games out of seven, we can first find the probability of them winning exactly four games, then five games, then six games, and then all seven games.\n\nThe total number of ways the games can be played is 2^7 (since there are 2 choices for each game - either the Badgers win or the Cougars win).\n\nTo find the probability of the Badgers winning exactly four games, we use combinations. There are 7 games choose 4 that the Badgers can win, which is denoted as C(7,4) = 35.\n\nThe probability of winning exactly four games is (C(7,4)) / (2^7) = 35 / 128.\n\nSimilarly, we can find the probabilities of the Badgers winning exactly five games, six games, and all seven games.\n\nThe probability of the Badgers winning at least four games is the sum of the probabilities of them winning exactly four games, five games, six games, and all seven games.\n\nSo, the probability is (35/128) + (21/128) + (7/128) + (1/128) = 64 / 128 = 1 / 2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games out of seven is 1/2.",
