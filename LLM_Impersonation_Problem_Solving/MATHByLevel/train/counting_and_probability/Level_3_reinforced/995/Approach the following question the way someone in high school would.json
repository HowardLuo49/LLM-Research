    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The Badgers play the Cougars in a series of seven basketball games. Each team has an equal chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Precisely one team must win at least four games.  Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games out of seven, we can use a combination of outcomes. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes for each game, which is 2 (Badgers win or Cougars win). Since there are 7 games in total, there are a total of 2^7 = 128 possible outcomes for all the games. \n\nNext, let's find the number of ways the Badgers can win at least four games. \n- There are 4 ways the Badgers can win exactly 4 games out of 7. \n- There are 3 ways they can win exactly 5 games. \n- There are 2 ways they can win exactly 6 games. \n- There is 1 way they can win all 7 games. \n\nAdding these up, we get a total of 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 ways the Badgers can win at least four games. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is 10/128, which simplifies to 5/64. \n\nSo, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is 5/64.",
