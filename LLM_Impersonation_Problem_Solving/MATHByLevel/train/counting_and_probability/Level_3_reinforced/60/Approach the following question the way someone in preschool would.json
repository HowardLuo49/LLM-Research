    "solution": "There are $\\binom{12}{3} = \\boxed{220}$ ways to pick any 3 points, which we assume to determine a unique plane.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can pretend that the points are like little bugs flying around in the sky. When we connect three bug points to make a plane, we can only connect three points that aren't in a straight line. That's what non-collinear means. So if we have 12 bug points, we can make the most planes by connecting every group of three bug points that are not in a straight line. This is like building lots of triangle planes in the sky!\n\nTo figure out how many planes we can make with 12 bug points, we can use a little math magic. The formula is n choose k, which is a fancy way of saying we choose groups of 3 points from 12 points.\n\nSo we can calculate it like this: 12 choose 3 equals 220. This means we can make 220 planes with 12 bug points in space. That's a lot of planes flying around in the sky, just like in our bug world!",
