    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Tyler has entered a buffet line in which he chooses one kind of meat, two different vegetables and one dessert.  If the order of food items is not important, how many different meals might he choose?\n\n$\\bullet$  Meat: beef, chicken, pork\n\n$\\bullet$  Vegetables: baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes\n\n$\\bullet$  Dessert: brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream",
    "solution": "There are $3$ choices for the meat and $4$ for dessert.\n\nThere are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose $2$ of the $4$ vegetables, since we don't care about the order in which the vegetables are chosen.\n\nThe answer therefore is $3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6=\\boxed{72}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's start with the meat. Tyler can choose beef, chicken, or pork. That's three choices.\n\nNext, he gets to pick two different vegetables. He can choose from baked beans, corn, potatoes, or tomatoes. That's four choices. Since he can only pick two, we need to think about how many different ways he can choose two vegetables out of four options. \n\nHe can choose baked beans and corn, or potatoes and tomatoes, or any other combination. So, the number of ways he can choose two vegetables out of four options is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of options and $r$ is the number of choices. In this case, it's $\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\dfrac{4\\times 3}{2\\times 1} = 6$ different ways.\n\nLastly, he gets to choose one dessert. He can pick brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, or ice cream. That's four choices.\n\nTo find the total number of different meals Tyler can choose, we multiply the number of choices for each category: $3 \\text{ (meat choices)} \\times 6 \\text{ (vegetable combinations)} \\times 4 \\text{ (dessert choices)} = 72$. \n\nSo, Tyler can choose from 72 different meals at the buffet!",
