Tyler has entered a buffet line in which he chooses one kind of meat, two different vegetables and one dessert.  If the order of food items is not important, how many different meals might he choose?\n\n$\\bullet$  Meat: beef, chicken, pork\n\n$\\bullet$  Vegetables: baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes\n\n$\\bullet$  Dessert: brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream",
    "solution": "There are $3$ choices for the meat and $4$ for dessert.\n\nThere are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose $2$ of the $4$ vegetables, since we don't care about the order in which the vegetables are chosen.\n\nThe answer therefore is $3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6=\\boxed{72}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many different meals Tyler can choose, we need to multiply the number of choices for each category. \n\nFor the meat, Tyler can choose from 3 options (beef, chicken, pork). \nFor the vegetables, Tyler can choose 2 from 4 options (baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes), which can be calculated as 4 choose 2, denoted as $\\binom{4}{2}$. This is equal to 6 possibilities. \nFor dessert, Tyler can choose 1 from 4 options (brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream). \n\nSo, the total number of different meals Tyler can choose is 3 (meat choices) x 6 (vegetable choices) x 4 (dessert choices) = 72 different meals.",
