    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we can start by finding all possible 4-letter words that can be formed using the given letters. Since we can repeat letters and any word is valid, we have 5 choices for each position in the word.\n\nSo, the total number of 4-letter words using the letters A, B, C, D, and E is:\n\n5 choices for the 1st letter * 5 choices for the 2nd letter * 5 choices for the 3rd letter * 5 choices for the 4th letter = 5^4 = 625\n\nNext, we need to find the number of words that do NOT contain any vowels. This means we can only use the letters B, C, and D for these words. Using the same method as above, the total number of 4-letter words without vowels is:\n\n3 choices for the 1st letter * 3 choices for the 2nd letter * 3 choices for the 3rd letter * 3 choices for the 4th letter = 3^4 = 81\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of words with at least one vowel. This can be done by subtracting the number of words without vowels from the total number of words:\n\nTotal number of words - Number of words without vowels = 625 - 81 = 544\n\nSo, there are 544 4-letter words with at least one vowel that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E.",
