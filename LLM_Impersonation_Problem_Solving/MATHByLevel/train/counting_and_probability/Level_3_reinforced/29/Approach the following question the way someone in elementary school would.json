    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see how many 4-letter words we can make using the letters A, B, C, D, and E. We need to include at least one vowel, which means we have to use either A or E in our word.\n\nFirst, let's count all the possible 4-letter words we can make using any of the 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E) without restrictions. Since we can repeat letters, there are 5 choices for each letter, so there are 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 625 total 4-letter words possible.\n\nNext, let's find all the 4-letter words made only from B, C, and D (no vowels). Since there are 3 choices for each letter, that gives us 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81 words.\n\nNow, we can subtract the number of words with no vowels from the total possible words to find the number of words with at least one vowel:\n625 total words - 81 words with no vowels = 544 words with at least one vowel.\n\nSo, we can construct 544 different 4-letter words from the letters A, B, C, D, and E that have at least one vowel. Great job!",
