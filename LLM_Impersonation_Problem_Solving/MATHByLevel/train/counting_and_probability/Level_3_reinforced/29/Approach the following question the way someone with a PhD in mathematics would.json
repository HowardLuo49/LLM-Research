    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first determine the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed using the given letters. Since we have 5 choices for each of the 4 positions, the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed is 5^4 = 625.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of 4-letter words that do not contain any vowels (i.e., do not contain the letters A or E). Since we have 3 choices for each position (B, C, or D), the number of 4-letter words without vowels is 3^4 = 81.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of words without vowels from the total number of words to find the number of words with at least one vowel:\n625 - 81 = 544.\n\nTherefore, there are 544 4-letter words that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E with at least one vowel.",
