    "solution": "In all cases, at least half of John's kids will be boys or at least half will be girls.  Furthermore, since John has an odd number of children, these conditions are mutually exclusive--that is, they are never true at the same time.  Since a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, our answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so John has five kids. That means he could have anywhere from 0 to 5 girls. To figure out the probability that at least half of them are girls, we need to find the number of ways that there could be 3, 4, or 5 girls out of 5 kids.\n\nFirst, let's look at the ways he could have exactly 3 girls out of 5 kids. This is a combination problem, so we need to use the formula for combinations: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).\n\nFor 3 girls out of 5 kids: 5C3 = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10 ways.\n\nNow let's look at the ways he could have exactly 4 girls out of 5 kids.\n\nFor 4 girls out of 5 kids: 5C4 = 5! / (4! * (5-4)!) = 5 ways.\n\nFinally, let's look at the ways he could have all 5 girls out of 5 kids.\n\nFor 5 girls out of 5 kids: 5C5 = 5! / (5! * (5-5)!) = 1 way.\n\nNow, we add up all the ways he could have at least half girls: 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 ways.\n\nSince there are a total of 2^5 = 32 possible outcomes (2 options for each child), the probability of at least half of John's kids being girls is 16/32 = 1/2. \n\nSo, the probability that at least half of John's kids are girls is 1/2 or 50%.",
