    "solution": "In all cases, at least half of John's kids will be boys or at least half will be girls.  Furthermore, since John has an odd number of children, these conditions are mutually exclusive--that is, they are never true at the same time.  Since a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, our answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that at least half of John's five children are girls, we can use combinatorial methods. \n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when John has 5 children is 2^5 = 32. This is because each child can be either a girl or a boy, and there are 5 children.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways in which at least 3 out of the 5 children are girls. This can be done by summing the number of ways in which 3, 4, or 5 children are girls:\n\nNumber of ways in which exactly 3 children are girls: \n(5 choose 3) = 10 ways\nNumber of ways in which exactly 4 children are girls: \n(5 choose 4) = 5 ways\nNumber of ways in which exactly 5 children are girls: \n(5 choose 5) = 1 way\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 10 + 5 + 1 = 16.\n\nSo, the probability that at least half of John's children are girls is 16/32 = 1/2. \n\nThus, the probability that at least half of John's five children are girls is 1/2.",
