    "solution": "In all cases, at least half of John's kids will be boys or at least half will be girls.  Furthermore, since John has an odd number of children, these conditions are mutually exclusive--that is, they are never true at the same time.  Since a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, our answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to know how many ways we can have at least half girls out of the five children.\n\nIf we count all the possible combinations of children, there are 2^5 = 32 ways (each child can be a boy or a girl).\n\nNow we need to see how many ways we can have at least three girls out of the five children. \n\nIf we have 3 girls, that means we have 2 boys. There are 5 ways to choose which three children are girls (C(5, 3) = 5), and for each of these ways there is only 1 possible choice for the two boys.\n\nSo, there are 5 ways to have at least 3 girls out of the 32 possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least half of John's children are girls is 5/32 or 0.15625.",
