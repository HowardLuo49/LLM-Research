    "solution": "The row that starts 1, 12 is the row $\\binom{12}{0}, \\binom{12}{1}, \\binom{12}{2},\\binom{12}{3}$, so the fourth number in this row is $\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\boxed{220}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fourth number in the row, we need to expand the row further. Starting with 1 and 12, we can calculate the next number by adding the two numbers above it. So, 1 + 12 = 13. Continuing this pattern, the next number would be 1 + 13 = 14. And the next number after that would be 13 + 14 = 27. Therefore, the fourth number in the row would be 27.",
