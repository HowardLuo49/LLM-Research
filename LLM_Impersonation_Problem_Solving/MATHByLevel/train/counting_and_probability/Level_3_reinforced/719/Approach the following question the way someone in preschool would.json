    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we have the numbers 2, 0, 0, and 4. We can use these numbers to make different four-digit numbers by arranging them in different ways. Let's try and see how many numbers we can make! Let's start by putting 2 first, then put 0, 0, and 4. Then, let's try putting 2 first, then 0, 4, and 0. We can keep trying different combinations and see how many four-digit numbers we can make! Let's have fun exploring all the different possibilities!",
