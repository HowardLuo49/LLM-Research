    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many different four-digit numbers we can form using the digits in 2004, we need to identify the different combinations of the digits 2, 0, 0, and 4.\n\nSince there are repeated digits in 2004 (two zeros), we need to consider the number of ways we can arrange these digits. \n\nFirst, let's list out the possible arrangements:\n\n1. 2004\n2. 2040\n3. 2400\n4. 0204\n5. 0240\n6. 0420\n7. 0042\n8. 0024\n9. 0402\n10. 0420\n11. 4002\n12. 4020\n\nTherefore, there are 12 different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004.",
