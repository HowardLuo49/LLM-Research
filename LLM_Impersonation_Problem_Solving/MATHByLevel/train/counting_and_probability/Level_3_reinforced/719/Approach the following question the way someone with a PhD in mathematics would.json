    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many different four-digit numbers can be formed by arranging the four digits in 2004?",
    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004, we must consider all possible permutations of the four digits 2, 0, 0, and 4.\n\nFirst, we note that the digit '0' is repeated twice in 2004. This means that when we list out all possible permutations of the digits, we will have some duplicate sequences. \n\nTo calculate the total number of permutations, we can use the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time with repetition allowed, which is given by n^r, where n is the number of distinct objects (in this case, 4) and r is the number of times each object can be repeated.\n\nSo, the total number of different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004 is 4^4 = 256.\n\nTherefore, there are 256 different four-digit numbers that can be formed by arranging the digits in 2004.",
