    "solution": "There are 5 steps to the right, and 4 steps up.  These 9 steps can be made in any order, so we can choose 4 of the 9 steps to be \"up\" in $\\binom{9}{4} = \\boxed{126}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use combinatorial arguments. Let us denote every step to the right as \"$R$\" and every step up as \"$U$\". Since there are a total of $w$ steps to the right and $h$ steps upwards to reach from $A$ to $B$, there are a total of $w+h$ steps.\n\nTo get from $A$ to $B$, we need to take exactly $w$ steps to the right and $h$ steps up. Therefore, the number of paths from $A$ to $B$ can be represented by the number of ways to arrange $w$ $R$'s and $h$ $U$'s. This is equivalent to choosing $w$ steps out of $w+h$ steps to be $R$'s, because once we determine where the $R$'s are, the rest of the positions will be $U$'s.\n\nTherefore, the number of paths from $A$ to $B$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{w+h}{w}$.",
