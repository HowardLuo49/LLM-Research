    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's play a fun game! We have four friends who want to stand in a line, but two of them don't want to stand next to each other. How many different ways can they stand in a line?\n\nFirst, let's imagine our friends are named A, B, C, and D. \n\nIf A and B don't want to stand next to each other, we can start by putting A in the front. Then we have three spots for B, C, and D. B can go in the second spot, C can go in the third spot, and D can go in the last spot. So, that's one way they can stand in a line without A and B standing next to each other.\n\nNow let's try putting B in the front. Then we have A, C, and D left to place. A can go in the second spot, C in the third, and D in the last spot. That's another way they can stand in a line without A and B standing next to each other.\n\nSo, there are two different ways our friends can stand in a line without A and B standing next to each other.
