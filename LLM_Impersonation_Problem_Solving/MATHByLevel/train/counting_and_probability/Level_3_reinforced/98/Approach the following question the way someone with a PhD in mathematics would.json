    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we need only count the number of balls in the distinguishable boxes.  We can put 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 balls in Box 1 (and the rest go in Box 2).  So there are $\\boxed{6}$ different arrangements.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can use a concept known as \"stars and bars.\" Since the balls are indistinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable, we can imagine representing the balls as stars and the boxes as bars.\n\nWe can think of the problem as finding the number of ways to distribute 5 identical balls among 2 distinct boxes. \n\nFor this scenario, we can visualize 5 balls as * * * * * and 2 boxes as | |. \n\nBy placing the bars among the stars, we can come up with different arrangements that represent each distribution of balls in boxes. For example, * | * * * | | * represents 1 ball in the first box, 3 in the second box, and 1 remaining ball in the second box.\n\nThe total number of ways to distribute the balls among the boxes can be calculated using the formula (n + k - 1) choose (k - 1), where n is the number of objects to distribute (in this case, 5 balls) and k is the number of divisions or boxes (2 in this scenario).\n\nThus, the number of ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes when the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are is given by (5+2-1) choose (2-1) = 6 choose 1 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 ways to distribute the 5 balls among the 2 boxes in this scenario.",
