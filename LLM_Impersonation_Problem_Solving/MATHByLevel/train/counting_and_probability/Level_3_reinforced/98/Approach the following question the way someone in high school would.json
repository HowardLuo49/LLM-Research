    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we need only count the number of balls in the distinguishable boxes.  We can put 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 balls in Box 1 (and the rest go in Box 2).  So there are $\\boxed{6}$ different arrangements.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can think of it as a distribution problem. Since the balls are not distinguishable, we just need to focus on distributing the balls into the boxes.\n\nTo distribute the 5 balls into 2 boxes, we can use the concept of combinations. We want to choose 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 balls to put in one of the boxes, which means the other box will automatically get the remaining balls.\n\nThere are 6 ways to distribute the balls:\n1. 5 balls in one box, 0 balls in the other box\n2. 4 balls in one box, 1 ball in the other box\n3. 3 balls in one box, 2 balls in the other box\n4. 2 balls in one box, 3 balls in the other box\n5. 1 ball in one box, 4 balls in the other box\n6. 0 balls in one box, 5 balls in the other box\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to put 5 balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
