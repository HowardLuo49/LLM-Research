We have to use the distributive property to multiply out all the terms. It can be a little tricky, but with practice, we can get better at it!\n\nSo, let's see how we can find the $x^2y^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+y)^6. It may take some time and patience, but don't worry! We can do it with some help from our teacher or friend. Let's give it a try and have fun learning together!",
