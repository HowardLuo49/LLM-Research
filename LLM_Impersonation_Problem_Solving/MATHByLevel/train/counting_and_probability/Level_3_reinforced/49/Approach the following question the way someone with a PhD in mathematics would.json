    "solution": "We find the point which is equidistant from 0 and 4. Clearly, this occurs at 2. So, for all $x > 2$, $x$ is closer to 4 than 0. So, the probability is equal to the length of this region $\\frac{5-2}{5} = \\boxed{.6}$.",

This occurs when the point is within the interval (0, 2] or [4, 5).
