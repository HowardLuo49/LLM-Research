    "solution": "We find the point which is equidistant from 0 and 4. Clearly, this occurs at 2. So, for all $x > 2$, $x$ is closer to 4 than 0. So, the probability is equal to the length of this region $\\frac{5-2}{5} = \\boxed{.6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, the portion of the number line shown goes from 0 to 5. That means that the total distance from 0 to 5 is 5 units.\n\nIf we want to know the probability that a point is closer to 4 than to 0, we need to think about the distance from each of those points. The distance from 0 to 4 is 4 units, and the distance from 4 to 5 is only 1 unit.\n\nSo, since the total distance is 5 units and we want to know the probability that the point is closer to 4, we can say the probability is 4/5, which is 0.8 as a decimal.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the point is closer to 4 than to 0 is 0.8.",
