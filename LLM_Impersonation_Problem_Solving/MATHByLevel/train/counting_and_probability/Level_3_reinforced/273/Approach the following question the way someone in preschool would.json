We can put 3 balls in the first box and 1 ball in the second box.\n3. We can put 2 balls in the first box and 1 ball in the second box and 1 ball in the third box.\n4. We can put 2 balls in the first box and 2 balls in the second box.\n5. We can put 1 ball in each box.\n\nSo, there are 5 ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls and boxes are not distinguishable.
