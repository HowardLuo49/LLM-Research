    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
    "solution": "Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order.  The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. Since the balls and boxes are not distinguishable, we can think of the problem as distributing 4 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes. \n\nBy using stars and bars, we can imagine placing 3 bars (representing the boundaries of the boxes) among 4 stars (representing the balls). The number of ways to distribute the balls can then be calculated by finding the number of distinct ways to arrange the 3 bars and 4 stars. This can be calculated using the formula (n+k-1) choose (k-1), where n is the number of stars (balls) and k is the number of bars (boxes).\n\nIn this case, n = 4 and k = 3. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes is calculated as (4+3-1) choose (3-1) = 6 choose 2 = 15. \n\nTherefore, there are 15 ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes.",
