    "solution": "Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order.  The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we have 4 balls and 3 boxes. Since the balls and boxes are not different from each other, we can just count all the different ways we can distribute the balls in the boxes. \n\nHere are all the possible ways:\n\n- All 4 balls in one box\n- 3 balls in one box, 1 ball in another box\n- 2 balls in one box, 2 balls in another box\n- 2 balls in one box, 1 ball in another box, and 1 ball in the remaining box\n\nSo, there are 4 different ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes when the balls and boxes are not distinguishable.",
