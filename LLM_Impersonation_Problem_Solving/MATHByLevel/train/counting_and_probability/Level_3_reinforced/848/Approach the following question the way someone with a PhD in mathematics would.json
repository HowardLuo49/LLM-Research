A sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of cheese. Ham, chicken, cheddar cheese, and white bread are each offered at the deli. If Al never orders a sandwich with a ham/cheddar cheese combination nor a sandwich with a white bread/chicken combination, how many different sandwiches could Al order?",
    "solution": "First, count the total number of possible sandwiches. There are four choices for bread, six for meat, and five for cheese, for a total of $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 120$ potential sandwiches. Discarding the ham / cheddar cheese combination will subtract four sandwiches (one for each type of bread). Similarly, discarding the white bread / chicken combination will subtract five sandwiches, one for each kind of cheese. Thus, Al can order $120 - 4 - 5 = \\boxed{111}$ different sandwiches.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will need to use the principle of combinatorics, specifically the principle of multiplication.\n\nLet's break down the problem. There are 4 types of bread, 6 types of meat, and 5 types of cheese. Since a sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of cheese, we need to find the total number of possible combinations of bread, meat, and cheese.\n\nFirst, let's consider all possible combinations without any restrictions. The total number of possible sandwiches would be:\n\n4 (types of bread) * 6 (types of meat) * 5 (types of cheese) = 120 different combinations.\n\nNow, let's consider the restrictions given in the problem. Al never orders a sandwich with a ham/cheddar cheese combination nor a sandwich with a white bread/chicken combination. We must subtract these restricted combinations from the total.\n\nThere are 2 restricted combinations:\n- Ham and cheddar cheese\n- White bread and chicken\n\nEach of these combinations eliminates 1 possible sandwich from the total.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different sandwiches that Al could order is:\n\n120 (total possible combinations) - 2 (restricted combinations) = 118 different sandwiches. \n\nThus, Al has 118 different sandwiches to choose from.",
