    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The deli has four kinds of bread, six kinds of meat, and five kinds of cheese. A sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of cheese. Ham, chicken, cheddar cheese, and white bread are each offered at the deli. If Al never orders a sandwich with a ham/cheddar cheese combination nor a sandwich with a white bread/chicken combination, how many different sandwiches could Al order?",
    "solution": "First, count the total number of possible sandwiches. There are four choices for bread, six for meat, and five for cheese, for a total of $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 120$ potential sandwiches. Discarding the ham / cheddar cheese combination will subtract four sandwiches (one for each type of bread). Similarly, discarding the white bread / chicken combination will subtract five sandwiches, one for each kind of cheese. Thus, Al can order $120 - 4 - 5 = \\boxed{111}$ different sandwiches.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So, let's see. Al can choose from four types of bread, six types of meat, and five types of cheese. But remember, Al can't have a sandwich with ham and cheddar cheese together or white bread and chicken together. So let's think about all the possible combinations Al can have:\n\n- There are four types of bread to choose from (white bread, others)\n- There are six types of meat to choose from (ham, chicken, others)\n- There are five types of cheese to choose from (cheddar cheese, others)\n\nLet's calculate the possibilities:\n\nIf Al chooses white bread, he can have it with any meat (except chicken) and any cheese (except cheddar cheese), so that's 5 types of meat and 4 types of cheese.\nIf Al chooses other types of bread, he can have them with any meat and any cheese, so that's 6 types of meat and 5 types of cheese.\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n\n5 (types of meat with white bread) * 4 (types of cheese with white bread) = 20 possibilities\n6 (types of meat with other types of bread) * 5 (types of cheese with other types of bread) = 30 possibilities\n\nSo, Al can order a total of 20 + 30 = 50 different sandwiches. Yay for sandwiches!",
