If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So let's count the girls first! There are 3 girls out of the 5 total contestants. Now let's pick 2 out of those 3 girls. So for the first girl, there's a 3 out of 5 chance to pick her. Then for the second girl, there's a 2 out of 4 chance to pick her since we already picked one girl. \n\nSo the fraction would be 3/5 * 2/4 = 6/20 = 3/10. So the probability that both chosen contestants are female is 3/10. Yay! Girls rule!",
