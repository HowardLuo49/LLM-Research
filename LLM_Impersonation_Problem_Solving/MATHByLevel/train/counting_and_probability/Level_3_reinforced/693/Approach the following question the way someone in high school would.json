    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Of the final five contestants in a television show, three are female and two are male. If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both final contestants of the television show are female, we first need to find the total number of ways two contestants can be chosen out of the five remaining contestants.\n\nThere are 5 contestants to choose from, so the total number of ways to choose 2 out of 5 contestants is given by the combination formula: \n\n5 choose 2 = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 females out of the 3 female contestants. This can be done using the combination formula again:\n\n3 choose 2 = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3\n\nTherefore, the probability that both final contestants are female is given by the number of ways to choose 2 females out of 3 divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants out of 5:\n\n3/10 = 3/10\n\nSo, the probability that both final contestants are female is 3/10.",
