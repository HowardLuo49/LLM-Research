If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of ways in which 2 contestants can be chosen from the final five. This can be done using combinations, denoted as \"n choose k\" or \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\).\n\nIn this case, there are 5 contestants to choose from, and we want to choose 2 of them, so the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants from 5 is:\n\n\\( \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10 \\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways in which both chosen contestants are female. Since there are 3 female contestants out of the 5 total, the number of ways to choose 2 female contestants from the 3 available is:\n\n\\( \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3}{2} = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that both chosen contestants are female is given by:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 female contestants}}{\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 contestants from 5}} = \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3}{10} \\).\n\nSo, the probability that both chosen contestants are female is \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\).",
