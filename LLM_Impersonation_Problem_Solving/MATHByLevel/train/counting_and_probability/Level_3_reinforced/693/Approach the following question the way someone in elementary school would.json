If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "There are 5 contestants left, and we need to pick 2 of them. Since 3 of them are female, that means we can pick 2 females in 3 ways.\n\nNext, we need to find all the ways to pick 2 contestants out of 5. This is a combination problem, so the formula is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!. Plugging in our numbers, we get 5C2 = 5! / 2!(5-2)! = 10 ways.\n\nSo, the probability that both contestants chosen are female is 3/10 or three tenths.",
