    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A club has $5$ members from each of $3$ different schools, for a total of $15$ members. How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
    "solution": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into multiple steps to determine the total number of ways to arrange the presidency meeting under the given conditions.\n\nStep 1: Choosing the host school\nSince there are 3 schools to choose from, there are 3 ways to select the host school.\n\nStep 2: Selecting the host school representatives\nAfter selecting the host school, we need to choose 2 representatives from that school. Since there are 5 members from each school, the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from the host school is ${5 \\choose 2}$.\n\nStep 3: Selecting the representatives from the other schools\nFor each of the other two schools, we need to choose 1 representative. Since there are 5 members at each school, the number of ways to choose 1 representative from each of the other two schools is ${5 \\choose 1} \\times {5 \\choose 1}$.\n\nStep 4: Multiplying the possibilities together\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange the presidency meeting, we multiply the number of ways to choose the host school, the host school representatives, and the representatives from the other schools together:\n\nTotal number of ways = (Number of ways to choose host school) $\\times$ (Number of ways to choose host school representatives) $\\times$ (Number of ways to choose representatives from other schools)\n\nTotal number of ways = 3 $\\times$ ${5 \\choose 2}$ $\\times$ ${5 \\choose 1} \\times {5 \\choose 1}$\n\nThis simplifies to: 3 $\\times$ 10 $\\times$ 5 $\\times$ 5 = 750\n\nTherefore, there are 750 possible ways to arrange the presidency meeting under the given conditions.",
