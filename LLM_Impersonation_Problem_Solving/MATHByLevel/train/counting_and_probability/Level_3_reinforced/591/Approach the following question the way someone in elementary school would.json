    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A club has $5$ members from each of $3$ different schools, for a total of $15$ members. How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
    "solution": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways the presidency meeting can be arranged, we can break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Choose the school to host the meeting\nSince the club can only choose one of the three schools to host the meeting, there are $3$ ways to do this.\n\nStep 2: Choose the representatives from each school\nOnce the host school is chosen, we need to pick $2$ representatives from that school. Then, we need to choose $1$ representative from each of the other two schools.\n\nFor the host school, there are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ ways to pick $2$ representatives out of $5$.\n\nFor the other two schools, there are $5$ ways to pick $1$ representative from each school.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the number of ways for each step\nTo find the total number of ways to arrange the presidency meeting, we just need to multiply the number of ways for each step:\n\n$3 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 750$\n\nSo there are $750$ possible ways to arrange the presidency meeting with the given conditions.",
