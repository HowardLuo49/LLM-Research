    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{21}{11}=\\binom{21}{21-11}=\\binom{21}{10}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{20}{9}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First off, let's break down what each of these symbols mean. $\\binom{20}{n}$ represents a combination of choosing $n$ items out of a set of 20 items. So $\\binom{20}{10}$ is choosing 10 items out of 20. $\\binom{21}{11}$ is choosing 11 items out of 21. \n\nNow, let's look at the equation $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$. We want to find the sum of all integer values of $n$ that make this equation true.\n\nTo make things simpler, we can use the property of Pascal's Triangle. We know that $\\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{20}{20-10} = \\binom{20}{10}$. So our equation simplifies to $\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{20-n} = \\binom{21}{11}$.\n\nNow we can look at Pascal's Triangle to find all the values of $n$ that make this equation true. By examining the numbers in the appropriate row of Pascal's Triangle, we see that the only possible integer values of $n$ are $5$ and $15$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values of $n$ that make the equation true is $5+15=20$.",
