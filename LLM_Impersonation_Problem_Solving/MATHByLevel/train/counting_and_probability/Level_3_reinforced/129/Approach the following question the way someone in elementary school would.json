    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{21}{11}=\\binom{21}{21-11}=\\binom{21}{10}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{20}{9}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we want to find the sum of all integer values of $n$ that make $\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$. Let's start by remembering that $\\binom{n}{k}$ means the number of ways to choose $k$ items from a total of $n$ items. \n\nTo make this problem easier, we can use the property of Pascal's Triangle. We know that $\\binom{21}{11}$ is the number of ways to choose 11 items from a total of 21 items. We also know that $\\binom{20}{10}$ is the number of ways to choose 10 items from a total of 20 items. \n\nNow let's focus on $\\binom{20}{n}$. We want to find the sum of all the $n$ values that make $\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$. Using Pascal's Triangle, we find that $\\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{20}{10}$. \n\nSo, the sum of all the $n$ values that make the equation true is just 10. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which $\\binom{20}{n}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
