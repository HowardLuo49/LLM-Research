    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{20}{11}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{21}{11}=\\binom{21}{21-11}=\\binom{21}{10}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{20}{9}+\\binom{20}{10}=\\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\\boxed{20}$.",

Hmm, well $\\binom{20}{10}$ is just $\\binom{20}{10}$, so that's easy. And $\\binom{21}{11}$ is just $\\binom{21}{11}. So we need to find $n$ so that $\\binom{20}{n} + \\binom{20}{10} = \\binom{21}{11}$. Let's see, hmm, well, maybe we could try different numbers for $n$ and see which one works. Maybe $n=5$?
