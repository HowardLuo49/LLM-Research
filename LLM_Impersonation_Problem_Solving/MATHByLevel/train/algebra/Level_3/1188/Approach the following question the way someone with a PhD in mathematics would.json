    "solution": "We can factor the expression $x-3$ out of each term: \\[2x(x-3) + 3(x-3) = 2x\\cdot (x-3) + 3\\cdot (x-3) = \\boxed{(2x+3)(x-3)}.\\] If you don't quite see how this works, suppose we put $A$ in place of $x-3$ everywhere in the original expression. Then we can see the factoring more clearly: \\[2xA +3A = 2x\\cdot A + 3\\cdot A = (2x+3)A.\\] Putting $x-3$ back in for $A$, we have our factorization: $(2x+3)(x-3)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To factor the expression $2x(x-3) + 3(x-3)$, we first notice that both terms have a common factor of $(x-3)$. We can factor out $(x-3)$ from both terms to simplify the expression:\n\n$2x(x-3) + 3(x-3) = (2x+3)(x-3)$\n\nTherefore, the factored form of the expression $2x(x-3) + 3(x-3)$ is $(2x+3)(x-3)$.",
