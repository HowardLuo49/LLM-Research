    "solution": "We can factor the expression $x-3$ out of each term: \\[2x(x-3) + 3(x-3) = 2x\\cdot (x-3) + 3\\cdot (x-3) = \\boxed{(2x+3)(x-3)}.\\] If you don't quite see how this works, suppose we put $A$ in place of $x-3$ everywhere in the original expression. Then we can see the factoring more clearly: \\[2xA +3A = 2x\\cdot A + 3\\cdot A = (2x+3)A.\\] Putting $x-3$ back in for $A$, we have our factorization: $(2x+3)(x-3)$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we can look for common factors in each term of the expression. We see that both terms have a factor of $(x-3)$. So we can factor out that common factor:\n\n$2x(x-3) + 3(x-3)$\n\n= $(x-3)(2x + 3)$\n\nSo the factored form of the expression is $(x-3)(2x + 3)$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to (2x+3)(x-3)?: First, we can look for common factors in each term of the expression.
