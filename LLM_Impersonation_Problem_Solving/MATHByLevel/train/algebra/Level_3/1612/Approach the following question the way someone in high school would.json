    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. I had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?",
    "solution": "If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional. Consequently, if I only work $\\frac{10}{12}=\\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week. $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\\boxed{24}$ hours a week.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so originally I was going to work 20 hours a week for 12 weeks, which would give me a total of 240 hours of work and $\\$3000. But since I was sick for the first two weeks, I missed out on 40 hours of work. \n\nNow I have 10 weeks left to work and I still need to earn the full $\\$3000. To make up for those missed 40 hours, I need to work extra hours each week for the remaining 10 weeks. \n\nSo, in total, I need to work 200 hours in 10 weeks to buy the car. That means I'll need to work 20 hours a week for the rest of the summer.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 24?: Okay, so originally I was going to work 20 hours a week for 12 weeks, which would give me a total of 240 hours of work and $\\$3000. But since I was sick for the first two weeks, I missed out on 40 hours of work. \n\nNow I have 10 weeks left to work and I still need to earn the full $\\$3000.
