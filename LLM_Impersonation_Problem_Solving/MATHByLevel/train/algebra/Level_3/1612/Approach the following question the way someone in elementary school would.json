    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. I had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?",
    "solution": "If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional. Consequently, if I only work $\\frac{10}{12}=\\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week. $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\\boxed{24}$ hours a week.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh no! That's too bad that you got sick for the first two weeks. Let's see, you were planning to work 20 hours a week for 12 weeks, which is a total of 240 hours. But now you missed 2 weeks, so you'll have to make up for that time. You still want to earn $\\$3000$, so now you only have 10 weeks left to work. If you divide 240 hours by 10 weeks, you'd have to work 24 hours a week for the rest of the summer to still be able to buy the car. Wow, that's a lot of hours! But if you really want that car, you can do it!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 24?: Oh no! That's too bad that you got sick for the first two weeks. Let's see, you were planning to work 20 hours a week for 12 weeks, which is a total of 240 hours. But now you missed 2 weeks, so you'll have to make up for that time. You still want to earn $\\$3000$, so now you only have 10 weeks left to work.

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No, the final solution (24 hours a week) is not equal to 24 dollars.",
