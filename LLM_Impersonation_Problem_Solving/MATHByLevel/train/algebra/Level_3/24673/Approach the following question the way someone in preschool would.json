    "solution": "$\\left( \\frac{1}{2k} \\right)^{-2} \\cdot (-k)^3 = (2k)^2 \\cdot (-k)^3 = 4k^2 \\cdot (-k^3) = \\boxed{-4k^5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the first part with the fancy fraction. The fraction is like sharing something into 2 equal parts, and then we need to do it again. Since it's in the denominator, it means we need to flip it over. So, $\\left( \\frac{1}{2k} \\right)^{-2}$ is the same as $(2k)^2$, which simplifies to $4k^2$.\n\nNow, let's look at the second part. We have a negative number, $-k$, and we need to multiply it by itself 3 times. This means we need to say \"negative k\" three times and multiply them all together. So, $(-k)^3$ simplifies to $-k \\cdot -k \\cdot -k$, which simplifies to $-k^3$.\n\nFinally, we need to multiply our two parts together. $4k^2$ multiplied by $-k^3$ gives us $-4k^5$. So, the answer is $-4k^5$.",
