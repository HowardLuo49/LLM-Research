    "solution": "$\\left( \\frac{1}{2k} \\right)^{-2} \\cdot (-k)^3 = (2k)^2 \\cdot (-k)^3 = 4k^2 \\cdot (-k^3) = \\boxed{-4k^5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify $\\left( \\frac{1}{2k} \\right)^{-2}$.\n\nWhen you see a negative exponent like $-2$, you can flip the fraction and make the exponent positive. So $\\left( \\frac{1}{2k} \\right)^{-2}$ becomes $\\left( 2k \\right)^2$, which simplifies to $4k^2$.\n\nNow we have $4k^2 \\cdot (-k)^3$. Since $(-k)^3$ means getting $-k$ multiplied by itself three times, we can write it as $-k \\cdot -k \\cdot -k$, which simplifies to $-k^3$.\n\nSo, our final answer is $4k^2 \\cdot (-k^3)$, which simplifies to $-4k^5$.",
