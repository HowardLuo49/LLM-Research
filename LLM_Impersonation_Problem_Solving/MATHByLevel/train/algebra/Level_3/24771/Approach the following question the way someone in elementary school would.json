    "solution": "Since $a$ varies inversely with $b^2$, $(a)(b^2)=k$ for some constant $k$. If $a=9$ when $b=2$, then $k=(9)(2^2)=(9)(4)=36$. So if $b=3$, \\begin{align*} (a)(3^2)&=36\n\\\\ 9a&=36\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=\\boxed{4}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, first we need to understand what \"varies inversely\" means. When two things vary inversely, it means that as one thing gets bigger, the other thing gets smaller and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, $a$ varies inversely with $b^2$. So when $b$ gets bigger, $a$ will get smaller. And when $b$ gets smaller, $a$ will get bigger.\n\nWe are given that when $a=9$, $b=2$. This means that $a$ is bigger when $b$ is smaller. \n\nNow we need to find the value of $a$ when $b=3$. Since $b$ is getting bigger, $a$ will get smaller. \n\nTo find the new value of $a$, we can use the formula for inverse variation: $a_1b_1^2= a_2b_2^2$, where $a_1$, $b_1$, are the initial values and $a_2$, $b_2$ are the final values. \n\nPlugging in the values we know, we get $9 \\cdot 2^2= a \\cdot 3^2$. \n\nSolving this equation, we get $9 \\cdot 4 = a \\cdot 9$, which simplifies to $36 = 9a$. \n\nFinally, dividing by 9 on both sides, we get $a=4$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ when $b=3$ is 4.",
