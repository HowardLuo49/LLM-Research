    "solution": "Since $a$ varies inversely with $b^2$, $(a)(b^2)=k$ for some constant $k$. If $a=9$ when $b=2$, then $k=(9)(2^2)=(9)(4)=36$. So if $b=3$, \\begin{align*} (a)(3^2)&=36\n\\\\ 9a&=36\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=\\boxed{4}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so when a varies inversely with b^2, that means that when b gets bigger, a gets smaller and vice versa. We know that when b=2, a=9. So if b gets bigger to 3, then a will get smaller. Let's find out how much smaller a will get. \n\nFirst, we know that a and b^2 are inversely related. So we can set up the equation a = k / b^2, where k is a constant.\n\nPlugging in a=9 and b=2 into the equation, we get 9 = k / 2^2 = k / 4. This means k = 36.\n\nNow we need to find a when b=3. Plugging in b=3 and k=36 into the equation, we get a = 36 / 3^2 = 36 / 9 = 4.\n\nSo when b=3, a=4.",
