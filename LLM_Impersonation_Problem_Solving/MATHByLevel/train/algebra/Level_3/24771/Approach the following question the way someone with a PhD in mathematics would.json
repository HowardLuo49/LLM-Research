    "solution": "Since $a$ varies inversely with $b^2$, $(a)(b^2)=k$ for some constant $k$. If $a=9$ when $b=2$, then $k=(9)(2^2)=(9)(4)=36$. So if $b=3$, \\begin{align*} (a)(3^2)&=36\n\\\\ 9a&=36\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=\\boxed{4}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we start by setting up the relationship between $a$ and $b$ as an inverse variation.
