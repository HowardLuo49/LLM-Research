    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$?",
    "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest integer $n$ that makes $n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0$, we can start by factoring the quadratic expression as $(n-3)(n-8) \\leq 0$. \n\nNext, we can plot this on a number line. \n\nWhen $n < 3$, both factors of the expression are negative, so the expression is positive. \nWhen $3 < n < 8$, one factor is positive and the other is negative, so the expression is negative. \nWhen $n > 8$, both factors are positive, so the expression is positive. \n\nTherefore, the greatest integer $n$ that satisfies $n^2 - 11n + 24 \\leq 0$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
