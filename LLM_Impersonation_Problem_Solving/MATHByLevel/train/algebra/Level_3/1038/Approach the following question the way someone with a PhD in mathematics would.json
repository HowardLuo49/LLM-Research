    "solution": "We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \\le 0 \\le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\\le 0$, tells us that $n\\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\\le n-3$, tells us that $n\\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\\le n\\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$, we first need to factor the quadratic expression. Since the quadratic is less than or equal to zero, we are looking for the values of $n$ where the quadratic is non-positive.\n\nThe quadratic expression can be factored as $(n-3)(n-8) \\leq 0$. To find the values of $n$ where this expression is non-positive, we need to consider the signs of $(n-3)$ and $(n-8)$.\n\nSetting $(n-3) \\geq 0$ and $(n-8) \\leq 0$, we see that this occurs when $3 \\leq n \\leq 8$. \n\nTherefore, the greatest integer $n$ such that $n^2 - 11n +24 \\leq 0$ is $8$.",
