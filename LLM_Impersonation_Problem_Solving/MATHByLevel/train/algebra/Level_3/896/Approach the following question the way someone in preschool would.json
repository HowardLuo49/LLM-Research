    "solution": "We proceed as follows: \\begin{align*}\n(x - 2)(2x + 5) &= 8x - 6\\\\\n2x^2 + x - 10 &= 8x - 6\\\\\n2x^2 - 7x - 4 &= 0\\\\\n(x - 4)(2x + 1) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}This gives us $x = 4$ or $x = -\\frac{1}{2}.$ However, since the latter would make $x - 2$ negative, we see that $x = \\boxed{4}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the sides of the rectangle! \n\nOne side is $x - 2$ and the other side is $2x + 5$. To find the area, we need to multiply these two sides together. \n\nSo the area is $(x - 2)(2x + 5) = 8x - 6$. \n\nLet's see if we can solve this problem by drawing a picture of the rectangle and counting the squares inside!",
