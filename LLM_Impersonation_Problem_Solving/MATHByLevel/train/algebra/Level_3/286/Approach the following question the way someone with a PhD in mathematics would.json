    "solution": "We are given that $N^2 + N = 6$.  Rearranging gives $N^2 + N - 6 =0$, and factoring the quadratic on the left gives $(N+3)(N-2) = 0$.  The only negative solution to this equation is $N = \\boxed{-3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N$ be the negative integer in question. We are given that the sum of $N$ and its square is 6, which can be represented as $N + N^2 = 6$. \n\nTo solve for $N$, we need to solve the quadratic equation $N^2 + N - 6 = 0$. We can factor this equation as $(N+3)(N-2) = 0$.\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for $N$: $N = -3$ or $N = 2$. However, since $N$ is specified as a negative integer, the only valid solution is $N = -3$. Therefore, the value of $N$ is -3.",
