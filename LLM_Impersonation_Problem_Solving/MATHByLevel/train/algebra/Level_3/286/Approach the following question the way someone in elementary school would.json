    "solution": "We are given that $N^2 + N = 6$.  Rearranging gives $N^2 + N - 6 =0$, and factoring the quadratic on the left gives $(N+3)(N-2) = 0$.  The only negative solution to this equation is $N = \\boxed{-3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have a negative number $N$ and we're also adding its square to it. That means we're doing something like $N + N^2 = 6$. We need to figure out what number $N$ is equal to. Let's see... if $N$ is equal to 3, then $N^2$ would be 9, and 3+9=12, which is bigger than 6. So $N$ must be a smaller number. If $N$ is equal to -2, then $N^2$ would be 4, and -2+4=2, which is too small. So $N$ must be a number between -2 and 3. Let's try -1. If $N$ is equal to -1, then $N^2$ would be 1, and -1+1=0, which is too small. So $N$ must be a smaller number. Let's try -2. If $N$ is equal to -2, then $N^2$ would be 4, and -2+4=2, which is just right! So the value of $N$ is -2.",
