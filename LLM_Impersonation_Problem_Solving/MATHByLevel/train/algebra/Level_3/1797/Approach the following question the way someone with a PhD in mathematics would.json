    "solution": "Let $x=\\log_432$.  Then, we must have $4^x = 32$.  Writing both 4 and 32 with 2 as the base gives $(2^2)^x = 2^5$, so $2^{2x} = 2^5$.  Therefore, we must have $2x =5$, so $x =\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To evaluate $\\log_432$, we need to find the exponent to which 4 must be raised in order to obtain 32. In other words, we need to solve the equation $4^x = 32$.\n\nRewriting 32 as $2^5$, we have $4^x = 2^5$. Since $4 = 2^2$, we can rewrite the equation as $(2^2)^x = 2^5$, which simplifies to $2^{2x} = 2^5$.\n\nNow, since the bases are the same, the exponents must also be equal. Therefore, we have $2x = 5$, which implies $x = \\frac{5}{2}$. Thus, $\\log_432 = \\frac{5}{2}$.",
