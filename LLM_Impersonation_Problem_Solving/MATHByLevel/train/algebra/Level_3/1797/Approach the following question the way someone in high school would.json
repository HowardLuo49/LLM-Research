    "solution": "Let $x=\\log_432$.  Then, we must have $4^x = 32$.  Writing both 4 and 32 with 2 as the base gives $(2^2)^x = 2^5$, so $2^{2x} = 2^5$.  Therefore, we must have $2x =5$, so $x =\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To evaluate $\\log_432$, we need to find out what exponent we should raise 4 to in order to get 32. Since $4^2 = 16$ and $4^3 = 64$, we know that $4^3 = 64$. So, $\\log_432 = 3$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{5?: To evaluate $\\log_432$, we need to find out what exponent we should raise 4 to in order to get 32. Since $4^2 = 16$ and $4^3 = 64$, we know that $4^3 = 64$. So, $\\log_432 = 3$.",
