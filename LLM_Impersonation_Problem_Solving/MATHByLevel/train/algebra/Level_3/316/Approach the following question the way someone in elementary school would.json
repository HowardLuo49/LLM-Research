    "solution": "Since $\\sqrt{9}<\\sqrt{12}<\\sqrt{16}$, or, equivalently $3<\\sqrt{12}<4$, the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\sqrt{12}$ must be $3$. Thus, $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{12}}\\rfloor^2=3^2=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the square root of 12. The square root of 12 is between 3 and 4 because 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. So, the square root of 12 is closest to 3. Now we need to find the greatest integer that is less than or equal to the square root of 12. Since 3 is the greatest integer less than the square root of 12, we can evaluate 3 squared, which is 3 times 3, equaling 9. So, $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{12}}\\rfloor^2$ is equal to 9.",
