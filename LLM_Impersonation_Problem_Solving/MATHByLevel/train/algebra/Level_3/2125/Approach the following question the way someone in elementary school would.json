    "solution": "Let's perform the addition one step at a time. The first step is adding $c$ and $a$ in the right column. Since $c$ and $a$ can't both be 0 and $c+a$ is at most $9+8=17$, we know that $c+a=10$. The one carries over.\n\nThe second step is adding $b$ and $c$ in the middle column. Similarly, we know that $b+c+1=10$ (the one is from the carrying over), so $b+c=9$. The one carries over.\n\nThe third step is adding $a$ and $d$ in the left column. Similarly, we know that $a+d+1=10$ so $a+d=9$.\n\nThus, we have the three equations \\begin{align*}\na+c&=10\\\\\nb+c&=9\\\\\na+d&=9\n\\end{align*} Adding the last two equations gives $b+c+a+d = 9 + 9 =18$, so our answer is $\\boxed{18}$. This corresponds to $(a,b,c,d)\\Rightarrow (4,3,6,5)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $a+b+c+d$, we first need to add the numbers in the ones column. Since there is a $c$ and an $a$ in the ones column, we know that $c+a$ equals $1$. We also know that $c=0$ and $a=1$. \n\nNext, we look at the tens column and see that there is only a $b$ there. Since there is nothing else to add to $b$, $b$ must be $0$. \n\nFinally, we can find the value of $d$ by adding the numbers in the hundreds column. There is only a $1$ there, so $d$ equals $1$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $a+b+c+d$ is $1+0+1+1=3$.",
