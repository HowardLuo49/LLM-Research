    "solution": "If the number is $x$, we set up the equation $x^2+85=(x-17)^2$ and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\nx^2+85&=(x-17)^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx^2+85&=x^2-34x+289\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n34x&=204\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=6\n\\end{align*} The number is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we need to find a number. Let's call the number we're looking for \"n.\" \n\nThe first part of the question says that 85 more than n squared is the same as the square of the number that is 17 less than our number n. \n\nSo, let's break it down. \n\nn squared is just n times n. And the number that is 17 less than n is n - 17. \n\nSo, the first part of the question is saying that 85 more than n squared is the same as the square of n - 17. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to write it out as an equation. \n\nn^2 + 85 = (n - 17)^2\n\nThen we just need to solve for n! Let's do it together. \n\nn^2 + 85 = (n - 17)(n - 17)\nn^2 + 85 = n^2 - 34n + 289\n85 = -34n + 289\n-204 = -34n\n6 = n\n\nYay, we found our number! The number is 6. Good job!",
