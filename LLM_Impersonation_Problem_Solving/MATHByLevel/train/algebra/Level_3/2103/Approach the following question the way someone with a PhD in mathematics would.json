    "solution": "If the number is $x$, we set up the equation $x^2+85=(x-17)^2$ and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\nx^2+85&=(x-17)^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx^2+85&=x^2-34x+289\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n34x&=204\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=6\n\\end{align*} The number is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the given information. Let the number be represented by the variable $x$. \n\nThe first part of the equation states that \"Eighty-five more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number.\" Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$x^2 + 85 = (x-17)^2$\n\nExpanding both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$x^2 + 85 = x^2 - 34x + 289$\n\nRearranging the terms, we have:\n\n0 = -34x + 204\n\nSolving for x by dividing both sides by -34, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{204}{34} = 6$\n\nTherefore, the number is $6$.",
