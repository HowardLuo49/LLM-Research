On each successive trip, you eat half of the remaining pizza. After five trips to the refrigerator, what fractional part of the pizza have you eaten?",
    "solution": "On the second, third, fourth, and fifth trips, you eat $\\frac1{2^2}$, $\\frac1{2^3}$, $\\frac1{2^4}$, and $\\frac1{2^5}$ of the pizza, respectively. The total portion of the pizza eaten is the geometric series \\begin{align*}\n\\frac12+\\frac1{2^2}+\\frac1{2^3}+\\frac1{2^4}+\\frac1{2^5} &= \\frac{\\frac12\\left(1-\\left(\\frac12\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac12}\\\\\n&=1-\\left(\\frac12\\right)^5\\\\\n&=1-\\frac1{32}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{31}{32}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Yummy pizza! If we start with a whole pizza, and eat half of it on the first trip, we have 1/2 left. Then we eat half of that on the second trip, which leaves us with 1/4. On the third trip, we eat half of 1/4, leaving us with 1/8. After the fourth trip, we eat half of 1/8, which leaves us with 1/16. Finally, on the fifth trip, we eat half of 1/16, leaving us with 1/32. So after five trips, we have eaten 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 of the pizza!",
