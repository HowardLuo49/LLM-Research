    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. If $a \\div b = 2$ and $b \\div c = \\frac{3}{4}$, what is the value of $c \\div a$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Since $\\dfrac{b}{a} \\cdot \\dfrac{c}{b} = \\dfrac{c}{a}$, we simply multiply the reciprocals of $a \\div b$ and $b \\div c$ together: $(1/2)(4/3) = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to figure out what $a$, $b$, and $c$ are. Since $a \\div b = 2$, that means $a$ divided by $b$ equals 2. This means that if we have $a$ apples and we share them equally among $b$ people, each person would get 2 apples. \n\nNext, we are given that $b \\div c = \\frac{3}{4}$. This means that $b$ divided by $c$ equals $\\frac{3}{4}$. This means if we have $b$ bananas and we share them equally among $c$ people, each person would get $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a banana.\n\nNow we need to find what $c \\div a$ is. To do this, we can flip the second equation to get $c \\div b = \\frac{4}{3}$. Then, we can multiply that by the first equation ($a \\div b = 2$) to get $c \\div a = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{8}{3}$. So, the value of $c \\div a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{2?: Okay, so first we need to figure out what $a$, $b$, and $c$ are.
