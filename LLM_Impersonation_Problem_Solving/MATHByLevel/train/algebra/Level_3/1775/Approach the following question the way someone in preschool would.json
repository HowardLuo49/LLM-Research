    "solution": "Since $\\dfrac{b}{a} \\cdot \\dfrac{c}{b} = \\dfrac{c}{a}$, we simply multiply the reciprocals of $a \\div b$ and $b \\div c$ together: $(1/2)(4/3) = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's see here. First, a divided by b is 2, so that means that a is 2 times b. Next, b divided by c is 3/4, so that means that b is 3/4 times c. Now we want to find c divided by a. \n\nWe know that a is 2 times b, and b is 3/4 times c. So a is 2 times 3/4 times c. We can simplify that to a = 3/2 times c. \n\nSo c divided by a is the same as c divided by (3/2 times c). When we divide by a fraction, we flip it and multiply, so c divided by (3/2 times c) is the same as c times (2/3 times c), which simplifies to 2/3. \n\nSo, c divided by a is 2/3!",
