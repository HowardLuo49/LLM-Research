    "solution": "Since $\\dfrac{b}{a} \\cdot \\dfrac{c}{b} = \\dfrac{c}{a}$, we simply multiply the reciprocals of $a \\div b$ and $b \\div c$ together: $(1/2)(4/3) = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $c \\div a$, we will first simplify the expressions given and then use them to calculate $c \\div a$.\n\nGiven that $a \\div b = 2$, we can rewrite this as $a = 2b$. \n\nGiven that $b \\div c = \\frac{3}{4}$, we can rewrite this as $b = \\frac{3c}{4}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $a = 2b$ into the second equation: $a = 2(\\frac{3c}{4}) = \\frac{6c}{4} = \\frac{3c}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $c \\div a$ is equal to $c \\div (\\frac{3c}{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nThus, the value of $c \\div a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
