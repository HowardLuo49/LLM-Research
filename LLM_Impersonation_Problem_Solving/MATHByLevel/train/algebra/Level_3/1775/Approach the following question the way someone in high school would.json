    "solution": "Since $\\dfrac{b}{a} \\cdot \\dfrac{c}{b} = \\dfrac{c}{a}$, we simply multiply the reciprocals of $a \\div b$ and $b \\div c$ together: $(1/2)(4/3) = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $c \\div a$, we can first rewrite the equations given to make it easier to work with:\n\n$a \\div b = 2$ can be rewritten as $a = 2b$\n\n$b \\div c = \\frac{3}{4}$ can be rewritten as $b = \\frac{3c}{4}$\n\nNow we want to find $c \\div a$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{c}{a}$. Substituting the values we found for $a$ and $b$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{c}{2b} = \\frac{c}{2(\\frac{3c}{4})} = \\frac{c}{\\frac{3c}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $c \\div a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
