    "solution": "Because $\\pi$ is greater than $3$ but less than $4$,\n\n$-1<\\pi - 4<0$.  Therefore, $[\\pi - 4]$ is $\\boxed{-1}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find $[\\pi - 4]$, we need to first determine the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\pi - 4$. \n\nSince $\\pi$ is approximately 3.14159, $\\pi - 4$ is approximately -0.85841. The greatest integer less than or equal to -0.85841 is -1. \n\nTherefore, $[\\pi - 4] = -1$.",
