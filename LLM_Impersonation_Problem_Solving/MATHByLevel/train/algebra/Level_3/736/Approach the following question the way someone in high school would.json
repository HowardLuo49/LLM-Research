    "solution": "Because $\\pi$ is greater than $3$ but less than $4$,\n\n$-1<\\pi - 4<0$.  Therefore, $[\\pi - 4]$ is $\\boxed{-1}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find $[\\pi - 4]$, we need to find the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\pi - 4$. Since $\\pi$ is approximately 3.14159, we have $\\pi - 4 \\approx -0.85841$. \n\nThe greatest integer less than or equal to $-0.85841$ is $-1$, so $[\\pi - 4] = -1$. \n\nTherefore, $[\\pi - 4] = -1$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to -1?: To find $[\\pi - 4]$, we need to find the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\pi - 4$. Since $\\pi$ is approximately 3.14159, we have $\\pi - 4 \\approx -0.85841$. \n\nThe greatest integer less than or equal to $-0.85841$ is $-1$, so $[\\pi - 4] = -1$. \n\nTherefore, $[\\pi - 4] = -1$.",
