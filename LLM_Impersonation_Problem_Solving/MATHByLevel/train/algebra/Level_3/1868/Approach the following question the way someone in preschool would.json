    "gpt_response": "Ok kiddos! Let's make the bottom number of the fraction nice and pretty. We can do that by simplifying the square root of 125.\n\nNow, what number multiplied by itself equals 125? Hmm let's see... Oh yes! It's 5! So we can rewrite the square root of 125 as 5.\n\nNow our fraction looks like this: $\\frac{5}{5}$. And 5 divided by 5 is 1!\n\nSo the simplified fraction is $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{125}} = \\frac{5}{5} = 1$.\n\nGreat job, everyone! We simplified the denominator and made our fraction nice and simple. Yay!",
