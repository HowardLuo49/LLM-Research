    "solution": "Simplifying, we get $2x^2+24x-60=x^2 + 13x.$ Bringing the right side to the left, we get $x^2+11x-60=0$. Factoring, we find that $(x+15)(x-4)=0$. Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 4 and -15, and of those, $\\boxed{-15}$ is the smallest.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's see. We can start by simplifying the equation $2x^2 + 24x - 60 = x(x + 13)$. First, we can distribute the $x$ on the right side to get $x^2 + 13x$. Now our equation looks like $2x^2 + 24x - 60 = x^2 + 13x$. \n\nNext, we can combine like terms on both sides to get a new equation. This gives us $x^2 + 11x - 60 = 0$. \n\nNow we can try to factor this quadratic equation. We need to find two numbers that multiply to $-60$ and add up to $11$. The numbers that work are $15$ and $-4$. So we can rewrite the equation as $(x + 15)(x - 4) = 0$.\n\nFinally, we can solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to $0. That gives us $x = -15$ or $x = 4$. Since we are looking for the smallest possible value of $x$, the answer is $x = -15$. \n\nSo, the smallest possible value of $x$ such that $2x^2 + 24x - 60 = x(x + 13)$ is $-15$. Yay, we did it!",
