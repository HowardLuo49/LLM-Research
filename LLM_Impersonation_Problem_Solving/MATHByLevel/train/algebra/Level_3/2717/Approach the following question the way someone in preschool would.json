The amount of flour she buys, in pounds, is at least 6 pounds more than half the amount of sugar, and is no more than twice the amount of sugar.  Find the least number of pounds of sugar that Betty could buy.",
    "solution": "Suppose Betty buys $f$ pounds of flour and $s$ pounds of sugar.  From the problem, we have $f \\ge 6+s/2$ and $f \\le 2s$.  Putting these together, we have $2s \\ge f \\ge 6 +s/2$. The expression on the left end of this inequality chain must therefore be greater than or equal to the $6+s/2$ on the right, so \\[2s \\ge 6 + s/2 \\implies 3s/2 \\ge 6 \\implies s\\ge \\boxed{4}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Let's say Betty went to the store and bought some sugar. Let's call the amount of sugar she bought S. \nBetty also bought some flour. The amount of flour she bought is at least 6 pounds more than half the amount of sugar, so it is at least (S/2 + 6) pounds. It is also no more than twice the amount of sugar, so it is no more than 2S pounds. \nWe want to find the least number of pounds of sugar that Betty could buy. Let's start by assuming S = 1 pound. \nIf S = 1 pound, then the amount of flour Betty could buy would be at least (1/2 + 6) = 6.5 pounds, which is not less than 2 pounds. \nSo, let's assume S = 2 pounds. In this case, the amount of flour Betty could buy would be at least (2/2 + 6) = 7 pounds, which is not less than 4 pounds. \nSo, let's assume S = 3 pounds. In this case, the amount of flour Betty could buy would be at least (3/2 + 6) = 7.5 pounds, which is not less than 6 pounds. \nSo, the least number of pounds of sugar that Betty could buy is 3. \nTherefore, Betty could buy at least 3 pounds of sugar.",
