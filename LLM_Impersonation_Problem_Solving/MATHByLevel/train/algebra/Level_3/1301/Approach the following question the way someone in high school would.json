    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to add up all the miles Phoenix hiked each day. Let's break it down:\n\n1st day: ? miles\n2nd day: ? miles\n3rd day: ? miles\n4th day: ? miles\n\n1st day + 2nd day = 22 miles\n1st day + 3rd day = 26 miles\n2nd day + 3rd day = 13 miles each day\n3rd day + 4th day = 30 miles\n\nBased on these equations, we can solve for each day's mileage.
