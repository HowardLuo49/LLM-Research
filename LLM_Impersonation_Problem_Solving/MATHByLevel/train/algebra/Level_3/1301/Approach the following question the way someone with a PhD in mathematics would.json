    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the information given to create a system of equations. Let's denote the distance Phoenix hiked on the first day as x, the distance she hiked on the second day as y, and the distance she hiked on the third day as z.\n\nFrom the information given, we can write the following equations:\nx + y = 22 (equation 1)\ny + z = 30 (equation 2)\nx + z = 26 (equation 3)\n\nWe also know that the total distance of the hike is the sum of the distances hiked on each day, which gives us:\nx + y + z + y = total distance\nx + 2y + z = total distance\n\nSubstitute the values of x, y, and z into the equation to get:\n22 + 13 + 30 + 13 = total distance\n65 = total distance\n\nTherefore, the total length of the trail is 65 miles.",
