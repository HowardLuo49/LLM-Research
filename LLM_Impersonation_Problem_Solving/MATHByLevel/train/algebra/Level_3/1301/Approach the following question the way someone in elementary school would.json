    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that on the first two days, Phoenix hiked 22 miles total. On the second and third days, she hiked 26 miles total. And on the last two days, she hiked 30 miles total. We need to figure out how long the trail is.\n\nLet's break it down:\nFirst two days: 22 miles\nSecond and third days: 26 miles\nLast two days: 30 miles\n\nTo find out how long the trail is, we need to add up all the miles she hiked:\n22 + 26 + 30 = 78\n\nSo, the Rocky Path Trail is 78 miles long. Yay! Phoenix did a great job hiking all that way.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 52?: Ok, so we know that on the first two days, Phoenix hiked 22 miles total. On the second and third days, she hiked 26 miles total. And on the last two days, she hiked 30 miles total. We need to figure out how long the trail is.\n\nLet's break it down:\nFirst two days: 22 miles\nSecond and third days: 26 miles\nLast two days: 30 miles\n\nTo find out how long the trail is, we need to add up all the miles she hiked:\n22 + 26 + 30 = 78\n\nSo, the Rocky Path Trail is 78 miles long.
