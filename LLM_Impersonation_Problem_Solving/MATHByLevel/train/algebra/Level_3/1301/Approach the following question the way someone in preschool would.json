    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Phoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
    "solution": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, Phoenix went on a really long hike! Let's count together to figure out how long the trail was. \n\nOn the first day, Phoenix hiked 22 miles. \nOn the second day, she hiked 13 miles. \nOn the third day, she hiked 13 miles again. \nOn the fourth day, she hiked 30 miles. \n\nNow, let's add up all the miles she hiked: \n22 miles + 13 miles + 13 miles + 30 miles = 78 miles \n\nBut wait! We know that the total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. \n\nSo, if we take out those 26 miles, we get: \n78 miles - 26 miles = 52 miles \n\nSo, the Rocky Path Trail must have been 52 miles long! Great job counting, friends!",
