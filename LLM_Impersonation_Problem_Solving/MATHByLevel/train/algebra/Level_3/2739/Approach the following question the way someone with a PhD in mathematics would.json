    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Ryosuke is picking up his friend from work. The odometer reads 74,568 when he picks his friend up, and it reads 74,592 when he drops his friend off at his house. Ryosuke's car gets 28 miles per gallon and the price of one gallon of gas is $\\$4.05$. What was the cost of the gas that was used for Ryosuke to drive his friend back home from work? (Express your answer in dollars and round to the nearest cent.)",
    "solution": "Ryosuke traveled a distance of $74,592 - 74,568 = 24$ miles between the time he picked up his friend and when he dropped him off. Since his car gets 28 miles per gallon, he used 24/28 or 12/14 of a gallon. At $\\$4.05$ per gallon, the cost of the trip is about $12/14 \\times 4.05 \\approx \\boxed{\\$3.47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate the total distance Ryosuke drove from picking up his friend to dropping him off. This can be calculated by subtracting the initial odometer reading from the final odometer reading:\n\n$74,592 - 74,568 = 24$ miles\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many gallons of gas Ryosuke used to drive this distance. Since his car gets 28 miles per gallon, we can divide the total distance by the miles per gallon:\n\n$24 / 28 \\approx 0.857$ gallons\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost of the gas used by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon:\n\n$0.857 \\times \\$4.05 \\approx \\$3.47$\n\nTherefore, the cost of the gas used for Ryosuke to drive his friend back home from work is approximately $\\$3.47.",
