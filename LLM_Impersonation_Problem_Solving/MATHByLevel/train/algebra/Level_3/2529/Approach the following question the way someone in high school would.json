    "solution": "Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $2x-7 = 9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = (9^{\\frac{1}{2}})^3 = 3^3 = 27$. Solving $2x-7=27$ gives us $x = \\boxed{17}$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this equation, first rewrite it in exponential form. Remember that $\\log_a{b} = c$ is the same as saying $a^c = b$.\n\nSo in this case, we have $9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 2x-7$.\n\nSimplify $9^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ as $(3^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 3^{3} = 27$. So now we have $27 = 2x-7$.\n\nAdd 7 to both sides to isolate $2x$: $27 + 7 = 2x$, which means $34 = 2x$.\n\nDivide by 2 to solve for $x$: $x = \\frac{34}{2} = 17$.\n\nTherefore, the solution is $x = 17$.",
