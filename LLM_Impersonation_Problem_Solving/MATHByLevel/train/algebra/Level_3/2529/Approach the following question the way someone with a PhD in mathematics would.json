    "solution": "Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $2x-7 = 9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = (9^{\\frac{1}{2}})^3 = 3^3 = 27$. Solving $2x-7=27$ gives us $x = \\boxed{17}$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first use the property of logarithms that states if $\\log_a(b)=c$, then $a^c = b$. \n\nIn this case, we have $\\log_9(2x-7) = \\dfrac{3}{2}$. \n\nBy applying the property of logarithms, we get $9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 2x-7$. \n\nWe know that $a^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\sqrt[n]{a^m}$, so $9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\sqrt{9^3}$. \n\nSimplifying further, we have $9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 9\\sqrt{9} = 9 \\cdot 3 = 27$. \n\nSo, $27 = 2x-7$. \n\nAdding 7 to both sides yields $34 = 2x$, and dividing by 2 gives $x = \\frac{34}{2} = 17$. \n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $x=17$.",
