    "solution": "Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $2x-7 = 9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = (9^{\\frac{1}{2}})^3 = 3^3 = 27$. Solving $2x-7=27$ gives us $x = \\boxed{17}$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So we have to find $x$. The log is $\\log_9$ and it equals $\\dfrac{3}{2}$. That's like magic! We have $2x-7$ inside the log. We have to make the log disappear to find $x$. So we have to do something with $9$. Hmm... I think $9$ to the power of $\\dfrac{3}{2}$ is $27$. So $2x-7$ is equal to $27$. Now we have to solve for $x$. \n\n$2x-7 = 27$\n\n$2x = 27+7$\n\n$2x = 34$\n\n$x = \\dfrac{34}{2}$\n\n$x = 17$\n\nSo $x$ is $17$. Yay, we did it!",
