    "solution": "Since the midpoint of a segment has coordinates that are the average of the endpoints, we see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{2 - 6}{2}, \\frac{3+5}{2}\\right) = (-2, 4)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{-8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First we gotta find the midpoint! So we add the x-coordinates of the endpoints and divide by 2 to get the x-coordinate of the midpoint. It's (2 + (-6))/2 = -4/2 = -2 for the x-coordinate. Then we do the same for the y-coordinates. It's (3 + 5)/2 = 8/2 = 4 for the y-coordinate. So the midpoint is at (-2, 4). \n\nTo find the product of the coordinates, we just multiply the x-coordinate by the y-coordinate. So -2 x 4 is -8. That's the product of the coordinates of the midpoint!",
