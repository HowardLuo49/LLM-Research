    "solution": "Since the midpoint of a segment has coordinates that are the average of the endpoints, we see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{2 - 6}{2}, \\frac{3+5}{2}\\right) = (-2, 4)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{-8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the midpoint of the line segment. To find the midpoint, we add the x-coordinates of the endpoints and divide by 2, and do the same for the y-coordinates. \n\nThe x-coordinate of the midpoint is $(2 + (-6))/2 = -4/2 = -2$ \n\nThe y-coordinate of the midpoint is $(3 + 5)/2 = 8/2 = 4$\n\nSo, the coordinates of the midpoint are $(-2, 4)$ \n\nNow, to find the product of the coordinates, we simply multiply -2 and 4: \n\n$(-2) * 4 = -8$ \n\nTherefore, the product of the coordinates of the midpoint is -8.",
