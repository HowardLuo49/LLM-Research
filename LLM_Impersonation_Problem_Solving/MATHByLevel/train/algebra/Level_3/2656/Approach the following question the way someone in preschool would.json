    "solution": "Squaring both sides, $$1 + \\sqrt{2y-3} = \\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2y-3}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{6}\\right)^2 = 6.$$Hence, $\\sqrt{2y-3} = 5$. If we square this equation again, then $$2y - 3 = \\left(\\sqrt{2y-3}\\right)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \\Longrightarrow y = \\frac{25+3}{2} = \\boxed{14}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We have a square root of something inside another square root, which sounds like a mystery! We want to find the number that makes both sides equal, so we can solve the mystery. \n\nFirst, we notice that the square root of 6 is just 6 because 6 times 6 is 36. So our equation becomes $\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2y-3}} = 6$. \n\nNow, we can start solving the mystery by squaring both sides to get rid of the outer square root.
