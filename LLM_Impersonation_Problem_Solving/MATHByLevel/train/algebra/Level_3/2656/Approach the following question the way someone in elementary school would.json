    "solution": "Squaring both sides, $$1 + \\sqrt{2y-3} = \\left(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2y-3}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{6}\\right)^2 = 6.$$Hence, $\\sqrt{2y-3} = 5$. If we square this equation again, then $$2y - 3 = \\left(\\sqrt{2y-3}\\right)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \\Longrightarrow y = \\frac{25+3}{2} = \\boxed{14}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to figure out what $\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2y-3}}$ is equal to. We know that it's equal to $\\sqrt{6}, so that means $1 + \\sqrt{2y-3} = 6$. Now we need to solve for $y$. \n\nSo we have $1 + \\sqrt{2y-3} = 6$. Subtract $1$ from both sides to get $\\sqrt{2y-3} = 5$. Now we square both sides to get rid of the square root, so $(\\sqrt{2y-3})^2 = 5^2$. That simplifies to $2y-3 = 25$. \n\nNow we add $3$ to both sides to get $2y = 28$. And then we divide by $2$ to find that $y = 14$. So when $y = 14$, the equation $\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2y-3}} = \\sqrt{6}$ is true!",
