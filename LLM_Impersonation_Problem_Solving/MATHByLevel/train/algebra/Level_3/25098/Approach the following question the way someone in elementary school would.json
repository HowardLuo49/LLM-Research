    "solution": "First, we recognize that $\\frac{4}{3x^{-3}}$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{4x^3}{3}$. Thus, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{3x^{-3}} \\cdot \\frac{3x^{2}}{2} & = \\frac{4x^3}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3x^2}{2} \\\\\n& = \\frac{(4 \\cdot 3)(x^3 \\cdot x^2)}{3 \\cdot 2} \\\\\n& = 2x^{3+2} \\\\\n& = \\boxed{2x^5}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To simplify this, we need to multiply the numbers on top and the numbers on the bottom separately.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the numbers on top: $4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n\nThen, let's multiply the numbers on the bottom: $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\nSo, after multiplying the numbers separately, the simplified fraction is $\\frac{12}{6}$.\n\nBut we can simplify this even further by dividing 12 by 6, which equals 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\frac{2}{1}$ or simply 2.",
