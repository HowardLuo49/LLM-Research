    "solution": "We could write out all of the terms until we get to the tenth term, but instead we can find the formula for the $n$th term in the geometric sequence. Since 9 is the first term and we multiply by $\\frac{1}{3}$ to find the next term, we determine that the formula for the geometric sequence is $a_n=9\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{(n-1)}$. That means $a_{10}=9\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^9=\\frac{3^2}{3^9}=\\frac{1}{3^7}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2187}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the tenth term in the geometric sequence $9,3,1,\\frac 13,\\ldots$, we need to figure out the pattern. Each term is getting multiplied by $\\frac{1}{3}$ to get the next term. So, the next term after $\\frac{1}{3}$ would be $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nTo find the tenth term, we need to continue this pattern of multiplying by $\\frac{1}{3}$ nine more times. \n\nThe tenth term would be $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19 \\times \\frac 19$ which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{3^{10}}=\\frac{1}{59049}$. \n\nSo, the tenth term in the geometric sequence is $\\frac{1}{59049}$.",
