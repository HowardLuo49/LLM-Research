    "solution": "Applying the difference of squares factorization individually to the first pair of terms and the last pair of terms, we have  \\begin{align*}\n1003^2&-997^2-1001^2+999^2\\\\\n&= (1003+997)(1003-997)-(1001+999)(1001-999) \\\\\n&= 2000(6)-2000(2) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{8000}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "First, look at the numbers in the parentheses. We have $1003$, $997$, $1001$, and $999$. \n\nTo do the math, you can start with $1003^2$. This means you need to multiply $1003$ by $1003$. \n\n$1003$ times $1003$ is $1006009$. \n\nNext, let's do $997^2$, which is multiplying $997$ by $997$. \n\n$997$ times $997$ is $994009$. \n\nNow, let's do $1001^2$, which means multiplying $1001$ by $1001. \n\n$1001$ times $1001$ is $1002001$. \n\nFinally, let's do $999^2$, which is multiplying $999$ by $999. \n\n$999$ times $999$ is $998001$. \n\nNow, subtract the sum of the first two values from the sum of the last two values. \n\nSo $1006009 - 994009 - 1002001 + 998001$ equals $2000$. \n\nTherefore, $1003^2-997^2-1001^2+999^2$ equals 2000.",
