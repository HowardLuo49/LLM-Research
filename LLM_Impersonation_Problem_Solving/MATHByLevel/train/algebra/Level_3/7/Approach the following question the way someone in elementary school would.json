    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?",
    "solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $q$, we can begin by eliminating $p$. In order to do this, we multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, giving us a system of two equations that both have 12 as the coefficient of $p$ \\begin{align*} 12p+16q&=32\n\\\\ 12p+9q&=39\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(12p+16q)-(12p+9q)=32-(39)$, which simplifies to $7q=-7$ or $q=\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out what $q$ is equal to, we will need to use some math! \n\nFirst, let's add the two equations together to see what happens:\n$3p+4q+4p+3q=8+13$\nWhen we add them up, we get:\n$7p+7q=21$\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 7:\n$7p/7+7q/7=21/7$\nThis simplifies to:\n$p+q=3$\n\nNow we can substitute this new equation back into the original equations to find out what $q$ is equal to:\n$3+q=3$\nSubtracting 3 from both sides gives us:\n$q=0$\n\nSo, $q$ is equal to 0!",
