    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?",
    "solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $q$, we can begin by eliminating $p$. In order to do this, we multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, giving us a system of two equations that both have 12 as the coefficient of $p$ \\begin{align*} 12p+16q&=32\n\\\\ 12p+9q&=39\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(12p+16q)-(12p+9q)=32-(39)$, which simplifies to $7q=-7$ or $q=\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count the numbers in the equations. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! There are eight numbers in the first equation and 13 numbers in the second equation. Now let's look at the letters. There are p's and q's in the equations. Let's see if we can find out what q is equal to. Hmmm... let's try putting the equations together. Maybe we can solve the problem if we add them or subtract them. Let's see what happens!",
