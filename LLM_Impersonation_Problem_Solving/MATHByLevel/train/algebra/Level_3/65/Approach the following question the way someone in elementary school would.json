    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A television's price was discounted $40\\%$ and then slashed another $40\\%$ during a liquidation sale. By what percent has the original price been reduced?",
    "solution": "Let the original price of the television be $T$. Then the price is now $0.6(0.6T)=0.36T$. Thus overall the price has been reduced by $1-0.36=\\boxed{64\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how much the price was reduced, we first need to find out how much the price was reduced each time! \n\nFirst, we take the original price and subtract $40\\%$ of the original price by multiplying by $0.6$. This gives us the price after the first discount. \n\nThen, we take the price after the first discount and subtract another $40\\%$ by multiplying by $0.6$ again. \n\nTo find out by what percent the original price was reduced, we have to calculate $1 - \\left(\\frac{\\text{final price}}{\\text{original price}}\\right) \\times 100\\%$. \n\nI will use an example to explain this to you. \n\nSay the original price was $100. \nAfter the first discount, it becomes $100 \\times 0.6 = \\$60$. \nAfter the second discount, it becomes $60 \\times 0.6 = \\$36$. \n\nTo calculate the percent reduction, we do $1 - \\left(\\frac{36}{100}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 64\\%$. \n\nTherefore, the original price has been reduced by $64\\%$.",
