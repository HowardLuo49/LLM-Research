    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A motel bills its customers by charging a flat fee for the first night and then adding on a fixed amount for every night thereafter. If it costs George $\\$155$ to stay in the motel for 3 nights and Noah $\\$290$ to stay in the motel for 6 nights, how much is the flat fee for the first night?",
    "solution": "Let $f$ be the flat fee for the first night and $n$ be the fixed fee for each night thereafter. Notice that the first night is incorporated into the flat fee. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf + 2n &= 155 \\\\\nf + 5n &= 290 \\\\\n\\end{align*}It's easiest to eliminate $f,$ solve for $n$ and then solve for $f$ using that value. To solve for $n$, subtract the first equation from the second, obtaining $3n = 135$, or $n = 45$. Substitute for $n$ in the first equation to obtain $f = 155 - 90$, or $f = 65$. Thus, the flat fee for the first night is $\\boxed{\\$65}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how much the flat fee is, we can first find out how much it costs for one night after the first night.\n\nFor George, he stayed for 3 nights, so he paid for 1 flat fee + 2 extra nights.\nFor Noah, he stayed for 6 nights, so he paid for 1 flat fee + 5 extra nights.\n\nLet's say the flat fee is $x$ and the fixed amount for every night after the first night is $y$.\n\nFor George:\n$1x + 2y = 155$\n\nFor Noah:\n$1x + 5y = 290$\n\nNow we need to solve these equations to find $x$, the flat fee for the first night. Let's solve it like this:\n\nFor George:\n$1x + 2y = 155$\n$1x = 155 - 2y$\n$x = 155 - 2y$\n\nFor Noah:\n$1x + 5y = 290$\nSubstitute x with what we found above:\n$(155 - 2y) + 5y = 290$\n$155 - 2y + 5y = 290$\n$3y = 135$\n$y = 45$\n\nNow we can substitute $y = 45$ back into the equation we found for $x$:\n$x = 155 - 2(45)$\n$x = 155 - 90$\n$x = 65$\n\nTherefore, the flat fee for the first night at the motel is $\\$65$.",
