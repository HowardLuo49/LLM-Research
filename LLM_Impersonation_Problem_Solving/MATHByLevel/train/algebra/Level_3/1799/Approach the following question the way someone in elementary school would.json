    "solution": "The only way $|3x+5|$ is not positive is if it is 0.  We have $|3x+5| = 0$ if and only if $3x+5 = 0$.  Solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$.",

This means that $|3x+5|$ could be zero or negative.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nIf $|3x+5|$ is zero, then $3x+5=0$. \nSolving for $x$, we get: $3x=-5$ and $x=-\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nIf $|3x+5|$ is negative, that means $3x+5$ is negative. \nThis can happen when $x$ is less than $-\\frac{5}{3}$. \n\nSo, the value of $x$ for which $|3x+5|$ is not positive is $\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
