    "solution": "The only way $|3x+5|$ is not positive is if it is 0.  We have $|3x+5| = 0$ if and only if $3x+5 = 0$.  Solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$ for which $|3x+5|$ is not positive, we need to consider when $3x+5$ is negative or zero. This is because the absolute value of a number is negative only if the number itself is negative or zero.\n\nSo, we set up the inequality $3x+5 \\leq 0$. Then, we solve for $x$:\n\n$3x+5 \\leq 0$\n\n$3x \\leq -5$\n\n$x \\leq -5/3$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ for which $|3x+5|$ is not positive is $\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
