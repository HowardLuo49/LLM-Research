    "solution": "The only way $|3x+5|$ is not positive is if it is 0.  We have $|3x+5| = 0$ if and only if $3x+5 = 0$.  Solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of $x$ for which $|3x+5|$ is not positive, we need to consider when the expression inside the absolute value brackets evaluates to zero or negative.\n\nThe expression $|3x+5|$ becomes zero when $3x+5=0$, which implies $3x=-5$ and hence $x=-\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nThe expression $|3x+5|$ becomes negative when $3x+5<0$, which implies $x<-\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ for which $|3x+5|$ is not positive is $x \\leq -\\frac{5}{3}$.",
