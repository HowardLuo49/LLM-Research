    "solution": "Let's work with this problem in cents, not dollars, because the answer calls for a number in cents. So, Uri's two burgers and a soda cost 210 cents and Gen's food costs 240 cents. Let a burger cost $b$ cents and a soda cost $s$ cents. We are trying to find the value of $s$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. These equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2b + s &= 210 \\\\\nb + 2s &= 240 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe are solving for $s$, so we want to eliminate $b$ from the equations above. Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 2, we get $2b+4s = 480$, or $2b = 480 - 4s$. Substituting this equation into the first equation above to eliminate $b$, we get that $(480 - 4s) + s = 210$, or $s=90$. Thus, a soda costs $\\boxed{90}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the cost of one burger as $b$ and the cost of one soda as $s$. From the given information, we can set up a system of equations:\n\n$2b + s = 210$ \n\n$b + 2s = 240$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we can first multiply the second equation by 2 and subtract it from the first equation to eliminate $b$:\n\n$2b + s - 2b - 4s = 210 - 480$\n\n$-3s = -270$\n\n$s = 90$\n\nThus, a soda costs 90 cents.",
