    "solution": "We have $f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 -7 =41$, so we seek $g(f(-4)) = g(41)$.  But what's $g(41)$? So, we turn to the other information we are given, $g(f(4)) = 9$. Since $f(4) = 3(4)^2 - 7=41$, this equation gives us $g(41) = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the value of $f(4)$ by plugging in $x=4$ into the function $f(x)$. This gives us $f(4) = 3(4)^2 - 7 = 3(16) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41$. \n\nNow, we know that $g(f(4)) = 9$, so $g(41) = 9$. \n\nTo find $g(f(-4))$, we need to first find the value of $f(-4)$ by plugging in $x=-4$ into the function $f(x)$. This gives us $f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 - 7 = 3(16) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41$. \n\nNow, we can find $g(f(-4))$ by substituting $f(-4)$ into the function $g(x)$. So, $g(41) = 9$. \n\nTherefore, $g(f(-4)) = 9$.",
