    "solution": "We have $f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 -7 =41$, so we seek $g(f(-4)) = g(41)$.  But what's $g(41)$? So, we turn to the other information we are given, $g(f(4)) = 9$. Since $f(4) = 3(4)^2 - 7=41$, this equation gives us $g(41) = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find out what $f(4)$ is. Since $f(x) = 3x^2 - 7$, we can plug in $x = 4$ to find $f(4) = 3(4)^2 - 7 = 3(16) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41$.\n\nNext, we know that $g(f(4)) = 9$. So that means $g(41) = 9$. \n\nNow we need to find $f(-4)$. We already know that $f(4) = 41$, so to find $f(-4)$ we just need to plug in $x = -4$ into the equation for $f(x)$. \n\nSo $f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 - 7 = 3(16) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41$.\n\nNow we can find $g(f(-4))$. Since we know $f(-4) = 41$, we can plug that into the equation $g(f(4)) = 9$ to find $g(41) = 9$. \n\nTherefore, $g(f(-4)) = 9$.",
