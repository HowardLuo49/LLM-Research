    "solution": "We have $f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 -7 =41$, so we seek $g(f(-4)) = g(41)$.  But what's $g(41)$? So, we turn to the other information we are given, $g(f(4)) = 9$. Since $f(4) = 3(4)^2 - 7=41$, this equation gives us $g(41) = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $g(f(-4))$, we first need to determine the value of $f(-4)$ using the function $f(x) = 3x^2 - 7$. \n\nSubstitute $x = -4$ into $f(x)$:\n$f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 - 7 = 3(16) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41$.\n\nNext, we use the given information that $g(f(4)) = 9$.
