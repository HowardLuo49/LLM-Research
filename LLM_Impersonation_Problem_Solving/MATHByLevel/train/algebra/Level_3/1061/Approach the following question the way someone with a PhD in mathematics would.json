    "solution": "We might recognize the top as $\\frac{2}{3}$, and the bottom as $\\frac{4}{3}$, thereby giving you a value of $\\frac{1}{2}$.  If not, call the numerator $x$.  Multiplying by 10, and subtracting $x$, you get 9x = 6, and thus, $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.  We then notice that the denominator is $1 + \\frac{x}{2}$, thereby giving us a value of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ for the entire fraction.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first express the repeating decimals as fractions. Let $x = 0.\\overline{666}$ and $y = 1.\\overline{333}$.
