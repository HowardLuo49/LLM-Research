    "solution": "We might recognize the top as $\\frac{2}{3}$, and the bottom as $\\frac{4}{3}$, thereby giving you a value of $\\frac{1}{2}$.  If not, call the numerator $x$.  Multiplying by 10, and subtracting $x$, you get 9x = 6, and thus, $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.  We then notice that the denominator is $1 + \\frac{x}{2}$, thereby giving us a value of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ for the entire fraction.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count the numbers after the decimal point in both numbers. In the first number, there is a repeating pattern of 6.
