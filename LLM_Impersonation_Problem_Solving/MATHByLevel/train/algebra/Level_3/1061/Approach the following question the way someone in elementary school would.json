    "solution": "We might recognize the top as $\\frac{2}{3}$, and the bottom as $\\frac{4}{3}$, thereby giving you a value of $\\frac{1}{2}$.  If not, call the numerator $x$.  Multiplying by 10, and subtracting $x$, you get 9x = 6, and thus, $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.  We then notice that the denominator is $1 + \\frac{x}{2}$, thereby giving us a value of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ for the entire fraction.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we can write 0.\\overline{666} as 0.\\overline{6} because 6 repeats forever.\nLikewise, we can write 1.\\overline{333} as just 1.\\overline{3} because 3 repeats forever.\n\nSo, our fraction becomes $\\frac{0.\\overline{6}}{1.\\overline{3}}$.\n\nNext, we want to get rid of the decimal by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 10 (since there is one number to the right of the decimal point).\n\nThis gives us $\\frac{6.\\overline{6}}{13.\\overline{3}}$.\n\nNow, we can write it as a common fraction by subtracting the original fraction from the one multiplied by 10:\n\n$10(6.\\overline{6}) - (0.\\overline{6}) = 65 - 6 = 59$\n$10(13.\\overline{3}) - (1.\\overline{3}) = 133 - 13 = 120$\n\nTherefore, the fraction is $\\frac{59}{120}$.",
