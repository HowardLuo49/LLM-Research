    "solution": "We will complete the square for $y^2 + 10y + 33.$\n\nThe binomial to be squared will be of the form $y+a$ because the coefficient of $y^2$ is 1. By squaring the binomial, we get $y^2+2ay+a^2$. We want $2ay$ to be equal to $10y$, therefore $a=5$. $(y+5)^2=y^2+10y+25$.\n\n$y^2+10y+33=(y^2+10y+25)+8=(y+5)^2+8$. Therefore, the binomial is $y+5$ and the integer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer, we need to look at the expression $y^2+10y+33$ and see if we can write it as a square of a binomial. \n\nFirst, let's think about what a square of a binomial looks like. It is when we have something squared (like $y$) plus two of that thing multiplied together and then added to another number. \n\nIf we look at the expression $y^2+10y+33$, we can try to rewrite it as a square of a binomial. \n\nLet's see if we can rewrite $y^2+10y+33$ as $(y+a)^2+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are numbers we need to find. \n\nThe square of $(y+a)^2$ is $y^2+2ay+a^2$. \n\nIf we expand $(y+a)^2$ we get $y^2+2ay+a^2$. \n\nCan you see how we might be able to rewrite $y^2+10y+33$ as a square of a binomial? \n\nLet's think about what number do we need to add to $10y$ to make it $2ay$ where $a$ is an unknown number. \n\nIf we rewrite $10y$ as $2ay$, we see that to get $10y$ we need to have $a=5$. \n\nSo, if we write the expression as $(y+5)^2+b$, then $b$ should be $25$ because $5^2=25$. \n\nTherefore, the integer we were looking for is $b=25$. \n\nSo, the expression $y^2+10y+33$ can be written as $(y+5)^2+25$. \n\nI hope this helps you understand how to find the integer!",
