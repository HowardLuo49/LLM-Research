    "solution": "We can find $x$ by taking four times the second equation plus the first:\n\n$4(7x+y)+(9x-4y)=28x+9x=37x=4(17)+6=74\\implies x=2$.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we can find $y$:\n\n$7x+y=17\\implies y=17-7x=17-7(2)=3$.\n\nThus our answer is $\\boxed{(2,3)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the intersection of two lines, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two equations.\n\nWe have the equations:\n$9x-4y=6$\n$7x+y=17$\n\nFirst, let's solve for $y$ in the second equation:\n$7x + y = 17$\n$y = 17 - 7x$\n\nNow we plug this expression for $y$ into the first equation:\n$9x - 4(17-7x) = 6$\n$9x - 68 + 28x = 6$\n$37x - 68 = 6$\n$37x = 74$\n$x = 2$\n\nNow that we have found $x=2$, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find $y$:\n$7(2) + y = 17$\n$14 + y = 17$\n$y = 3$\n\nTherefore, the intersection of the lines is at $(2,3)$.",
