    "solution": "We can find $x$ by taking four times the second equation plus the first:\n\n$4(7x+y)+(9x-4y)=28x+9x=37x=4(17)+6=74\\implies x=2$.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we can find $y$:\n\n$7x+y=17\\implies y=17-7x=17-7(2)=3$.\n\nThus our answer is $\\boxed{(2,3)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find where the lines cross, we need to solve the equations together. So let's first write them all down:\n\nLine 1: $9x-4y=6$\nLine 2: $7x+y=17$\n\nWe can solve this by either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination!\n\nFirst, let's multiply the second equation by 4 so we can add the equations together to eliminate $y$. That gives us:\n$36x - 16y = 24$\n$28x + 4y = 68$\n\nNow we can add them together to get $64x = 92$. That means $x = \\frac{92}{64} = \\frac{23}{16}$.\n\nNow, we can plug this back into either equation. We'll go with the second one:\n$7 \\cdot \\frac{23}{16} + y = 17$\n$23+ y = 17$\n$y = 17 - 23 = -6$\n\nSo the intersection point is $(\\frac{23}{16}, -6)$.\n\nAnd that's the answer, we found where the lines cross at the point $(\\frac{23}{16}, -6)$!",
