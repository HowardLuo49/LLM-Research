    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The new Perry Hotter book will have a cover price of $\\$25$. The local bookstore is offering two discounts $\\$4.00$ off and $20\\%$ off. A clever shopper realizes that the prices will be different depending on the order in which she claims her discounts. How much more money will she save by taking the better valued approach rather than the other approach? Express your answer in cents.",
    "solution": "If the clever shopper takes $4 off followed by $20\\%$ off, the book will cost $0.8 \\times (\\$25 - \\$4) = 0.8 \\times \\$21 = \\$16.80$. If she takes $20\\%$ off followed by $4 off, it will cost $(0.8 \\times \\$25) - \\$4 = \\$20 - \\$4 = \\$16.00$. She will save $\\$16.80 - 16.00 = \\$0.80 = \\boxed{80\\text{ cents}}$ by taking the better-valued approach.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's pretend the book is a yummy cookie! If I take $\\$4.00$ off first, I will have to pay $25 - 4 = 21$ dollars. But if I take $20\\%$ off first, that's like taking away $20\\%$ of the whole cookie first before taking away more. So, I will have to pay $25 - 0.20(25) = 25 - 5 = 20$ dollars.\n\nTo find out how much more money I will save by taking the better valued approach, I need to subtract both prices. So, $21 - 20 = 1$ dollar. But I need to find out in cents, so $1 \\times 100 = 100$ cents. Therefore, I will save 100 cents by taking the better valued approach! Yay for saving money!",
