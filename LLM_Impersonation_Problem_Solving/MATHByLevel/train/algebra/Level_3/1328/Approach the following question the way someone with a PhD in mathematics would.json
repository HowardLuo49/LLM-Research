    "solution": "The given line has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$, so the line perpendicular to this line has slope $-\\frac{1}{-2/3} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the slope of a line perpendicular to the given line $2x + 3y = 6$, we first need to determine the slope of the given line. To do this, we rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form: $3y = -2x + 6$, which simplifies to $y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$. From this form, we see that the slope of the line is $-\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe slope of a line perpendicular to a given line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. Hence, the slope of the line perpendicular to $2x + 3y = 6$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$. This is derived by taking the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line, which is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, the slope of the line perpendicular to $2x + 3y = 6$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$.",
