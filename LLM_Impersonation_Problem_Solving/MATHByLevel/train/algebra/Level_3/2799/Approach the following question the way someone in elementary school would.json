The expression $x^2 + 13x + 30$ can be written as  $(x + a)(x + b),$ and the expression $x^2 + 5x - 50$ written as $(x + b)(x - c)$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $a + b + c$?",
    "solution": "Factoring, we find that $x^2 + 13x + 30 = (x + 3)(x + 10)$ and $x^2 + 5x - 50 = (x + 10)(x - 5)$. We can see that $b = 10$, therefore $a = 3$ and $c = 5$, and $a + b + c = \\boxed{18}.$",

Since this is supposed to match $x^2 + 13x + 30$, we know that $a + b = 13$ and $ab = 30$.\n\nNext, I will multiply out $(x + b)(x - c)$ to get $x^2 - cx + bx - bc$. Since this is supposed to match $x^2 + 5x - 50$, we know that $b - c = 5$ and $-bc = -50$. This means $bc = 50$.\n\nSo, from $a + b = 13$ and $ab = 30$, we can find that $a = 3$ and $b = 10$.
