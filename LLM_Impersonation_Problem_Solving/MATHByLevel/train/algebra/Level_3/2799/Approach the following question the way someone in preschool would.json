    "solution": "Factoring, we find that $x^2 + 13x + 30 = (x + 3)(x + 10)$ and $x^2 + 5x - 50 = (x + 10)(x - 5)$. We can see that $b = 10$, therefore $a = 3$ and $c = 5$, and $a + b + c = \\boxed{18}.$",

So, we can write it as $(x + 10)(x + 3)$. \n\nNext, we have $x^2 + 5x - 50$. We want to write it as $(x + b)(x - c). Let's find two numbers that multiply to -50 and add up to 5. Hmmm, this one is a bit tricky. Oh, I got it! 10 and -5! So, we can write it as $(x + 10)(x - 5)$.\n\nNow, we just need to find the value of $a$, $b$, and $c$.
