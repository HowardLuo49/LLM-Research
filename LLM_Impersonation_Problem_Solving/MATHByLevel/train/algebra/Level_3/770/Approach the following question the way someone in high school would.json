    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out the maximum number of friends Alex can give coins to without any of them receiving the same number of coins. To do this, we can start by giving each friend a different number of coins starting from 1.\n\nSo, Alex can give coins to a maximum of 8 friends (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36 coins).\n\nNow, Alex has 12 friends, so he needs to give at least 12 coins to the remaining 4 friends. However, to ensure that no two friends receive the same number of coins, Alex needs to give 1 coin to the next friend, 2 coins to the friend after that, and so on.\n\nTherefore, Alex needs a minimum of 36 (coins given to the first 8 friends) + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 46 additional coins to give each friend at least one coin and ensure that no two friends receive the same number of coins.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 15?: To solve this problem, we need to figure out the maximum number of friends Alex can give coins to without any of them receiving the same number of coins.
