    "solution": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 4 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 4$. It follows that the square of the radius is 4, so the radius must be $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the radius of the circle, we need to rewrite the equation in a special form called the standard form of a circle equation. The standard form is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. So, let's complete the square for both $x$ and $y$.\n\nStarting with $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y + 6 = 0$:\n\nFor $x^2 - 6x$, we add and subtract $(6/2)^2 = 9$ inside the parentheses:\n$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + y^2 + 2y + 6 = 0 + 9$.\n\nFor $y^2 + 2y$, we add and subtract $(2/2)^2 = 1$ inside the parentheses:\n$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) + 6 = 0 + 9 + 1$.\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as:\n$(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 10$.\n\nSo, the center of the circle is at $(3, -1)$ and the radius is $\\sqrt{10}$. So, the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\n\n(Simplify square root of 10 as an approximation if necessary.)",
