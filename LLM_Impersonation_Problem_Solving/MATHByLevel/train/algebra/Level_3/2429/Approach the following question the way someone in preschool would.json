    "solution": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 4 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 4$. It follows that the square of the radius is 4, so the radius must be $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "This is actually a really fun question! To find the radius of the circle, we need to rewrite the equation in a special form called the standard form of a circle equation. \n\nFirst, let's group the x terms together and the y terms together: \n$(x^2 - 6x) + (y^2 + 2y) = -6$\n\nNow, we want to complete the square for both the x part and the y part. Let's start with the x part. To complete the square for $x^2 - 6x$, we need to add $(6/2)^2 = 9$ inside the parentheses: \n$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y) = 3$\n\nNow let's do the same for the y part. Add $(2/2)^2 = 1$ inside the parentheses: \n$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) = 4$\n\nAlmost there! Now we can rewrite this as $(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 4$. \n\nAnd ta-da! The radius of the circle is $\\boxed{2}$! That wasn't too hard, was it?",
