    "solution": "The product of two positive numbers is positive, and the product of two negative numbers is also positive. Therefore, if the product of two numbers is less than or equal to $0$, then one of the numbers must be greater than or equal to $0$ and one of the numbers must be less than or equal to $0$.\n\nIf $(n+3)(n-7)\\le 0$, then because we know $n+3\\ge n-7$, we must specifically have $n+3\\ge 0$ and $n-7\\le 0$. The first condition, $n+3\\ge 0$, is true when $n\\ge -3$. The second condition, $n-7\\le 0$, is true when $n\\le 7$. Since both conditions must be true, the only solutions are the integers from $-3$ through $7$ (inclusive). These are $$n = -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.$$ Counting, we see that there are $\\boxed{11}$ solutions.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many integers $n$ satisfy $(n+3)(n-7) \\le 0$, we need to think about what happens when the expression is less than or equal to 0. \n\nLet's try some numbers to see which ones make the expression less than or equal to 0. \n\nIf we try $n=5$, we get $(5+3)(5-7) = (8)(-2) = -16$, which is less than 0. \n\nIf we try $n=6$, we get $(6+3)(6-7) = (9)(-1) = -9$, which is also less than 0. \n\nIf we try $n=0$, we get $(0+3)(0-7) = (3)(-7) = -21$, which is less than 0. \n\nSo, it looks like the integers $n$ that satisfy $(n+3)(n-7) \\le 0$ are $n=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$ because those are the numbers that make the expression less than or equal to 0. \n\nThat means there are 8 integers that satisfy the equation.",
