    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The second and fifth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 17 and 19, respectively. What is the eighth term?",
    "solution": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d = 17$, fifth term is $a + 4d = 19$, and the eighth term is $a + 7d$.  Note that $(a + 4d) - (a + d) = 3d$, and $(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 3d$, so the terms $a + d = 17$, $a + 4d = 19$, and $a + 7d$ also form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nIf 17 and 19 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then the common difference is $19 - 17 = 2$, so the next term must be $19 + 2 = \\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So, an arithmetic sequence is when you add the same amount each time to get the next number. In this case, we start with 17, then add the same amount to get to 19, and we want to find the eighth number in the sequence.\n\nLet's count together: 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. So, the eighth term in the sequence would be 24! Yay, we did it!",
