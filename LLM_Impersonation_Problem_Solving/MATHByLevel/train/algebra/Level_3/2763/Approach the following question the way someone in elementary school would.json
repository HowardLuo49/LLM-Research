    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The second and fifth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 17 and 19, respectively. What is the eighth term?",
    "solution": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d = 17$, fifth term is $a + 4d = 19$, and the eighth term is $a + 7d$.  Note that $(a + 4d) - (a + d) = 3d$, and $(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 3d$, so the terms $a + d = 17$, $a + 4d = 19$, and $a + 7d$ also form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nIf 17 and 19 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then the common difference is $19 - 17 = 2$, so the next term must be $19 + 2 = \\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the eighth term of the arithmetic sequence, we first need to figure out the common difference between each term. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is found by adding the same number to the previous term.\n\nThe second term is 17, and the fifth term is 19. To find the common difference, we can subtract the second term from the fifth term:\n\n19 - 17 = 2\n\nSo, the common difference between each term is 2.\n\nTo find the eighth term, we need to add the common difference to the fifth term three more times:\n\n19 + 2 = 21 (sixth term)\n21 + 2 = 23 (seventh term)\n23 + 2 = 25 (eighth term)\n\nTherefore, the eighth term of the arithmetic sequence is 25.",
