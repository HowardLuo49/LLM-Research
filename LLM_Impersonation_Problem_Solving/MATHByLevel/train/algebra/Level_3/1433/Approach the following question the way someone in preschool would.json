    "solution": "Since the perimeter is 40, the sides of the rectangle add up to $40/2 = 20.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $20 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 20x = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100 = 100 - (x - 10)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{100}$ square feet, which occurs for a $10 \\times 10$ square.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's count together! If we use all 40 feet of fencing to make a rectangle, we can divide it into 4 sides. That means each side would be 10 feet long. So let's draw a rectangle with sides that are 10 feet long each. \n\nNow let's count the squares inside the rectangle. Since each side is 10 feet long, that means the rectangle is 10 feet by 10 feet. So, when we multiply 10 feet by 10 feet, we get 100 square feet in the area of the rectangular pen enclosed by the fencing.\n\nYay! We did it! The greatest possible number of square feet is 100!",
