    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Given 40 feet of fencing, what is the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of a rectangular pen enclosed by the fencing?",
    "solution": "Since the perimeter is 40, the sides of the rectangle add up to $40/2 = 20.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $20 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 20x = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100 = 100 - (x - 10)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{100}$ square feet, which occurs for a $10 \\times 10$ square.",
    "gpt_response": "Hello! To find the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of a rectangular pen enclosed by 40 feet of fencing, we need to remember that a rectangle has four sides - two of them are the same length and the other two are the same length.\n\nFirst, we can start by using half of the fencing to find the length of one side of the rectangle. Since we have 40 feet of fencing, half of that is 20 feet. So, one side of the rectangle can be 20 feet long.\n\nNext, we can use the remaining 20 feet of fencing to find the length of the other side of the rectangle. Since we have two sides that need to be the same length, we can divide the 20 feet of fencing by 2 to get 10 feet for the other side.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width. So, the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of the rectangular pen enclosed by the 40 feet of fencing is 20 feet x 10 feet = 200 square feet. Yay!",
