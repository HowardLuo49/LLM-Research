    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Given 40 feet of fencing, what is the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of a rectangular pen enclosed by the fencing?",
    "solution": "Since the perimeter is 40, the sides of the rectangle add up to $40/2 = 20.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $20 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 20x = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100 = 100 - (x - 10)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{100}$ square feet, which occurs for a $10 \\times 10$ square.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of a rectangular pen enclosed by the fencing, we need to maximize the area of the rectangle. \n\nSince the perimeter of the rectangle is 40 feet, we can set up the equation 2l + 2w = 40, where l represents the length of the rectangle and w represents the width. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get l + w = 20. Solving for one variable in terms of the other, we can say l = 20 - w. \n\nTo find the area of the rectangle, we use the formula A = l * w. Substituting in the value of l from the previous equation, we get A = (20 - w) * w. \n\nExpanding, we get A = 20w - w^2. To find the maximum area, we need to find the vertex of the parabola formed by this equation. The formula for finding the x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form ax^2 + bx + c is x = -b/2a. In this case, a = -1, b = 20, and c = 0. \n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get w = -20/(2*-1) = 10. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of the rectangular pen is found when the width is 10 feet and the area is 10 * 20 = 200 square feet.",
