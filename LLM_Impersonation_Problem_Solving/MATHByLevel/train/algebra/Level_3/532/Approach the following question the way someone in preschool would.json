    "solution": "We simply plug into $b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(3)(-12) = 49 + 144 = \\boxed{193},$ and that is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "The discriminant is a math thing that helps us figure out how many solutions a quadratic equation has. To find it, we use a secret formula: $b^2 - 4ac$. In our equation $3x^2 - 7x - 12$, the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are like special friends. So let's put those values into the formula and see what we get! It's like a fun math puzzle.",
