    "gpt_response": "To find the discriminant, we need to use the formula $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ where $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ ($3$ in this case), $b$ is the coefficient of $x$ ($-7$), and $c$ is the constant term ($-12$).\n\nPlugging in our values, we get $\\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4(3)(-12)$.\n\nThis simplifies to $\\Delta = 49 + 144$, or $\\Delta = 193$.\n\nSo, the discriminant of $3x^2 - 7x - 12$ is $193$.",
