    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The seventh and tenth terms of a geometric sequence are $7$ and $21$, respectively. What is the $13$th term of this progression?",
    "solution": "To get from the seventh term to the tenth term, we multiply the seventh term by 3 ($7\\times3=21$). So to get from the tenth term to the $13$th term, we multiply the tenth term by 3 since the ratio between terms is constant. The $13$th term is $21\\times3=\\boxed{63}$.\n\nTo be more specific, we can write the eighth term as $7r$, where $r$ is the common ratio of the geometric sequence. The ninth term is $7r^2$, the tenth term is $7r^3$, etc. If $7r^3=21$, then $r^3=3$. So $a_n=a_{n-3}r^3=3a_{n-3}$. We get the $13$th term with $3a_{10}=3\\times21=\\boxed{63}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 13th term of the geometric sequence, we need to know the common ratio between terms. The common ratio can be found by dividing the 10th term by the 7th term:\n\nCommon ratio = 21 / 7 = 3\n\nNow we can find the 13th term by multiplying the 10th term by the common ratio three more times:\n\n10th term = 21\n11th term = 21 * 3 = 63\n12th term = 63 * 3 = 189\n13th term = 189 * 3 = 567\n\nSo, the 13th term of the geometric sequence is 567.",
