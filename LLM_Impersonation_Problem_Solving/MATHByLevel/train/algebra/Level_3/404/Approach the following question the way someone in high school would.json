    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The seventh and tenth terms of a geometric sequence are $7$ and $21$, respectively. What is the $13$th term of this progression?",
    "solution": "To get from the seventh term to the tenth term, we multiply the seventh term by 3 ($7\\times3=21$). So to get from the tenth term to the $13$th term, we multiply the tenth term by 3 since the ratio between terms is constant. The $13$th term is $21\\times3=\\boxed{63}$.\n\nTo be more specific, we can write the eighth term as $7r$, where $r$ is the common ratio of the geometric sequence. The ninth term is $7r^2$, the tenth term is $7r^3$, etc. If $7r^3=21$, then $r^3=3$. So $a_n=a_{n-3}r^3=3a_{n-3}$. We get the $13$th term with $3a_{10}=3\\times21=\\boxed{63}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $13$th term of this geometric sequence, we first need to figure out the common ratio. \n\nWe know that the seventh term is $7$ and the tenth term is $21$. \n\nWe can find the common ratio by dividing the tenth term by the seventh term: \n$21/7 = 3.$\n\nSo, the common ratio is $3$. \n\nNow, we can find the $13$th term by multiplying the tenth term by the common ratio three times, since we need to go from the 10th to the 13th term:\n$21 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 21 \\times 27 = 567.$\n\nTherefore, the $13$th term of this geometric sequence is $567$.",
