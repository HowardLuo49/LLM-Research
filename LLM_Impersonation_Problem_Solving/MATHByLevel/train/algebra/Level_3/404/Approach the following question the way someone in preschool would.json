    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The seventh and tenth terms of a geometric sequence are $7$ and $21$, respectively. What is the $13$th term of this progression?",
    "solution": "To get from the seventh term to the tenth term, we multiply the seventh term by 3 ($7\\times3=21$). So to get from the tenth term to the $13$th term, we multiply the tenth term by 3 since the ratio between terms is constant. The $13$th term is $21\\times3=\\boxed{63}$.\n\nTo be more specific, we can write the eighth term as $7r$, where $r$ is the common ratio of the geometric sequence. The ninth term is $7r^2$, the tenth term is $7r^3$, etc. If $7r^3=21$, then $r^3=3$. So $a_n=a_{n-3}r^3=3a_{n-3}$. We get the $13$th term with $3a_{10}=3\\times21=\\boxed{63}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count to the numbers mentioned in the question. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The seventh term is 7 and the tenth term is 21.\n\nHmm, to find the 13th term, I think we need to figure out the pattern in the sequence. Let's see... I notice that to get from the seventh term to the tenth term, we multiply by 3, because $7 \\times 3 = 21$.\n\nSo, if we continue this pattern, we can find the 13th term. We would just need to multiply the 10th term by 3 again, because $21 \\times 3 = 63$.\n\nTherefore, the 13th term of this sequence is $63$. Yay!",
