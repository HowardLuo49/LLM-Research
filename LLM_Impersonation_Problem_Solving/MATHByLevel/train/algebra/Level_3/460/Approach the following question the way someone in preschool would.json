    "solution": "Since $2>0$ we know that $f(2)=a(2)+3=5$. Solving for $a$, we get that $a=1$. With $x=0$, we get that $f(0)=ab=5$. We already know that $a=1$, so $b=5$. Because -2 is negative, we know that $f(-2)=b(-2)+c=(5)(-2)+c=-10$. This tells us that $c=0$, so our answer is $a+b+c=1+5+0=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's look at the information we have. When $x = 2$, we have $f(2) = 5$. This means $a(2) + 3 = 5$, so $2a + 3 = 5$. Solving this equation, we find that $a = 1$.\n\nNext, when $x = 0$, we have $f(0) = 5$. This means $ab = 5$, and since $a = 1$, we have $b = 5$.\n\nFinally, when $x = -2$, we have $f(-2) = -10$.
