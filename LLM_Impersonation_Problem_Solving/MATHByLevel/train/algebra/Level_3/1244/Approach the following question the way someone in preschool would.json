    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! When we have an expression like $\\frac{a+3}{a^2-4}$, it's undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. So we need to find what values of $a$ make $a^2-4$ equal to zero. Let's look for those values!\n\nIf we set $a^2-4=0$, we can add 4 to both sides to get $a^2=4$. And if we take the square root of both sides, we get $a=\\pm2$. So the expression $\\frac{a+3}{a^2-4}$ is undefined when $a=-2$ and $a=2$.\n\nSo the values of $a$ that make the expression undefined are $-2$ and $2$. Let's list them in increasing order: $-2, 2$.",
