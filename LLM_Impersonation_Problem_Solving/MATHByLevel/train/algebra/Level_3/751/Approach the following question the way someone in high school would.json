    "solution": "A function will have a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals zero and the degree of that root is greater than the degree of the same root in the numerator.  Here, the denominator is zero at $x = 4.$  The degree of this root is 1.  The number has no root at $x = 4$ (degree 0), so there is a vertical asymptote at $x=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$ where there will be a vertical asymptote, we need to look for the value that would make the denominator zero, since division by zero is undefined.\n\nIn this case, the denominator is $x-4$. To find the value of $x$ that makes the denominator zero, we set $x-4=0$ and solve for $x$. \n\n$x-4=0$\n\n$x=4$\n\nTherefore, at $x=4$ there will be a vertical asymptote in the function $y= \\frac{x^2+2x+8}{x-4}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4?: To find the value of $x$ where there will be a vertical asymptote, we need to look for the value that would make the denominator zero, since division by zero is undefined.\n\nIn this case, the denominator is $x-4$. To find the value of $x$ that makes the denominator zero, we set $x-4=0$ and solve for $x$. \n\n$x-4=0$\n\n$x=4$\n\nTherefore, at $x=4$ there will be a vertical asymptote in the function $y= \\frac{x^2+2x+8}{x-4}$.",
