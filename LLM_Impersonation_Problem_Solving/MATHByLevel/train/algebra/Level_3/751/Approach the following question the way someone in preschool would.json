    "solution": "A function will have a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals zero and the degree of that root is greater than the degree of the same root in the numerator.  Here, the denominator is zero at $x = 4.$  The degree of this root is 1.  The number has no root at $x = 4$ (degree 0), so there is a vertical asymptote at $x=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... to find the value of x that will make a vertical asymptote, we need to think about when the denominator of the fraction will be equal to 0. So, if x-4 equals 0, then x must equal 4. That's the value of x that will make a vertical asymptote for this equation!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4?: Hmm, let's see... to find the value of x that will make a vertical asymptote, we need to think about when the denominator of the fraction will be equal to 0. So, if x-4 equals 0, then x must equal 4. That's the value of x that will make a vertical asymptote for this equation!",
