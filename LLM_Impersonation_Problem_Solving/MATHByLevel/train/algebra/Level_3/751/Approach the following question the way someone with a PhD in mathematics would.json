    "solution": "A function will have a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals zero and the degree of that root is greater than the degree of the same root in the numerator.  Here, the denominator is zero at $x = 4.$  The degree of this root is 1.  The number has no root at $x = 4$ (degree 0), so there is a vertical asymptote at $x=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find where a vertical asymptote occurs in this function, we must determine the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined. \n\nThus, we set $x - 4 = 0$ and solve for $x$: \n\n$x - 4 = 0$\n\n$x = 4$\n\nTherefore, there will be a vertical asymptote at $x = 4$ in the function $y= \\frac{x^2+2x+8}{x-4}$.",
