    "solution": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out how long it takes one faucet to fill the 100-gallon tub. If three faucets can fill it in 6 minutes, then one faucet would take 18 minutes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it would take six faucets to fill the 25-gallon tub. We can set up a proportion to solve for this:\n\n(18 minutes / 100 gallons) = (x minutes / 25 gallons)\n\nCross multiplying, we get 100x = 18 * 25\n100x = 450\nx = 450 / 100\nx = 4.5 minutes\n\nFinally, we need to convert 4.5 minutes into seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 4.5 minutes would be:\n\n4.5 minutes * 60 = 270 seconds\n\nTherefore, it would take six faucets 270 seconds to fill a 25-gallon tub.",
