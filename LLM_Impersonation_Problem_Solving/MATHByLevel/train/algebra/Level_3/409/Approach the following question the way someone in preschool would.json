    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see. First, we need to multiply the first terms of each parentheses. So, $9x$ times $4x^2$ is $36x^3$. Next, we multiply $9x$ by 3, which gives us $27x$. Then, we multiply 2 by $4x^2$, which equals $8x^2$. Finally, we multiply 2 by 3, which gives us $6$. Now, we can add all these results together to get our final answer: $36x^3 + 27x + 8x^2 + 6$.",
