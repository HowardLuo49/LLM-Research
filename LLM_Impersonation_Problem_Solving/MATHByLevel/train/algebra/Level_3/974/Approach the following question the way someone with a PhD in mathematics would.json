    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2+21=4x+18y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-4x+y^2-18y=-21$. Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-2)^2-4+(y-9)^2-81=-21$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-2)^2+(y-9)^2=64$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(2,9)$ and radius $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the radius of the cookie, we must first rewrite the given equation in standard form. \n\nRearranging the terms, we have $x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 18y = -21$.\n\nCompleting the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms, we get $(x-2)^2 + (y-9)^2 = 36$.\n\nComparing this equation with the standard form of a circle $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, we see that the center of the circle is at $(2,9)$ and the radius is $\\sqrt{36} = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the cookie is 6 units. We can conclude that this is a snack-sized cookie.",
