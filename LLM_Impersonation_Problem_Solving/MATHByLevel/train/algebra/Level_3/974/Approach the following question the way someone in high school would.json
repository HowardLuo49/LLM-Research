    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2+21=4x+18y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-4x+y^2-18y=-21$. Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-2)^2-4+(y-9)^2-81=-21$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-2)^2+(y-9)^2=64$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(2,9)$ and radius $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the radius of this cookie, we need to rewrite the equation of the boundary in the form of a circle equation, which is $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$ where $(a,b)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation $x^2+y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18y$ in the standard form by completing the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms:\n\n$(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 - 18y) = -21$\n$(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 18y + 81) = -21 + 4 + 81$\n$(x-2)^2 + (y-9)^2 = 64$\n\nNow we see that the equation of the boundary is in the form of a circle equation with center at $(2,9)$ and radius $\\sqrt{64} = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the radius of this cookie is 8 units. So it is a lunch-sized cookie!",
