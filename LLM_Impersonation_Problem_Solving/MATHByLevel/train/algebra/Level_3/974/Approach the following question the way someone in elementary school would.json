    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2+21=4x+18y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-4x+y^2-18y=-21$. Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-2)^2-4+(y-9)^2-81=-21$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-2)^2+(y-9)^2=64$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(2,9)$ and radius $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to rearrange the equation of the cookie to make it look like the equation of a circle. The standard form of the equation of a circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.\n\nSo we need to rearrange the given equation:\n$x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 18y = -21$\n\nTo complete the square, we need to add and subtract the squares of half of the coefficients of x and y:\n$x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 18y + 81 = -21 + 4 + 81$\n$(x-2)^2 + (y-9)^2 = 64$\n\nComparing this to the standard form of a circle, we can see that the center of the circle is at (2, 9) and the radius is 8. So, Cookie Monster, this cookie is definitely a lunch-sized cookie!",
