    "solution": "Note that $a \\star b = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$. Thus, $4 \\star 6 = (4 + 6)^2 = 10^2 = \\boxed{100}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $a \\star b$ when $a = 4$ and $b = 6$, all we have to do is substitute those values into the equation $a \\star b = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$. \n\nSo, $4 \\star 6 = 4^2 + 2(4)(6) + 6^2 = 16 + 48 + 36 = \\boxed{100}$. \n\nTherefore, when $a = 4$ and $b = 6$, $a \\star b$ is equal to 100.",
