    "solution": "We have: $$3 < \\sqrt{2x} < 4 $$$$\\Rightarrow 9 < 2x < 16 $$$$\\Rightarrow 4.5 < x < 8$$The integers from 5 to 7 inclusive satisfy this inequality, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers that satisfy the condition.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer values of x that satisfy the condition, we first need to find the range of values for the square root of $2x$. Since the square root of $2x$ is greater than 3 and less than 4, we know that $\\sqrt{2x} > 3$ and $\\sqrt{2x} < 4$.\n\nSolving $\\sqrt{2x} > 3$, we get $2x > 9$ which simplifies to $x > 4.5$. \nSolving $\\sqrt{2x} < 4$, we get $2x < 16$ which simplifies to $x < 8$.\n\nTherefore, the integer values of x that satisfy the condition are 5, 6, and 7. So there are 3 integer values of x that satisfy the condition.",
