Let $a_1,a_2$ be two nonzero values of $a$ such that $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$.  Let the corresponding $b$ values be $b_1,b_2$.  If $b_1,b_2$ are nonzero, find the value of $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}$.",
    "solution": "If $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$, then the product $ab$ is a constant.  For $a_1$ and $a_2$ this implies: $$a_1\\cdot b_1=a_2\\cdot b_2$$We can divide both sides of this equation by $b_1\\cdot a_2$ to find: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a_1\\cdot b_1}{b_1\\cdot a_2}&=\\frac{a_2\\cdot b_2}{b_1\\cdot a_2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{a_1}{a_2}&=\\frac{b_2}{b_1}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}&=\\frac{b_1}{b_2}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for $a$ to be inversely proportional to $b$. When two quantities are inversely proportional, it means that as one value increases, the other value decreases in such a way that their product remains constant. This relationship can be expressed as $ab=k$, where $k$ is a constant.\n\nGiven that $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}= \\frac{k/b_1}{k/b_2}$. This implies that $a_1b_1=a_2b_2$, since $ab=k$. \n\nSo, we have $a_1b_1=a_2b_2$. Dividing both sides by $a_2b_1$, we get $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}=\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$. Since $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, we can substitute this into our equation to find that $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
