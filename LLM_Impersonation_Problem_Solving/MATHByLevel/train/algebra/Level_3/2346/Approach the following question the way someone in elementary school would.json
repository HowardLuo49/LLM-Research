Let $a_1,a_2$ be two nonzero values of $a$ such that $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$.  Let the corresponding $b$ values be $b_1,b_2$.  If $b_1,b_2$ are nonzero, find the value of $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}$.",
    "solution": "If $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$, then the product $ab$ is a constant.  For $a_1$ and $a_2$ this implies: $$a_1\\cdot b_1=a_2\\cdot b_2$$We can divide both sides of this equation by $b_1\\cdot a_2$ to find: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a_1\\cdot b_1}{b_1\\cdot a_2}&=\\frac{a_2\\cdot b_2}{b_1\\cdot a_2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{a_1}{a_2}&=\\frac{b_2}{b_1}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}&=\\frac{b_1}{b_2}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember that when things are inversely proportional, as one value goes up, the other value goes down. So if $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, it means that $a_1$ is smaller than $a_2$. \n\nSince $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$, if $a$ gets smaller, $b$ gets bigger, and vice versa. So since $a_1$ is smaller than $a_2$, $b_1$ must be bigger than $b_2$. \n\nNow, we know that $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$. We also know that $b_1$ is bigger than $b_2$. Since $b_1$ is bigger, we can say that $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}>1$. \n\nIf $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $b_1$ is bigger than $b_2$, then $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
