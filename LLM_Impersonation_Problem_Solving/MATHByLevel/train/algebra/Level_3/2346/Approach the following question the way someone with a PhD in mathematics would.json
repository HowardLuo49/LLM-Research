    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Suppose that $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$.  Let $a_1,a_2$ be two nonzero values of $a$ such that $\\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$.  Let the corresponding $b$ values be $b_1,b_2$.  If $b_1,b_2$ are nonzero, find the value of $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}$.",
    "solution": "If $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$, then the product $ab$ is a constant.  For $a_1$ and $a_2$ this implies: $$a_1\\cdot b_1=a_2\\cdot b_2$$We can divide both sides of this equation by $b_1\\cdot a_2$ to find: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a_1\\cdot b_1}{b_1\\cdot a_2}&=\\frac{a_2\\cdot b_2}{b_1\\cdot a_2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{a_1}{a_2}&=\\frac{b_2}{b_1}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}&=\\frac{b_1}{b_2}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "As $a$ is inversely proportional to $b$, we have that $ab = k$ for some constant $k$. Therefore, we have $a_1b_1 = a_2b_2 = k$.\n\nGiven that $\\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{2}{3}$, we have $\\frac{a_1b_1}{a_2b_2} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{b_1}{b_2} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\frac{b_1}{b_2}$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
