    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Four years ago you invested some money at $10\\%$ interest. You now have $\\$439.23$ in the account. If the interest was compounded yearly, how much did you invest 4 years ago?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the initial amount.  After four years, at a ten percent annual interest rate, the investment will have grown to $x \\cdot 1.1^4$, so $x \\cdot 1.1^4 = 439.23$.  Then $x = 439.23/1.1^4 = \\boxed{300}$.",
