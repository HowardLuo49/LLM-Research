    "solution": "Let $x$ be the initial amount.  After four years, at a ten percent annual interest rate, the investment will have grown to $x \\cdot 1.1^4$, so $x \\cdot 1.1^4 = 439.23$.  Then $x = 439.23/1.1^4 = \\boxed{300}$.",

How much money did I put in the account four years ago?\n\nTo figure this out, we can use a formula.
