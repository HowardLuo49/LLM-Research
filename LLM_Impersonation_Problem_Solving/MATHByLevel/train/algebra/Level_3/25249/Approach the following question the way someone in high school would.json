    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. I have a bag with blue marbles and yellow marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 8:5. If I remove 12 blue marbles and add 21 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 1:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I removed some?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 8:5, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{8}{5}$. Additionally, after we remove blue marbles and add yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be $x-12$ and $y+21$ respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $1:3$, so $\\dfrac{x-12}{y+21}=\\dfrac{1}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $5x=8y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x-12)=1(y+21)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=15$, $x=24$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before some were removed, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's assign variables for the number of blue and yellow marbles in the bag before we remove any. Let's say there are 8x blue marbles and 5x yellow marbles in the bag.\n\nAfter removing 12 blue marbles, we will have 8x - 12 blue marbles remaining. After adding 21 yellow marbles, we will have 5x + 21 yellow marbles in the bag.\n\nAccording to the new ratio, (8x - 12)/(5x + 21) = 1/3\n\nNow, we can cross multiply to solve for x:\n\n3(8x - 12) = 1(5x + 21)\n24x - 36 = 5x + 21\n19x = 57\nx = 3\n\nNow that we have found the value of x, we can substitute it back into our equations to find the initial number of blue marbles:\n\n8x = 8(3) = 24 blue marbles\n\nTherefore, there were 24 blue marbles in the bag before we removed any.",
