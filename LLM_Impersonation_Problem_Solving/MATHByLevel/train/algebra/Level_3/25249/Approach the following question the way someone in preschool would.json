    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. I have a bag with blue marbles and yellow marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 8:5. If I remove 12 blue marbles and add 21 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 1:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I removed some?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 8:5, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{8}{5}$. Additionally, after we remove blue marbles and add yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be $x-12$ and $y+21$ respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $1:3$, so $\\dfrac{x-12}{y+21}=\\dfrac{1}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $5x=8y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x-12)=1(y+21)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=15$, $x=24$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before some were removed, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the blue marbles first! We have 8 blue marbles for every 5 yellow marbles. So if we have 8 parts blue marbles and 5 parts yellow marbles, we have a total of 8+5 = 13 parts.\n\nNext, we know that if we take away 12 blue marbles and add 21 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 1:3. This means we have a total of 1 part blue marbles and 3 parts yellow marbles, which equals 1+3 = 4 parts.\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion to solve for how many blue marbles were in the bag originally:\n\n8/13 = x/4\n\nCross multiply to solve for x:\n\n8 * 4 = 13x\n32 = 13x\nx = 32/13\nx = 2.46 approximately\n\nSo, there were approximately 32 blue marbles in the bag originally before you removed some.
