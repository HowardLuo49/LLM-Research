    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The area of a square equals the square of a length of the side of the square. The perimeter of a square equals the sum of the lengths of all four sides. The sum of the areas of two squares is 65, while the difference in their areas is 33.  Find the sum of their perimeters.",
    "solution": "Let the side length of the larger square be $x$ and the side length of the smaller square be $y$.  We are told $x^2 + y^2 = 65$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 33$.  Adding these two equations gives $2x^2 = 98$, so $x^2 = 49$. Since $x$ must be positive, we have $x=7$. Substituting this into either equation above gives us $y^2 = 16$.  Since $y$ must be positive, we have $y=4$.  The perimeter of the larger square is $4x$ and that of the smaller square is $4y$, so the sum of their perimeters is $4x+4y = 4(x+y) = \\boxed{44}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, this sounds like a fun math problem! Let's start by figuring out the side lengths of the squares. We know that their areas add up to 65 and their difference is 33. That means one square has an area of 49 (65-33) and the other has an area of 16 (49-33).\n\nTo find the side length of the first square, we need to take the square root of 49, which is 7. And for the second square, we take the square root of 16, which is 4.\n\nNow we know that the side lengths of the two squares are 7 and 4. To find the sum of their perimeters, we add all four sides of both squares. \n\nFor the first square, the perimeter = 4 x 7 = 28\nFor the second square, the perimeter = 4 x 4 = 16\n\nFinally, we add them together: 28 + 16 = 44. So, the sum of the perimeters of the two squares is 44. Yay, we did it!",
