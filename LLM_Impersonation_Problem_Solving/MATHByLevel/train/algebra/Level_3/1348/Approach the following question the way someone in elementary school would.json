    "solution": "Because $\\sqrt{16}<\\sqrt{17}<\\sqrt{25}$, or, $4<\\sqrt{17}<5$, the largest integer less than $\\sqrt{17}$ is $4$. Therefore, $4^2=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To evaluate $\\lfloor\\sqrt{17}\\rfloor^2$, first find the square root of 17. The square root of 17 is between 4 and 5. Since 4 is the largest whole number less than the square root of 17, the greatest integer less than the square root of 17 is 4. \n\nNow, square 4 to find the answer. $4^2 = 16$. \n\nSo, $\\lfloor\\sqrt{17}\\rfloor^2 = 16$.",
