    "solution": "Because $\\sqrt{16}<\\sqrt{17}<\\sqrt{25}$, or, $4<\\sqrt{17}<5$, the largest integer less than $\\sqrt{17}$ is $4$. Therefore, $4^2=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first find the square root of 17. The square root of 17 is between 4 and 5, because $4^2=16$ and $5^2=25$. Since $\\sqrt{17}$ is closer to 4, we know that $\\lfloor\\sqrt{17}\\rfloor=4$. Now, to find the square of 4, we get $4^2=16$. So, $\\lfloor\\sqrt{17}\\rfloor^2=16$.",

The square root of 17 is between 4 and 5, because $4^2=16$ and $5^2=25$. Since $\\sqrt{17}$ is closer to 4, we know that $\\lfloor\\sqrt{17}\\rfloor=4$. Now, to find the square of 4, we get $4^2=16$.
