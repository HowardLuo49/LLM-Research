    "solution": "Because $\\sqrt{16}<\\sqrt{17}<\\sqrt{25}$, or, $4<\\sqrt{17}<5$, the largest integer less than $\\sqrt{17}$ is $4$. Therefore, $4^2=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we must evaluate the square root of 17, which is approximately 4.12310562561766. Taking the floor of this value yields 4. Finally, squaring this value gives 16. Therefore, $\\lfloor\\sqrt{17}\\rfloor^2 = 16$.",
