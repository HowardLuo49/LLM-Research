    "solution": "The sum of a set of integers is the product of the mean of the integers and the number of integers, and the median of a set of consecutive integers is the same as the mean. So the median must be $7^5/49=7^3$, or $\\boxed{343}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to remember what consecutive means. Consecutive numbers are numbers that come one after the other, like 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. \n\nSo if we have 49 consecutive integers, we have to add them all up to get $7^5$, which is a really big number. \n\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle number in our list of consecutive integers. Since we have an odd number of integers (49), the middle number will be the 25th number in the list.\n\nI'm not sure how to find the exact number, but I remember that the middle number is usually the average of the two middle numbers for odd numbers. \n\nSo the median of the 49 consecutive integers that add up to $7^5$ is the average of the 25th and 26th numbers.",
