Consider the lines \\begin{align*}\ny&=3x+5 \\\\ 2y&=4x+5 \\\\ 3y&=9x-2 \\\\ 2y&=x-3 \\\\ 4y&=x-5.\n\\end{align*}Let's say that a pair of lines is $\\emph{good}$ if the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other.  Among all the pairs of lines shown, how many pairs are good?",
    "solution": "We find the slope for each line. The slopes are $\\frac31=3$, $\\frac42=2$, $\\frac93=3$, $\\frac12$, and $\\frac14$.\nParallel lines have the same slope, therefore lines $a$ and $c$ are parallel. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. None of the slopes above are negative reciprocals, therefore there are no perpendicular lines. There are $1+0=\\boxed{1}$ pairs of lines that are parallel or perpendicular.",

These lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other, so they are perpendicular! They are good.\n\nThe fourth pair of lines are $y=3x+5$ and $4y=x-5$.
