    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The sixteenth and seventeenth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 8 and 10, respectively. What is the second term?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term in the arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  The sixteenth term is $a + 15d = 8$, and the seventeenth term is $a + 16d = 10$, so the common difference is $d = 10 - 8 = 2$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation $a + 15d = 8$, we get $a + 30 = 8$, so $a = -22$.  Then the second term is $a + d = -22 + 2 = \\boxed{-20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second term of an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \n\nan = a1 + (n-1)d \n\nwhere an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.\n\nGiven that the sixteenth and seventeenth terms are 8 and 10 respectively, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\na16 = a1 + 15d = 8\na17 = a1 + 16d = 10\n\nSubtracting the equations to eliminate a1, we get:\n\na17 - a16 = d = 2\n\nNow we can substitute the value of d back into one of the equations to find a1:\n\na1 + 15(2) = 8\na1 + 30 = 8\na1 = -22\n\nTherefore, the second term of the arithmetic sequence is -22.",
