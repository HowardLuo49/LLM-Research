    "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term in the arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  The sixteenth term is $a + 15d = 8$, and the seventeenth term is $a + 16d = 10$, so the common difference is $d = 10 - 8 = 2$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation $a + 15d = 8$, we get $a + 30 = 8$, so $a = -22$.  Then the second term is $a + d = -22 + 2 = \\boxed{-20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, first we need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a list of numbers where each number is the same distance away from the next number. So if we start at 8 and go up 2 to get to 10, we know the difference between each number is 2.\n\nSo let's count backwards to figure out what the second term is. If the seventeenth term is 10, then the sixteenth term must be 8. And if the difference between each number is 2, then the fifteenth term must be 6, and the fourteenth term must be 4, and so on.\n\nSo the second term in this arithmetic sequence must be 6. Yay, we figured it out!",
