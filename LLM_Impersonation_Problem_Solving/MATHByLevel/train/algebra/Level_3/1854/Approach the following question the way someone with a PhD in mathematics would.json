    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The sixteenth and seventeenth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 8 and 10, respectively. What is the second term?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term in the arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  The sixteenth term is $a + 15d = 8$, and the seventeenth term is $a + 16d = 10$, so the common difference is $d = 10 - 8 = 2$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation $a + 15d = 8$, we get $a + 30 = 8$, so $a = -22$.  Then the second term is $a + d = -22 + 2 = \\boxed{-20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by\n\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,\n\nwhere a_n is the nth term of the sequence, a_1 is the first term, n is the position of the term in the sequence, and d is the common difference between terms.\n\nGiven that the sixteenth term is 8 and the seventeenth term is 10, we have the following equations:\n\na_16 = a_1 + 15d = 8,\na_17 = a_1 + 16d = 10.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get\n\na_17 - a_16 = d = 2.\n\nSubstitute d = 2 back into the first equation, we have\n\na_1 + 15(2) = 8,\na_1 = 8 - 30 = -22.\n\nTherefore, the second term of the arithmetic sequence is -22.",
