    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The sixteenth and seventeenth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 8 and 10, respectively. What is the second term?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term in the arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  The sixteenth term is $a + 15d = 8$, and the seventeenth term is $a + 16d = 10$, so the common difference is $d = 10 - 8 = 2$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation $a + 15d = 8$, we get $a + 30 = 8$, so $a = -22$.  Then the second term is $a + d = -22 + 2 = \\boxed{-20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so an arithmetic sequence is when you add the same number each time to get the next number. In this case, we know the sixteenth term is 8 and the seventeenth term is 10.\n\nTo find the second term, we need to figure out how much we are adding each time. Since the difference between the seventeenth and sixteenth terms is 2 (10-8=2), we know that we are adding 2 each time.\n\nNow, we need to find the first term in the sequence. Since we are adding 2 each time, we can work backwards to find it. \n\nIf the seventeenth term is 10 and we are adding 2 each time, the sixteenth term would be 10-2=8. \n\nIf the sixteenth term is 8 and we are adding 2 each time, the fifteenth term would be 8-2=6. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we can find that the second term in the sequence is 8-14= __.",
