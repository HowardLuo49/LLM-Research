On a balance scale, $3$ green balls balance $6$ blue balls, $2$ yellow balls balance $5$ blue balls, and $6$ blue balls balance $4$ white balls. How many blue balls are needed to balance $4$ green, $2$ yellow and $2$ white balls?",
    "solution": "We will herein give the weight of each color ball a variable determined by the first letter of the color. We have $3G=6B\\implies 1G=2B$, $2Y=5B\\implies 1Y=2.5B$, and $6B=4W\\implies 1W=1.5B$. Thus $4G+2Y+2W=4(2B)+2(2.5B)+2(1.5B)=8B+5B+3B=16B$, and our answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",

First, we know that 3 green balls balance 6 blue balls, so 1 green ball is equal to 2 blue balls.\nNext, we know that 2 yellow balls balance 5 blue balls, so 1 yellow ball is equal to 2.5 blue balls (or we can say 1 yellow ball is close to 3 blue balls).\nLastly, we know that 6 blue balls balance 4 white balls, so 1 blue ball is equal to 2/3 white balls.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many blue balls we need to balance 4 green balls, 2 yellow balls, and 2 white balls.\n4 green balls = 4 * 2 = 8 blue balls\n2 yellow balls = 2 * 2.5 = 5 blue balls\n2 white balls = 2 * 3/2 = 3 blue balls\n\nAdding all of these up, we need 8 + 5 + 3 = 16 blue balls to balance 4 green, 2 yellow, and 2 white balls.",
