    "solution": "$\\textbf{Solution 1}$: Let the three numbers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, and WLOG assume that $a\\le b \\le c$. We have the three equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=67\\\\\nc-b&=7\\\\\nb-a&=3\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $c=b+7$. Substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $c$, we have $a+b+(b+7)=67\\Rightarrow a+2b=60$. Adding this last equation to the third equation, we have $a+2b+b-a=60+3\\Rightarrow b=21$. Substituting this value into the second equation to find $c$, we get $c=b+7=28$. Thus, the largest number is $\\boxed{28}$.\n\n$\\textbf{Solution 2}$: Let the middle number be $x.$ Then, the largest number is $x+7$ and the smallest number is $x-3.$ The numbers have a sum of $67,$ so we have the equation $$(x-3) + (x) + (x+7) = 67.$$ Simplifying, we get $$3x + 4 = 67$$ $$\\implies x = 21.$$ So, the largest number is $x+7 = 21+7 = \\boxed{28}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's break it down. We know we have three different numbers that add up to 67. Let's call the smallest number x. \n\nThe two larger numbers differ by 7, so let's call the middle number y and the largest number z. That means z = y + 7. \n\nThe two smaller numbers differ by 3, so we have x = y - 3. \n\nNow, we can add up all the numbers to get the equation x + y + z = 67. Substituting in our expressions for x and z, we get:\n\nx + y + y + 7 = 67. \n\nNow we can substitute in x = y - 3 to get:\n\ny - 3 + y + y + 7 = 67. \n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n3y + 4 = 67. \n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n\n3y = 63. \n\nDividing by 3, we get:\n\ny = 21. \n\nNow we can substitute y back into our expression for z to get:\n\nz = 21 + 7\nz = 28. \n\nSo, the largest number is 28.",
