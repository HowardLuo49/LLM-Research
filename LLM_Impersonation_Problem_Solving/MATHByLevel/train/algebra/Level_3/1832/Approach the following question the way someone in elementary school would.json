    "solution": "Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$. Because the coordinates of a midpoint of a line segment are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, we have that $\\frac{3+x}{2} = 2$ and $\\frac{1+y}{2} = 5$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ yields $x = 1$ and $y = 9$. Thus, point $B$ has coordinates $(1,9)$, so the product of its coordinates is $\\boxed{9}$.",
