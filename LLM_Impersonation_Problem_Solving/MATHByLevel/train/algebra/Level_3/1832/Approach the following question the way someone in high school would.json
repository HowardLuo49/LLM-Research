    "solution": "Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$. Because the coordinates of a midpoint of a line segment are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, we have that $\\frac{3+x}{2} = 2$ and $\\frac{1+y}{2} = 5$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ yields $x = 1$ and $y = 9$. Thus, point $B$ has coordinates $(1,9)$, so the product of its coordinates is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coordinates of point $B$, we need to use the midpoint formula, which is $(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$. \n\nSince $M(2,5)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $A(3,1)$ is one endpoint, we can set up the following equations: \n$$\\frac{3+x}{2} = 2 \\implies 3+x = 4 \\implies x = 1$$\n$$\\frac{1+y}{2} = 5 \\implies 1+y = 10 \\implies y = 9$$\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $B$ are $(1,9)$ and the product of the coordinates is $1 \\times 9 = 9$.",
