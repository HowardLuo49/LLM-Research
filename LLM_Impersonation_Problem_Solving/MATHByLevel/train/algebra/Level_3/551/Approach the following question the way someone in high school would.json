    "solution": "The problem is asking for the sum of the integers from $-12$ to 3.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of integers from $-12$ to 3 is $3 - (-12) + 1 = 16$, so the sum is $(-12 + 3)/2 \\cdot 16 = \\boxed{-72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all the integers between -12.1 and 3.3, we need to first list out all the integers in that range. The integers between -12.1 and 3.3 are -12, -11, -10, ..., 2, 3. \n\nTo find the sum, we can add all these integers together. \n\n-12 + (-11) + (-10) + ... + 2 + 3 = -12 - 11 - 10 - ... + 2 + 3\n\nNow we can use the formula to find the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nS = n/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nIn this case, n = number of terms = 16 (from -12 to 3)\nfirst term = -12\nlast term = 3\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nS = 16/2 * (-12 + 3) = 8 * (-9) = -72\n\nSo, the sum of all the integers between -12.1 and 3.3 is -72.",
