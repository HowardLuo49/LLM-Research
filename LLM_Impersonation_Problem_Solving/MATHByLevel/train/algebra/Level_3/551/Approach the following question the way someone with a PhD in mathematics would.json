    "solution": "The problem is asking for the sum of the integers from $-12$ to 3.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of integers from $-12$ to 3 is $3 - (-12) + 1 = 16$, so the sum is $(-12 + 3)/2 \\cdot 16 = \\boxed{-72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all integers between -12.1 and 3.3, we first need to determine the range of integers within this interval. The integers between -12.1 and 3.3 are -12, -11, -10, ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. \n\nTo find the sum of this arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\ud835\udc46 = \ud835\udc5b/2 (\ud835\udc4e\u2081 + \ud835\udc4e\u2099),\nwhere \ud835\udc46 is the sum of the series, \ud835\udc5b is the number of terms in the series, \ud835\udc4e\u2081 is the first term, and \ud835\udc4e\u2099 is the last term.\n\nIn this case, the first term \ud835\udc4e\u2081 = -12 and the last term \ud835\udc4e\u2099 = 3. Therefore, \ud835\udc5b = 3 - (-12) + 1 = 16.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\ud835\udc46 = 16/2 (-12 + 3) = 8 (-9) = -72.\n\nThus, the sum of all integers between -12.1 and 3.3 is -72.",
