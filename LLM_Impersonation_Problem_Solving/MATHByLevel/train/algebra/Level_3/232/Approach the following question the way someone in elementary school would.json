    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",
    "gpt_response": "In the first 30 days, Jenna's bill grew by 1$\\%$, so she had to pay 1$\\%$ of $\\$400$ as a late charge. To find 1$\\%$ of a number, we divide it by 100, so 1$\\%$ of $\\$400$ is $\\$4$.\n\nSo, after the first 30 days, Jenna's bill was $\\$404$.\n\nAfter another 30 days, Jenna did not pay the bill again, so it increased by another 1$\\%$. To find 1$\\%$ of $\\$404$, we divide it by 100, so 1$\\%$ of $\\$404$ is $\\$4.04$.\n\nAdding this to Jenna's previous bill of $\\$404$, we get $\\$404 + \\$4.04 = \\$408.04$.\n\nTherefore, Jenna's bill is now $\\$408.04$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 408.04?: In the first 30 days, Jenna's bill grew by 1$\\%$, so she had to pay 1$\\%$ of $\\$400$ as a late charge.
