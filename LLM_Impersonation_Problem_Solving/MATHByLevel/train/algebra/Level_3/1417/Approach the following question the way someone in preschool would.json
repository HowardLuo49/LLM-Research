    "solution": "We can square $x + 4$ to get $x^2 + 8x + 16$, so the given equation becomes $x^2 + 8x - 1 = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 - 1 = (x + 4)^2 - 17 = 0$, which means $(x + 4)^2 = 17$.  We see that $b = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Scott has a big square equation with x's and stuff. He wants to make a smaller square with just x and a. So he adds a number to both sides of the equation so it looks like $(x + a)^2 = b$. Scott is very smart and knows that $b$ is the answer to a super hard math question!",
