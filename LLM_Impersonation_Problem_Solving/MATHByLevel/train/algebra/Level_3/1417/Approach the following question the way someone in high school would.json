    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When Scott completes the square on the quadratic $x^2 + 8x - 1 = 0$, he obtains an equation of the form $(x + a)^2 = b$.  What is $b$?",
    "solution": "We can square $x + 4$ to get $x^2 + 8x + 16$, so the given equation becomes $x^2 + 8x - 1 = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 - 1 = (x + 4)^2 - 17 = 0$, which means $(x + 4)^2 = 17$.  We see that $b = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $b$, we need to complete the square on the quadratic equation $x^2 + 8x - 1 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we move the constant term to the other side: $x^2 + 8x = 1$.\n\nNext, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $8/2 = 4$, and square it to get $4^2 = 16$.\n\nNow we add and subtract this value inside the parentheses: $x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16 = 1$.\n\nThis simplifies to $(x + 4)^2 = 17$.\n\nTherefore, $b = 17$.",
