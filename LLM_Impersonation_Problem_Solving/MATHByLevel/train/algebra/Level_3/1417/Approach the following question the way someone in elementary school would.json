    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When Scott completes the square on the quadratic $x^2 + 8x - 1 = 0$, he obtains an equation of the form $(x + a)^2 = b$.  What is $b$?",
    "solution": "We can square $x + 4$ to get $x^2 + 8x + 16$, so the given equation becomes $x^2 + 8x - 1 = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 - 1 = (x + 4)^2 - 17 = 0$, which means $(x + 4)^2 = 17$.  We see that $b = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to complete the square for the quadratic equation $x^2 + 8x - 1 = 0$. To do this, we take half of the coefficient of $x$ (which is 8) and square it. Half of 8 is 4, and $4^2$ is 16. \n\nNow, we add 16 to both sides of the equation:\n$$x^2 + 8x + 16 - 1 = 16$$\n$$(x + 4)^2 = 16$$\n\nSo, when Scott completes the square, he obtains an equation of the form $(x + 4)^2 = 16$. Therefore, $b$ is equal to 16.",
