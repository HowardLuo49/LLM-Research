    "solution": "The expression is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero, so we are looking for values of $x$ that satisfy $(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)=0$. This polynomial factors further as $(x-1)(x+3)(x-3)=0$, giving us the solutions $x=1$, $x=-3$ and $x=3$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ for which the expression is undefined.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many values of $x$ make the expression undefined, we need to look at the denominators in the expression. The expression has two denominators: $(x^2+2x-3)$ and $(x-3)$. \n\nFirst, let's look at $(x^2+2x-3)$. To make this denominator undefined, we need to set it equal to 0 and solve for $x$. \n\n$x^2+2x-3 = 0$\n\nNow, let's factor this quadratic equation: \n\n$(x+3)(x-1) = 0$\n\nThis means that the expression is undefined when $x=-3$ and $x=1$. \n\nNext, let's look at $(x-3)$.
