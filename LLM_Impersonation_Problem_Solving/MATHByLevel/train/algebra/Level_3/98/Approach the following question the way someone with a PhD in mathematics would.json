    "solution": "The expression is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero, so we are looking for values of $x$ that satisfy $(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)=0$. This polynomial factors further as $(x-1)(x+3)(x-3)=0$, giving us the solutions $x=1$, $x=-3$ and $x=3$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ for which the expression is undefined.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the values of $x$ for which the given expression is undefined, we must identify the values that would make the denominator equal to zero. In this case, the expression will be undefined when any of the factors in the denominator become zero. Therefore, we need to solve the following equations:\n\n1. $x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0$\n2. $x - 3 = 0$\n\nFor the first equation, we can factor the quadratic as $(x+3)(x-1) = 0$, so $x = -3$ or $x = 1$.\n\nFor the second equation, we find that $x=3$.\n\nTherefore, the expression is undefined for $x = -3, 1, 3$. In total, there are three values of $x$ for which the expression is undefined.",
