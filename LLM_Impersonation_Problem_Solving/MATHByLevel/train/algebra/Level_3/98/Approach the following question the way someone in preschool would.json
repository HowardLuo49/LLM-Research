    "solution": "The expression is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero, so we are looking for values of $x$ that satisfy $(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)=0$. This polynomial factors further as $(x-1)(x+3)(x-3)=0$, giving us the solutions $x=1$, $x=-3$ and $x=3$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ for which the expression is undefined.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, well to figure out how many values of $x$ make the expression undefined, we need to look at the denominator. The expression won't be defined if the denominator equals 0. So let's think about what values of $x$ would make the denominator $0$... Let's see... Oh I know! The denominator will equal $0$ when $x = 3$ or when $x$ makes the other part equal to $0$ which is $(x^2 + 2x - 3)$. So we need to find all the values of $x$ that make $(x^2 + 2x - 3)$ equal to $0$. \n\nHmm... let's think... maybe we can try some numbers for $x$ and see which ones make the expression equal to $0. Oh, I remember! We can use factoring to find the values of $x$ that make the expression $0$. So let's factor $(x^2 + 2x - 3)$ and set it equal to $0$ to find the values of $x$ that would make the denominator $0$.\n\nWow, this is really fun! Let's see how many values of $x$ we can find that make the expression undefined. So exciting!",
