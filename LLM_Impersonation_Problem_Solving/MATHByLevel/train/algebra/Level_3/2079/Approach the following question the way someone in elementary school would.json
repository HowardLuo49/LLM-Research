    "solution": "Since $r$ and $s$ vary inversely, $r\\cdot s$ must be a constant.  Thus $1200\\cdot .35 = s \\cdot 2400 \\Rightarrow s = \\frac{.35}2 = \\boxed{.175}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $s$ when $r$ is $2400$, we can set up a proportion. \n\nSince $r$ and $s$ vary inversely, we know that $r \\cdot s$ is constant.\n\nSo, when $r$ is 1200, $s$ is 0.35. We can write this as:\n\n$1200 \\cdot 0.35 = 2400 \\cdot s$\n\nNow we can solve for $s$:\n\n$420 = 2400s$\n\nDivide both sides by 2400:\n\n$s = \\frac{420}{2400} = 0.175$\n\nTherefore, when $r$ is 2400, $s$ is 0.175.",
