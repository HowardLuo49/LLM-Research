    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In the equation $|x-7| -3 = -2$, what is the product of all possible values of $x$?",
    "solution": "We rearrange the given equation to $|x-7| = 1$.  Thus either $x-7 = 1$, meaning $x = 8$, or $x-7 = -1$, meaning $x=6$.  Our answer is therefore $6\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{48}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the possible values of x, we first need to isolate the absolute value term. So we can start by adding 3 to both sides of the equation.\nWe get $|x-7| = 1$.\nNext, we split this into two separate equations: $x-7 = 1$ and $x-7 = -1$.\nSolving these, we get $x = 8$ and $x = 6$.\nSo the possible values of x are 8 and 6.\nNow, to find the product of these values, we simply multiply them: $8 * 6 = 48$.\nTherefore, the product of all possible values of x is 48.",
