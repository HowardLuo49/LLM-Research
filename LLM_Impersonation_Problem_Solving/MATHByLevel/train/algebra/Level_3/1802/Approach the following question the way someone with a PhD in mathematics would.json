    "solution": "We rearrange the given equation to $|x-7| = 1$.  Thus either $x-7 = 1$, meaning $x = 8$, or $x-7 = -1$, meaning $x=6$.  Our answer is therefore $6\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{48}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the equation $|x-7|-3=-2$, we first isolate the absolute value term by adding 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\n$|x-7| = 1$\n\nThis means that either $x-7 = 1$ or $x-7 = -1$. Solving for $x$ in each case, we get:\n\nCase 1: $x-7 = 1$\n$x = 7 + 1 = 8$\n\nCase 2: $x-7 = -1$\n$x = 7 - 1 = 6$\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $x$ are 8 and 6. The product of these two values is:\n\n$8*6 = 48$\n\nSo the product of all possible values of $x$ in the equation $|x-7|-3=-2$ is 48.",
