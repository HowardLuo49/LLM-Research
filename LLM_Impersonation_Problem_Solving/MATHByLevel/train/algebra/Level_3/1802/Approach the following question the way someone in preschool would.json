    "solution": "We rearrange the given equation to $|x-7| = 1$.  Thus either $x-7 = 1$, meaning $x = 8$, or $x-7 = -1$, meaning $x=6$.  Our answer is therefore $6\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{48}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! We have a funny looking equation with some numbers and letters. We need to find out what number 'x' could be to make everything equal. So let's have some fun and solve it!\n\nWe start by adding 3 to both sides of the equation to get rid of that pesky -3. Then we have $|x-7| = 1$. This means that whatever's inside the absolute value signs is either 1 away from 7 or -1 away from 7.\n\nThat means x could be 6 or 8! Let's multiply those two numbers together to find the product. 6 x 8 = 48!\n\nSo the product of all possible values of x in the equation $|x-7| -3 = -2$ is 48! Yay, we did it!",
