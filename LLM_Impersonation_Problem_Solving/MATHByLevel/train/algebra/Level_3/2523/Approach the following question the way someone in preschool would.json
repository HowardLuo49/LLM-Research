    "solution": "Since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, by definition $\\alpha\\beta = k$ for some constant $k$.  Plugging in, we see that $(-3)\\cdot (-6) = k$, so $k = 18$.  So when $\\beta = 8$, we have that $8\\alpha = 18$, or $\\alpha = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to draw a happy face to help us remember the question. Now, let's see the numbers that are given. When $\\beta = -6$, $\\alpha = -3$. And now we want to find $\\alpha$ when $\\beta = 8. Let's think...if $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, that means when $\\beta$ goes up, $\\alpha$ goes down, and vice versa! So when $\\beta$ goes from -6 to 8, it goes up, so $\\alpha$ should go down. Let's do some counting...if $\\beta$ goes up by 2, $\\alpha$ should go down by 1, since they are inversely proportional. So, since $\\beta$ is going up by 14 (from -6 to 8), $\\alpha$ should go down by 7 (since 14 divided by 2 is 7). So, if $\\alpha = -3$ when $\\beta = -6$, then $\\alpha$ should be $-3 - 7 = -10$ when $\\beta = 8$. Yay, we solved it! Let's color a picture to celebrate!",
