    "solution": "Since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, by definition $\\alpha\\beta = k$ for some constant $k$.  Plugging in, we see that $(-3)\\cdot (-6) = k$, so $k = 18$.  So when $\\beta = 8$, we have that $8\\alpha = 18$, or $\\alpha = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $\\alpha$ when $\\beta = 8$, I can set up a proportion using the relationship that $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$. \n\nFirst, I write out the relationship as $\\alpha \\beta = k$, where $k$ is a constant.\n\nGiven that when $\\alpha = -3$ and $\\beta = -6$, we have $-3 \\cdot -6 = k$, so $k = 18$.\n\nNow, I can set up the proportion:\n\n$-3 \\cdot -6 = \\alpha \\cdot 8$\n\n$18 = \\alpha \\cdot 8$\n\nDividing both sides by 8 gives $\\alpha = \\frac{18}{8} = \\frac{9}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, when $\\beta = 8$, $\\alpha = \\frac{9}{4}$.",
