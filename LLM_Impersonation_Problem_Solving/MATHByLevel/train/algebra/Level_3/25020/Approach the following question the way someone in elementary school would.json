We can do this by drawing a line from one point to the other and counting the squares along the way. \n\nFirst, we can count how many squares it takes to move from $3$ to $7$ horizontally. We can see that it takes $4$ squares.\n\nNext, we can count how many squares it takes to move from $-2$ to $5$ vertically. We can see that it takes $7$ squares.\n\nSo, the total distance between the points is $4 + 7 = 11$ units.",
