    "solution": "Cross-multiplying (which is the same as multiplying both sides by $r-2$ and by $r+1$) gives \\[(r+3)(r+1) = (r-1)(r-2).\\]Expanding the products on both sides gives  \\[r^2 + 3r + r + 3 = r^2 -r - 2r + 2.\\]which simplifies to $r^2 + 4r + 3 = r^2 - 3r + 2$. Subtracting $r^2$ from both sides and collecting terms gives $7r = -1$, so $r = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's see here. Um.. I see a bunch of r's in the fractions. Maybe we can try to find a way to make them match. Let's see.. if I put 2 in place of r, then the fraction on the left side would be $\\frac{2+3}{2-2} = \\frac{5}{0}$. Oh no! That's not right because we can't divide by zero. Let's try another number. How about 1? Then the left side would be $\\frac{1+3}{1-2} = \\frac{4}{-1}$. Hmm.. that's not equal to the fraction on the right side $\\frac{1-1}{1+1} = \\frac{0}{2}$. Oh! I know! Let's try another number. Let's try 3. Then the left side would be $\\frac{3+3}{3-2} = \\frac{6}{1}$. Yay! That's equal to the fraction on the right side $\\frac{3-1}{3+1} = \\frac{2}{4}$. So r = 3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{1}}$.  Yay! We did it!",
