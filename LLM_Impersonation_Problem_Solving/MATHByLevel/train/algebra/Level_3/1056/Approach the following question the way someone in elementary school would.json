    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The square of an integer is 182 greater than the integer itself. What is the sum of all integers for which this is true?",
    "solution": "Let our integer be $x$.  Then we have that $x^2 = 182 + x$, or $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this equation is just $-(-1) = \\boxed{1}$.  Note that we are given that one solution is an integer, and so the other one must be as well since they add to 1.\n\nNote that we can factor $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$ as $(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0$.  So the integers that work are 14 and $-13$, and their sum is $14 + (-13) = 1,$ as expected.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer, we need to solve the equation x^2 = x + 182. In order to do this, we must list out all of the integer values to see which ones match the equation. \n\nLet's start by listing out some integers and calculating their squares:\n\n1^2 = 1\n2^2 = 4\n3^2 = 9\n4^2 = 16\n5^2 = 25\n6^2 = 36\n7^2 = 49\n8^2 = 64\n9^2 = 81\n10^2 = 100\n11^2 = 121\n12^2 = 144\n13^2 = 169\n14^2 = 196\n15^2 = 225\n\nWhen we continue listing out squares, we see that 13^2 is equal to 169 and 13 + 182 is equal to 195.
