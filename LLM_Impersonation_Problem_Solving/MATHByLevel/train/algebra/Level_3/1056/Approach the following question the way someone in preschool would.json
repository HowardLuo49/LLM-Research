    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The square of an integer is 182 greater than the integer itself. What is the sum of all integers for which this is true?",
    "solution": "Let our integer be $x$.  Then we have that $x^2 = 182 + x$, or $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this equation is just $-(-1) = \\boxed{1}$.  Note that we are given that one solution is an integer, and so the other one must be as well since they add to 1.\n\nNote that we can factor $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$ as $(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0$.  So the integers that work are 14 and $-13$, and their sum is $14 + (-13) = 1,$ as expected.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We know that a square number is when you multiply a number by itself. So for this question, we need to find a number that when we multiply it by itself and then add 182, we get the same number back.\n\nLet's try some numbers: \n- If we try 1, 1 squared is 1, but adding 182 makes it 183, not 1.\n- If we try 2, 2 squared is 4, and adding 182 makes it 186, not 2.\n- If we try 3, 3 squared is 9, and adding 182 makes it 191, not 3.\n- If we try 4, 4 squared is 16, and adding 182 makes it 198, not 4.\n- If we try 5, 5 squared is 25, and adding 182 makes it 207, not 5.\n\nOh! I think I know. Let's try 13. \n- 13 squared is 169, and adding 182 makes it 351. But 13 is not the same as 351.\n\nCan you help me find the answer? What number should we try next to see if the square is 182 greater than the number itself? Let's keep trying until we find the right one.",
