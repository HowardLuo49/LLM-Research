    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The square of an integer is 182 greater than the integer itself. What is the sum of all integers for which this is true?",
    "solution": "Let our integer be $x$.  Then we have that $x^2 = 182 + x$, or $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this equation is just $-(-1) = \\boxed{1}$.  Note that we are given that one solution is an integer, and so the other one must be as well since they add to 1.\n\nNote that we can factor $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$ as $(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0$.  So the integers that work are 14 and $-13$, and their sum is $14 + (-13) = 1,$ as expected.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the integer as x. \nAccording to the given conditions, we have x^2 = x + 182. \nBy rearranging terms, we get x^2 - x - 182 = 0. \nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -1, and c = -182. \nUsing the quadratic formula, the solutions for x are x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. \nPlugging in the values, we get x = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 4*182)) / 2.\nCalculating the square root, we get x = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(729)) / 2 = (1 \u00b1 27) / 2. \nTherefore, the solutions for x are x = 14 and x = -13. \nThe sum of these integers is 14 + (-13) = 1. \nHence, the sum of all integers for which the given condition is true is 1.",
