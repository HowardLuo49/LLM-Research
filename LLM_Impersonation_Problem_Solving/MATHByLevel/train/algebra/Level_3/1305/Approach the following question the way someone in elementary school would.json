    "solution": "Distribute on the left-hand side and add 3 to both sides to obtain $3x^2-7x+3=0$.  Since it doesn't factor easily, we use the quadratic formula:  \\[\n\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{7^{2}-4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3}}{2\\cdot 3} = \\frac{7 \\pm\\sqrt{13}}{6}.\n\\] Since $7$, $13$, and $6$ are relatively prime, $m=7$, $n=13$, and $p=6$, so $m+n+p=7+13+6=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the solutions of $x(3x-7)=-3$. To do this, we need to expand the left side of the equation. So let's multiply $x$ by $3x$ and then by $-7$. \n\nExpanding, we get $3x^2 - 7x = -3$. This is a quadratic equation, so let's set it equal to 0: $3x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0$. \n\nWe can solve this equation by using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. \n\nIn this case, $a=3$, $b=-7$, and $c=3$. So plugging these values into the formula, we get $x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(3)(3)}}{2(3)}$. \n\nSolving further, we get $x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 36}}{6}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{6}$. So $m=7$, $n=13$, and $p=6$. \n\nFinally, adding $m$, $n$, and $p$ together we get $7 + 13 + 6 = \\boxed{26}$.",
