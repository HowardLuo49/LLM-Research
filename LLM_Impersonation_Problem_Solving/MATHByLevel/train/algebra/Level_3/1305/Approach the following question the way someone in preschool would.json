    "solution": "Distribute on the left-hand side and add 3 to both sides to obtain $3x^2-7x+3=0$.  Since it doesn't factor easily, we use the quadratic formula:  \\[\n\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{7^{2}-4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3}}{2\\cdot 3} = \\frac{7 \\pm\\sqrt{13}}{6}.\n\\] Since $7$, $13$, and $6$ are relatively prime, $m=7$, $n=13$, and $p=6$, so $m+n+p=7+13+6=\\boxed{26}$.",
