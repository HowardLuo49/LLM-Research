    "solution": "Since $g(a) = 3a-4$, the equation $g(a)=0$ means $3a-4=0$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find when $g(a)$ equals zero, we need to set $3a - 4$ equal to zero and solve for $a$. \n\n$3a - 4 = 0$\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\n$3a = 4$\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\n$a = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ that makes $g(a) = 0$ is $\\frac{4}{3}$.",
