    "solution": "Since $g(a) = 3a-4$, the equation $g(a)=0$ means $3a-4=0$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $a$ for which $g(a)=0$, we need to solve the equation $3a-4=0$. This simplifies to $3a=4$, and dividing by 3 gives $a=\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ for which $g(a)=0$ is $a=\\frac{4}{3}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{4?: To find the value of $a$ for which $g(a)=0$, we need to solve the equation $3a-4=0$. This simplifies to $3a=4$, and dividing by 3 gives $a=\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ for which $g(a)=0$ is $a=\\frac{4}{3}$.",
