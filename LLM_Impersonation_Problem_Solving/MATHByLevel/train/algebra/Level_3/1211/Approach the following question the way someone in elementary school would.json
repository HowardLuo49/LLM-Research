    "solution": "Since $g(a) = 3a-4$, the equation $g(a)=0$ means $3a-4=0$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find what number will make $g(a)$ equal to 0, we can plug in $a$ for $x in the function $g(x) = 3x - 4$. \n\nSo, we get $g(a) = 3a - 4$. \n\nTo find what $a$ is when $g(a) = 0$, we need to solve the equation $3a - 4 = 0$. \n\nTo solve this, we need to get $a$ by itself, so we can add 4 to both sides. \n\n$3a = 4$\n\nThen we divide by 3 to find $a$. \n\n$a = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\nTherefore, when $a = \\frac{4}{3}$, $g(a) = 0$.",
