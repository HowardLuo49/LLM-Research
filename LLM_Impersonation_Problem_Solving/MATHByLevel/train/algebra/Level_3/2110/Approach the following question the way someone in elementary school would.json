    "solution": "First, we find $p(1,-1)$. Since it falls into the otherwise category, $p(1,-1) = 3 \\cdot 1 - 1 = 2$.\n\nNext, we find $p(-5,-2)$. Since both numbers are negative, it follows that $p(-5,-2) = -5 - 2(-2) = -1$.\n\nThus, $p(p(1,-1),p(-5,-2)) = p(2,-1)$. This again falls into the otherwise category, and we find that $p(2,-1) = 3 \\cdot 2 - 1 = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out what $p(1,-1)$ is. Since $1 \\ge 0$ and $-1 < 0$, we use the formula $p(x,y) = x - 2y$ when $x < 0$ and $y < 0$. So, $p(1,-1) = 1 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nNext, let's find $p(-5,-2)$. Since $-5 < 0$ and $-2 < 0$, we use the formula $p(x,y) = x - 2y$ again. Thus, $p(-5,-2) = -5 - 2(-2) = -5 + 4 = -1$.\n\nNow, we need to find $p(3,-1)$. Since $3 \\ge 0$ and $-1 < 0$, we use the formula $p(x,y) = x - 2y$. Therefore, $p(3,-1) = 3 - 2(-1) = 3 + 2 = 5$.\n\nSo, $p(p(1,-1), p(-5,-2)) = p(3, -1) = 5$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
