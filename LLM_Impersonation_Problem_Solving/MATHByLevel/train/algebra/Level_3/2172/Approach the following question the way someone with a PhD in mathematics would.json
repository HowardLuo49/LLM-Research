    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For what value of $x$ does $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$, then $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$.  We can eliminate the $2x^2$ term from each side and solve $-5x+2=7x-4$ for $x$ to get $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$, we can utilize the properties of exponents. \n\nWe know that for any positive base $a$, $a^{b} = a^{c}$ implies that $b = c$.
