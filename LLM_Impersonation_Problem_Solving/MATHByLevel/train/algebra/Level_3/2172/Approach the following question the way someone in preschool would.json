    "solution": "If $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$, then $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$.  We can eliminate the $2x^2$ term from each side and solve $-5x+2=7x-4$ for $x$ to get $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see. We need to find a number for $x$ that makes both sides of the equation equal the same thing. I think if we put the two exponents equal to each other, we might find the right $x$ value. So we have $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$. Now let's see if we can solve for $x$.\n\nSubtracting $2x^{2}$ from both sides gives us $-5x+2 = 7x-4$. Now adding $5x$ to both sides gives us $2 = 12x-4$. Add 4 to both sides to get $6 = 12x$. Finally, divide by 12 to find $x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nYay we did it! Good job everyone!",
