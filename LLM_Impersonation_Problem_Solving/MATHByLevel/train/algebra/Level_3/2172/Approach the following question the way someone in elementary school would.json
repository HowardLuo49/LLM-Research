    "solution": "If $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$, then $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$.  We can eliminate the $2x^2$ term from each side and solve $-5x+2=7x-4$ for $x$ to get $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to remember that when the bases are the same (in this case, 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other to solve for x. \n\nSo we have:\n$2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$\n\nNext, we can simplify the equation:\n$-5x + 2 = 7x - 4$\n\nNow, let's isolate the x terms on one side of the equation:\n$7x + 5x = 4 + 2$\n$12x = 6$\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 12:\n$x = \\frac{6}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n\nTherefore, for the value of x that makes the two expressions equal, x must be $\\frac{1}{2}$.",
