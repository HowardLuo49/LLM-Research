    "solution": "If $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$, then $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$.  We can eliminate the $2x^2$ term from each side and solve $-5x+2=7x-4$ for $x$ to get $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first let's remember that when we have $a^{x} = a^{y}$, we know that $x = y$.\n\nSo in our case, we have $3^{2x^{2}-5x+2} = 3^{2x^{2}+7x-4}$.\n\nThis means that $2x^{2}-5x+2 = 2x^{2}+7x-4$.\n\nNow we just need to solve for $x$. Let's subtract $2x^{2}$ from both sides to get $-5x+2 = 7x-4$.\n\nNext, let's move all the $x$ terms to one side by subtracting $7x$ from both sides, giving us $-12x+2 = -4$.\n\nNow, let's add 4 to both sides to get $-12x = -2$.\n\nFinally, divide by -12 on both sides to get $x = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nSo, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
