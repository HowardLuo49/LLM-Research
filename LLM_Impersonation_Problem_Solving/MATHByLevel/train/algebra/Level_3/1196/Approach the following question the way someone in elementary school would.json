    "solution": "The only time this expression is not defined is when the denominator is equal to 0. In other words, we are looking for all solutions to the equation $x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$. We can find the roots by factoring the quadratic into $(x - 10)(x - 10) = 0$ or by using the quadratic formula: $$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2-4(1)(100)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we see that $x = 10$ is the only time when the denominator of our expression is equal to 0. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{10}$.",
