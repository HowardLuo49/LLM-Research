    "solution": "The only time this expression is not defined is when the denominator is equal to 0. In other words, we are looking for all solutions to the equation $x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$. We can find the roots by factoring the quadratic into $(x - 10)(x - 10) = 0$ or by using the quadratic formula: $$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2-4(1)(100)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we see that $x = 10$ is the only time when the denominator of our expression is equal to 0. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. To find out when this expression is not defined, we need to think about what would make the denominator equal to zero. So, if we set the denominator $x^2 - 20x + 100$ equal to zero and solve for $x$, we can find the value that makes the expression not defined. Let's do it together!\n\n$x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$\n\nNow, let's solve for $x$. We can factor this trinomial into $(x-10)(x-10)=0$, since $10 \\times 10 = 100$ and $10 + 10 = 20$.\n\nSo, $x-10=0$ which means $x=10$.\n\nYay, we did it!
