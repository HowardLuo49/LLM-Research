    "solution": "To solve for the $x$-intercept, we let $y$ equal 0, and then solve for the value of $x$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n0-4&=4(x-8)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -1&=(x-8)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7&=x\n\\end{align*} Similarly, let $x$ equal 0, and solve for the $y$-intercept: \\begin{align*}\ny-4&=4(0-8)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y-4&=-32\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=-28\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the sum of the $x$ and $y$ intercepts is $7+(-28)=\\boxed{-21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $x$-intercept, we set $y$ to be zero in the equation. So, we have $0-4=4(x-8)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $-4=4x-32$, which reduces to $4x=28$ and $x=7$. Therefore, the $x$-intercept is 7.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we set $x$ to be zero in the equation. So, we have $y-4=4(0-8)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $y-4=-32$, which reduces to $y=-28$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept is -28.\n\nTo find the sum of the $x$-intercept and $y$-intercept, we add 7 and -28.
