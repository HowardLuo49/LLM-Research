    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The midpoint of a line segment is located at $(1, -2)$. If one of the endpoints is $(4, 5)$, what is the other endpoint? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "solution": "The $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the midpoint are the averages of the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of the endpoints, respectively.  Since $4-3=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $1-3=-2$.  Since $5-7=-2$, the $y$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $-2-7=-9$.  Therefore, the endpoints are $(4,5)$ and $\\boxed{(-2,-9)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that the midpoint is at $(1, -2)$ and one of the endpoints is at $(4, 5)$. To find the other endpoint, we can use the midpoint formula.\n\nThe midpoint formula is: \nMidpoint = ($\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}$, $\\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}$)\n\nLet's call the other endpoint $(x, y)$.\nWe know that the midpoint is $(1, -2)$, one endpoint is $(4, 5)$, and the other endpoint is $(x, y)$.\n\nUsing the midpoint formula, we can plug in the known values:\n(1, -2) = ($\\frac{4 + x}{2}$, $\\frac{5 + y}{2}$)\n\nNow we can solve for $x$ and $y$:\n$\\frac{4 + x}{2} = 1$  and  $\\frac{5 + y}{2} = -2$\n\nSolving the first equation, we get:\n$4 + x = 2$\n$x = -2$\n\nSolving the second equation, we get:\n$5 + y = -4$\n$y = -9$\n\nSo the other endpoint is at $(-2, -9)$.\n\nTherefore, the other endpoint is $(-2, -9)$.",
