    "solution": "The $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the midpoint are the averages of the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of the endpoints, respectively.  Since $4-3=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $1-3=-2$.  Since $5-7=-2$, the $y$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $-2-7=-9$.  Therefore, the endpoints are $(4,5)$ and $\\boxed{(-2,-9)}$.",

So let's try to figure out the other endpoint.\n\nTo find the midpoint of a line segment, you need to find the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two endpoints. So let's add the x-coordinates together and divide by 2. \n\nFirst, let's add the x-coordinates: 1 + 4 = 5. Then, divide by 2: 5/2 = 2.5. \n\nNext, let's add the y-coordinates: -2 + 5 = 3. Then, divide by 2: 3/2 = 1.5. \n\nSo the other endpoint is at (2.5,1.5). Yay, we did it!",
