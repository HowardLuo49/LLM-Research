    "solution": "32000 bacteria is $32000/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish. Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number. Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\\cdot6=\\boxed{24}$ hours.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. Let \\(t\\) be the number of hours it takes for the bacteria to reach a count of 32,000.\n\nThe exponential growth formula is given by \\(N(t) = N_0 \\times 2^{t/h}\\), where \\(N(t)\\) is the number of bacteria at time \\(t\\), \\(N_0\\) is the initial number of bacteria, and \\(h\\) is the doubling time.\n\nGiven that the bacteria double every four hours, we have \\(h = 4\\) hours, \\(N_0 = 500\\), and we want to find \\(t\\) when \\(N(t) = 32,000\\).\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\\[\n32000 = 500 \\times 2^{t/4}\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 500:\n\\[\n64 = 2^{t/4}\n\\]\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides:\n\\[\n\\log(64) = \\log(2^{t/4})\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\log(64) = (t/4) \\times \\log(2)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(t\\):\n\\[\nt = 4 \\times \\frac{\\log(64)}{\\log(2)} \\approx 24\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there will be exactly 32,000 bacteria in the lab dish in approximately 24 hours.",
