    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The bacteria in a lab dish double in number every four hours. If 500 bacteria cells are in the dish now, in how many hours will there be exactly 32,000 bacteria?",
    "solution": "32000 bacteria is $32000/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish. Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number. Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\\cdot6=\\boxed{24}$ hours.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for exponential growth: N = N0 * 2^(t/r), where N is the final number of bacteria, N0 is the initial number of bacteria, t is the time in hours, and r is the rate of growth.\n\nIn this case, N0 = 500, N = 32,000, and r = 4 hours. We need to find t.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n32,000 = 500 * 2^(t/4)\n\nDivide both sides by 500:\n\n64 = 2^(t/4)\n\nNext, we can rewrite 64 as a power of 2, which is 2^6:\n\n2^6 = 2^(t/4)\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n6 = t/4\n\nTo solve for t, we multiply both sides by 4:\n\nt = 24\n\nSo, it will take 24 hours for there to be exactly 32,000 bacteria in the dish.",
