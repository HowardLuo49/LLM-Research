    "solution": "32000 bacteria is $32000/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish. Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number. Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\\cdot6=\\boxed{24}$ hours.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's think about this problem. Right now, we have 500 bacteria cells in the dish. And every four hours, the number of bacteria doubles. So, after four hours, we will have 1000 bacteria cells, after eight hours we will have 2000 bacteria cells, after twelve hours we will have 4000 bacteria cells, and after sixteen hours we will have 8000 bacteria cells.\n\nSo, we need to figure out how many four-hour periods it will take for the number of bacteria to reach 32,000. So, let's keep doubling the number of bacteria cells: after twenty hours we will have 16,000 bacteria cells, after twenty-four hours we will have 32,000 bacteria cells.\n\nTherefore, it will take 24 hours for the number of bacteria cells to reach 32,000.",
