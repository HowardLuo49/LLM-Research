Sarah is trying to fence a rectangular area containing at least 100 sq. ft while using the least amount of material to build the fence. The length of the rectangular area should be 15 ft longer than the width. What should the width, in ft, be?",
    "solution": "We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\\ge100$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$. We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq. ft is $\\boxed{5}$ ft.",
    "gpt_response": "In preschool, we can pretend that we are building a fence for our toy farm! Let's imagine that we have a toy farm that we want to fence in to keep all our toy animals safe.\n\nFirst, we need to figure out how big our rectangular area should be. Sarah wants it to have at least 100 sq. ft, so we need to make sure it's big enough for all of our toy animals to have room to play.\n\nTo find out how big our rectangular area should be, we need to figure out the length and width. The length should be 15 ft longer than the width.\n\nLet's start by picking a width for our fence. Let's say the width is 5 ft. If the length is 15 ft longer, then the length would be 5 ft + 15 ft = 20 ft.\n\nTo calculate the area of our rectangular fence, we multiply the length by the width. So, 5 ft x 20 ft = 100 sq. ft.\n\nSince our fence needs to be at least 100 sq. ft, it looks like our width of 5 ft is just right! Our toy farm will have plenty of room for all of our toy animals to play. Yay!",
