    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Sarah is trying to fence a rectangular area containing at least 100 sq. ft while using the least amount of material to build the fence. The length of the rectangular area should be 15 ft longer than the width. What should the width, in ft, be?",
    "solution": "We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\\ge100$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$. We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq. ft is $\\boxed{5}$ ft.",
    "gpt_response": "To minimize the amount of material needed for the fence, we need to minimize the perimeter of the rectangular area. Let the width of the rectangular area be represented by w ft. Since the length of the rectangular area is 15 ft longer than the width, the length can be represented as w + 15 ft.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.\n\nGiven that the area should be at least 100 sq. ft, we have the equation:\n\nw * (w + 15) \u2265 100\nw^2 + 15w \u2265 100\nw^2 + 15w - 100 \u2265 0\n\nTo minimize the amount of material used, we need to find the width that results in the smallest perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2l + 2w = 2(w + 15) + 2w = 4w + 30.\n\nDifferentiating the perimeter with respect to w to find the critical points, we get:\n\ndP/dw = 4\nSetting this to zero, we get:\n\n4 = 0\nThis equation has no solutions, so the perimeter is not minimized at a critical point. We can conclude that we should look for a minimum in the interval [0, \u221e).\n\nTo find the minimum width, we can use the quadratic formula to solve w^2 + 15w - 100 = 0:\n\nw = [-15 \u00b1 sqrt((15)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-100))] / 2\nw = [-15 \u00b1 sqrt(225 + 400)] / 2\nw = [-15 \u00b1 sqrt(625)] / 2\nw = [-15 \u00b1 25] / 2\n\nThis gives us two possible widths:\n\nw = 5 ft (discard this since it results in a negative length)\nw = 20 ft\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangular area should be 20 ft to use the least amount of material for the fence.",
