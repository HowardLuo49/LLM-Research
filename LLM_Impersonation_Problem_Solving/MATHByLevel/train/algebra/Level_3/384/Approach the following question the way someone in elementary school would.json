    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Sarah is trying to fence a rectangular area containing at least 100 sq. ft while using the least amount of material to build the fence. The length of the rectangular area should be 15 ft longer than the width. What should the width, in ft, be?",
    "solution": "We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\\ge100$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$. We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq. ft is $\\boxed{5}$ ft.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the width of the rectangular area, we need to figure out the dimensions that will make the perimeter of the fence the smallest. Let's call the width \"w\" and the length \"w + 15\". \n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up all four sides, so the perimeter in this case would be:\nP = 2w + 2(w + 15)\n\nSince we want the total area to be at least 100 sq. ft, the area of the rectangle is:\nA = w(w + 15) >= 100\n\nTo find the minimum amount of material needed for the fence, we can use the equation:\nMaterial = 2w + 2(w + 15)\n\nNow we can solve for the width by substituting the value of w from the area equation into the material equation and finding the minimum value that makes the area at least 100 sq. ft. \n\nLet's solve for w by setting the area equal to 100 sq. ft:\nw(w + 15) = 100\nw^2 + 15w - 100 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that the width, w, should be 5 ft. \n\nSo, the width of the rectangular area should be 5 ft to use the least amount of material to build the fence and have at least 100 sq. ft of area.",
