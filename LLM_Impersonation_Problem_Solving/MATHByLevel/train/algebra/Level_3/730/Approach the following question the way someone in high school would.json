    "solution": "Clearly $C$ must be the midpoint of $AB$ if $C$ is the closest point to both $A$ and $B.$ Using the midpoint formula, we see that: $$\\left(\\frac{1 + x}{2}, \\frac{8 + y}{2}\\right) = \\left(3, 5\\right).$$Therefore, $\\frac{1 + x}{2} = 3$, so $x = 5.$ Meanwhile, $\\frac{8 + y}{2} = 5$, so $y = 2$. Our answer is $xy = \\boxed{10}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the midpoint of $AB,$ we can use the midpoint formula which is $C = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right).$ \n\nGiven that $C = (3, 5),$ $A = (1, 8),$ and $B = (x, y),$ we can set up the following equations:\n\n$$3 = \\frac{1 + x}{2}$$\n$$5 = \\frac{8 + y}{2}$$\n\nSolving for $x$ in the first equation, we get $x = 5.$\nSolving for $y$ in the second equation, we get $y = 2.$\n\nTherefore, $xy = 5 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{10}.$",
