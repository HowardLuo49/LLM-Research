    "solution": "Clearly $C$ must be the midpoint of $AB$ if $C$ is the closest point to both $A$ and $B.$ Using the midpoint formula, we see that: $$\\left(\\frac{1 + x}{2}, \\frac{8 + y}{2}\\right) = \\left(3, 5\\right).$$Therefore, $\\frac{1 + x}{2} = 3$, so $x = 5.$ Meanwhile, $\\frac{8 + y}{2} = 5$, so $y = 2$. Our answer is $xy = \\boxed{10}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the coordinates of point $B.$ Since $C$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ we can find the average of the $x$-coordinates and the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ to get the coordinates of $C.$ \n\nThe $x$-coordinate of $C$ is the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B,$ so it is $\\frac{1 + x}{2} = 3.$ Solving for $x,$ we have $1 + x = 6$ and $x = 5.$ \n\nThe $y$-coordinate of $C$ is the average of the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B,$ so it is $\\frac{8 + y}{2} = 5.$ Solving for $y,$ we have $8 + y = 10$ and $y = 2.$ \n\nSo, the coordinates of $B$ are $(5, 2),$ and the value of $xy$ is $5 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{10}.$",
