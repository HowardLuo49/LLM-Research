    "solution": "Clearly $C$ must be the midpoint of $AB$ if $C$ is the closest point to both $A$ and $B.$ Using the midpoint formula, we see that: $$\\left(\\frac{1 + x}{2}, \\frac{8 + y}{2}\\right) = \\left(3, 5\\right).$$Therefore, $\\frac{1 + x}{2} = 3$, so $x = 5.$ Meanwhile, $\\frac{8 + y}{2} = 5$, so $y = 2$. Our answer is $xy = \\boxed{10}.$",
