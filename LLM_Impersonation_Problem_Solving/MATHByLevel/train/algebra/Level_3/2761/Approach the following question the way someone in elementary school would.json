    "solution": "Simplify both equations by dividing by 3: \\begin{align*}\n4x + 7y &= 5 \\\\\n7x + 4y &= 17.\n\\end{align*} We solve this system using the elimination method.  Multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by $-4$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n28x + 49y &= 35 \\\\\n-28x -16y &= -68.\n\\end{align*} Adding the equations gives $33y=-33$, so $y=-1$.  Substituting $y=-1$ into either equation and solving, we get $x=3$.  Therefore, $(x,y)=\\boxed{(3,-1)}$.",
