If a player rolls $n$, she is awarded $f(n)$ points, where  \\[f(n) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl} 6 & \\text{ if }n\\text{ is a multiple of 2 and 3}, \\\\\n2 & \\text{ if }n\\text{ is only a multiple of 2}, \\\\\n0 & \\text{ if }n\\text{ is not a multiple of 2}.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]Allie rolls the die four times and gets a 5, 4, 1, and 2. Betty rolls and gets 6, 3, 3, and 2. What is the product of Allie's total points and Betty's total points?",
    "solution": "For Allie, 5 and 1 get her no points since they are not multiples of 2, while 4 and 2 are multiples of 2 and each get her 2 points for a total of 4 points. For Betty, 3 and 3 get her no points, 2 gets her 2 points, and 6 is a multiple of 2 and 3, so it gets her 6 points. So, Betty has a total of 8 points and the product of Allie and Betty's total points is $4\\cdot8=\\boxed{32}$.",
