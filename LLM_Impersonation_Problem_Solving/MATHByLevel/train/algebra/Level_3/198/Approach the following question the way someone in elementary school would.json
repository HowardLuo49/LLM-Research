    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The sum of three consecutive one-digit, positive, odd integers is one-seventh of the product of the same three integers. What is the middle integer when the three integers are listed in ascending order?",
    "solution": "Represent the three integers as $n-2$, $n$, and $n+2$, where $n$ is the middle integer.  The problem states that  \\[\nn(n-2)(n+2)=7(n+(n+2)+(n-2)),\n\\] which simplifies to $(n-2)(n+2)=21$.  Since $7\\cdot3$ and $21\\cdot1$ are the only representations of 21 as a product of two positive integers, we see that $n-2=3$ and $n+2=7$ which implies $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to think about what one-digit, positive, odd integers are. That means the numbers we're looking at are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. \n\nNext, we know that the sum of these three numbers is equal to one-seventh of the product of the three numbers. That means if we add up the three numbers, it will be the same as if we multiplied them all together and then divided by 7. \n\nLet's try out one set of numbers and see if it works. Let's say we use the numbers 3, 5, and 7. \nSum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\nProduct: 3 x 5 x 7 = 105\nOne-seventh of the product: 105 / 7 = 15 \n\nIt works! The sum of the numbers is equal to one-seventh of the product. \n\nSo the middle number in this case is 5. So when the three numbers are listed in ascending order, the middle number is 5. \n\nWe could also try out the other sets of numbers to double check, but I think we got it right with 3, 5, and 7.",
