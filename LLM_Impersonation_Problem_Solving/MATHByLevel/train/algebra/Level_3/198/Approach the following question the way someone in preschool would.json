    "solution": "Represent the three integers as $n-2$, $n$, and $n+2$, where $n$ is the middle integer.  The problem states that  \\[\nn(n-2)(n+2)=7(n+(n+2)+(n-2)),\n\\] which simplifies to $(n-2)(n+2)=21$.  Since $7\\cdot3$ and $21\\cdot1$ are the only representations of 21 as a product of two positive integers, we see that $n-2=3$ and $n+2=7$ which implies $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use our fingers to find the answer! We know that the three numbers are odd and one-digit. So let's start with the smallest odd one-digit number, which is 1. \n\nIf we add the next odd one-digit number, which is 3, we get 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nAnd if we add the third odd one-digit number, which is 5, we get 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. \n\nNow, let's see if this sum is one-seventh of the product of the three numbers. The product of 1, 3, and 5 is 1 x 3 x 5 = 15. \n\nIs 9 equal to 1/7 of 15? Let's divide 15 by 7. \n\n15 divided by 7 is equal to 2 with a remainder of 1. This means that 9 is not equal to 1/7 of 15.\n\nSince the sum of the three numbers is not equal to one-seventh of the product, we need to try a different set of three consecutive odd one-digit numbers. Let's try 3, 5, and 7 instead. \n\n3 + 5 + 7 = 15, which is the same product of the three numbers. \n\nSo, when the three numbers are listed in ascending order, the middle integer is 5. Yay, we found the answer!",
