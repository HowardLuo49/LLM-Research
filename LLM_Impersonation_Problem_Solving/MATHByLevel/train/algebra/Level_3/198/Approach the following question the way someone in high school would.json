    "solution": "Represent the three integers as $n-2$, $n$, and $n+2$, where $n$ is the middle integer.  The problem states that  \\[\nn(n-2)(n+2)=7(n+(n+2)+(n-2)),\n\\] which simplifies to $(n-2)(n+2)=21$.  Since $7\\cdot3$ and $21\\cdot1$ are the only representations of 21 as a product of two positive integers, we see that $n-2=3$ and $n+2=7$ which implies $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's say the three consecutive one-digit, positive, odd integers are x, x+2, and x+4.\n\nAccording to the question, the sum of these three integers is equal to one-seventh of the product of the same three integers. So, we can write the equation as:\n\nx + (x+2) + (x+4) = (x)(x+2)(x+4)/7\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n3x + 6 = (x^3 + 6x^2 + 8x)/7\n\n21x + 42 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 8x\n\nRearrange the terms and simplify further:\n\nx^3 + 6x^2 - 13x - 42 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the middle integer when these three integers are listed in ascending order. To do that, we first need to find the values of x, x+2, and x+4 which satisfy the above equation.\n\nAfter solving the equation, the values of x that satisfy the equation are x=5, x=-3, and x=-7. Since we are looking for positive integers, we can ignore x=-3 and x=-7.\n\nTherefore, the only positive value of x is 5. So, the three consecutive one-digit, positive, odd integers are 5, 7, and 9. In ascending order, the middle integer is 7.",
