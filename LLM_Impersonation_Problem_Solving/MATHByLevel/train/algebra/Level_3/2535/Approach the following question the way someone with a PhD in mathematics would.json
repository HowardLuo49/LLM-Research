    "solution": "Since $46=2\\cdot23$ and $115=5\\cdot23$, we can factor a $23x^3$ from the expression, to get \\[46x^3-115x^7=23x^3(2-5x^4)=\\boxed{-23x^3(5x^4-2)},\\] which is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To factor the polynomial $46x^3-115x^7$, we can first factor out the greatest common factor, which is $x^3$. This gives us:\n\n$46x^3-115x^7 = x^3(46-115x^4)$\n\nNext, we can factor the expression $46-115x^4$ further by recognizing that it is a difference of squares. We can rewrite $46-115x^4$ as $(2\\sqrt{23})^2 - (5x^2)^2$.
