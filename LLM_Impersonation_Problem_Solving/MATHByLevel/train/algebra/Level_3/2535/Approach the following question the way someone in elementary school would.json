    "solution": "Since $46=2\\cdot23$ and $115=5\\cdot23$, we can factor a $23x^3$ from the expression, to get \\[46x^3-115x^7=23x^3(2-5x^4)=\\boxed{-23x^3(5x^4-2)},\\] which is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To factor 46x^3 - 115x^7, we need to find the greatest common factor of the two terms.\n\nThe greatest common factor of 46 and 115 is 23.\n\nThe greatest common factor of x^3 and x^7 is x^3.\n\nSo the greatest common factor of 46x^3 and 115x^7 is 23x^3.\n\nTherefore, we can factor out 23x^3 from both terms to get:\n\n23x^3(2 - 5x^4)\n\nSo, the factored form of 46x^3 - 115x^7 is 23x^3(2 - 5x^4).",
