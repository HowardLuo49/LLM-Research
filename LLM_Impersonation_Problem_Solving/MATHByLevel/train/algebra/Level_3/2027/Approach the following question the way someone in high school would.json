    "solution": "Notice that if we add $x(x+y)$ and $y(x+y)$, we can factor out a term of $(x+y)$ to obtain $x(x+y) + y(x+y) = (x+y)(x+y)$. Thus, $(x+y)^2 = x(x+y) + y(x+y)$, so $(x+y)^2 = 27 + 54 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the two equations given to us. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can expand $x(x+y)$ to get $x^2 + xy = 27$. \n\nFrom the second equation, we can expand $y(x+y)$ to get $xy + y^2 = 54$. \n\nNext, we can add these two equations together: \n$(x^2 + xy) + (xy + y^2) = 27 + 54$ \n$x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 81$ \n$(x+y)^2 = 81$ \n\nSo, the value of $(x+y)^2$ is 81.",
