    "solution": "Notice that if we add $x(x+y)$ and $y(x+y)$, we can factor out a term of $(x+y)$ to obtain $x(x+y) + y(x+y) = (x+y)(x+y)$. Thus, $(x+y)^2 = x(x+y) + y(x+y)$, so $(x+y)^2 = 27 + 54 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we can simplify the given equations by expanding the expressions:\n\n1. $x (x+y) = 27$\n  $x^2 + xy = 27$\n2. $y (x+y) = 54$\n  $xy + y^2 = 54$\n\nNext, we can add these two equations together:\n\n$x^2 + xy + xy + y^2 = 27 + 54$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 81$\n\nNow, we notice that the left side of the equation is actually $(x+y)^2$, so:\n$(x+y)^2 = 81$\n\nTherefore, the value of $(x+y)^2$ is 81.",
