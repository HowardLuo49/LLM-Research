    "solution": "Since $f(n)=n^2$ is a monotonically increasing function (on the set of positive integers), we can find the least and greatest integer solutions and count the integers between them.  Since $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225$, $n=15$ is the smallest solution.  Since $30^2=900$, $n=29$ is the largest solution.  There are $29-15+1=\\boxed{15}$ integers between 15 and 29 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many numbers are between 200 and 900, we need to find the square roots of the two numbers. \n\nThe square root of 200 is about 14.14, which means the smallest number could be 15. The square root of 900 is 30. \n\nSo, the numbers that work are 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. \n\nThere are 14 numbers that work, so the answer is 14.",
