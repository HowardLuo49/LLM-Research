    "solution": "Since $f(n)=n^2$ is a monotonically increasing function (on the set of positive integers), we can find the least and greatest integer solutions and count the integers between them.  Since $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225$, $n=15$ is the smallest solution.  Since $30^2=900$, $n=29$ is the largest solution.  There are $29-15+1=\\boxed{15}$ integers between 15 and 29 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers $n$ that satisfy $200 < n^2 < 900$, we first need to think about what it means for a number to be a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 9 is a perfect square because 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nWe know that $200 < n^2 < 900$, so we want to find the perfect squares that fall within this range. The perfect squares less than 200 are 1^2 = 1, 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, and so on, up to 14^2 = 196. The perfect squares greater than 900 are 31^2 = 961, 32^2 = 1024, 33^2 = 1089, and so forth.\n\nTherefore, the positive integers $n$ that satisfy $200 < n^2 < 900$ are the integers $\\{15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29\\}$. There are 15 positive integers $n$ that satisfy this condition.",
