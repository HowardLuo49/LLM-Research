    "solution": "Since $f(n)=n^2$ is a monotonically increasing function (on the set of positive integers), we can find the least and greatest integer solutions and count the integers between them.  Since $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225$, $n=15$ is the smallest solution.  Since $30^2=900$, $n=29$ is the largest solution.  There are $29-15+1=\\boxed{15}$ integers between 15 and 29 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We need to find numbers that are between 200 and 900 when we square them. \n\nFor example, when we square 10, we get 100 which is too small. But when we square 15, we get 225 which is between 200 and 900. \n\nLet's try some more numbers: 16 squared is 256, 17 squared is 289, 18 squared is 324, and 19 squared is 361. Those are all between 200 and 900!\n\nSo, the positive integers that satisfy $200 < n^2 < 900$ are 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. That makes 5 numbers in total! Great job counting, friends!",
