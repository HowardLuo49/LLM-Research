    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The equation of the line that passes through the points $(-3,5)$ and $(0,-4)$ can be expressed in the form $y=mx+b$. What is the value of $m+b$?",
    "solution": "Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement.  Thus $(-3, 5)$ gives us $5 = -3m + b$ and $(0, -4)$ gives us $-4 = b$.  So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $5 = -3m - 4$.  So $m = -3$ and $m + b = \\boxed{-7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the line passing through the points $(-3,5)$ and $(0,-4)$, we first need to find the slope ($m$) of the line. \n\nThe formula for slope is $m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)$, where $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\n\nHere, $x1 = -3, y1 = 5, x2 = 0,$ and $y2 = -4$.\n\nSo, $m = (-4 - 5)/(0 - (-3)) = -9/3 =  -3$.\n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use one of the points to find the y-intercept ($b$) of the line. Let's use the point $(-3,5)$:\n\n$5 = -3*(-3) + b$\n\n$5 = 9 + b$\n\n$b = -4$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $y = -3x - 4$.\n\nTo find $m + b$, we add $m = -3$ and $b = -4$:\n\n$m + b = -3 + (-4) =  -7$.\n\nHence, the value of $m + b$ is $-7$.",
