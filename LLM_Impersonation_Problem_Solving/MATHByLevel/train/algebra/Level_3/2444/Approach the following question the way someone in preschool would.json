    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The equation of the line that passes through the points $(-3,5)$ and $(0,-4)$ can be expressed in the form $y=mx+b$. What is the value of $m+b$?",
    "solution": "Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement.  Thus $(-3, 5)$ gives us $5 = -3m + b$ and $(0, -4)$ gives us $-4 = b$.  So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $5 = -3m - 4$.  So $m = -3$ and $m + b = \\boxed{-7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of m+b, we first need to find the values of m and b. \n\nTo find m, we can use the formula for the slope of a line: m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). \n\nLet's label our points: \nx1 = -3, y1 = 5\nx2 = 0, y2 = -4\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula: \nm = (-4 - 5)/(0 - (-3))\nm = (-9)/(3)\nm = -3\n\nNext, we can find b by plugging in one of the points into the equation y = mx + b.
