    "solution": "Since the following inequalities are true, \\[\\sqrt{1}<\\sqrt{2}<\\sqrt{4} \\Rightarrow 1<\\sqrt{2}<2\\]\\[\\sqrt{16}<\\sqrt{22}<\\sqrt{25} \\Rightarrow 4<\\sqrt{22}<5\\]\\[\\sqrt{196}<\\sqrt{222}<\\sqrt{225} \\Rightarrow 14<\\sqrt{222}<15\\]the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ is $2$, the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{22}$ is $5$, and the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{222}$ is $15$. Therefore, $2+5+15=\\boxed{22}$.",
    "gpt_response": "I like numbers! Let's figure out what the answer is. \n\nFirst, let's think about the square root of each number: \n- The square root of 2 is about 1.41, so the number above 1.41 is 2. \n- The square root of 22 is about 4.69, so the number above 4.69 is 5. \n- The square root of 222 is about 14.9, so the number above 14.9 is 15. \n\nNow, let's add up those numbers: \n2 (from $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{2}\\,\\right\\rceil$) + 5 (from $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{22}\\,\\right\\rceil$) + 15 (from $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{222}\\,\\right\\rceil$) = 22.\n\nSo, the answer is 22!
