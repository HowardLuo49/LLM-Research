    "solution": "Since the following inequalities are true, \\[\\sqrt{1}<\\sqrt{2}<\\sqrt{4} \\Rightarrow 1<\\sqrt{2}<2\\]\\[\\sqrt{16}<\\sqrt{22}<\\sqrt{25} \\Rightarrow 4<\\sqrt{22}<5\\]\\[\\sqrt{196}<\\sqrt{222}<\\sqrt{225} \\Rightarrow 14<\\sqrt{222}<15\\]the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ is $2$, the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{22}$ is $5$, and the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{222}$ is $15$. Therefore, $2+5+15=\\boxed{22}$.",
