    "solution": "First we have to solve for $k$ where $3\\sqrt{2}=k\\cdot81^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.  Since $81^{\\frac{1}{4}}=3$, we have $3\\sqrt{2}=k\\cdot3$, so $k = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWhen $x=4$, we have$$y=k\\cdot4^{\\frac{1}{4}}=k\\cdot\\sqrt{2}.$$Since $k=\\sqrt{2}$, we have $$y=\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{2}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "First, I see the equation $y=kx^{\\frac{1}{4}}$. So that means $y$ equals some number ($k$) times $x$ raised to the power of one-fourth. \n\nNext, it says $y=3\\sqrt{2}$ when $x=81$. That means $y$ is equal to $3\\sqrt{2}$ when $x$ is $81$. \n\nNow we need to find the value of $y$ when $x=4$. We can use what we know about the relationship between $y$ and $x$ when $x=81 to help us. \n\nWhen $x=81$, $y=3\\sqrt{2}$. So let's plug in $x=81$ and $y=3\\sqrt{2}$ into the equation $y=kx^{\\frac{1}{4}}$ to find $k$. \n\n$3\\sqrt{2}=k(81)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n\nNow we solve for $k$ by finding the fourth root of $81$ and then dividing $3\\sqrt{2}$ by that number. \n\nFirst, the fourth root of $81$ is $3$ because $3*3*3*3=81$. \n\nThen we divide $3\\sqrt{2}$ by $3$ to find $k$. So $k=\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nNow that we know $k$, we can find the value of $y$ when $x=4$. \n\n$y=k(4)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n\n$y=\\sqrt{2}(4)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$\n\n$y=\\sqrt{2}*2$\n\n$y=2\\sqrt{2}$\n\nSo when $x=4$, $y=2\\sqrt{2}$.",
