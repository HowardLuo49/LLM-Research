    "solution": "First we have to solve for $k$ where $3\\sqrt{2}=k\\cdot81^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.  Since $81^{\\frac{1}{4}}=3$, we have $3\\sqrt{2}=k\\cdot3$, so $k = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWhen $x=4$, we have$$y=k\\cdot4^{\\frac{1}{4}}=k\\cdot\\sqrt{2}.$$Since $k=\\sqrt{2}$, we have $$y=\\sqrt{2}\\cdot\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{2}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's plug in the values we have into the equation $y=kx^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\n\nWhen $x=81$, $y=3\\sqrt{2}$. So we have $3\\sqrt{2}=k(81)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\n\nNow we need to solve for $k$ by first finding the fourth root of 81: $81^{\\frac{1}{4}}=3$.\n\nSo we now have $3\\sqrt{2}=k(3)$, which simplifies to $3\\sqrt{2}=3k$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us $k=\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow that we have found the value of $k$, we need to find the value of $y$ when $x=4$.\n\nPlugging in $x=4$ into the equation $y=kx^{\\frac{1}{4}}$ with $k=\\sqrt{2}$, we get $y=\\sqrt{2}(4)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\n\nCalculating $4^{\\frac{1}{4}}$ gives us $2$, so $y=\\sqrt{2}(2)=2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ when $x=4$ is $2\\sqrt{2}$.",
