The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas. After one week, how many amoebas are in the puddle? (Assume the puddle has no amoebas before the first one is placed in the puddle.)",
    "solution": "At the end of the first day, there are 2 amoebas.  At the end of the second, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 2^2$ amoebas.  At the end of the third day, there are $2\\cdot 2^2 = 2^3$ amoebas, and so on.  So, after the seventh day, there are $2^7= \\boxed{128}$ amoebas.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the number of amoebas in the puddle each day. On the first day there is 1 amoeba. On the second day, the original amoeba splits into 2, so there are a total of 1 + 2 = 3 amoebas. On the third day, each of those 3 amoebas split, making it 3 + 3 = 6 amoebas. We keep doubling the number of amoebas each day until we reach day 7.\n\nDay 1: 1 amoeba\nDay 2: 2 amoebas\nDay 3: 4 amoebas\nDay 4: 8 amoebas\nDay 5: 16 amoebas\nDay 6: 32 amoebas\nDay 7: 64 amoebas\n\nSo after one week, there are 64 amoebas in the puddle.",
