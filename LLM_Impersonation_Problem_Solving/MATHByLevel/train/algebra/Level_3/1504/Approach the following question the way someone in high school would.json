    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. An amoeba is placed in a puddle one day, and on that same day it splits into two amoebas.  The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas. After one week, how many amoebas are in the puddle? (Assume the puddle has no amoebas before the first one is placed in the puddle.)",
    "solution": "At the end of the first day, there are 2 amoebas.  At the end of the second, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 2^2$ amoebas.  At the end of the third day, there are $2\\cdot 2^2 = 2^3$ amoebas, and so on.  So, after the seventh day, there are $2^7= \\boxed{128}$ amoebas.",
    "gpt_response": "On the first day, we start with 1 amoeba. Then, on the second day, that 1 amoeba splits into 2 new amoebas. So now we have a total of 2 amoebas. On the third day, each of those 2 amoebas splits into 2 new amoebas, giving us a total of 4 amoebas. This process continues, with the number of amoebas doubling each day.\n\nSo after one week (which is 7 days), we would have:\nDay 1: 1 amoeba\nDay 2: 2 amoebas\nDay 3: 4 amoebas\nDay 4: 8 amoebas\nDay 5: 16 amoebas\nDay 6: 32 amoebas\nDay 7: 64 amoebas\n\nTherefore, after one week, there would be 64 amoebas in the puddle.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 128?: On the first day, we start with 1 amoeba. Then, on the second day, that 1 amoeba splits into 2 new amoebas. So now we have a total of 2 amoebas. On the third day, each of those 2 amoebas splits into 2 new amoebas, giving us a total of 4 amoebas.
