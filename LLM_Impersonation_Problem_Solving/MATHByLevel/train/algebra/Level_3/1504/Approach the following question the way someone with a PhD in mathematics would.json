The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas. After one week, how many amoebas are in the puddle? (Assume the puddle has no amoebas before the first one is placed in the puddle.)",
    "solution": "At the end of the first day, there are 2 amoebas.  At the end of the second, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 2^2$ amoebas.  At the end of the third day, there are $2\\cdot 2^2 = 2^3$ amoebas, and so on.  So, after the seventh day, there are $2^7= \\boxed{128}$ amoebas.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use exponential growth. Let's denote the number of amoebas in the puddle on day $n$ as $A_n$. We know that on day 0, there is 1 amoeba in the puddle, so $A_0 = 1$. \n\nSince every amoeba splits into two new amoebas each day, we have the following relationship:\n$A_{n+1} = 2 \\cdot A_n$ \n\nBy using the above relation iteratively, we can find the number of amoebas in the puddle for each day up to day 7:\n\n$A_1 = 2 \\cdot A_0 = 2$\n$A_2 = 2 \\cdot A_1 = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$\n$A_3 = 2 \\cdot A_2 = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$\n$A_4 = 2 \\cdot A_3 = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16$\n$A_5 = 2 \\cdot A_4 = 2 \\cdot 16 = 32$\n$A_6 = 2 \\cdot A_5 = 2 \\cdot 32 = 64$\n$A_7 = 2 \\cdot A_6 = 2 \\cdot 64 = 128$\n\nTherefore, after one week (i.e., day 7), there are 128 amoebas in the puddle.",
