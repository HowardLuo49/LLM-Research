    "solution": "If $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x+b$ for some number $b$, since $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 - 12x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2 - 12x+a$, we have $4bx=-12x$, so $b=-3$.  Thus, $a=b^2 = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $a$, we need to consider that if $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then it can be written in the form $(2x - b)^2$. \n\nExpanding $(2x - b)^2$, we get $4x^2 - 4bx + b^2$. \n\nComparing this with $4x^2 - 12x + a$, we see that $-4bx = -12x$ and $b^2 = a$. \n\nFrom the first equation, we find that $b = 3$. \n\nThen, substituting $b = 3$ into the second equation, we get $a = b^2 = 3^2 = 9$. \n\nSo, $a = 9$.",
