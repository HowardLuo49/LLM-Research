    "solution": "If $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x+b$ for some number $b$, since $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 - 12x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2 - 12x+a$, we have $4bx=-12x$, so $b=-3$.  Thus, $a=b^2 = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us consider the general form of a square of a binomial:\n\n\\[(ax^2 + bx + c)^2 = a^2x^4 + 2abx^3 + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2\\]\n\nComparing this with the given expression $4x^2 - 12x + a$, we can see that $a^2 = 4$, $2ab = -12$, and $2ac + b^2 = a$.\n\nFrom $a^2 = 4$, we get $a = \\pm 2$. However, since $2ab = -12$, we require $a = -2$ in order to satisfy this condition.\n\nTherefore, $a = -2$ is the constant such that $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial.",
