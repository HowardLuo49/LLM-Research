    "solution": "If $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x+b$ for some number $b$, since $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 - 12x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2 - 12x+a$, we have $4bx=-12x$, so $b=-3$.  Thus, $a=b^2 = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If $a$ is a number that makes $4x^2 - 12x + a$ into a square, then we should think about which numbers we can multiply together to get this square.

If we expand this, we get $4x^2 - 4bx + b^2$. \n\nNow let's compare this to $4x^2 - 12x + a$. We see that $-4bx = -12x$, so $b = 3$.
