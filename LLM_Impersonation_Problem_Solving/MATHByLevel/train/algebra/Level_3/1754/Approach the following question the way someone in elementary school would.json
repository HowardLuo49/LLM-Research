    "solution": "If $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $2x+b$ for some number $b$, since $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.  So, we compare $(2x+b)^2$ to $4x^2 - 12x + a$. Expanding $(2x+b)^2$ gives \\[(2x+b)^2 = 4x^2 + 4bx + b^2.\\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $4x^2 - 12x+a$, we have $4bx=-12x$, so $b=-3$.  Thus, $a=b^2 = \\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out what $a$ is, we need to first figure out what the binomial is when it is squared. Since $4x^2 - 12x + a$ is the square of a binomial, that means it can also be written as $(2x - b)^2$ for some number $b$.\n\nWhen we expand $(2x - b)^2$, we get $4x^2 - 4bx + b^2$. So, in order to match this with $4x^2 - 12x + a$, we need $-4b = -12$ and $b^2 = a$.\n\nSolving $-4b = -12$, we find that $b = 3$. Then, since $b = 3$, we know that $b^2 = 3^2 = 9$, which means $a = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the constant $a$ is equal to $9$.",
