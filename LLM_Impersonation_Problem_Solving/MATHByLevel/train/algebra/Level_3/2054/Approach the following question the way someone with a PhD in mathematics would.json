    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Find $x$ such that $\\log_x 4=\\log_{27} 3$.",
    "solution": "We begin by evaluating the RHS of the equation. Since $27=3^3$, we know that $27^{\\frac13}=3$ and $\\log_{27} 3=\\frac13$. This allows us to simplify the original equation as $\\log_x 4=\\frac13$. Writing this equation in exponential form, we get $x^{\\frac13}=4$, which gives us the solution $x=4^3=\\boxed{64}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, recall the property of logarithms that $\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}$ for any positive real numbers $a,b$ and any positive real number $c \\neq 1$. Applying this property to the given equation, we have:\n\n$\\log_x 4 = \\frac{\\log_{27} 3}{\\log_{27} x}$.\n\nRecognizing that $\\log_{27} 3 = \\frac{1}{3}$ and that $\\log_{27} x = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_x 27 = \\frac{\\log_x 27}{3}$, the equation becomes:\n\n$\\frac{\\log_x 4}{1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{\\log_x 27}{3}}$.\n\nSimplifying further, we obtain:\n\n$\\log_x 4 = \\frac{1}{\\log_x 27}$.\n\nBy the definition of logarithms, we know that $x^{\\frac{1}{\\log_x 27}}=27$, so $x^{\\log_x 27} = 27$. From this, it follows that $x=27$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation $\\log_x 4 = \\log_{27} 3$ is $x=27$.",
