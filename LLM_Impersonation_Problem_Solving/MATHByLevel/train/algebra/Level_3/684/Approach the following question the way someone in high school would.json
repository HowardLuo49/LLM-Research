    "solution": "Since 29 is not a perfect square, we know that $\\sqrt{29}$ cannot equal an integer. Therefore, $f(\\sqrt{29})=\\lfloor\\sqrt{29}\\rfloor+5=5+5=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $f(\\sqrt{29})$, we first need to determine if $\\sqrt{29}$ is an integer or not. Since $\\sqrt{29}$ is not a perfect square, it is not an integer.
