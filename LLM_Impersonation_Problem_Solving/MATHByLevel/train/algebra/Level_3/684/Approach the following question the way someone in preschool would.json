    "solution": "Since 29 is not a perfect square, we know that $\\sqrt{29}$ cannot equal an integer. Therefore, $f(\\sqrt{29})=\\lfloor\\sqrt{29}\\rfloor+5=5+5=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to see if $\\sqrt{29}$ is an integer or not. Well, $\\sqrt{29} \\approx 5.4$, so it's not an integer. \nSince $\\sqrt{29}$ is not an integer, we use the second part of the function. So, $f(\\sqrt{29}) = \\lfloor{\\sqrt{29}}\\rfloor + 5 = \\lfloor{5.385}\\rfloor + 5 = 5 + 5 = \\boxed{10}$.",
