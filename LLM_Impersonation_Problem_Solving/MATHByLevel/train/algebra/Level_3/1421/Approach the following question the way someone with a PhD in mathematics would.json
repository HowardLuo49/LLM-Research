    "solution": "First, we see that $0$ does not satisfy the inequality, so we can divide by $x$.  If $x$ is positive, we can divide to get $x<7$, and there are $6$ positive integers satisfying this. If $x$ is negative, we divide to get $x>7$, which is not satisfied by any negative integers.  So the number of integer solutions is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the inequality $x^2 < 7x$, we first rearrange it into the form $x^2 - 7x < 0$. The expression on the left side can be factored as $x(x - 7) < 0$. \n\nThis inequality holds true when either $x < 0$ and $x - 7 > 0$, or when $x > 0$ and $x - 7 < 0. Solving each condition separately:\n\n1. When $x < 0$ and $x - 7 > 0$, we have $x < 0$ and $x > 7$. This gives us no solutions, as there are no integers that satisfy this condition.\n\n2. When $x > 0$ and $x - 7 < 0, we have $x > 0$ and $x < 7$, which implies $0 < x < 7$. The integers that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, giving us a total of $\\boxed{6}$ integer values for $x$ that satisfy the inequality $x^2 < 7x$.",
