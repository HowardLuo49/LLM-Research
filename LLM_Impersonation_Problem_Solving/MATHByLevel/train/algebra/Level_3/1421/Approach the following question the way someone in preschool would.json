    "solution": "First, we see that $0$ does not satisfy the inequality, so we can divide by $x$.  If $x$ is positive, we can divide to get $x<7$, and there are $6$ positive integers satisfying this. If $x$ is negative, we divide to get $x>7$, which is not satisfied by any negative integers.  So the number of integer solutions is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together how many numbers make the big number smaller. \n\nWe can start with the smallest number, which is 0. When we put 0 in the first box and the second box, we get 0 < 0. Since this is not true, we can say 0 is not the answer.\n\nNext, let's try the number 1. When we put 1 in the first box and 7 in the second box, we get 1 < 7. This is true, so 1 is one of the numbers we are looking for.\n\nWe can keep trying more numbers like 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We see that when we put these numbers in the boxes, the statement x^2 < 7x is true. \n\nSo, we have found five numbers that make the big number smaller. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, there are five integer values of x that make x^2 < 7x true. Yay, we found the answer!",
