    "solution": "First, we see that $0$ does not satisfy the inequality, so we can divide by $x$.  If $x$ is positive, we can divide to get $x<7$, and there are $6$ positive integers satisfying this. If $x$ is negative, we divide to get $x>7$, which is not satisfied by any negative integers.  So the number of integer solutions is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many integers values of $x$ satisfy the inequality $x^2 < 7x$, we need to first get all the terms on one side of the inequality. \n\nSubtracting $7x$ from both sides, we get:\n$x^2 - 7x < 0$\n\nNext, we factor out an $x$ from the left side:\n$x(x - 7) < 0$\n\nNow we need to find the values of $x$ that make this inequality true. We know that the product of two numbers is negative when one number is positive and the other is negative. So, either $x$ is positive and $x - 7$ is negative, or $x$ is negative and $x - 7$ is positive.\n\nCase 1: $x > 0$ and $x - 7 < 0$\nSolving $x - 7 < 0$, we get $x < 7$\nSince $x > 0$, the possible values are integers from $1$ to $6$ inclusive.\n\nCase 2: $x < 0$ and $x - 7 > 0$\nSolving $x - 7 > 0$, we get $x > 7$\nSince $x < 0$, there are no integers that satisfy this condition.\n\nTherefore, the integer values of $x$ that satisfy $x^2 < 7x$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ (a total of 6 values).",
