    "solution": "Writing the equation $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$ in exponential notation gives $r+16 = 16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\\frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32$. Solving $r+16 = 32$ gives $r = \\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number $r$, we need to think about what the logarithm means. The logarithm tells us what power we need to raise a certain number to get our answer. In this case, we need to raise 16 to the power of 5/4 to get $r + 16$. \n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as $16^{5/4} = r + 16$. To figure out what $r$ is, we need to simplify 16 to the power of 5/4. \n\n$16^{5/4}$ means we need to multiply 16 by itself 5 times (since the numerator is the power and the denominator is the root). So, $16^{5/4} = 16 \\times 16 \\times 16 \\times 16 \\times 16$. \n\nAfter multiplying that out, we get $r + 16 = 64$. \n\nTo find $r$, we need to subtract 16 from both sides of the equation. \n\n$r = 64 - 16 = 48$. \n\nSo, $r = 48$ is the number that satisfies the equation $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$.",
