    "solution": "Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this quadratic is negative its linear coefficient, which is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(The above is true because if a quadratic has roots $r$ and $s$, we have $(x-r)(x-s) = x^2 - (r+s)+rs = 0$.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$, we first need to solve the equation. \n\nWe start by moving all the terms to one side of the equation to get $x^2-5x+5-9=0$. \n\nNext, we simplify this to get $x^2-5x-4=0$. \n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation. We can try factoring or using the quadratic formula. \n\nIf we factor, we get $(x-4)(x+1)=0$, which gives us $x=4$ or $x=-1$. \n\nSo, the two values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $4$ and $-1$. \n\nTo find the sum of these values, we just add them together: $4+(-1)=3$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$ is $3$.",
