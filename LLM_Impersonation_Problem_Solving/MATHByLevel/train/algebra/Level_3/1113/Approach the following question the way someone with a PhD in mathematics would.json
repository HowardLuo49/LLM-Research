    "solution": "Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this quadratic is negative its linear coefficient, which is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(The above is true because if a quadratic has roots $r$ and $s$, we have $(x-r)(x-s) = x^2 - (r+s)+rs = 0$.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$, we first need to solve the quadratic equation. \n\nRearranging the equation, we get $x^2-5x-4=0$. \n\nTo find the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, we can use the quadratic formula: $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-5$, and $c=-4$.\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get $x=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{(-5)^2-4*1*(-4)}}{2*1}=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{25+16}}{2}=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{41}}{2}$.\n\nSo the two solutions for $x$ are $x=\\frac{5+\\sqrt{41}}{2}$ and $x=\\frac{5-\\sqrt{41}}{2}$.\n\nThe sum of these values is $\\frac{5+\\sqrt{41}}{2} + \\frac{5-\\sqrt{41}}{2}= \\frac{10}{2} = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$ is 5.",
