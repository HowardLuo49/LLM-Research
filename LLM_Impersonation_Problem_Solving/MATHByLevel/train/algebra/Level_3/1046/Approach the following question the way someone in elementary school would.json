    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference in this arithmetic sequence.  Then the $13^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 12d = 29$.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2$.  Then the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 49 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{103}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fiftieth term, we need to first figure out the common difference between each term. The common difference is the amount that is added or subtracted to get from one term to the next.\n\nWe can find the common difference by subtracting the first term from the thirteenth term:\n29 - 5 = 24\n\nNow that we know the common difference is 24, we can find the fiftieth term by adding this difference to the thirteenth term:\n\n29 + (24 x 37) = 29 + 888 = 917\n\nSo, the fiftieth term of the arithmetic sequence is 917.",
