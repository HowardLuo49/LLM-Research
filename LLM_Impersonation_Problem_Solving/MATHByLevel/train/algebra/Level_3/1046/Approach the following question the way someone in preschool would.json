    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference in this arithmetic sequence.  Then the $13^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 12d = 29$.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2$.  Then the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 49 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{103}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In an arithmetic sequence, you add the same number each time to get the next number. So, if we start with 5 and add the same number over and over, we eventually get to 29. We know that 5 is the first term and 29 is the thirteenth term. To find the fiftieth term, we need to keep adding the same number over and over. \n\nSince we're adding the same number each time, we can find out how much we're adding by subtracting the first term from the thirteenth term: 29 - 5 = 24. \n\nNow, to find the fiftieth term, we need to add this same amount 49 more times (since we are already on the thirteenth term). So, 24 x 49 = 1176. \n\nAdding this to the thirteenth term, we get: 29 + 1176 = 1205. \n\nSo, the fiftieth term of this arithmetic sequence is 1205.",
