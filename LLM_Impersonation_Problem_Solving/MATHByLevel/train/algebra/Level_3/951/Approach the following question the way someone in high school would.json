    "solution": "The powers of $i$ repeat every four powers: $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, $i^5=i$, $i^6=-1$ and so on. So to determine $i^n$, where $n$ is an integer, we only need to find the remainder of $n$ when it is divided by 4. The remainder of both 22 and 222 when divided by 4 is 2, so $i^{22} + i^{222} = i^2 + i^2 = -1 + (-1) = \\boxed{-2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To evaluate this, we first need to understand that $i$ is equal to the square root of -1. \nNow let's break down the exponents one by one:\n$i^{22}$ can be simplified by noting that $i^4 = 1$ (because $i^2=-1$ and $i^4 = (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1$), so we can rewrite $i^{22}$ as $(i^4)^5 = 1^5 = 1$.\nSimilarly, $i^{222}$ can be simplified by noting that $i^4 = 1$, so we can rewrite $i^{222}$ as $(i^4)^{55} = 1^{55} = 1$.\nTherefore, $i^{22} + i^{222} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\nSo, $i^{22} + i^{222} = 2$.",
