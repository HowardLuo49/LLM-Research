On a particular day in Salt Lake, UT, the temperature was given by $-t^2 +12t+50$ where $t$ is the time in hours past noon. What is the largest $t$ value at which the temperature was exactly 77 degrees?",
    "solution": "We set the temperature equal to 77 degrees: \\begin{align*}\n-t^2 +12t+50&=77\\\\\nt^2-12t+27&=0\\\\\n(t-3)(t-9)&=0\n\\end{align*}We see then that the temperature is 77 degrees exactly twice: at $t=3$ and $t=9$, so our answer is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest $t$ value at which the temperature was exactly 77 degrees, we need to set the temperature function equal to 77 and solve for $t$. \nSo, we have the equation $-t^2 + 12t + 50 = 77$.\n\nRearranging terms, we get $t^2 - 12t + 27 = 0$.\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $t = \\frac{-(-12) \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(1)(27)}}{2(1)}$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $t = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 108}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2}$.\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions: $t = \\frac{12 + 6}{2} = 9$ and $t = \\frac{12 - 6}{2} = 3$. \n\nSince we are looking for the largest $t$ value, the answer is $t = 9$ hours past noon.",
