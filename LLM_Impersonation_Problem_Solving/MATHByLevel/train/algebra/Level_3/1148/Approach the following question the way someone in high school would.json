    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. On a particular day in Salt Lake, UT, the temperature was given by $-t^2 +12t+50$ where $t$ is the time in hours past noon. What is the largest $t$ value at which the temperature was exactly 77 degrees?",
    "solution": "We set the temperature equal to 77 degrees: \\begin{align*}\n-t^2 +12t+50&=77\\\\\nt^2-12t+27&=0\\\\\n(t-3)(t-9)&=0\n\\end{align*}We see then that the temperature is 77 degrees exactly twice: at $t=3$ and $t=9$, so our answer is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's set up the equation: \n\n$-t^2 + 12t + 50 = 77$\n\nNow, we need to solve for $t$ by moving all the terms to one side of the equation:\n\n$-t^2 + 12t + 50 - 77 = 0$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$-t^2 + 12t - 27 = 0$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, you can either use the quadratic formula or factor the equation. After solving, you should find two possible solutions for $t$. Since we are looking for the largest $t$ value, choose the greater value.\n\nAnd that's it! By solving the quadratic equation, you can find the largest $t$ value at which the temperature was exactly 77 degrees.",
