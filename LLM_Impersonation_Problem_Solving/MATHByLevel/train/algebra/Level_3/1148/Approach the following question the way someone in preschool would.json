    "solution": "We set the temperature equal to 77 degrees: \\begin{align*}\n-t^2 +12t+50&=77\\\\\nt^2-12t+27&=0\\\\\n(t-3)(t-9)&=0\n\\end{align*}We see then that the temperature is 77 degrees exactly twice: at $t=3$ and $t=9$, so our answer is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's figure this out! So, the temperature equation is $-t^2 + 12t + 50$ and we want to find when it equals 77 degrees. That means we need to solve the equation $-t^2 + 12t + 50 = 77$. Let's see...if we move the 77 to the other side, we get $-t^2 + 12t + 50 - 77 = 0$. Hmm, that's tricky! Maybe we can use our counting blocks to help us out. Let's see...oh, I know! Let's try to factor the equation and see if we can find two numbers that multiply to -27 (since 50 - 77 = -27) and add to 12. Oh, I got it! It's 15 and -3! So, we can rewrite the equation as $-(t-15)(t+3) = 0$. That means either $t-15=0$ or $t+3=0$. So, the two solutions are $t=15$ or $t=-3$. But wait, we can't have a negative time! So, the largest $t$ value when the temperature was exactly 77 degrees is $t=15$ hours past noon. Yay, we did it!",
