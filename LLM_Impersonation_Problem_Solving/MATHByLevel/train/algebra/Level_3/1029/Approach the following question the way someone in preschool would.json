    "solution": "The $y$-axis is where the $x$-coordinate is $0$.  Using the given points, as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $2$, the $y$-coordinate decreases by $4$.  So as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $1$ from $1$ to $0$, the $y$-coordinate will decrease by $2$ from $7$ to $5$.  The point is $\\boxed{(0,5)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see! First, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through the points $(1, 7)$ and $(3, 11)$. To do this, we can use the formula for the equation of a line: $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.\n\nLet's find the slope first. The slope is given by the formula:\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\nPlugging in the coordinates $(1, 7)$ and $(3, 11)$, we get:\n$$m = \\frac{11 - 7}{3 - 1} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$$\n\nSo now we have the equation of the line as:\n$$y = 2x + b$$\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept $b$, we can plug in one of the points into the equation. Let's use $(1, 7)$:\n$$7 = 2(1) + b$$\n$$7 = 2 + b$$\n$$b = 5$$\n\nNow we have our line as $y = 2x + 5$. To find where it intersects the $y$-axis, we can plug in $x = 0$ into the equation:\n$$y = 2(0) + 5$$\n$$y = 5$$\n\nSo the line intersecting the y-axis at the point $(0, 5)$. Yay!",
