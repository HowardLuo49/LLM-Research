    "solution": "The quadratic is the square of $3y$,  the constant term is the square of $-5$, and the linear term equals $2(3y)(-5)$, so we have $9y^2 -30y + 25 = \\boxed{(3y - 5)^2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To factor $9y^2-30y+25, we first look for numbers that we can multiply to get 9 and add to get -30. The numbers are 3 and 3. \n\nSo, we can rewrite the expression as $(3y-5)(3y-5)$ or $(3y-5)^2$. \n\nTherefore, the factored form of $9y^2-30y+25$ is $(3y-5)^2$. Yay! We did it!",
