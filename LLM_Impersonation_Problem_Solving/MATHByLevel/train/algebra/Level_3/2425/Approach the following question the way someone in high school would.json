    "solution": "In this particular case, the fraction will be undefined only if its denominator is equal to zero. Because of this, we can ignore the numerator. We start by setting the binomial in the denominator equal to 0: \\begin{align*} 8x^2-65x+8=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (8x-1)(x-8)=0\n\\end{align*} We find that the two possible values for $x$ are $\\frac18$ and $8$. Since the question asks for the largest value, the final solution is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find when the expression is not defined, we need to find where the denominator equals zero. So let's solve the equation $8x^2-65x+8=0$.\n\nFirst, let's factor the quadratic equation. We need to find two numbers that multiply to 8 and add up to -65. These numbers are -1 and -8. So the factored form of the equation is $(8x-1)(x-8)=0$.\n\nSetting each factor to zero, we get $8x-1=0$ and $x-8=0$. Solving these equations gives $x=\\frac{1}{8}$ and $x=8$.\n\nSo the largest value of x such that the expression is not defined is $\\boxed{8}$.",
