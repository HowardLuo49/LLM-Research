    "solution": "In this particular case, the fraction will be undefined only if its denominator is equal to zero. Because of this, we can ignore the numerator. We start by setting the binomial in the denominator equal to 0: \\begin{align*} 8x^2-65x+8=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (8x-1)(x-8)=0\n\\end{align*} We find that the two possible values for $x$ are $\\frac18$ and $8$. Since the question asks for the largest value, the final solution is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest value of $x$ for which the given expression is not defined, we need to determine the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined.\n\nThe denominator of the expression is $8x^2 - 65x + 8$. We need to find the values of $x$ for which this expression equals zero. We can do this by solving the quadratic equation $8x^2 - 65x + 8 = 0$.\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: \\[ x = \\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \\] where $a = 8$, $b = -65$, and $c = 8$. Plugging in these values, we get: \\[ x = \\dfrac{65 \\pm \\sqrt{(-65)^2 - 4(8)(8)}}{2(8)} = \\dfrac{65 \\pm \\sqrt{4225 - 256}}{16} = \\dfrac{65 \\pm \\sqrt{3969}}{16} = \\dfrac{65 \\pm 63}{16}. \\] Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are $x = \\frac{128}{16}=8$ and $x = \\frac{2}{16}= \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nHence, the largest value of $x$ for which the given expression is not defined is $\\boxed{8}$.",
