    "solution": "In this particular case, the fraction will be undefined only if its denominator is equal to zero. Because of this, we can ignore the numerator. We start by setting the binomial in the denominator equal to 0: \\begin{align*} 8x^2-65x+8=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (8x-1)(x-8)=0\n\\end{align*} We find that the two possible values for $x$ are $\\frac18$ and $8$. Since the question asks for the largest value, the final solution is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find when the expression is not defined, we have to look at the denominator because we can't divide by zero. So, we need to make sure that the denominator, $8x^2-65x+8$, is not equal to zero. \n\nTo find the largest value of $x$, we need to solve the equation $8x^2-65x+8=0$ and find the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero.\n\nTo solve the equation $8x^2-65x+8=0$, we can factor or use the quadratic formula. \n\nAfter solving the equation, we find that the largest value of $x$ such that the expression is not defined is $x=\\frac{8}{8}=1$. So, the largest value of $x$ is 1.",
