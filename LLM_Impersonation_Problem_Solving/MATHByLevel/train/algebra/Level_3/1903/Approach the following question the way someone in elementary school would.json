    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{625} x$, we must first find $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ in exponential form, which gives us $9^{\\frac12}=x-2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=9^{\\frac12}+2=3+2=5$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, the final step is to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Since we know that $625=5^4$ or $625^{\\frac14}=5$, $\\log_{625} 5=\\boxed{\\frac14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to solve for $x$ in the equation $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nSince $\\frac{1}{2}$ is the square root of 1, we know that $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ means that $(x-2)=9^\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThis simplifies to $x-2 = 3$. Adding 2 to both sides gives us $x=5$. \n\nNow that we have found $x=5$, we can find $\\log_{625} x$.\n\nSince $625=5^4$, we can rewrite $\\log_{625} x$ as $\\log_{5^4} x$.\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}$, we can rewrite it as $\\frac{\\log_5 x}{\\log_5 625}$.\n\nSince $\\log_5 625 = 4$, we get the final answer of $\\frac{\\log_5 5}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nTherefore, $\\log_{625} x = \\frac{1}{4}$.",
