    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. If $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$, find $\\log_{625} x$.",
    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{625} x$, we must first find $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ in exponential form, which gives us $9^{\\frac12}=x-2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=9^{\\frac12}+2=3+2=5$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, the final step is to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Since we know that $625=5^4$ or $625^{\\frac14}=5$, $\\log_{625} 5=\\boxed{\\frac14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, first we need to solve for what x is in the first equation. So let's think about what number to the power of 1/2 equals 9. In preschool, we might guess that the number is 3, because 3 times 3 is 9. So x-2 must be 3, which means x is 5. \n\nNow we want to find the logarithm base 625 of x. 625 to the power of what equals 5? In preschool, we might not know off the top of our heads, so we can try breaking down 625 into factors. 625 is 5 times 5 times 5 times 5, or $5^4$. So, the answer must be 4. \n\nWe used some simple math and guessing to solve this problem, just like we would do in preschool.",
