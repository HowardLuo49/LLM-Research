    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{625} x$, we must first find $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_9 (x-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$ in exponential form, which gives us $9^{\\frac12}=x-2$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=9^{\\frac12}+2=3+2=5$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, the final step is to find $\\log_{625} 5$. Since we know that $625=5^4$ or $625^{\\frac14}=5$, $\\log_{625} 5=\\boxed{\\frac14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, let's rewrite the given equation in exponential form. Since $\\log_9 (x-2) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $9^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x-2$. Simplifying the left side gives us $3 = x-2$, so $x = 5$.\n\nNow, we want to find $\\log_{625} x$. This can be written as $\\log_{625} 5$. Since $625 = 5^4$, we have $\\log_{5^4} 5$. Using the change of base formula, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{\\log_5 5}{\\log_5 5^4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\log_{625} x = \\frac{1}{4}$.",
