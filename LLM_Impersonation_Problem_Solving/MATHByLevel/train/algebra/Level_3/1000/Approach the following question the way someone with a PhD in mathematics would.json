    "solution": "This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the degree of a polynomial, we need to find the highest power of the variable present in the polynomial. In this case, the polynomial is given as:\n\n$4 + 5x^3 + 100 + 2\\pi x^4 + \\sqrt{10}x^4 + 9$\n\nThe highest power of the variable present in the polynomial is $x^4$. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 4.",
