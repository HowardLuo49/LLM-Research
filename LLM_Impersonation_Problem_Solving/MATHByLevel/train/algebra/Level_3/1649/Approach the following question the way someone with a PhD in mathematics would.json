    "solution": "Setting $\\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}$ equal to $0.76=\\frac{76}{100}=\\frac{19}{25}$, we have \\begin{align*} \\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}&=\\frac{19}{25}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 25(4b+19)&=19(6b+11)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 100b+475&=114b+209\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad -14b&=-266\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=\\boxed{19}\n\\end{align*}.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$, we must set up an equation where the decimal $0.76$ is represented as a fraction with the numerator in the form $4b + 19$ and the denominator in the form $6b + 11$. \n\nThe decimal $0.76$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{76}{100} = \\frac{19}{25}$. Therefore, we have $\\frac{19}{25} = \\frac{4b + 19}{6b + 11}$. \n\nCross multiplying, we get $19(6b+11) = 25(4b+19)$.\n\nExpanding both sides gives $114b + 209 = 100b + 475$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $14b = 266$, which implies $b = 19$. Therefore, the value of $b$ is $19$.",
