    "solution": "Setting $\\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}$ equal to $0.76=\\frac{76}{100}=\\frac{19}{25}$, we have \\begin{align*} \\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}&=\\frac{19}{25}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 25(4b+19)&=19(6b+11)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 100b+475&=114b+209\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad -14b&=-266\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=\\boxed{19}\n\\end{align*}.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$, we need to make the decimal $0.76$ into a fraction. First, we know that $0.76 = \\frac{76}{100}$.
