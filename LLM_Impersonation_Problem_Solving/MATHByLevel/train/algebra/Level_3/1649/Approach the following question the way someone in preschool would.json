    "solution": "Setting $\\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}$ equal to $0.76=\\frac{76}{100}=\\frac{19}{25}$, we have \\begin{align*} \\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}&=\\frac{19}{25}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 25(4b+19)&=19(6b+11)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 100b+475&=114b+209\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad -14b&=-266\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b&=\\boxed{19}\n\\end{align*}.",

Let's start by making the fraction into a decimal. Can you help me do that? Let's start with $4b + 19$ divided by $6b + 11$. Let's try different numbers for $b$ and see if we can find the right one. Let's see if we can solve this together!",
