    "solution": "The sum of the integers from $-30$ to 30 is zero, so we need to find only the sum of the integers from 31 to 50.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of integers from 31 to 50 is $50 - 31 + 1 = 20$, so the sum is $(31 + 50)/2 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{810}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the integers from $-30$ to $50$, we need to add up all the numbers in between. \n\nFirst, we need to find the sum of the integers from $-30$ to $0$. We can do this by finding the average of $-30$ and $0$ and multiplying it by the number of terms. The average of $-30$ and $0$ is $-15$, and there are $16$ terms from $-30$ to $0$. So, the sum of integers from $-30$ to $0$ is $-15 \\times 16 = -240$.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the integers from $1$ to $50$. We can do this by finding the average of $1$ and $50$ and multiplying it by the number of terms. The average of $1$ and $50$ is $25.5$, and there are $50$ terms from $1$ to $50$. So, the sum of integers from $1$ to $50$ is $25.5 \\times 50 = 1275$.\n\nFinally, to find the sum of integers from $-30$ to $50$, we just need to add the sums we found for the two ranges: $-240 + 1275 = 1035$.\n\nSo, the sum of the integers from $-30$ to $50$ is $1035$.",
