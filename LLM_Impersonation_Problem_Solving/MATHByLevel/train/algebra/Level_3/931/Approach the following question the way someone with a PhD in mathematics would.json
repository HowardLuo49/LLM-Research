    "solution": "The sum of the integers from $-30$ to 30 is zero, so we need to find only the sum of the integers from 31 to 50.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of integers from 31 to 50 is $50 - 31 + 1 = 20$, so the sum is $(31 + 50)/2 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{810}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the integers from $-30$ to $50$, inclusive, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\n$S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$,\n\nwhere $S$ is the sum of the series, $n$ is the number of terms in the series, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, the first term is $-30$ and the last term is $50$. To find the number of terms, we can subtract the first term from the last term and add $1$ (since the series is inclusive):\n\n$50 - (-30) + 1 = 80 + 1 = 81$.\n\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n$S = \\frac{81}{2}(-30 + 50) = \\frac{81}{2}(20) = 810$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the integers from $-30$ to $50$, inclusive, is $810$.",
