    "solution": "The sum of the integers from $-30$ to 30 is zero, so we need to find only the sum of the integers from 31 to 50.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of integers from 31 to 50 is $50 - 31 + 1 = 20$, so the sum is $(31 + 50)/2 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{810}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all the numbers from -30 to 50, you need to add them all up. \n\nFirst, add -30 and 50 together. That equals 20.\n\nNext, add -29 and 49 together. That equals 20.\n\nKeep going with all the numbers in between, adding them up in pairs that add up to 20. \n\nYou will see that there are 41 pairs that equal 20, so the sum of all the integers from -30 to 50 is 20 times 41, which equals 820. \n\nSo, the sum of the integers from -30 to 50 is 820.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 810?: To find the sum of all the numbers from -30 to 50, you need to add them all up. \n\nFirst, add -30 and 50 together.
