    "solution": "If the line $x+y=b$ intersects the midpoint, which is: $$\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2},\\frac{5+9}{2}\\right)=(3,7)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+7=b$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmmm... okay, so we have these two lines and they meet at the middle point of the line from (2,5) to (4,9). So, like, the middle point is like in the middle of the line and stuff. And we know that the equation for one of the lines is x+y=b. So if we find the middle point and plug in those values we can find the value of b! Yay!",
