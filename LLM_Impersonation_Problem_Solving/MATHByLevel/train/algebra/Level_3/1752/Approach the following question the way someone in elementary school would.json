    "solution": "If the line $x+y=b$ intersects the midpoint, which is: $$\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2},\\frac{5+9}{2}\\right)=(3,7)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+7=b$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$, we need to first find the midpoint of the line segment from $(2,5)$ to $(4,9)$. \n\nTo do this, we average the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the endpoints. \nThe average of the x-coordinates is $(2+4)/2 = 3$,\nand the average of the y-coordinates is $(5+9)/2 = 7$.\n\nSo the midpoint of the line segment is (3,7).\n\nSince the graph of the line $x+y=b$ intersects the line segment at its midpoint, we know that the midpoint (3,7) lies on the line $x+y=b$. \n\nPlugging in the coordinates of the midpoint into the equation $x+y=b$, we get:\n$3+7=b$, which simplifies to $b=10$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is 10.",
