    "solution": "First, we solve for $b = g(a)$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(g(a)) &= 8 \\\\\nf(b) &= 8 \\\\\nb^2 + 8 &= 8 \\\\\nb^2 &= 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, $b = g(a) = 0.$ Now, we solve for $a$ using $g(a) = a^2 - 4 = 0.$ From this, $a = \\pm 2.$ Since we are given that $a > 0$, our answer is $a = \\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, this is a tricky question! Let's start by finding the value of $g(a)$ first. To do that, we need to substitute $a$ into the function $g(x) = x^2 - 4$. So, if we plug in $a$ for $x$, we get $g(a) = a^2 - 4$. \n\nNext, we need to find $f(g(a))$. This means we need to substitute $g(a)$ into the function $f(x) = x^2 + 8$. So, if we plug in $g(a)$ for $x$, we get $f(g(a)) = (g(a))^2 + 8$. \n\nBut remember, we are given that $f(g(a)) = 8$. So, $(g(a))^2 + 8 = 8$. \n\nSince we already know that $g(a) = a^2 - 4$, we can substitute that in as well: $(a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8$. \n\nNow, we just need to solve for $a$! Let's do it together.",
