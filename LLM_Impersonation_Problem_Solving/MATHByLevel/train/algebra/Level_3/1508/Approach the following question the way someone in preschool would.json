    "solution": "If we multiply the second equation, the reciprocal of the first equation, and the reciprocal of the third equation, we get \\[\\frac{s}{r}\\cdot\\frac{r}{q}\\cdot \\frac{t}{s} = 6\\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\\cdot2\\Rightarrow \\frac{t}{q}= \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Okay let's see. We have numbers q and r and they equal 9 when divided, and numbers s and r and they equal 6 when divided. Then we have numbers s and t and they equal 1 divided by 2. So...uh...we want to know the number t divided by q.\n\nHmm...I think we need to find a way to connect all these numbers together. Maybe if we try to find a relationship between q, r, s, t, and the numbers they are equal to?\n\nOh, I know! We can use the facts that we have to set up equations and then solve for t divided by q! Let's start by solving for q, r, and s first. Maybe that might help us find t divided by q.",
