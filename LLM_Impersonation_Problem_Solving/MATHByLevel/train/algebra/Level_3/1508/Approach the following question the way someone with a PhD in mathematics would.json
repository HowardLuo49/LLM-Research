    "solution": "If we multiply the second equation, the reciprocal of the first equation, and the reciprocal of the third equation, we get \\[\\frac{s}{r}\\cdot\\frac{r}{q}\\cdot \\frac{t}{s} = 6\\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\\cdot2\\Rightarrow \\frac{t}{q}= \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find $\\frac{t}{q}$, we can first express $s$ in terms of $t$ using the relationship $\\frac{s}{t} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Multiplying both sides by $t$, we get $s=\\frac{t}{2}$.\n\nNext, we can express $s$ in terms of $r$ using the relationship $\\frac{s}{r} = 6$. Multiplying both sides by $r$, we get $s=6r$.\n\nSetting these two expressions for $s$ equal to each other, we have $\\frac{t}{2} = 6r$, or $t = 12r$. \n\nNow, we can express $q$ in terms of $r$ using the relationship $\\frac{q}{r} = 9$. Multiplying both sides by $r$, we get $q=9r$.\n\nFinally, we can express $\\frac{t}{q}$ as $\\frac{12r}{9r} = \\frac{4}{3}$. \n\nTherefore, $\\frac{t}{q} = \\frac{4}{3}$.",
