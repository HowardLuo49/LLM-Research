    "solution": "Converting the given information to equational form, we find $M(M-6) = -5$.  Rearranging, $M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0$.  Using Vieta's equations for sum and product of roots, we find that the sum of the solutions to this equations is $-(-6) = \\boxed{6}$.",

Then we have the equation:\n$M(M-6) = -5$\nSubstitute $M=x$ into the equation:\n$x(x-6) = -5$\nExpand the left side of the equation:\n$x^2 - 6x = -5$\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n$x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0$\n\nTo find the values of $M$, we need to solve this quadratic equation.
