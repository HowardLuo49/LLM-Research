    "solution": "Converting the given information to equational form, we find $M(M-6) = -5$.  Rearranging, $M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0$.  Using Vieta's equations for sum and product of roots, we find that the sum of the solutions to this equations is $-(-6) = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all possible values of M, we first need to figure out what the equation is saying. It says that if you multiply a number M by six less than M, you get -5. So, the equation we need to solve is M(M-6) = -5.\n\nNow, let's find all the possible values of M that satisfy this equation. We can start by guessing some values for M and see if they work. Let's try M = -1:\n\n-1(-1-6) = -1(-7) = 7, which is not -5. So, M = -1 is not a possible value.\n\nLet's try M = 1:\n\n1(1-6) = 1(-5) = -5, which is the correct answer. So, M = 1 is a possible value.\n\nWe can also use algebra to solve this equation. Let's rewrite M(M-6) = -5 as M^2 - 6M = -5. Then, we can rearrange the equation to get M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0. This is a quadratic equation that we can solve using the quadratic formula.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that the possible values of M are 1 and 5. So, the sum of all possible values of M is 1 + 5 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of M is 6.",
