    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. On Monday, I worked $t-6$ hours and earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour. My friend Andrew worked $2t-8$ hours but only earned $t-5$ dollars an hour. As it turns out, we earned the same amount. What is the value of $t$?",
    "solution": "Since we both earned the same amount, \\begin{align*}\n(t-6) (2t-5) &= (2t-8)(t-5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2t^2-17t+30 &= 2t^2 - 18t+ 40.\n\\end{align*}Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count how many hours I worked on Monday. I worked $t-6$ hours.\n\nNow, let's count how much money I earned per hour. I earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour.\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money I earned in total. To find that, we need to multiply the number of hours I worked by the amount I earned per hour. So, the total amount I earned is $(t-6)(2t-5)$.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many hours Andrew worked. He worked $2t-8$ hours.\n\nLet's also calculate how much money Andrew earned per hour. He earned $t-5$ dollars per hour.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much money Andrew earned in total. To find that, we multiply the number of hours Andrew worked by the amount he earned per hour. So, the total amount Andrew earned is $(2t-8)(t-5)$.\n\nSince we earned the same amount, we set the two total amounts equal to each other:\n$$(t-6)(2t-5) = (2t-8)(t-5)$$\n\nNow, we solve for $t$ by expanding both sides of the equation and simplifying:\n$$2t^2 - 5t - 12t + 30 = 2t^2 - 10t - 8t + 40$$\n$$2t^2 - 17t + 30 = 2t^2 - 18t + 40$$\n$$-17t + 30 = -18t + 40$$\n$$-17t + 18t = 40 - 30$$\n$$t = 10$$\n\nSo, the value of $t$ is $10$.",
