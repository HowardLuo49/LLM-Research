    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Ramon sells two enchiladas and three tacos for $\\$$2.50 and he sells three enchiladas and two tacos for $\\$$2.70. Assuming a fixed price per item, what is the cost, in dollars, of three enchiladas and four tacos? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "Suppose that a taco costs $t$ dollars and and enchiladas cost $e$ dollars each.  Then the given information implies that $2e + 3t = 2.50$ and $3e + 2t = 2.70$.  Multiplying the first equation by 3 yields $6e + 9t = 7.50$, and multiplying the second equation by 2 gives $6e + 4t = 5.40$.  Subtracting these two equations, we see that $5t = 2.10$.  Thus one taco costs $\\frac{2.10}{5} = .42$, and two tacos are $.84$.  Since we are given the price of three enchiladas and two tacos, we see that three enchiladas and four tacos total $2.70 + .84 = \\boxed{\\$3.54}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out the cost of one enchilada and one taco. We can do this by setting up a system of equations:\n\nLet x represent the cost of one enchilada in dollars and y represent the cost of one taco in dollars. \n\nFrom the given information, we can write two equations:\n\n1) 2x + 3y = 2.50\n2) 3x + 2y = 2.70\n\nNow, let's solve for x and y. One way to do this is by solving the system of equations using elimination. \n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, we get:\n\n1) 4x + 6y = 5.00\n2) 9x + 6y = 8.10\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\n5x = 3.10\n\nDividing by 5 on both sides, we find:\n\nx = 0.62\n\nNow, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for y.
