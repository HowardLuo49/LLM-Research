    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Samson derives utility according the relation  $$\\text{Utility} = \\text{hours of math done} \\times \\text{hours of frisbee played}.$$On Monday he plays $t$ hours of frisbee and spends $8 - t$ hours doing math.  On Tuesday, he ends up getting the same amount of utility as Monday while spending $2-t$ hours playing frisbee and $t+3$ hours on math.  Find $t$.  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
    "solution": "Since he derived equal utility from both days, we have $$t (8 - t) = (2 - t)(t + 3),$$so $$8t - t^2 = -t^2 -t + 6.$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Samson had fun playing with the frisbee and doing math on Monday and Tuesday! On Monday, he played $t$ hours of frisbee and did $8 - t$ hours of math. On Tuesday, he played $2 - t$ hours of frisbee and did $t + 3$ hours of math.\n\nBoth days gave Samson the same amount of happiness, which we can call \"utility\". To find out the amount of utility from each day, we can use the formula: \n\n$\\text{Utility} = \\text{hours of math done} \\times \\text{hours of frisbee played}.$\n\nFor Monday: Utility = $(8 - t) \\times t = 8t - t^2$\n\nFor Tuesday: Utility = $(t + 3) \\times (2 - t) = 6 - t^2 + 3t$\n\nSince both days gave Samson the same amount of utility, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n$8t - t^2 = 6 - t^2 + 3t$\n\nBy simplifying this equation, we find that $8t = 6 + 3t$, which means $5t = 6$. Solving for $t$, we find $t = \\frac{6}{5}$, which is our answer as a fraction in lowest terms. Yay, we did it!",
