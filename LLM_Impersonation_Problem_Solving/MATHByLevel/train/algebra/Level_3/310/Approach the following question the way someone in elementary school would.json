    "solution": "Point B has coordinates $(x,4)$.  We know the slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so we know that: $\\frac{4-0}{x-0} = \\frac{2}{3}$, thus, $x = 6$, and the sum of the coordinates of point B is $\\boxed{10}$.",

This means that point B has a y-coordinate of 4.\n\nThe slope of segment AB is 2/3, which means that for every 2 units we move up, we also need to move 3 units to the right.\n\nSince point B is on the line y = 4, the y-coordinate of point B is 4.
