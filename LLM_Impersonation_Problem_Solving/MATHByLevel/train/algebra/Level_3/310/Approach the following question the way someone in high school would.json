    "solution": "Point B has coordinates $(x,4)$.  We know the slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so we know that: $\\frac{4-0}{x-0} = \\frac{2}{3}$, thus, $x = 6$, and the sum of the coordinates of point B is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of point $B$, we need to figure out the coordinates of point $B$ first. \n\nWe know that point $A$ is at $(0, 0)$, so the $x$-coordinate of point $B$ must be $0$ as well, since point $B$ lies on the line $y = 4$. \n\nNext, we use the fact that the slope of segment $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ to find the $y$-coordinate of point $B$. The slope of a line is given by the formula $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Plug in the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ to get: \n\n$\\frac{y - 0}{x - 0} = \\frac{4 - 0}{x - 0}$ \n\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{4}{x}$ \n\nSince the slope is $\\frac{2}{3}$, we have $\\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{2}{3}$. \n\nNow we can solve for $y$: \n\n$\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x}$ \n\n$2x = 12$ \n\n$x = 6$ \n\nSo, the $y$-coordinate of point $B$ is $4$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of point $B$ is $6 + 4 = \\boxed{10}$.",
