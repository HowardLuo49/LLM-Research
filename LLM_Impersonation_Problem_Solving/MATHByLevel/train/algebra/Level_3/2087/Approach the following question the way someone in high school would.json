    "solution": "Cubing both sides of  \\[\n1\\text{ yard}=3\\text{ feet}\n\\] we find that 1 cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.  Therefore, 3 cubic yards are equal to $27\\cdot3=\\boxed{81}$ cubic feet.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many cubic feet are in three cubic yards, you need to know that there are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. So to find out how many cubic feet are in three cubic yards, you would multiply 27 by 3. \n\n27 x 3 = 81 cubic feet \n\nTherefore, there are 81 cubic feet in three cubic yards.",
