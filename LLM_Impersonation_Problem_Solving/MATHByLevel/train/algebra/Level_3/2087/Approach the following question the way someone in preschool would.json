    "solution": "Cubing both sides of  \\[\n1\\text{ yard}=3\\text{ feet}\n\\] we find that 1 cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.  Therefore, 3 cubic yards are equal to $27\\cdot3=\\boxed{81}$ cubic feet.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm...let's see. If one cubic yard is three feet long, three feet wide, and three feet high, then that means three cubic yards would be three times as much. So, that would be nine feet long, nine feet wide, and nine feet high. So, there would be 27 cubic feet in three cubic yards. Yay, we did it!",

If one cubic yard is three feet long, three feet wide, and three feet high, then that means three cubic yards would be three times as much.
