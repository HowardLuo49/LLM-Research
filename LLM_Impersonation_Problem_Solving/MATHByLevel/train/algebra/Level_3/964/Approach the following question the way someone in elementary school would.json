    "solution": "This problem is immediate once you know the following fact:\n\nFor the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the solutions of the equation is $-b/a$ and the product of the solutions is $c/a$.\n\nIn this case, $b = 1992$ and $a = 1$, so the sum of the solutions is $-b/a = \\boxed{-1992}$.",

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, so let's try a different approach.\n\nLet's use a magic trick called factoring! We can rewrite the equation as $x(x + 1992) = 1993$. Now, we can look for two numbers that multiply to 1993 and see if they add up to 1992. \n\nAfter some thinking, we see that 1991 and 2 are the two numbers that satisfy these conditions. So, we can rewrite the equation as $(x+1991)(x+2)=0$. \n\nNow, we can find the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation by setting each factor to zero. So, we have $x+1991=0$ and $x+2=0$. \n\nSolving these equations, we find that $x=-1991$ and $x=-2$. \n\nTo find the sum of the values of $x$, we simply add these two values together. \n\n$-1991 + (-2) = -1993$\n\nSo, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy $x^2 +1992x = 1993$ is $-1993$. \n\nYay, we did it!
