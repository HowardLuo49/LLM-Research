    "solution": "Working from the inside out, we start by computing $G(1)$. Since $(1,-3)$ is on the graph, we have $G(1)=-3$.\n\nTherefore, $G(G(1)) = G(-3)$. Since $(-3,5)$ is on the graph, we have $G(G(1))=5$.\n\nTherefore, $G(G(G(1))) = G(5)$. Since $(5,5)$ is on the graph, we have $G(G(G(1)))=5$, and we also see that applying $G$ any number of additional times will leave us at $5$. Therefore, $G(G(G(G(G(1)))))=\\boxed{5}$.",
