    "solution": "Let $\\log_{3}{81}=a$. Then $3^a=81=3^4$, so $a=4$. Let $\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}}=b$. Then $\\frac{1}{9}=3^b$. Express $\\frac{1}{9}$ as a power of $3$: $\\frac{1}{9}=\\frac{1}{3^2}=3^{-2}$. Thus $3^b=3^{-2}$ and $b=-2$. We want to find $\\log_{3}{81}-\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}}=a-b=(4)-(-2)=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, first think about what the logarithms mean. The logarithm of a number tells you what power you need to raise the base to get that number. \n\nFor the first part of the problem, $\\log_{3}{81}$, we need to figure out what power of 3 equals 81. To do this, we can think about what number we need to multiply by itself 4 times to get 81. We know that $3^{4}=81$, so $\\log_{3}{81} = 4$.\n\nNext, let's look at $\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}}$. This time we need to figure out what power of 3 equals $\\frac{1}{9}$. We can rewrite $\\frac{1}{9}$ as $3^{-2}$ because $3^{-2} = \\frac{1}{3^{2}} = \\frac{1}{9}$. So, $\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}} = -2$.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the two values we found: $4 - (-2) = 4 + 2 = 6$. So, $\\log_{3}{81}-\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}} = 6$.",
