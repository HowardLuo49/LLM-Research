    "solution": "Let $\\log_{3}{81}=a$. Then $3^a=81=3^4$, so $a=4$. Let $\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}}=b$. Then $\\frac{1}{9}=3^b$. Express $\\frac{1}{9}$ as a power of $3$: $\\frac{1}{9}=\\frac{1}{3^2}=3^{-2}$. Thus $3^b=3^{-2}$ and $b=-2$. We want to find $\\log_{3}{81}-\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}}=a-b=(4)-(-2)=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, first think about what each part of the problem is saying. The first part, $\\log_{3}{81}$, is asking \"What power do I need to raise 3 to in order to get 81?\" The answer is 4 because $3^4 = 81$. \n\nNext, think about $\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}}$. This is asking \"What power do I need to raise 3 to in order to get $\\frac{1}{9}$?\" The answer is -2 because $3^{-2} = \\frac{1}{9}$. \n\nSo, our problem is now $4 - (-2)$. To subtract a negative number, we can think of it as adding the opposite. So, $4 - (-2) = 4 + 2 = 6$. \n\nSo, $\\log_{3}{81}-\\log_{3}{\\frac{1}{9}} = 6$.",
