    "solution": "Let $x= \\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})$.  Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\\sqrt{6})^x = 216\\sqrt{6}$.  Writing both sides with $6$ as the base gives us $6^{\\frac{x}{2}} = 6^3\\cdot 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, let's first simplify the expression inside the logarithm. We know that $\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{6} = 6$, so we can rewrite the expression as $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (216 \\cdot 6)$.\n\nNow, we can simplify further by multiplying $216$ and $6$ to get $1296$. Therefore, our expression becomes $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} 1296$.\n\nNext, we need to think about what power of $\\sqrt{6}$ equals $1296$. Since $\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{6} = 6$, we know that $(\\sqrt{6})^4 = 6^2 = 36$. Therefore, $(\\sqrt{6})^{4} = 36$, and since $36$ is a factor of $1296$, we can rewrite $1296$ as $(\\sqrt{6})^{4} \\cdot 36$.\n\nNow our expression becomes $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} ((\\sqrt{6})^{4} \\cdot 36)$. Using properties of logarithms, we can split this into two logarithms: $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (\\sqrt{6})^4 + \\log_{\\sqrt{6}} 36$.\n\nFinally, we simplify each part: $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (\\sqrt{6})^4$ equals $4$ because we are finding the exponent that equals $\\sqrt{6}$. And $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} 36$ equals $2$ because $\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{6} = 6$, and $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is $4 + 2 = 6$. So, $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (216 \\sqrt{6}) = 6$.",
