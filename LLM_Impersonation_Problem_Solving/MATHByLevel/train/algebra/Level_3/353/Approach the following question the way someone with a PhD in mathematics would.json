    "solution": "Let $x= \\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})$.  Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\\sqrt{6})^x = 216\\sqrt{6}$.  Writing both sides with $6$ as the base gives us $6^{\\frac{x}{2}} = 6^3\\cdot 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To evaluate $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (216\\sqrt{6})$, we first notice that $216\\sqrt{6}$ can be simplified to $216\\sqrt{6} = 216 \\cdot 6^{1/2} = (216 \\cdot 6^{1})^{1/2} = (1296)^{1/2} = 36$. \n\nSo, we are left with evaluating $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} 36$. This means we are looking for the exponent to which we must raise $\\sqrt{6}$ to obtain 36. In other words, we are looking for $x$ such that $(\\sqrt{6})^x = 36$. \n\nWe can rewrite 36 as $6^2$, so we have $\\sqrt{6}^x = 6^2$. This implies that $x = 2$. \n\nTherefore, $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (216\\sqrt{6}) = \\log_{\\sqrt{6}} 36 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (216\\sqrt{6}) = 2$.",
