    "solution": "Let $x= \\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})$.  Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\\sqrt{6})^x = 216\\sqrt{6}$.  Writing both sides with $6$ as the base gives us $6^{\\frac{x}{2}} = 6^3\\cdot 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, that's a big number! Let's break it down. First, let's simplify $\\sqrt{6}$ by finding the square root of 6, which is about 2.45. Now, let's solve $\\log_{2.45} (216\\cdot2.45)$.\n\nHmm, let's see. I know that the log of a number is the power to which the base is raised to get that number. So, if we raise 2.45 to the power of something, we get 216 times 2.45. \n\nI'm not really sure how to calculate that right now, but it seems like a big number! Maybe we can ask a grown-up for help with this one.",
