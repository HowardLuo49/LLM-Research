    "solution": "We can rewrite $z^2=12z-7$ as $z^2-12z+7=0$. Because the sum of the roots of a quadratic is $\\dfrac{-b}{a}$, we know that the sum of all values of $z$ such that $z^2-12z+7=0$ is $\\dfrac{-(-12)}{1}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to solve the equation $z^2 = 12z - 7$. \n\nWe can start by moving all the terms to one side of the equation to make it easier to work with. So, the equation becomes $z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0$. \n\nNow, we need to find the values of $z$ that make this equation true. We can try to factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. \n\nLet's use the quadratic formula: $z = \\frac{-(-12) \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)}$. \n\nSimplifying this gives us $z = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 28}}{2}$. \n\nCalculating further, we get $z = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{116}}{2}$. \n\nSince $\\sqrt{116}$ simplifies to $2\\sqrt{29}$, we get $z = \\frac{12 \\pm 2\\sqrt{29}}{2}$. \n\nNow let's find the sum of both values of $z$. \n\n$z_1$ = $\\frac{12 + 2\\sqrt{29}}{2} = 6 + \\sqrt{29}$\n\n$z_2$ = $\\frac{12 - 2\\sqrt{29}}{2} = 6 - \\sqrt{29}$\n\nSo, the sum of both values of $z$ is $z_1 + z_2 = (6 + \\sqrt{29}) + (6 - \\sqrt{29}) = 12$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all values of $z$ that satisfy the equation $z^2=12z-7$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
