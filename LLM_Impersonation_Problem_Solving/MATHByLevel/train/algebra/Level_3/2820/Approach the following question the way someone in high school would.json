    "solution": "We can rewrite $z^2=12z-7$ as $z^2-12z+7=0$. Because the sum of the roots of a quadratic is $\\dfrac{-b}{a}$, we know that the sum of all values of $z$ such that $z^2-12z+7=0$ is $\\dfrac{-(-12)}{1}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all values of $z$ that satisfy the equation $z^2=12z-7$, we first need to rearrange the equation to get it in the form $z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0$. Then, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for $z$. The quadratic formula is $z = (-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}) / 2a$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n\nPlugging in the values from our equation $z^2 - 12z + 7 = 0$, we get $a = 1$, $b = -12$, and $c = 7$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$z = (12 \\pm sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4*1*7}) / 2*1$\n\n$z = (12 \\pm sqrt{144 - 28}) / 2$\n\n$z = (12 \\pm sqrt{116}) / 2$\n\nNow, we simplify the square root of 116:\n\n$z = (12 \\pm 2sqrt{29}) / 2$\n\nSo, the two possible values for $z$ are:\n\n$z = (12 + 2sqrt{29}) / 2 = 6 + sqrt{29}$\n\n$z = (12 - 2sqrt{29}) / 2 = 6 - sqrt{29}$\n\nFinally, we add these two values together to get the sum of all values of $z$:\n\n$6 + sqrt{29} + 6 - sqrt{29} = 12$\n\nTherefore, the sum of all values of $z$ that satisfy the equation $z^2=12z-7$ is 12.",
