    "solution": "We can rewrite $z^2=12z-7$ as $z^2-12z+7=0$. Because the sum of the roots of a quadratic is $\\dfrac{-b}{a}$, we know that the sum of all values of $z$ such that $z^2-12z+7=0$ is $\\dfrac{-(-12)}{1}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, to figure this out, I think we need to find the number that we can square to get 12 times that number minus 7. Maybe if we count up by 1 starting from 1, we can find the number that works. Let's see... 1 squared is 1, 2 squared is 4, 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16... Wait a minute! I think I found it! The number we're looking for is 4 because 4 squared is 16 and if we take 12 times 4 and subtract 7, we get 48 minus 7 which is 41! So the sum of all values of z that work for this equation is 4. Yay, I did it!",
