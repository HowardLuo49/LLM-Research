Together Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds, Bart and Cindy weigh 245 pounds, and Cindy and Damon weigh 270 pounds. How many pounds do Abby and Damon weigh together?",
    "solution": "Let the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=260\\\\\nb+c&=245\\\\\nc+d&=270\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $(a+b)-(b+c)=260-245 \\Rightarrow a-c=15$. Adding this last equation to the third given equation, we have $(a-c)+(c+d)=15+270 \\Rightarrow a+d=285$. Thus, Abby and Damon together weigh $\\boxed{285}$ pounds.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's add up the weights of each pair of friends:\n\nAbby + Bart = 260 pounds\nBart + Cindy = 245 pounds\nCindy + Damon = 270 pounds\n\nNow, let's solve for each individual's weight:\n\nWe know from the first equation that Abby + Bart = 260 pounds. Since Bart + Cindy = 245 pounds, we can substitute 245 for Bart in the first equation to get Abby + 245 = 260. Subract 245 from both sides to get Abby = 15 pounds.\n\nSince we know Abby is 15 pounds, we can substitute 15 for Abby in the first equation to get 15 + Bart = 260. Subtract 15 from both sides to get Bart = 245 pounds.\n\nNow we know that Bart is 245 pounds, and since Bart + Cindy = 245 pounds, Cindy must also weigh 245 pounds.\n\nSince we know Cindy is 245 pounds, we can substitute 245 for Cindy in the third equation to get 245 + Damon = 270. Subtract 245 from both sides to get Damon = 25 pounds.\n\nSo, Abby weighs 15 pounds and Damon weighs 25 pounds. Therefore, Abby and Damon weigh together 15 + 25 = 40 pounds.",
