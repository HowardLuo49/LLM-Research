Together Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds, Bart and Cindy weigh 245 pounds, and Cindy and Damon weigh 270 pounds. How many pounds do Abby and Damon weigh together?",
    "solution": "Let the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=260\\\\\nb+c&=245\\\\\nc+d&=270\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $(a+b)-(b+c)=260-245 \\Rightarrow a-c=15$. Adding this last equation to the third given equation, we have $(a-c)+(c+d)=15+270 \\Rightarrow a+d=285$. Thus, Abby and Damon together weigh $\\boxed{285}$ pounds.",
    "gpt_response": "Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds together. Bart and Cindy weigh 245 pounds together. Cindy and Damon weigh 270 pounds together. So, if we add Abby and Bart's weight, and then subtract Bart and Cindy's weight, we can find out how much Abby and Damon weigh together!\n\nAbby + Bart = 260 pounds\nBart + Cindy = 245 pounds\nCindy + Damon = 270 pounds\n\nFirst, let's find out how much Bart weighs. We can do this by subtracting Abby's weight from the total weight of Abby and Bart together:\n\nBart = 260 pounds - Abby\n\nNext, we can find out how much Cindy weighs. We can do this by subtracting Bart's weight from the total weight of Bart and Cindy together:\n\nCindy = 245 pounds - Bart\n\nNow, we can find out how much Abby and Damon weigh together by adding Abby's weight to Damon's weight:\n\nAbby + Damon = Abby + Cindy + Bart + Damon\nAbby + Damon = Abby + Cindy + 260 pounds + Damon\nAbby + Damon = 260 pounds + 245 pounds + 270 pounds\nAbby + Damon = 775 pounds\n\nSo, Abby and Damon weigh 775 pounds together. Yay!",
