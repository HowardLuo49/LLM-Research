    "solution": "Factoring, we have $x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - 10)(x - 6)$ Therefore, $a = 10$ and $b = 6,$ and $3b - a = 18 - 10 = \\boxed{8}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to factor the expression $x^2 - 16x + 60$ into the form $(x - a)(x - b)$. We can do this by finding two numbers that multiply to 60 and add up to -16. These numbers are -10 and -6 since $-10 \\times -6 = 60$ and $-10 + (-6) = -16$. \n\nTherefore, we can write $x^2 - 16x + 60$ as $(x - 10)(x - 6)$.\n\nNow, we can see that $a = 10$ and $b = 6$. Thus, $3b - a = 3(6) - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $3b - a$ is 8.",
