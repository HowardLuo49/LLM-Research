    "solution": "Factoring, we have $x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - 10)(x - 6)$ Therefore, $a = 10$ and $b = 6,$ and $3b - a = 18 - 10 = \\boxed{8}.$",

Let's draw a rectangle where the area is represented by the expression $x^2 - 16x + 60$. \n\nNow, we know that we can rewrite the area of the rectangle as the product of its length and width. So the expression $x^2 - 16x + 60$ is equal to $(x - a)(x - b)$, where $a$ and $b$ represent the length and width of the rectangle.\n\nSince $a$ is greater than $b$, that means that $a$ is the longer side and $b$ is the shorter side.\n\nTo find the values of $a$ and $b$, we can factor the expression $x^2 - 16x + 60$ into $(x - 10)(x - 6)$.\n\nSo, $a = 10$ and $b = 6$.\n\nNow, we need to find $3b - a$:\n\n$3b - a = 3(6) - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8$\n\nTherefore, the value of $3b - a$ is $8$.",
