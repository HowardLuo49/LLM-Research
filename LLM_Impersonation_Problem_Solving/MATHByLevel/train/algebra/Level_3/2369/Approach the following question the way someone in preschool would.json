    "solution": "Multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second equation by $-2$ gives\n\\begin{align*}\n10x-15y&=-25,\\\\\n-10x + 4y &=-8.\\\\\n\\end{align*}Adding the two equations gives $-11y = -33$, so $y=3$.  Substituting $y=3$ in the first original equation gives $2x - 9 = -5$, so $2x = 4$ and $x = 2$.  Therefore, the solution is $(x,y) = \\boxed{(2,3)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find a way to solve this problem. One way is to use the method of substitution. We can solve one of the equations for one variable, and then substitute that expression into the other equation to solve for the other variable. Once we have found both variables, we can put them together to form an ordered pair that satisfies both equations.\n\nLet's solve the first equation for $x$. We have $2x - 3y = -5.$ Adding $3y$ to both sides, we get $2x = 3y - 5$. Dividing by 2, we find $x = \\frac{3y - 5}{2}$.\n\nNow substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation $5x - 2y = 4$. We get $5\\left(\\frac{3y - 5}{2}\\right) - 2y = 4$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{15y - 25}{2} - 2y = 4$. \n\nMultiplying through by 2 to clear fractions, we get $15y - 25 - 4y = 8$. \n\nCombining like terms, we get $11y - 25 = 8$. \n\nAdding 25 to both sides, we get $11y = 33$.\n\nDividing by 11, we find $y = 3$. \n\nNow that we have found $y$, we can substitute this back into the expression we found for $x$. \n\nWe have $x = \\frac{3(3) - 5}{2} = \\frac{9-5}{2} = 2$. \n\nSo the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is $(2,3)$.",
