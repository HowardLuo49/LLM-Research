BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January of this year and then each subsequent calendar month they built twice the number of canoes they had built the previous month. How many total canoes were built by BoatsRUs by the end of May of this year?",
    "solution": "The numbers of canoes built by BoatsRUs each month form a geometric sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112. The first term is 7 and the common ratio is 2, so the sum of these terms is $\\frac{7(2^5-1)}{2-1} = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January. Then in February, they built twice as many, which is 7 x 2 = 14 canoes. In March, they built twice as many as February, which is 14 x 2 = 28 canoes. In April, they built 28 x 2 = 56 canoes. Finally, in May, they built 56 x 2 = 112 canoes. So, by the end of May, BoatsRUs built a total of 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217 canoes. Wow, that's a lot of canoes!",
