BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January of this year and then each subsequent calendar month they built twice the number of canoes they had built the previous month. How many total canoes were built by BoatsRUs by the end of May of this year?",
    "solution": "The numbers of canoes built by BoatsRUs each month form a geometric sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112. The first term is 7 and the common ratio is 2, so the sum of these terms is $\\frac{7(2^5-1)}{2-1} = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we can start by counting how many canoes were built each month. \n\nIn January, BoatsRUs built 7 canoes. \nIn February, they built twice as many, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 canoes. \nIn March, they built twice as many as in February, so that's 14 x 2 = 28 canoes. \nIn April, they built twice as many as in March, so that's 28 x 2 = 56 canoes. \nIn May, they built twice as many as in April, so that's 56 x 2 = 112 canoes. \n\nNow we can add up all the canoes built in each month to find the total number of canoes built by the end of May: \n7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217 \n\nSo, by the end of May, BoatsRUs built a total of 217 canoes.",
