BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January of this year and then each subsequent calendar month they built twice the number of canoes they had built the previous month. How many total canoes were built by BoatsRUs by the end of May of this year?",
    "solution": "The numbers of canoes built by BoatsRUs each month form a geometric sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112. The first term is 7 and the common ratio is 2, so the sum of these terms is $\\frac{7(2^5-1)}{2-1} = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up a mathematical model to represent the number of canoes built each month. Let's denote the number of canoes built in January as \\(x\\). \n\nIn February, BoatsRUs built twice the number of canoes built in January, so the number of canoes built in February is \\(2x\\). \n\nIn March, BoatsRUs built twice the number of canoes built in February, which is \\(2(2x) = 4x\\). \n\nContinuing this pattern, the number of canoes built in April is \\(2(4x) = 8x\\), and in May it is \\(2(8x) = 16x\\). \n\nTherefore, the total number of canoes built by BoatsRUs by the end of May is the sum of the canoes built in each month:\n\n\\[\nx + 2x + 4x + 8x + 16x = 31x\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of canoes built by BoatsRUs by the end of May is 31 times the number of canoes built in January. If the number of canoes built in January, denoted by \\(x\\), is known, the total number of canoes built by the end of May can be calculated by multiplying \\(x\\) by 31.",
