BoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January of this year and then each subsequent calendar month they built twice the number of canoes they had built the previous month. How many total canoes were built by BoatsRUs by the end of May of this year?",
    "solution": "The numbers of canoes built by BoatsRUs each month form a geometric sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112. The first term is 7 and the common ratio is 2, so the sum of these terms is $\\frac{7(2^5-1)}{2-1} = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many total canoes BoatsRUs built by the end of May, we need to add up the number of canoes built each month. \n\nIn January, they built 7 canoes. \n\nIn February, they built twice the number from January, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 canoes. \n\nIn March, they built twice February's number, so that's 14 x 2 = 28 canoes. \n\nIn April, they built twice March's number, so that's 28 x 2 = 56 canoes. \n\nIn May, they built twice April's number, so that's 56 x 2 = 112 canoes. \n\nTo find the total number of canoes built by the end of May, we add up all the numbers: 7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + 112 = 217 canoes. \n\nTherefore, by the end of May, BoatsRUs built a total of 217 canoes.",
