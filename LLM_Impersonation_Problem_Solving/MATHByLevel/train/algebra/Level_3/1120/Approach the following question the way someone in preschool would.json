    "solution": "Note that $\\left(x^4+6\\right)^2=x^8+12x^4+36$. So $\\frac{x^8+12x^4+36}{x^4+6}=\\frac{\\left(x^4+6\\right)^2}{x^4+6}=x^4+6$. Our answer is therefore $5^4+6=625+6=\\boxed{631}$.",

First, we have to plug in the number 5 for the x's in the equation. \n\nSo, we get $\\frac{5^8 +12(5^4)+36}{5^4+6}$\n\nLet's count $5^8$! 5, 25, 125, 625, 3,125, 15,625, 78,125, 390,625!
