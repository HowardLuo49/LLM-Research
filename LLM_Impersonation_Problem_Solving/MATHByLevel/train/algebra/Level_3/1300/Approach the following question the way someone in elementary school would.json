    "solution": "Let $a = x + 1$ and $b = 3 - x$. Then, \\begin{align*}\n(x+1)^2+2(x+1)(3-x)+(3-x)^2 &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\\\\n&= (a + b)^2 \\\\\n&= (x + 1 + 3 - x)^2 \\\\\n&= 4^2 =\\boxed{16}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the expression $(x+1)^2$. To find this, we need to multiply $(x+1)$ by itself. That gives us $x^2+2x+1$.\n\nNext, we have $2(x+1)(3-x)$. To find this, we need to multiply $(x+1)$ by $(3-x)$. That gives us $2(3x-x^2+3-x)$, which simplifies to $6x-2x^2+6-2x$.\n\nLastly, we have $(3-x)^2$. To find this, we need to multiply $(3-x)$ by itself. That gives us $9-6x+x^2$.\n\nNow, we can add all of these parts together to get our final expression: $(x+1)^2+2(x+1)(3-x)+(3-x)^2$ simplifies to $x^2+2x+1+6x-2x^2+6-2x+9-6x+x^2$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $-2x^2+x^2+6x-6x-2x+2x+1+6+9$, which simplifies to $0+0+0+0+0+0+1+6+9$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $16$.",
