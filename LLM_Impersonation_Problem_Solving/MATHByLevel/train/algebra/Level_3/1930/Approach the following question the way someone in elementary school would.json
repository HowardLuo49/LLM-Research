    "solution": "First, we note that $r$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r$ is nonpositive. Next, because $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is an integer and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r=12.2$, the decimal part of $r$ must be $0.2$.  Therefore, $r=n+0.2$ for some integer $n$, so that $\\lfloor r\\rfloor =n$ and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 2n+0.2 =12.2$. Therefore, $n=6$, and the only value of $r$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{r=6.2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all values of $r$ that make $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 12.2$, let's think about what the symbols mean. The symbol $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $r$. So if $r$ is 12.2, then $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is 12 because 12 is the greatest integer less than or equal to 12.2.\n\nNow we can substitute that in and solve for $r$:\n\n$12 + r = 12.2$\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n$r = 0.2$\n\nSo the only value of $r$ that makes $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 12.2$ is $r = 0.2$.",
