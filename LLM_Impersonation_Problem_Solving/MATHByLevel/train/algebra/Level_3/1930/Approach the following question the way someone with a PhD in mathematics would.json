    "solution": "First, we note that $r$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r$ is nonpositive. Next, because $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is an integer and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r=12.2$, the decimal part of $r$ must be $0.2$.  Therefore, $r=n+0.2$ for some integer $n$, so that $\\lfloor r\\rfloor =n$ and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 2n+0.2 =12.2$. Therefore, $n=6$, and the only value of $r$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{r=6.2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all values of $r$ such that $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 12.2$, we first note that $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $r$. Therefore, $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is an integer, and $r$ can be expressed as the sum of an integer and a decimal fraction. \n\nLet $n$ be the integer part of $r$, and let $d$ be the decimal part of $r$. We can express $r$ as $r = n + d$.  \n\nGiven that $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 12.2$, we have $n + n + d = 12.2$. Simplifying, we get $2n + d = 12.2$. Since $n$ is an integer, it follows that $d$ must equal $0.2$. \n\nTherefore, we have $r = n + 0.2$. Since $n$ is an integer, the only possible value for $n$ such that $r$ satisfies $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 12.2$ is $n = 6$. Thus, the only value of $r$ that satisfies the given equation is $r = 6.2$.",
