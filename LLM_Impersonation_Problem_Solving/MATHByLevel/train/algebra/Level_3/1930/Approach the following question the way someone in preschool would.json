    "solution": "First, we note that $r$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r$ is nonpositive. Next, because $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is an integer and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r=12.2$, the decimal part of $r$ must be $0.2$.  Therefore, $r=n+0.2$ for some integer $n$, so that $\\lfloor r\\rfloor =n$ and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 2n+0.2 =12.2$. Therefore, $n=6$, and the only value of $r$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{r=6.2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we need to find a number $r$ that when we add up the whole part of $r$ and the decimal part of $r$, we get 12.2. Hmm, let's try some numbers!\n\nIf we pick 11 for the whole part of $r$, then we need the decimal part to be 1.2. That would make $r = 11 + 1.2 = 12.2$.\n\nSo the only value of $r$ that works is $r = 11.2$. Yay, we did it!",
