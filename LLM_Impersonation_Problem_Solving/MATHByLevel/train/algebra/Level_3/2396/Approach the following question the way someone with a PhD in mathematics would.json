    "solution": "First, solve the inequality so that only the absolute value quantity is on the left and the constant value is on the right.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2|x| + 7&< 17\\\\\n2|x|&<10\\\\\n|x|&<5\n\\end{align*}To solve the inequality which has an absolute value in it, we must turn this into two different inequalities, one as normal, one with a reversed sign and opposite resulting value.  Both will have the absolute value removed.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &< 5 \\\\\nx &> -5\n\\end{align*}Since we need the least integer value of $x$, and $x$ has to be $\\textbf{greater than }$ -5, the next smallest integer is $\\boxed{-4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this inequality, we first need to isolate the absolute value term. \n\nGiven: $2|x| + 7 < 17$\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\n$2|x| < 10$\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n$|x| < 5$\n\nThis means that $x$ is a number within a distance of 5 from 0 on the number line. \n\nThe least integer value of $x$ that satisfies this inequality is -4, as it is the largest negative integer less than 5 in absolute value.\n\nHence, the least integer value of $x$ for which $2|x| + 7 < 17$ is $x = -4$.",
