    "solution": "First, solve the inequality so that only the absolute value quantity is on the left and the constant value is on the right.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2|x| + 7&< 17\\\\\n2|x|&<10\\\\\n|x|&<5\n\\end{align*}To solve the inequality which has an absolute value in it, we must turn this into two different inequalities, one as normal, one with a reversed sign and opposite resulting value.  Both will have the absolute value removed.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &< 5 \\\\\nx &> -5\n\\end{align*}Since we need the least integer value of $x$, and $x$ has to be $\\textbf{greater than }$ -5, the next smallest integer is $\\boxed{-4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least number that works, let's try different numbers for $x$! Let's start with $x=0$. If we put $x=0$ into the inequality, we get $2|0| + 7 < 17$, which simplifies to $7 < 17$. Since 7 is less than 17, that means $x=0$ is not our answer. Let's try the next number, $x=1$. Putting $x=1$ into the inequality gives us $2|1| + 7 < 17$, which simplifies to $2(1) + 7 < 17$, or $9 < 17$. Since 9 is less than 17, that means our least integer value of $x$ for which the inequality is true is $x=1$. Yay, we found it!",
