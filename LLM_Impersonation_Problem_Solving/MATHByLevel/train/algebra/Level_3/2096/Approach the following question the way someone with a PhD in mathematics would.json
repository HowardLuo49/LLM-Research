    "solution": "If you solved this problem by finding the solutions to the equation, go back and read the section again.  The sum of the roots is $-b/a$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term and $a$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term.  So, the desired sum is $-(84)/(-32)=\\boxed{\\frac{21}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the solutions of the given quadratic equation $-32x^2 + 84x + 135=0$, we will start by using the solution to the general quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ which is given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n\nIn our equation, the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are $-32$, $84$ and $135$ respectively. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the solutions of the equation will be the negative of the ratio of $b$ to $a$, which is $\\frac{-84}{-32} = \\frac{21}{8}$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the solutions of the equation $-32x^2 + 84x + 135=0$ is $\\frac{21}{8}$.",
