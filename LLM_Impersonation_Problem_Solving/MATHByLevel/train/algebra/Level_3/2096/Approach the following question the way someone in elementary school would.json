    "solution": "If you solved this problem by finding the solutions to the equation, go back and read the section again.  The sum of the roots is $-b/a$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term and $a$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term.  So, the desired sum is $-(84)/(-32)=\\boxed{\\frac{21}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the solutions, we first need to use the formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ for quadratic equations in the form $ax^2 + bx + c=0$. \n\nIn this case, $a=-32$, $b=84$, and $c=135$. \n\nSo the sum of the solutions is $\\frac{-84}{-32} = \\frac{84}{32} = \\frac{21}{8}$.\n\nSo, the sum of the solutions of the equation is $\\frac{21}{8}$.",
