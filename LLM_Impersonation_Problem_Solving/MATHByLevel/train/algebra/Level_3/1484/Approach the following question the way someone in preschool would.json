    "solution": "We apply the distributive property to get:\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{5}\\left(\\frac{5}{x}+10x^2\\right)&= \\frac{2}{5}\\cdot\\frac{5}{x}+\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot 10x^2\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{2}{x} + 4x^2}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to remember that fractions are like sharing things. Let's share the number 2 in half and then take 5 parts of it. That's $\\frac{2}{5}$. Now, we have two things to share: $\\frac{5}{x}$ and $10x^2$. Let's put them in a basket and see how we can share them. We can share the first one by splitting it into x pieces and the second one by splitting it into 10 groups of $x^2$. Let's work together to see how many pieces each person gets.",
