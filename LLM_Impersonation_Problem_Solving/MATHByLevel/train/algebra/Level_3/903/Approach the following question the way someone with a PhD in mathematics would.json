    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the sum of the two solutions to the equation $54-15x-x^2=0$?",
    "solution": "If the two solutions are $r$ and $s$, then the left-hand side of the equation may be factored as $-(x-r)(x-s)$. When multiplied out, this expression takes the form $-x^2+(r+s)x-rs$.  Therefore, $r+s$ is the coefficient of $x$ in the equation, namely $\\boxed{-15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the two solutions to the equation $54-15x-x^2=0$, we first rewrite the equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$. \n\nIn this case, $a=-1$, $b=-15$, and $c=54$. We can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:\n\n$$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nPlugging in the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$$x=\\frac{15\\pm\\sqrt{(-15)^2-4(-1)(54)}}{2(-1)}$$\n$$x=\\frac{15\\pm\\sqrt{225+216}}{-2}$$\n$$x=\\frac{15\\pm\\sqrt{441}}{-2}$$\n$$x=\\frac{15\\pm21}{-2}$$\n\nTherefore, the two solutions are $x=-18$ and $x=3$. The sum of the two solutions is:\n\n$$-18+3=-15$$\n\nSo the sum of the two solutions to the equation $54-15x-x^2=0$ is $-15$.",
