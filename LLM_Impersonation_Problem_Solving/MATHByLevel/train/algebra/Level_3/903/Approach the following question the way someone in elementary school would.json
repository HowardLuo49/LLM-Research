    "solution": "If the two solutions are $r$ and $s$, then the left-hand side of the equation may be factored as $-(x-r)(x-s)$. When multiplied out, this expression takes the form $-x^2+(r+s)x-rs$.  Therefore, $r+s$ is the coefficient of $x$ in the equation, namely $\\boxed{-15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the two solutions, we first need to solve the equation $54-15x-x^2=0$.\n\nLet's look at the terms in the equation:\n\n- The $54$ is there and not a part of a special pattern (no multiples of $x$), which means it is part of the constant term.\n- The $-15x$ is multiplied by $x$, so we know it's part of the linear term.\n- The $-x^2$ is multiplied by $x^2$, so we know it's part of the quadratic term.\n\nTo solve the equation, let's set it equal to $0$ so we can find the values of $x$:\n\n$54 - 15x - x^2 = 0$\n\nNow we need to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n$-x^2 - 15x + 54 = 0$\n\n$(-x + 6)(x + 9) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two solutions: $x = -9$ and $x = 6$.\n\nNow to find the sum of the two solutions, we just add them together:\n\n$-9 + 6 = -3$\n\nSo the sum of the two solutions is $-3$.",
