    "solution": "Cross-multiplication gives  \\[x^2+2x+3=(x+4)(x+5)=x^2+9x+20.\\]Therefore \\[0=7x+17\\]and $x=\\boxed{-\\frac{17}7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to get rid of the fraction on the left side of the equation. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $x+4$. This will cancel out the fraction, and we will be left with \\[x^2+2x+3=(x+5)(x+4)\\].\n\nNext, we can simplify the right side of the equation by multiplying out $(x+5)(x+4)$ to get $x^2+9x+20$.\n\nNow our equation looks like this: \\[x^2+2x+3=x^2+9x+20\\].\n\nWe can now simplify this equation by moving all the terms to one side. Subtracting $x^2$ from both sides, we get \\[2x+3=9x+20-x^2\\].\n\nContinuing to simplify, subtracting $9x$ from both sides, we then get \\[2x-9x+3=20-x^2\\].\n\nCombining like terms, this simplifies to \\[-7x+3=20-x^2\\].\n\nNext, we can move all terms to one side again by adding $7x$ and subtracting 3 from both sides: \\[0=17-x^2+7x\\].\n\nFinally, we have \\[0=x^2-7x+17\\].\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can factor the quadratic equation by finding two numbers that multiply to 17 and add up to -7. These numbers are -1 and -17, so the factored form is \\[(x-1)(x-17)=0\\].\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero will give us our solutions: $x-1=0$ or $x-17=0$. So, either $x=1$ or $x=17$.",
