    "solution": "The largest power of $5$ that divides both terms is $5^3$. We factor out $5^3$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n5^5 - 5^3 &= 5^3 \\cdot 5^2 - 5^3 \\cdot 1 \\\\\n&= 5^3(5^2 - 1)\n\\end{align*} $5^2 - 1 = 24$, which factors as $2^3 \\cdot 3$. Thus, the prime factorization is ${2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3}$, and the sum of the prime factors is $2+3+5 = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the distinct prime factors of $5^5 - 5^3$, first we need to find the value of $5^5$ and $5^3$. \n\n$5^5$ means 5 multiplied by itself 5 times, so $5^5 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 3125$. \n\n$5^3$ means 5 multiplied by itself 3 times, so $5^3 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$. \n\nNow, let's subtract $5^3$ from $5^5$:\n\n$5^5 - 5^3 = 3125 - 125 = 3000$\n\nThe prime factors of 3000 are 2, 3 and 5.
