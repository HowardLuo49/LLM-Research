    "solution": "The largest power of $5$ that divides both terms is $5^3$. We factor out $5^3$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n5^5 - 5^3 &= 5^3 \\cdot 5^2 - 5^3 \\cdot 1 \\\\\n&= 5^3(5^2 - 1)\n\\end{align*} $5^2 - 1 = 24$, which factors as $2^3 \\cdot 3$. Thus, the prime factorization is ${2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3}$, and the sum of the prime factors is $2+3+5 = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the distinct prime factors of $5^5 - 5^3$, first let's simplify $5^5 - 5^3$ as $5^3(5^2 - 1)$. \n\nNext, we notice that $5^2 - 1$ can be factored as $(5 + 1)(5 - 1) = 6 \\times 4 = 24$. \n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to $5^3 \\times 24 = 5^3 \\times 2^3 \\times 3 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^3$. \n\nSo, the distinct prime factors of $5^5 - 5^3$ are 2, 3, and 5. \n\nAdding these prime factors together, we get $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the distinct prime factors of $5^5 - 5^3$ is 10.",
