    "solution": "The largest power of $5$ that divides both terms is $5^3$. We factor out $5^3$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n5^5 - 5^3 &= 5^3 \\cdot 5^2 - 5^3 \\cdot 1 \\\\\n&= 5^3(5^2 - 1)\n\\end{align*} $5^2 - 1 = 24$, which factors as $2^3 \\cdot 3$. Thus, the prime factorization is ${2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3}$, and the sum of the prime factors is $2+3+5 = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. First, we need to find what $5^5$ is. That's like saying 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5. So, that's 3125. And then 5^3 is 5 times 5 times 5, which is 125. Now, we need to subtract 125 from 3125, which gives us 3000. \n\nNow, we need to find the prime factors of 3000. Hmm, let's try dividing by 2. 3000 divided by 2 is 1500. And then we divide by 2 again to get 750. And then we divide by 2 again to get 375. And then we divide by 3 to get 125. And then we divide by 5 to get 25. And then we divide by 5 again to get 5. \n\nSo, the distinct prime factors of 5^5 - 5^3 are 2, 3, and 5. Let's add them up. 2 + 3 + 5 is 10. So, the sum of the distinct prime factors is 10. Yay, we did it!",
