    "solution": "The largest power of $5$ that divides both terms is $5^3$. We factor out $5^3$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n5^5 - 5^3 &= 5^3 \\cdot 5^2 - 5^3 \\cdot 1 \\\\\n&= 5^3(5^2 - 1)\n\\end{align*} $5^2 - 1 = 24$, which factors as $2^3 \\cdot 3$. Thus, the prime factorization is ${2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3}$, and the sum of the prime factors is $2+3+5 = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the distinct prime factors of $5^5 - 5^3$, we first need to factorize the expression.\n\nWe know that $5^5 = 3125$ and $5^3 = 125$.
