    "solution": "Since $\\sqrt{64}<\\sqrt{80}<\\sqrt{81}$, $\\sqrt{80}$ must be a number between $8$ and $9$. Therefore, the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $\\sqrt{80}$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find the square root of 80 first. The square root of 80 is between 8 and 9 because 8 squared is 64 and 9 squared is 81. So 80 is between 8 times 8 and 9 times 9.\n\nBut our question is asking for the floor of the square root of 80. The floor of a number is the highest whole number that is less than or equal to the number. So the floor of the square root of 80 is 8. \n\nTherefore, $\\lfloor\\sqrt{80}\\rfloor = 8$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: Let's find the square root of 80 first. The square root of 80 is between 8 and 9 because 8 squared is 64 and 9 squared is 81. So 80 is between 8 times 8 and 9 times 9.\n\nBut our question is asking for the floor of the square root of 80.
