    "solution": "We only need to look at the constant terms; all the other terms will have variables in them when multiplied.  Thus we have $(5)(15)$, which equals $\\boxed{75}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the constant term in the expansion of the given expression $(x^4+x+5)(x^5+x^3+15)$, we need to multiply all possible pairs of terms in the two expressions and identify the term that is independent of $x$. \n\nExpanding the expressions, we get:\n\n$(x^4+x+5)(x^5+x^3+15)$\n$= x^4(x^5) + x^4(x^3) + x^4(15) + x(x^5) + x(x^3) + x(15) + 5(x^5) + 5(x^3) + 5(15)$\n$= x^9 + x^7 + 15x^4 + x^6 + x^4 + 15x + 5x^5 + 5x^3 + 75$\n\nNow, we need to identify the term that is independent of $x$. This is the term that does not have an $x$ in it, which is the constant term. Hence, the constant term in the expansion is $75$.",
