    "solution": "We only need to look at the constant terms; all the other terms will have variables in them when multiplied.  Thus we have $(5)(15)$, which equals $\\boxed{75}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the constant term in the expansion of $(x^4+x+5)(x^5+x^3+15)$, we need to multiply the constant terms in each of the two binomials. \n\nIn the first binomial, the constant term is 5. In the second binomial, the constant term is 15. \n\nWhen we multiply 5 and 15 together, we get 75. \n\nSo, the constant term in the expansion of $(x^4+x+5)(x^5+x^3+15)$ is 75.",
