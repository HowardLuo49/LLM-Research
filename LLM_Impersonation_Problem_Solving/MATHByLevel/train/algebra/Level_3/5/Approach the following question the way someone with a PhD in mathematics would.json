    "solution": "The given expression is undefined when the denominator is zero. Thus, we want to find the sum of the zeros $y$ to the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$. Since for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the zeros of the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$ is $5/1=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the values of $y$ for which the expression $\\frac{y+6}{y^2 - 5y + 4}$ is undefined, we need to determine when the denominator, $y^2-5y+4$, is equal to zero. \n\nWe can do this by finding the roots of the quadratic equation $y^2-5y+4=0$. Using the quadratic formula, the roots are given by: \n\n$y = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2-4(1)(4)}}{2(1)}$\n\nSolving this gives us:\n\n$y = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2}$\n\nThis results in two roots: $y=4$ and $y=1$. Therefore, the expression $\\frac{y+6}{y^2 - 5y + 4}$ is undefined for $y=4$ and $y=1$. \n\nThe sum of all values of $y$ for which the expression is undefined is $4+1=5$.",
