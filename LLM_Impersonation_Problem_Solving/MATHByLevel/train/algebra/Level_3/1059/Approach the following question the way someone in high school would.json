    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Karen drove continuously from 9:40 a.m. until 1:20 p.m. of the same day and covered a distance of 165 miles. What was her average speed in miles per hour?",
    "solution": "Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\\frac{40}{60}=3\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\\frac{165}{\\frac{11}{3}}=3\\cdot15=\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour.",
    "gpt_response": "To find Karen's average speed in miles per hour, we need to divide the total distance she covered by the total time she drove.\n\nFirst, let's find the total time Karen drove. \nKaren started driving at 9:40 a.m. and drove until 1:20 p.m. So, the total time she drove is 3 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nNext, let's convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to hours. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert the 40 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.\n40 minutes / 60 minutes = 0.67 hours (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, let's add the 3 hours and 0.67 hours to get the total time Karen drove.\n3 hours + 0.67 hours = 3.67 hours\n\nNow that we have the total time Karen drove, let's calculate her average speed.\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\nAverage speed = 165 miles / 3.67 hours\nAverage speed = 44.96 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, Karen's average speed was approximately 44.96 miles per hour.",
