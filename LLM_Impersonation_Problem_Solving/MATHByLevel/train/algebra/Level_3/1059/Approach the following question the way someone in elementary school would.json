    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Karen drove continuously from 9:40 a.m. until 1:20 p.m. of the same day and covered a distance of 165 miles. What was her average speed in miles per hour?",
    "solution": "Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\\frac{40}{60}=3\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\\frac{165}{\\frac{11}{3}}=3\\cdot15=\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour.",
    "gpt_response": "To find Karen's average speed, we need to divide the total distance she traveled by the total time it took. \n\nFirst, we need to find how long she drove for. Karen drove from 9:40 a.m. to 1:20 p.m., which is a total of 3 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nWe need to convert the time into hours by dividing 40 minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). \n40 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.67 hours\n\nNow, we add the 3 hours and 0.67 hours together to get the total time Karen drove. \n3 hours + 0.67 hours = 3.67 hours\n\nNext, we divide the total distance Karen traveled (165 miles) by the total time she drove (3.67 hours). \n165 miles \u00f7 3.67 hours \u2248 44.86 miles per hour\n\nKaren's average speed was approximately 44.86 miles per hour.",
