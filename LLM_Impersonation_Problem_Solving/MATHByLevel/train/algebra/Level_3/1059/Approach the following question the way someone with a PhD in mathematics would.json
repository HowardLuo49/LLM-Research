    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Karen drove continuously from 9:40 a.m. until 1:20 p.m. of the same day and covered a distance of 165 miles. What was her average speed in miles per hour?",
    "solution": "Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\\frac{40}{60}=3\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\\frac{165}{\\frac{11}{3}}=3\\cdot15=\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine Karen's average speed, we divide the total distance covered by the total time taken. Let us first convert the starting and ending times to the same unit. \n\nSince Karen drove from 9:40 a.m. to 1:20 p.m., the total time taken can be calculated as follows:\nTotal time = (1:20 p.m.) - (9:40 a.m.) = 3 hours and 40 minutes = 3.67 hours\n\nNow, we can calculate Karen's average speed:\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time taken\nAverage speed = 165 miles / 3.67 hours\nAverage speed \u2248 44.93 mph\n\nTherefore, Karen's average speed during the journey was approximately 44.93 miles per hour.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 45?: To determine Karen's average speed, we divide the total distance covered by the total time taken.
