    "solution": "Letting $x= \\!\\sqrt{12 +\\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \\!\\sqrt{12 + x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 12+x$, so $x^2 -x-12 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x-4)(x+3) = 0$. Therefore, $x=4$ or $x=-3$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{4}$.",

Let's call this part \"X\" for now. So X = $\\sqrt{12 + X}$. \nNow, we need to find a number that when added to 12 and then the square root is taken, it gives us that same number back. Let's try some numbers:\nIf X = 4, then $\\sqrt{12 + 4} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$. Yay! We found the number!\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",
