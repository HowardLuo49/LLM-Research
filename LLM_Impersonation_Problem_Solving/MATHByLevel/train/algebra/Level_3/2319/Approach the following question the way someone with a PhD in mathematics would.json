    "solution": "Letting $x= \\!\\sqrt{12 +\\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \\!\\sqrt{12 + x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 12+x$, so $x^2 -x-12 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x-4)(x+3) = 0$. Therefore, $x=4$ or $x=-3$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can represent the given expression as an infinite nested radical: $\\sqrt{12 +\\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\cdots}}}}=x$. \nThen, we can write this expression as $x = \\sqrt{12 + x}$. Squaring both sides, we get $x^2 = 12 + x$. Rearranging terms, we have $x^2 - x - 12 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation that can be factored as $(x-4)(x+3) = 0$. Therefore, the possible solutions are $x=4$ or $x=-3$. Since the square root must be a non-negative number, we have $x=4$ as the final answer.\n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{12 +\\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\cdots}}}} = 4$.",
