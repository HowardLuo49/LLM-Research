    "solution": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $1998-x$. The product which needs to be maximized is $1998x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-999)^2+999^2$. Since $-(x-999)^2\\le 0$, the expression is maximized when $x=999$, which results in a value of $999^2=\\boxed{998001}$.",

We want to find the maximum value of the product xy. \n\nSince x + y = 1998, we can rewrite this as y = 1998 - x. \n\nWe want to maximize the product xy, which can be expressed as f(x) = x(1998 - x). \n\nTo find the maximum value of f(x), we can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x and set it equal to 0:\n\nf'(x) = (1998 - 2x) = 0\n1998 - 2x = 0\n2x = 1998\nx = 999 \n\nSince the derivative of f(x) is negative for x < 999 and positive for x > 999, we can conclude that x = 999 corresponds to a local maximum.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the product xy, we need x = 999 and y = 1998 - x = 999. \n\nThe greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998 is 999 * 999 = 998,001.",
