    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Four people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. How many more people will be needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
    "solution": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (4)(6)= 24$ because 4 people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 4 hours, then we must have $m(4) = 24$, so $m=6$.  Therefore, we need $6-4 = \\boxed{2}$ more people to complete the job in 4 hours.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to first determine the total work that needs to be done in order to mow the lawn. Since four people can mow the lawn in 6 hours, we can calculate the total work as:\n\n4 people * 6 hours = 24 people-hours of work\n\nNow, if we want to mow the lawn in 4 hours, we need to calculate how many people would be needed to do 24 people-hours of work in that time. Since each person mows at the same rate, we can set up a proportion:\n\n4 people * 6 hours = x people * 4 hours\n\n24 = 4x\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, we would need 6 people to mow the lawn in 4 hours. This means we would need 2 more people (6 - 4) to help mow the lawn in that time frame.",
