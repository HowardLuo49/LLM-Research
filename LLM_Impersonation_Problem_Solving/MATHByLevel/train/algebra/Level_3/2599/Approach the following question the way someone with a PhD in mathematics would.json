    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Four people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. How many more people will be needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
    "solution": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (4)(6)= 24$ because 4 people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 4 hours, then we must have $m(4) = 24$, so $m=6$.  Therefore, we need $6-4 = \\boxed{2}$ more people to complete the job in 4 hours.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of people needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the equation:\n\n4 people * 6 hours = x people * 4 hours\n\n24 = 4x\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, 6 more people will be needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: Let x be the number of people needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the equation:\n\n4 people * 6 hours = x people * 4 hours\n\n24 = 4x\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, 6 more people will be needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours.",
