    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Four people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. How many more people will be needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
    "solution": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (4)(6)= 24$ because 4 people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 4 hours, then we must have $m(4) = 24$, so $m=6$.  Therefore, we need $6-4 = \\boxed{2}$ more people to complete the job in 4 hours.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's imagine we have four friends who can mow a lawn together in 6 hours. That means they work together really well and get the job done pretty quick!\n\nNow, if we want to mow the same lawn in only 4 hours, we might need to add more friends to help. If it takes 4 hours, that means we need to mow faster. So, we might need a few more friends to help out and work together.\n\nLet's ask our teacher or grown-up how many more friends we need to help us mow the lawn in 4 hours. Maybe they can help us figure it out together!",
