    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Four people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. How many more people will be needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
    "solution": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (4)(6)= 24$ because 4 people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 4 hours, then we must have $m(4) = 24$, so $m=6$.  Therefore, we need $6-4 = \\boxed{2}$ more people to complete the job in 4 hours.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we first need to find out how long it takes for one person to mow the lawn. Since four people can mow the lawn in 6 hours, that means it would take one person 4 times as long, which is 24 hours.\n\nNow, we want to mow the lawn in 4 hours. If one person can do it in 24 hours, that means we need 6 times as many people to do it in 4 hours. So, we would need 6 more people to mow the lawn in 4 hours.",

Since four people can mow the lawn in 6 hours, that means it would take one person 4 times as long, which is 24 hours.\n\nNow, we want to mow the lawn in 4 hours.
