    "solution": "The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle. The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints. Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices.  Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices, we need to figure out the $y$-coordinates of those two vertices. \n\nFirst, we know that a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal and parallel. So to find the other two vertices, we need to find two points that are also the same distance apart as $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$.\n\nLet's look at the distance between the two given points. The difference between the $x$-coordinates is $9-3 = 6$ and the difference between the $y$-coordinates is $-4-17 = -21$.\n\nTo find the other two vertices, we need to add the same difference to the $y$-coordinate of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$. This means adding $-21$ to $17$ gives us $17+(-21) = -4$ and adding $-21$ to $-4$ gives us $-4+(-21) = -25$.\n\nSo the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices are $-4$ and $-25$. Now, to find the sum, we just add them together: $-4 + (-25) = -29$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices is $-29$.",
