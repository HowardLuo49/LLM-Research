    "solution": "The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle. The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints. Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices.  Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices of the rectangle, we need to think about where the other two vertices might be! A rectangle has four right angles and two sides that are parallel and equal in length. \n\nLet's draw a rectangle with the given points $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$. We know that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. So, we can draw two lines that are parallel to the side that connects $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$. These two lines will have the same $y$-coordinates as the given points.\n\nLet's think about this in a really fun way! Imagine two monkeys jumping around the rectangle, one starting at $(3,17)$ and the other starting at $(9,-4)$. They will jump to the opposite side of the rectangle, making the same $y$-coordinate on the other side of the rectangle. So, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices will be the same as the $y$-coordinates of the given points.\n\nSo, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices is $17 + (-4) = 13$. Yay, we did it!",
