    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many distinct $x$-intercepts does the graph of $y = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)$ have?",
    "solution": "An $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$.  So, the $x$-intercepts are the solutions to the equation $0 = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)$.  From this equation, we see that solutions occur when $x-5=0$ and when $x^2+5x+6=0$.  Now, $x^2+5x+6$ factors to $(x+3)(x+2)$.  So, the solutions are $5, -2, -3$, which comes to $\\boxed{3}$ intercepts.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $x$-intercepts, we need to set $y$ (or $f(x)$) equal to zero and solve for $x$. \nSo we need to solve the equation:\n\\[0 = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)\\]\n\nThis equation is equal to zero when either factor is equal to zero. \n\nSetting $(x-5)=0$, we find that $x=5$ is one $x$-intercept.\n\nNow, setting $(x^2+5x+6)=0$, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation.
