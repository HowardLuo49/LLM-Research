    "solution": "An $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$.  So, the $x$-intercepts are the solutions to the equation $0 = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)$.  From this equation, we see that solutions occur when $x-5=0$ and when $x^2+5x+6=0$.  Now, $x^2+5x+6$ factors to $(x+3)(x+2)$.  So, the solutions are $5, -2, -3$, which comes to $\\boxed{3}$ intercepts.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the x-intercepts of the graph, we need to see where the graph crosses the x-axis. This happens when the y-coordinate is 0.\n\nLet's set y = 0 and solve for x:\n$(x-5)(x^2+5x+6) = 0$\n\nThis means either $x-5 = 0$ or $x^2+5x+6 = 0$.\n\nIf we solve $x-5 = 0$, we find that $x = 5$.\n\nIf we solve $x^2+5x+6 = 0$, we can factor to get $(x+2)(x+3) = 0$, which gives us $x = -2$ and $x = -3$.\n\nSo, the graph of $y = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)$ has 3 distinct x-intercepts at $x = 5$, $x = -2$, and $x = -3$.",
