    "solution": "We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides.  This gives us $2-\\frac{x}{2} = -27$.  Solving this equation gives $x =\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all solutions to the equation, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Start by isolating the cube root by raising both sides of the equation to the power of 3. This will cancel out the cube root on the left side.\n\n$\\left(\\sqrt[3]{2 - \\frac{x}{2}}\\right)^3 = (-3)^3$\n\nStep 2: Simplify both sides using the property of cube roots.
