    "solution": "If a point is on the $x$-axis, its $y$-coordinate is 0.  Therefore, we substitute $y=0$ into the equation for the line to find $x=12/(-4)=-3$.  Therefore, the coordinates of the $x$-intercept are $\\boxed{(-3,0)}$.",

In preschool, we can remember that the $x$-axis is where the $y$ coordinate is always zero. So we can substitute 0 for $y$ in the equation $3y-4x=12$.\n\n$3(0)-4x=12$\n$0-4x=12$\n$-4x=12$\n$x=-3$\n\nSo the point where the line intersects the $x$-axis is (-3, 0).",
