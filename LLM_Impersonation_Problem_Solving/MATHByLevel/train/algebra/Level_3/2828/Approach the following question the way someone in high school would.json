    "solution": "If a point is on the $x$-axis, its $y$-coordinate is 0.  Therefore, we substitute $y=0$ into the equation for the line to find $x=12/(-4)=-3$.  Therefore, the coordinates of the $x$-intercept are $\\boxed{(-3,0)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find where the line $3y - 4x = 12$ intersects the $x$-axis, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n\n$3(0) - 4x = 12$\n\n$-4x = 12$\n\n$x = -3$\n\nSo, the line intersects the $x$-axis at the point $(-3, 0)$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to (-3,0)?: To find where the line $3y - 4x = 12$ intersects the $x$-axis, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n\n$3(0) - 4x = 12$\n\n$-4x = 12$\n\n$x = -3$\n\nSo, the line intersects the $x$-axis at the point $(-3, 0)$.",
