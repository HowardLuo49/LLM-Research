    "solution": "Since both lines intersect at the point $(-4,-7)$, line $n$ must pass through this point.  We can substitute these coordinates into the equation $y=kx-7$ and solve for $k$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n-7&=k(-4)-7\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -7&=-4k-7\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-4k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\boxed{0}&=k\n\\end{align*}",
