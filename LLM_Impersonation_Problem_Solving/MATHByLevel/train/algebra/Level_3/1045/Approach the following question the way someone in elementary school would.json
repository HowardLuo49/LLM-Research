    "solution": "To get the square root out of the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{2}+1)$ so that the $\\sqrt{2}$ is squared and $\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$ cancel each other out.  $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2-\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{2}-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{1}=\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}+1}$$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay let's make the denominator easier to work with. We need to get rid of the square root. To do this, we have to multiply the top and bottom by the conjugate of $\\sqrt{2}-1$, which is $\\sqrt{2}+1$. \n\nSo, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{\\sqrt{2}+1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)}$\n\nNow we can simplify the denominator by using the difference of squares:\n\n$(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1) = (2 - 1) = 1$\n\nSo our final answer is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{1} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{2}+1}$.",
