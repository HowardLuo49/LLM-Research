    "solution": "This is a geometric sequence with first term $\\frac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is:\n\n$\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)=\\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$.\n\nWe see that $\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{2^6-1}{2^7}$, so $n=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so to find the sum of the first $n$ terms in an infinite geometric sequence, we use the formula $S = \\frac{a}{1-r}$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. \n\nIn this case, the first term $a$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ and the common ratio $r$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, since each term is half of the previous term. \n\nSo, we plug in the values into the formula: \n\n$S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$ \n\nBut we know that the sum of the first $n$ terms is actually $\\frac{63}{128}$, so we need to find $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\dots + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{n-1} = \\frac{63}{128}$. \n\nSo, we need to solve the equation $\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^n) = \\frac{63}{128}$. \n\nSolving gives $n=5$.
