    "solution": "This is a geometric sequence with first term $\\frac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is:\n\n$\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)=\\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$.\n\nWe see that $\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{2^6-1}{2^7}$, so $n=\\boxed{6}$.",
