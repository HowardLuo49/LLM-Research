    "solution": "This is a geometric sequence with first term $\\frac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is:\n\n$\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)=\\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$.\n\nWe see that $\\frac{63}{128}=\\frac{2^6-1}{2^7}$, so $n=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find out how to add up all the terms in this pattern. The pattern is getting smaller and smaller, but we can still add it up! \n\nThe first term is $\\frac{1}{4}$, the second term is $\\frac{1}{8}$, the third term is $\\frac{1}{16}$, and so on. Each term is half of the previous term.\n\nTo find the sum of all the terms, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric sequence: $S = \\frac{a}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nPlugging in the values from our sequence, we get: $S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{\\frac{2}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nBut we know that the sum of the first $n$ terms is actually $\\frac{63}{128}$, not $\\frac{1}{2}$.

So our equation becomes: $2^{-1} \\times 2^{-1} \\times 2^{-1} \\times \\dots = 2^{-n} = \\frac{63}{128}$.\n\nNow we just need to solve for $n$ in $2^{-n} = \\frac{63}{128}$. \n\nWe can rewrite $\\frac{63}{128}$ as $2^{-1} \\times 3^{-2}$ to make it easier to solve the equation: $2^{-n} = 2^{-1} \\times 3^{-2}$.\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $-n = -1$.\n\nSolving for $n$, we get $n = 1$.\n\nSo the sum of the first $1$ term in the sequence $\\left\\{\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\dots\\right\\}$ is $\\frac{63}{128}$.",
