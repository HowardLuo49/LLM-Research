    "solution": "First, remember that the slope of a line in the form of $y=mx+b$ is equal to $m$.  So, the line must take the form $y=-7x+b$.  Next, substitute the point $(3,0)$ and solve for $b$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=-7(3)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-21+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 21&=b\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $m+b$ is $-7+21=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the line, we can use the point-slope formula: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ where $(x_1, y_1)$ is the given point $(3,0)$ and $m$ is the slope $-7$.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: $y - 0 = -7(x - 3)$\nSimplify: $y = -7x + 21$\n\nNow we can see that $m = -7$ and $b = 21$. To find $m+b$, we just add them together:\n$m + b = -7 + 21= 14$\n\nSo, the value of $m+b$ is 14.",
