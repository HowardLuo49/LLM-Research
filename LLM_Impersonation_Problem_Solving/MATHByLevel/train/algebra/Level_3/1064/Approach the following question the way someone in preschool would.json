    "solution": "First, remember that the slope of a line in the form of $y=mx+b$ is equal to $m$.  So, the line must take the form $y=-7x+b$.  Next, substitute the point $(3,0)$ and solve for $b$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=-7(3)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-21+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 21&=b\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $m+b$ is $-7+21=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's remember our special formula for a line, y = mx + b. The slope $m$ helps us climb up or down the line, and the $b$ just helps us know where to start on the up and down. We know the slope is -7 and that the line contains the point (3,0). So, if we fit everything in, we can figure out $m+b$. Let's just go step by step and figure it out together!",
