    "solution": "We solve each equation separately. First off, we have $8x^2 + 7x - 1 = (8x-1)(x+1) = 0.$ We can also see that $24x^2+53x-7 = (8x-1)(3x+7) = 0.$ It is clear that both equations are satisfied only when $8x - 1 = 0,$ therefore $x = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}}.$",

By adding $(1/8)$ and $(-1)$ to the above system, it becomes an inconsistent system, which tells us a contradiction in our original assumption. Thus, it can be concluded that no such value of $x$ satisfying the given conditions exists.",
