    "solution": "We solve each equation separately. First off, we have $8x^2 + 7x - 1 = (8x-1)(x+1) = 0.$ We can also see that $24x^2+53x-7 = (8x-1)(3x+7) = 0.$ It is clear that both equations are satisfied only when $8x - 1 = 0,$ therefore $x = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}}.$",

Let's count them... 8x^2 + 24x^2 = 32x^2... and 7x + 53x = 60x... I think we are getting close! But what about the numbers... let's add them up too...\n\n-1 + (-7) = -8... So, the equation is 32x^2 + 60x - 8 = 0... Now let's try to find the value for x!\n\nHmm... maybe we can divide each term by a number to make it simpler... Maybe we can divide everything by 8... Let's see:\n\n32x^2/8 + 60x/8 - 8/8 = 0... That's 4x^2 + 7.5x - 1 = 0... Let's see if we can find x now...\n\nI think we need to find a common fraction for this... Maybe if we factor or use shapes we can find the answer. Hope this helps! Math is fun!",
