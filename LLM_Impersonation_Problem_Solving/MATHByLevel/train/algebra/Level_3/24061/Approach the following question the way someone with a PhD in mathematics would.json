    "solution": "Since $(4, -3)$ lies on the line, we plug $x = 4$ and $y = -3$ into the equation to get $1 - 4k = -3\\cdot -3 \\Rightarrow k = \\boxed{-2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of $k$ for which the line $1-kx = -3y$ contains the point $(4,-3)$, we must substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation and solve for $k$.\n\nSubstituting $x=4$ and $y=-3$ into the equation, we get:\n$1 - k(4) = -3(-3)$\n$1 - 4k = 9$\n$-4k = 8$\n$k = -2$\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ for which the line $1-kx = -3y$ contains the point $(4,-3)$ is $k=-2$.",
