    "solution": "Since $(4, -3)$ lies on the line, we plug $x = 4$ and $y = -3$ into the equation to get $1 - 4k = -3\\cdot -3 \\Rightarrow k = \\boxed{-2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... Let's see. The equation is $1-kx = -3y$. We want to find a value for $k$ so that this line passes through the point $(4,-3)$. \n\nFirst, let's plug in the values for $x$ and $y$ from the point into the equation. \nSo, $1-k(4) = -3(-3)$. \nSimplifying, we get $1-4k = 9$. \n\nNow we need to solve for $k$. Let's start by moving $1$ to the other side of the equation. \nSo, $-4k = 8$. \n\nAnd finally, let's solve for $k$ by dividing both sides by $-4$. \nThat gives us $k = -2$. \n\nYay! So the value of $k$ that makes the line pass through the point $(4,-3)$ is $-2$.",
