One endpoint of a diameter is at $(-1,-1)$.  What are the coordinates of the other endpoint of this diameter?  Express your answer as an ordered pair.",

Since the opposite ends of a diameter are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we must travel the same distance and direction from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ as we do from $(2,3)$ to the other endpoint.  To go from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ we run $3$ (left dashed red line) and rise $4$ (left dashed blue line), so our other endpoint has coordinates $(2+3,3+4)=\\boxed{(5,7)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter, we first need to find the distance between the center of the circle, $(2,3)$, and one endpoint of the diameter, $(-1,-1)$. \n\nTo find the distance between two points, we use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. \n\nSo, the distance between $(2,3)$ and $(-1,-1)$ is $\\sqrt{(-1-2)^2 + (-1-3)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$. \n\nSince the distance between the two points is the diameter of the circle, the diameter is 5 units long. Thus, the other endpoint of the diameter must be 5 units away from the center of the circle.\n\nSince we know that the distance from the center of the circle to the other endpoint of the diameter is 5 units, we can find the coordinates by moving 5 units in any direction from the center of the circle. \n\nOne way to do this is to move 5 units horizontally from the center. Since the center is at (2,3), moving 5 units horizontally means adding 5 to the x-coordinate. \n\nSo, the x-coordinate of the other endpoint is $2 + 5 = 7$. \n\nSince we are moving horizontally to the right, the y-coordinate remains the same as the center, so the y-coordinate of the other endpoint is $3$. \n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter are $(7,3)$.",
