One endpoint of a diameter is at $(-1,-1)$.  What are the coordinates of the other endpoint of this diameter?  Express your answer as an ordered pair.",

Since the opposite ends of a diameter are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we must travel the same distance and direction from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ as we do from $(2,3)$ to the other endpoint.  To go from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ we run $3$ (left dashed red line) and rise $4$ (left dashed blue line), so our other endpoint has coordinates $(2+3,3+4)=\\boxed{(5,7)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter, we first need to find the coordinates of the center of the circle $O$ and then use this information to find the radius of the circle.\n\nThe center of the circle $O$ is at $(2,3)$ and one endpoint of the diameter is at $(-1,-1)$. The coordinates of the center and one endpoint of the diameter can be used to find the radius of the circle using the distance formula. \n\nThe distance formula between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2} \\]\n\nIn this case, the center of the circle $O (2,3)$ and one endpoint of the diameter $(-1,-1)$ are given.

Since the diameter of a circle is twice the length of the radius, the diameter of the circle $O$ is $2 \\times 5 = 10$. \n\nNow, with the center $(2,3)$ and the radius 5, we can find the other endpoint of the diameter. Since the diameter joins two points on the circle, the other endpoint will be $10$ units away from the center in the opposite direction of the first endpoint $(-1,-1)$.\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate the other endpoint coordinates as:\n\\[ \\text{Other endpoint} = (2-2 \\times \\frac{-1-2}{5}, 3-2 \\times \\frac{-1-3}{5}) = (2+2 \\times \\frac{3}{5}, 3+2\\times \\frac{4}{5}) \\]\n\\[ = (2+ \\frac{6}{5}, 3+\\frac{8}{5}) = (\\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{23}{5}) \\]\n\nThus, the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter are $\\boxed{(\\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{23}{5})}$.",
