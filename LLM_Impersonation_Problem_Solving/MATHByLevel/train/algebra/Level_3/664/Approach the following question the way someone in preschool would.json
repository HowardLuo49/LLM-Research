One endpoint of a diameter is at $(-1,-1)$.  What are the coordinates of the other endpoint of this diameter?  Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "solution": "[asy]\ndraw((-7,0)--(11,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,11),Arrows);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(12,0)); label(\"$y$\",(-1,11));\ndraw(Circle((2,3),5));\ndot((2,3)); dot((-1,-1));\nlabel(\"(2,3)\",(2,3),W);\nlabel(\"(-1,-1)\",(-1,-1),W);\ndraw((-1,-1)--(2,-1),dashed+red); draw((2,-1)--(2,3),dashed+blue);\ndraw((2,3)--(5,3),dashed+red); draw((5,3)--(5,7),dashed+blue);\ndot((5,7));\nlabel(\"(?,?)\",(5,7),E);\n[/asy]\n\nRefer to the above diagram.  Since the opposite ends of a diameter are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we must travel the same distance and direction from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ as we do from $(2,3)$ to the other endpoint.  To go from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ we run $3$ (left dashed red line) and rise $4$ (left dashed blue line), so our other endpoint has coordinates $(2+3,3+4)=\\boxed{(5,7)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's find the other endpoint of the diameter. First, let's remember that a diameter goes through the center of the circle. So since the center of the circle is at $(2,3)$ and one endpoint is at $(-1,-1)$, we need to go the same distance from the center in the other direction.\n\nTo find that distance, let's count how many units we need to go from the center to the endpoint we already know. From $(2,3)$ to $(-1,-1)$ we go left 3 units and down 4 units. So we need to go right 3 units and up 4 units to find the other endpoint.\n\nStarting at $(2,3)$, we go right 3 units to get to $(5,3)$ and then up 4 units to get to $(5,7)$. So the coordinates of the other endpoint of the diameter are $(5,7)$. Yay, we did it!",
