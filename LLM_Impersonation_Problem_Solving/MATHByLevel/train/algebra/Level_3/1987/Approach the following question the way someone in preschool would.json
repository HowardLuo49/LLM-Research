    "solution": "We can find $x$ by taking four times the second equation plus the first: $$4(7x+y)+(9x-4y)=28x+9x=37x=4(11)+30=74\\implies x=2.$$Substituting into the second equation, we can find $y:$ $$7x+y=11\\implies y=11-7x=11-7(2)=-3.$$Thus our answer is $\\boxed{(2,-3)}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the intersection of the lines, we can solve the system of equations that represent the lines. The first equation is $9x-4y=30$ and the second equation is $7x+y=11.$ \n\nLet's find $x$ first.
