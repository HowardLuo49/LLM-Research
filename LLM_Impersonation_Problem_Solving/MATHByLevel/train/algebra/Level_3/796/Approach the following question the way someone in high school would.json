    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Margo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes. Using the same route, it takes Margo 20 minutes to get back home. If her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, how many total miles did she walk?",
    "solution": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many total miles Margo walked, we need to first find the distance from her house to her friend's house. Since it took her 10 minutes to walk there, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find the distance.\n\nDistance from house to friend's house = 4 miles per hour x (10 minutes/60 minutes) \n= 4 miles per hour x 0.167 hours\n= 0.67 miles\n\nNext, we need to find the distance from her friend's house back to her own house. Since it took her 20 minutes to walk home, we can use the same formula to find the distance.\n\nDistance from friend's house to house = 4 miles per hour x (20 minutes/60 minutes) \n= 4 miles per hour x 0.333 hours\n= 1.33 miles\n\nNow, we can add up the two distances to find the total miles Margo walked.\n\nTotal miles walked = 0.67 miles + 1.33 miles\n= 2 miles\n\nTherefore, Margo walked a total of 2 miles.",
