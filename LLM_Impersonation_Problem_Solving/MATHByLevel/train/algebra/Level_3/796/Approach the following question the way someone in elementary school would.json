    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Margo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes. Using the same route, it takes Margo 20 minutes to get back home. If her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, how many total miles did she walk?",
    "solution": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we know it took Margo 10 minutes to walk to her friend's house. Then it took her 20 minutes to walk back home. That means she spent a total of 30 minutes walking.\n\nSince her average speed was 4 miles per hour, we need to figure out how far she walked in 30 minutes. To do that, we need to convert 30 minutes into hours. 30 minutes is half of an hour, so that means Margo walked for 0.5 hours.\n\nNow we multiply her average speed of 4 miles per hour by the time she walked, which is 0.5 hours. 4 miles per hour x 0.5 hours = 2 miles.\n\nSo Margo walked a total of 2 miles.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: Ok, so first we know it took Margo 10 minutes to walk to her friend's house. Then it took her 20 minutes to walk back home.
