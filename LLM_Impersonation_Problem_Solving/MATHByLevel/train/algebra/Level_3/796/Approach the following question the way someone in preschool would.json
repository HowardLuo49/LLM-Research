Using the same route, it takes Margo 20 minutes to get back home. If her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, how many total miles did she walk?",
    "solution": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Let's imagine that Margo is going on a fun adventure! First, she walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes. That's not too far, so she must be walking pretty fast. Then, when it's time to go back home, it takes her 20 minutes. Maybe she's taking her time and enjoying the scenery. \n\nSince Margo's average walking rate for the whole trip is 4 miles per hour, we can figure out how far she walked by adding up the distances for each leg of the trip. \n\nFirst, let's figure out how far she walked to her friend's house. Since she walked at 4 miles per hour and it took her 10 minutes, we can use the formula distance = speed x time. So, 4 miles/hour x 10 minutes = 40 minutes/hour. \n\nNext, let's figure out how far she walked back home. Since she walked at 4 miles per hour and it took her 20 minutes, we can do the same calculation. 4 miles/hour x 20 minutes = 80 minutes/hour. \n\nNow, we can add up the distances for each leg of the trip. 40 minutes/hour + 80 minutes/hour = 120 minutes. \n\nBut wait! We need to convert that into hours to figure out the total distance. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 120 minutes is equal to 2 hours. \n\nSo, Margo walked a total of 4 miles per hour x 2 hours = 8 miles. Yay, Margo! She had a great adventure and got some exercise too!",
