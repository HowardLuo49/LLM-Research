    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's see...we see a bunch of numbers and letters mixed together in this problem. We need to make sure we keep all the letters with the same letter group and all the numbers with the same number group.\n\nSo, we have $(x^{22}-3x^{5} + x^{-2} - 7)\\cdot(5x^4)$. We want to multiply $(x^{22}-3x^{5} + x^{-2} - 7)$ by $5x^4$.\n\nLet's start by multiplying $x^{22}$ by $5x^4$. Remember when we multiply with the same base, we add the exponents, so $x^{22} \\cdot 5x^4 = 5x^{22+4} = 5x^{26}$.\n\nNext, let's multiply $-3x^5$ by $5x^4$. That gives us $-3\\cdot 5 \\cdot x^{5+4} = -15x^9$.\n\nNow, let's multiply $x^{-2}$ by $5x^4$. When we multiply with negative exponents, we move them to the denominator. So $x^{-2}\\cdot 5x^4 = 5x^{4-2} = 5x^2$.\n\nLastly, let's multiply $-7$ by $5x^4$. That gives us $-35x^4$.\n\nNow, let's put all the pieces together: $5x^{26} - 15x^9 + 5x^2 - 35x^4$.
