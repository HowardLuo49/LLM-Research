    "gpt_response": "To evaluate the expression $\\lfloor 3.2\\rfloor$, we must consider the definition of the floor function. The floor function, denoted by $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. In this case, for $x = 3.2$, the greatest integer less than or equal to 3.2 is 3. Therefore, $\\lfloor 3.2\\rfloor = 3$.",
