    "solution": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5a+2b&=0, \\\\\nb-2&=a.\n\\end{align*}Making the substitution for $a$ from the second equation to the first, we get $5(b-2)+2b=0$, which simplifies to $7b-10=0$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=\\frac{10}{7}$. Hence $7b=7\\cdot \\frac{10}{7}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first express $a$ in terms of $b$ using the given information $a$ is two less than $b$. This can be represented mathematically as $a = b - 2$. \n\nNext, we substitute this expression back into the initial equation $5a + 2b = 0$ to eliminate $a$ and solve for $b. \n\nSubstituting $a = b - 2$ into $5a + 2b = 0$, we get:\n$5(b - 2) + 2b = 0$\n$5b - 10 + 2b = 0$\n$7b - 10 = 0$\n$7b = 10$\nThus, $7b$ equals $10$.",
