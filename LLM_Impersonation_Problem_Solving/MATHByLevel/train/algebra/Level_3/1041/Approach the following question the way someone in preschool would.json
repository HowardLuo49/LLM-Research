    "solution": "Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $x^2-x-6=14 \\Rightarrow x^2-x-20=0$. Since in a quadratic  with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $1/1=\\boxed{1}$.",

Let's check! \n\n$(5+2)(5-3)=7\\cdot 2=14$! It works! So one possible value of $x$ is 5, which means the other possible value is 2. \n\nNow let's add them up to find the sum. 5 + 2 = 7.
