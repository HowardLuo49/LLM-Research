    "solution": "The number of cans in each row form an arithmetic sequence, with first term 1 and common difference 2.  If there are $n$ terms, then the terms are 1, 3, $\\dots$, $2n - 1$.\n\nThe total number of cans is therefore the sum of the arithmetic series \\[1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2n - 1).\\]The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[1 + (2n - 1)]/2 \\cdot n = n^2$.\n\nThen from $n^2 = 100$, we get $n = \\boxed{10}$.",
