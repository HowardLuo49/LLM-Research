    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A grocer makes a display of cans in which the top row has one can and each lower row has two more cans than the row above it. If the display contains 100 cans, how many rows does it contain?",
    "solution": "The number of cans in each row form an arithmetic sequence, with first term 1 and common difference 2.  If there are $n$ terms, then the terms are 1, 3, $\\dots$, $2n - 1$.\n\nThe total number of cans is therefore the sum of the arithmetic series \\[1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2n - 1).\\]The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[1 + (2n - 1)]/2 \\cdot n = n^2$.\n\nThen from $n^2 = 100$, we get $n = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the number of rows in the display as \\(n\\). \n\nThe number of cans in each row can be represented as an arithmetic series with the first term being 1 and the common difference being 2. Thus, the number of cans in the \\(i^{th}\\) row can be expressed as:\n\n\\(a_i = 1 + 2(i-1) = 2i - 1\\)\n\nThe total number of cans in the display can be found by summing the terms of this arithmetic series:\n\n\\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2(1) + 2(n-1)] = n^2\\)\n\nGiven that the total number of cans in the display is 100, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\(n^2 = 100\\)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\(n = 10\\)\n\nTherefore, the display contains 10 rows.",
