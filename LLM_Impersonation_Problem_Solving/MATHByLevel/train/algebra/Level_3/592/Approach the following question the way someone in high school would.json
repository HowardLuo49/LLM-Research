    "solution": "The number of cans in each row form an arithmetic sequence, with first term 1 and common difference 2.  If there are $n$ terms, then the terms are 1, 3, $\\dots$, $2n - 1$.\n\nThe total number of cans is therefore the sum of the arithmetic series \\[1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2n - 1).\\]The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[1 + (2n - 1)]/2 \\cdot n = n^2$.\n\nThen from $n^2 = 100$, we get $n = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out the pattern in the number of cans in each row. \n\nLet's start by setting up the equation. Let x represent the number of rows. \n\nThe first row has 1 can.\nThe second row has 1 + 2 = 3 cans.\nThe third row has 3 + 2 = 5 cans.\nAnd so on...\n\nWe can represent this pattern with the equation: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2x-1) = 100\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the series. One way to do this is to find the average of the first and last term, then multiply by the number of terms. \n\nFirst term = 1\nLast term = 2x - 1\n\nAverage = (1 + (2x-1)) / 2 = x\n\nNumber of terms = x\n\nSum = x * x = x^2\n\nNow we can set x^2 = 100 and solve for x.\n\nx^2 = 100\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the display contains 10 rows.",
