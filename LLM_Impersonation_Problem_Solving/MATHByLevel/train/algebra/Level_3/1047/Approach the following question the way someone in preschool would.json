For the first expression, we can multiply 2x by x and then 2x by 7, and then multiply -5 by x and -5 by 7. \n\nFor the second expression, we do the same thing. We multiply x by 2x and then -1 by 5. \n\nAfter we multiply everything out, we can then subtract the second expression from the first expression to find our answer.\n\nI hope this helps!
