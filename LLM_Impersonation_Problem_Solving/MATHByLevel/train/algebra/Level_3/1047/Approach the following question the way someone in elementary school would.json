    "solution": "We expand each product separately: \\begin{align*}\n(2x-5)(x+7) &= 2x(x) + 2x(7) -5(x) -5(7)\\\\\n&=2x^2 +14x - 5x -35\\\\\n&= 2x^2 +9x - 35\n\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}\n(x+5)(2x-1) &=x(2x) + x(-1) +5(2x) + 5(-1)\\\\\n&=2x^2 -x + 10x -5\\\\\n&=2x^2 +9x - 5.\n\\end{align*}So, we have  \\begin{align*}&\\ \\ \\ \\ (2x-5)(x+7) - (x+5)(2x-1) \\\\&= 2x^2+9x -35 - (2x^2 +9x -5) = \\boxed{-30}.\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "First, you distribute the numbers inside the parentheses. So, for $(2x - 5)(x + 7)$, you would multiply $2x$ by $x$ and $-5$ by $x$ and $2x$ by $7$ and $-5$ by $7$. Then do the same for $(x + 5)(2x - 1)$. Next, you subtract the second set of parentheses from the first set of parentheses by just subtracting each term from each other. Let me do the math: \n\n$$(2x - 5)(x + 7) - (x + 5)(2x - 1)$$\n$$= 2x \\cdot x + 2x \\cdot 7 - 5 \\cdot x - 5 \\cdot 7 - x \\cdot 2x - x \\cdot (-1) - 5 \\cdot 2x - 5 \\cdot (-1)$$\n$$= 2x^2 + 14x - 5x - 35 - 2x^2 + x - 10x + 5$$\n$$= 2x - 30$$\n\nSo, the answer simplified is $2x - 30$.",
