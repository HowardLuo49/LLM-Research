    "solution": "First we bring $3x$ to the left side to get  \\[x^2-7x-14=16.\\]Moving the 14 to the right side gives \\[x^2-7x=30.\\]We notice that the left side is almost the square $\\left(x-\\frac72\\right)^2=x^2-7x+\\frac{49}4$. Adding $\\frac{49}4$ to both sides lets us complete the square on the left-hand side, \\[x^2-7x+\\frac{49}4=30+\\frac{49}4=\\frac{169}4,\\]so  \\[\\left(x-\\frac72\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{13}2\\right)^2.\\]Therefore $x=\\frac72\\pm\\frac{13}2$.  The sum of these solutions is  \\[\\frac{7+13}2+\\frac{7-13}2=\\frac{14}2=\\boxed{7}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's play with numbers! We have a fun quadratic equation here: $x^2-4x-14=3x+16$. We want to find the sum of the two solutions. Hmm...let's see what happens if we solve this equation and find those solutions. \n\nLet's start by simplifying the equation a bit. We can rearrange things to get $x^2 - 4x - 3x = 16 + 14$. So, that would be $x^2 - 7x = 30$. \n\nOh, this is tricky! But don't worry, we can solve it. Let's try to factor the expression. Let's see... if we have $x$ and $x$ in our answer, what could go in the parentheses? Hmm...maybe $x-5$ and $x+6$. Let's try it out! \n\nSo, $x^2 - 7x = (x-5)(x+6)$...wait a minute, that doesn't quite work! Let's go back and try another way. We can use the quadratic formula! \n\nSo, the quadratic formula is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. In our equation, $a=1$, $b=-7$, and $c=-30$. Plugging in those values, we get $x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49+120}}{2}$. Simplifying that gives us $x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{2}$. \n\nOh, wow! Now we have our two solutions: $x = \\frac{7 + 13}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{7 - 13}{2}$. So the two solutions are $x = 10$ and $x = -3$. \n\nTo find the sum of these solutions, we just add them together! $10 + (-3) = 7$. Yay, we found the sum of the solutions! Great job, math explorer!",
