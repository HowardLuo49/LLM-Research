    "solution": "We note that $\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 9^t} = 3 \\cdot 3^t$. The equation becomes: \\begin{align*}\n3 \\cdot 3^t + 3 \\cdot 3^t &= 18\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 6 \\cdot 3^t &= 18 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3^t &= 3.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $t = \\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve for t, we first need to simplify the equation. \n\nFirst, simplify $3 \\cdot 3^t$ to $3^{t+1}$ since they both have the same base.\n\nNext, simplify $\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 9^t}$ to $3 \\cdot 3^t$ since the square root of 9 is 3.\n\nNow our equation becomes $3^{t+1} + 3 \\cdot 3^t = 18$.\n\nWe can factor out a $3^t$ to get $3^t(3 + 3) = 18$.\n\nThis simplifies to $6 \\cdot 3^t = 18$.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6 to get $3^t = 3$.\n\nFinally, take the logarithm of both sides to solve for t: $t = \\log_3(3)$.\n\nThus, $t = 1$.",
