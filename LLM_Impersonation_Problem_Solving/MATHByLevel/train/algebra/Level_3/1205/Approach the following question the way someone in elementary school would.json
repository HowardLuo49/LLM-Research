    "solution": "We note that $\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 9^t} = 3 \\cdot 3^t$. The equation becomes: \\begin{align*}\n3 \\cdot 3^t + 3 \\cdot 3^t &= 18\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 6 \\cdot 3^t &= 18 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3^t &= 3.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $t = \\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the equation by using the properties of exponents. $3 \\cdot 3^t$ is just $3^{1+t}$, and $\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 9^t}$ is $3 \\cdot 3^t$. So the equation becomes $3^{1+t} + 3 \\cdot 3^t = 18$.\n\nNext, notice that both terms have a factor of $3^t$ in them. So let's factor that out: $3^t(3 + 3) = 18$. Simplifying further, we get $6 \\cdot 3^t = 18$.\n\nNow we just need to isolate $3^t$. Divide both sides by 6 to get $3^t = 3$. Since $3 = 3^1$, we can see that $t$ must be 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution to $3 \\cdot 3^t + \\sqrt{9 \\cdot 9^t} = 18$ is $t = 1$.",
