    "solution": "We have that $c=4d$, $b=2c$, and $a=3b$ and thus we can use the equations $c=4d$, $b=8d$, and $a=24d$ to find the value of the expression.  Plugging in these values we get $\\frac{24d \\cdot 4d}{8d \\cdot d}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's assign some variables to represent the values in the question. Let's say $b = 1$ (since it's easiest to start with a value of 1). Then we know that $a = 3b = 3$, $c = 2b = 2$, and $d = \\frac{c}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = 0.5$. \n\nNow we can plug these values into the expression $\\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}$:\n\n$\\frac{3\\cdot 2}{1\\cdot 0.5}$\n\n$= \\frac{6}{0.5}$\n\n$= 12$\n\nSo, the value of $\\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}$ when $b = 1$ is 12.",
