    "solution": "We have that $c=4d$, $b=2c$, and $a=3b$ and thus we can use the equations $c=4d$, $b=8d$, and $a=24d$ to find the value of the expression.  Plugging in these values we get $\\frac{24d \\cdot 4d}{8d \\cdot d}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out the relationships between the variables. If $a$ is three times $b$, that means $a = 3b$. If $b$ is twice $c$, that means $b = 2c$. And if $c$ is four times $d$, that means $c = 4d$. \n\nNow, let's substitute these values into $\\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}$. Since $a = 3b$, we can substitute $3b$ for $a$. And since $b = 2c$, we can substitute $2c$ for $b. Finally, since $c = 4d$, we can substitute $4d$ for $c$.\n\nNow, let's plug these relationships into $\\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}$:\n\n$\\frac{3b \\cdot 4d}{2c \\cdot d} = \\frac{12bd}{2(4d)} = \\frac{12bd}{8d} = 1.5b$\n\nSo, the value of $\\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}$ is 1.5 times $b$.",
