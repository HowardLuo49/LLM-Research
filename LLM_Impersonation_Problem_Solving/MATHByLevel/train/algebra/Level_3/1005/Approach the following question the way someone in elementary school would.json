    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\\$$660. How many days did he not work?",
    "solution": "Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 20 \\\\\n60x - 30y &= 660 \\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use some math to figure this out! We know that Sam earned $\\$$660 in total for the 20 days. \n\nOn the days that he worked, he earned $\\$$60 each day. So if we let the number of days that he worked be x, then the amount he earned from working is $60x.\n\nOn the days that he didn't work, $\\$$30 was subtracted from his earnings each day. So if we let the number of days he didn't work be y, then the amount subtracted from his earnings is $30y.\n\nWe can write an equation to represent the total amount he earned: $60x - $30y = $660.\n\nSince we know that he worked a total of 20 days, we can say that x + y = 20.\n\nNow we have a system of equations to solve:\n60x - 30y = 660\nx + y = 20\n\nTo solve this, we can use substitution or elimination method.\n\nLet's use substitution.
