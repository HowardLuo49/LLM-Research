    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\\$$660. How many days did he not work?",
    "solution": "Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 20 \\\\\n60x - 30y &= 660 \\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's call the number of days Sam worked as \"x\" and the number of days he did not work as \"y\". We know that Sam worked for 20 days in total, so we can write the equation: x + y = 20.\n\nWe also know that on days he works, he earns $60, so the total amount he earns from working is 60x. On days he does not work, $30 is subtracted from his earnings, so the total amount subtracted is 30y. In total, he received $660, so we can write the equation: 60x - 30y = 660.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\nx + y = 20\n60x - 30y = 660\n\nLet's solve for x in the first equation: x = 20 - y\n\nSubstitute x = 20 - y into the second equation:\n60(20 - y) - 30y = 660\n1200 - 60y - 30y = 660\n1200 - 90y = 660\n-90y = -540\ny = 6\n\nSo, Sam did not work for 6 days.",
