    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\\$$660. How many days did he not work?",
    "solution": "Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 20 \\\\\n60x - 30y &= 660 \\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! Sam works for 20 days and earns $\\$$60 each day. We can count by 60s - 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 540, 600, 660! So, we know that Sam earned $\\$$660 for when he did work.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many days Sam did not work. At the end, he received $\\$$660 and if he worked for all 20 days, he would have earned $\\$$60 * 20 = $\\$$1200. So, he must have not worked for $\\$$1200 - $\\$$660 = $\\$$540.\n\nRemember, for each day he does not work, $\\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. To figure out how many days he did not work, we can divide $\\$$540 by $\\$$30. \n\nSo, 540 \u00f7 30 = 18. This means Sam did not work for 18 days. \n\nGreat job counting and problem-solving!",
