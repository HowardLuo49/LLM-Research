    "solution": "For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $1 + 2 + \\dots + 102 = 102 \\cdot 103/2 = 5253$.  The remainder when 5253 is divided by 5250 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the first 102 counting numbers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\nS_n = n/2 * (first term + last term)\nwhere S_n is the sum of the first n terms, n is the number of terms, and the first term is 1.\n\nPlugging in the values for n = 102 and first term = 1:\nS_102 = 102/2 * (1 + 102)\nS_102 = 51 * 103\nS_102 = 5253\n\nNow, to find the remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250, we can use the division algorithm:\n5253 = 5250 * q + r\nwhere q is the quotient and r is the remainder.\n\nDividing 5253 by 5250 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 3. Therefore, the remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250 is 3.",
