    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The equation $x^2-4x+7=19$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\\geq b$. What is the value of $2a+b$?",
    "solution": "Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16$, which indicates that the fastest way to solve this problem would be to complete the square. Thus, we have $(x-2)^2=16$, or $x-2=\\pm4$, or $x=6$ and $x=-2$. Since $a\\geq b$, we now know that $a=6$ and $b=-2$, so $2a+b=2(6)-2=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the values of $a$ and $b$, we first need to solve the quadratic equation $x^2-4x+7=19$. This can be rewritten as $x^2-4x-12=0$. Using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2-4(1)(-12)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16+48}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 8}{2}$. \nThus, we have $x=6$ and $x=-2$. Since $a\\geq b$, we have $a=6$ and $b=-2$. Therefore, $2a+b=2(6)+(-2)=12-2=10$. Therefore, the value of $2a+b$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
