    "solution": "Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16$, which indicates that the fastest way to solve this problem would be to complete the square. Thus, we have $(x-2)^2=16$, or $x-2=\\pm4$, or $x=6$ and $x=-2$. Since $a\\geq b$, we now know that $a=6$ and $b=-2$, so $2a+b=2(6)-2=\\boxed{10}$.",
