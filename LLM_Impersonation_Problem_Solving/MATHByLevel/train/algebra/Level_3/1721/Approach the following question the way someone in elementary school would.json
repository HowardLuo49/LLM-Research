    "solution": "Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16$, which indicates that the fastest way to solve this problem would be to complete the square. Thus, we have $(x-2)^2=16$, or $x-2=\\pm4$, or $x=6$ and $x=-2$. Since $a\\geq b$, we now know that $a=6$ and $b=-2$, so $2a+b=2(6)-2=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to solve the equation $x^2-4x+7=19$. Since the solutions are $a$ and $b$, we can start by setting up the equation as $(x-a)(x-b)=0$. Then we can expand it to get $x^2-(a+b)x+ab=0$. Since the coefficient of $x$ is $-4$, we know that $a+b=4$. Also, since $ab=7-19=-12$, we know that the only possible values of $a$ and $b$ are $6$ and $-2$, or $-6$ and $2$, which satisfy the condition that $a\\geq b$. Therefore, our solutions are $a=6$ and $b=-2$. Finally, we find the value of $2a+b=2(6)+(-2)=12-2=\\boxed{10}$.",
