    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A rectangular room measures 12-feet by 6-feet. How many square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room?",
    "solution": "The area of the room is $(12\\text{ ft.}) (6\\text{ ft.})=72$ square feet.  Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet.  Therefore, $72/9=\\boxed{8}$ square yards are needed to cover the floor.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of square yards of carpet needed to cover the floor of the rectangular room, we first need to calculate the total area of the floor in square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the room measures 12 feet by 6 feet, so the area of the floor is 12 feet * 6 feet = 72 square feet.\n\nNext, we convert the area from square feet to square yards since carpet is typically sold by the square yard. There are 3 feet in a yard, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 square feet in a square yard. Therefore, to convert from square feet to square yards, we divide the area in square feet by 9:\n\n72 square feet / 9 = 8 square yards\n\nTherefore, 8 square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the rectangular room.",
