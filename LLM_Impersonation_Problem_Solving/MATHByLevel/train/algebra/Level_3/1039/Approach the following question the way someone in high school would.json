    "solution": "Let the two solutions to the equation be $x_1$ and $x_2,$ where $x_1>x_2. $ It follows that  \\[x_1 - x_2 = (x_1+5)-(x_2+5) = 20 - (-20) = \\boxed{40}.\\]",

The positive difference between the two solutions is the larger solution minus the smaller solution.\n\nTo find the two solutions, we need to set up two equations: $x + 5 = 20$ and $x + 5 = -20$. Solving these equations, we get $x = 15$ and $x = -25$.\n\nTo find the positive difference between these two solutions, we subtract the smaller solution from the larger solution: $15 - (-25) = 15 + 25 = 40$. \n\nTherefore, the positive difference between the two solutions of $|x + 5| = 20$ is 40.",
