    "solution": "The horizontal separation between $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $4-1=3$ units.  The vertical separation between the points is $7-1=6$ units.  Therefore, the segment whose endpoints are (1,1) and (4,7) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs measure 3 units and 6 units.  By the Pythagorean, the length of this segment is $\\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=3\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the distance between two points in a Cartesian coordinate system, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Let $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be the two points. The distance between $P_1$ and $P_2$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$\n\nIn this case, $P_1 = (1,1)$ and $P_2 = (4,7)$. Plugging in the coordinates into the formula, we get:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (7-1)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 36} = \\sqrt{45}$$\n\nSince the square root of 45 cannot be simplified further, the distance between $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $\\sqrt{45}$.",
