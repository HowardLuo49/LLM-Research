    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Find the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$. Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "solution": "The horizontal separation between $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $4-1=3$ units.  The vertical separation between the points is $7-1=6$ units.  Therefore, the segment whose endpoints are (1,1) and (4,7) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs measure 3 units and 6 units.  By the Pythagorean, the length of this segment is $\\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=3\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's draw some dots on a piece of paper to represent the points. Here is one dot for point (1,1) and another dot for point (4,7). Now let's count how many squares it takes to get from one dot to the other. We count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 squares. So the distance between the two points is 7 squares. Since we're in preschool, we don't know how to calculate the exact distance between the points using the distance formula, so the simplest form of our answer is just 7 squares.",
