    "solution": "Since $58=2\\cdot29$ and $203=7\\cdot29$, we can factor a $29x^5$ from the expression, to get $$58x^5-203x^{11}=\\boxed{-29x^5(7x^6-2)}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To factor this expression, we first need to find the greatest common factor of the coefficients. In this case, the greatest common factor of 58 and 203 is 1.\n\nNext, we look at the variables. The variable in each term is x, and the lowest power of x is x^5. Therefore, we can factor out an x^5 from both terms.\n\nSo, the factored form of the expression is:\n\nx^5(58-203x^6)\n\nTherefore, the factored form of 58x^5-203x^11 is x^5(58-203x^6).",
