    "solution": "We see that we can rewrite the left side of the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35$ as $(2x - 7)(4x - 5)$, so we have $(2x - 7)(4x - 5) = 0$. Thus, solving the equations $2x - 7 = 0$ and $4x - 5 = 0$ gives us $x = 3.5$ and $x = 1.25$ as our solutions. Since $1.25 < 3.5$, our final answer is $x = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest value of $x$, we need to solve the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$. We can use the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\n\nPlugging in the values $a = 8$, $b = -38$, and $c = 35$, we get: $x = \\frac{38 \\pm \\sqrt{(-38)^2 - 4(8)(35)}}{2(8)}$.\n\nSimplifying this, we get: $x = \\frac{38 \\pm \\sqrt{1444}}{16}$.
