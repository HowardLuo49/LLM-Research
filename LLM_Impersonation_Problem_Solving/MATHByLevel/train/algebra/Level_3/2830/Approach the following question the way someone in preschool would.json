    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "solution": "We see that we can rewrite the left side of the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35$ as $(2x - 7)(4x - 5)$, so we have $(2x - 7)(4x - 5) = 0$. Thus, solving the equations $2x - 7 = 0$ and $4x - 5 = 0$ gives us $x = 3.5$ and $x = 1.25$ as our solutions. Since $1.25 < 3.5$, our final answer is $x = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We have to find a number that we can put into the equation to make it equal to 0. Let's try some numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on until we find the right one. Okay, let's start with 1.\n\nWhen we plug in 1 for x, we get 8(1)^2 - 38(1) + 35 = 8 - 38 + 35 = 5. That's not 0, so let's try 2.\n\nWhen we plug in 2 for x, we get 8(2)^2 - 38(2) + 35 = 32 - 76 + 35 = -9. That's still not 0, so let's try 3.\n\nWhen we plug in 3 for x, we get 8(3)^2 - 38(3) + 35 = 72 - 114 + 35 = -7. That's not 0 either. Hmm, maybe we should try a smaller number.\n\nLet's try 0.5. When we plug in 0.5 for x, we get 8(0.5)^2 - 38(0.5) + 35 = 2 - 19 + 35 = 18. That's also not 0. Let's try 0.25.\n\nWhen we plug in 0.25 for x, we get 8(0.25)^2 - 38(0.25) + 35 = 1 - 9.5 + 35 = 26.5. Still not 0. Hmm, maybe we should try an even smaller number.\n\nLet's try 0.1. When we plug in 0.1 for x, we get 8(0.1)^2 - 38(0.1) + 35 = 0.8 - 3.8 + 35 = 32. That's not 0 either. Maybe we need to try an even smaller number.\n\nLet's try 0.01. When we plug in 0.01 for x, we get 8(0.01)^2 - 38(0.01) + 35 = 0.08 - 0.38 + 35 = 34.7.
