    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, first we need to get $x$ by itself on one side of the equation. \n\nTo do that, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by $x+1$. This will cancel out the $x+1$ in the denominator on the left side of the equation. \n\nAfter we do this, we have $x^2 + x + 1 = (x+2)(x+1)$. \n\nNext, we can expand the right side of the equation to get $x^2 + x + 1 = x^2 + 3x + 2$. \n\nNow we can simplify the equation by subtracting $x^2 + x$ from both sides. \n\nAfter we do that, we get $1 = 2x + 2$. \n\nFinally, we can solve for $x$ by subtracting 2 from both sides and then dividing both sides by 2. \n\nAfter we do that, we get $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nSo, the solution to the equation is $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$.",
