I have some oxygen in a 2.28 liter container with a pressure of 5 kPa. If I move all of it to a 5.7 liter container at the same temperature, what will the new pressure be in kPa?",
    "solution": "Since the pressure $p$ of the oxygen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$. From the first container, we know that $k=2.28\\cdot5=11.4$. Consequently, when we move it to the 5.7 liter container, we get that $5.7p=11.4$, so $p=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To start, we know that pressure and volume are inversely proportional. This means that if the volume of the container gets bigger, the pressure will get smaller. So, since we are moving the oxygen from a 2.28 liter container to a 5.7 liter container, the pressure will decrease.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial pressure of the oxygen in the 2.28 liter container. We know that the pressure is 5 kPa. \n\nNext, we can set up a proportion to find the new pressure in the 5.7 liter container. Since the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume, we can write:\n\nInitial pressure / Initial volume = New pressure / New volume\n\n5 kPa / 2.28 L = New pressure / 5.7 L\n\nNow, cross multiply to solve for the new pressure:\n\n(5 kPa)(5.7 L) = (2.28 L)(New pressure)\n\n28.5 = 2.28 * New pressure\n\nDivide both sides by 2.28 to find the new pressure:\n\nNew pressure = 28.5 / 2.28\nNew pressure = 12.5 kPa\n\nSo, the new pressure of the oxygen in the 5.7 liter container will be 12.5 kPa.",
