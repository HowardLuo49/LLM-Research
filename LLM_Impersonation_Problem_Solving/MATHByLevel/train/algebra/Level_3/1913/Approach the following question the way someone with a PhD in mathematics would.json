At constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume. I have some oxygen in a 2.28 liter container with a pressure of 5 kPa. If I move all of it to a 5.7 liter container at the same temperature, what will the new pressure be in kPa?",
    "solution": "Since the pressure $p$ of the oxygen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$. From the first container, we know that $k=2.28\\cdot5=11.4$. Consequently, when we move it to the 5.7 liter container, we get that $5.7p=11.4$, so $p=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the pressure of the gas is inversely proportional to its volume, we can use the formula for inverse proportionality which states that P1*V1 = P2*V2, where P1 is the initial pressure, V1 is the initial volume, P2 is the final pressure, and V2 is the final volume.\n\nIn this case, we have P1 = 5 kPa, V1 = 2.28 liters, and V2 = 5.7 liters. We want to find P2.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n5 kPa * 2.28 L = P2 * 5.7 L\n\nP2 = (5 kPa * 2.38 L) / 5.7 L\n\nP2 = 2.1 kPa\n\nTherefore, the new pressure in the 5.7 liter container would be 2.1 kPa.",
