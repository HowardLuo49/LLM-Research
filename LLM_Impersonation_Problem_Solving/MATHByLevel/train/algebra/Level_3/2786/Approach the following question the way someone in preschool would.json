Half of 58 is 29, and when we add 1 to that, we get $\\#58 = 30$. \n\nNow, we need to put 30 into the formula again! So, we have $\\#(\\#58) = .5(30) + 1$. Let's find out what that equals! Half of 30 is 15, and then we add 1 to that, we get $\\#(\\#58) = 16$.\n\nOne more time! We put 16 into the formula one more time: $\\#(\\#(\\#58)) = .5(16) + 1$. Let's do this!
