    "solution": "The expression is only undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. Therefore, the goal is to find the product of all real $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2+2x-3=0$. Since the discriminant of this quadratic is $2^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 16$, which is positive, we know that the roots of $x^2 +2x-3$ are distinct real numbers.  The product of the roots of a quadratic of the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is equal to $\\frac{c}{a}$, so the desired product of the values of $x$ for which $x^2 + 2x - 3=0$ is $\\frac{-3}{1}$, or $\\boxed{-3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find the product of all the $x$ that make the expression not work. \n\nFirst, we see that the expression will be undefined if the denominator is equal to zero. So, let's find when $x^2+2x-3=0$. \n\nTo do that, we can factor the quadratic into $(x+3)(x-1)=0$.\n\nSo, the expression will be undefined when $x=-3$ or $x=1$.\n\nTherefore, the product of all the $x$ that make the expression undefined is $-3 \\times 1= -3$.",
