    "solution": "Since $4^2=16$, $\\log_7x$ must equal $2$. Writing the equation $\\log_7x=2$ in exponential form gives $7^2=x$, so $x=\\boxed{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the number 4 in the equation. That's like saying we have a square with 4 sides. Then it says we have a log base 7 of something. That sounds like a secret code guess so we will try to figure out what that is. Then we have 16, which is like having 4 groups of 4. So maybe we can think of a number that when we multiply it by itself 4 times we get 16. That number is 2! So if we look at the equation again, it's like saying 4 to the power of 2 equals 16. So our secret code number is 2. Let's put that into the equation to find $x$: $4^{\\log_7x}=16$ becomes $4^{\\log_7x}=4^2$. Since the base 4 is the same on both sides, we know that the exponents must be equal. So $\\log_7x=2$. Since $7^2=49$, we know that $x=49$. Yay, we solved the mystery and found the treasure!",
