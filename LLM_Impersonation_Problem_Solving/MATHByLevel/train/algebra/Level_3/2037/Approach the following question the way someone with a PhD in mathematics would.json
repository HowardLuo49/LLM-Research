    "solution": "Since $4^2=16$, $\\log_7x$ must equal $2$. Writing the equation $\\log_7x=2$ in exponential form gives $7^2=x$, so $x=\\boxed{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $x$, we first express $16$ as a power of $4$:\n\\[16 = 4^2\\]\n\nNext, we substitute $16$ as $4^2$ in the given equation:\n\\[4^{\\log_7x} = 4^2\\]\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\\[\\log_7x = 2\\]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the logarithmic equation in exponential form:\n\\[x = 7^2\\]\n\nTherefore, $x = 49$.",
