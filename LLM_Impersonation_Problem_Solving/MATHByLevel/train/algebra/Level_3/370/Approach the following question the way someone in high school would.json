    "solution": "Turning the division sign into multiplication and simplifying, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{2}{x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{4}&=.75 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{2}&=.75\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x}&=.25\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=\\boxed{4}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$ in this equation, we first need to simplify the expression on the left side. \n\nWe know that when we divide by a fraction, it's the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{2}{x} \\times \\frac{x}{4} = 0.75$. \n\nNext, we can add the fractions on the left side to get a single fraction. Simplifying the expression gives us $\\frac{1 + 2}{x} \\times \\frac{x}{4} = 0.75$. \n\nNow, we have $\\frac{3}{x} \\times \\frac{x}{4} = 0.75$. Multiplying the fractions gives us $\\frac{3x}{4x} = 0.75$. \n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate $x$ and solve for it. This gives us $\\frac{x}{4} = 0.25$. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we find that $x = 1$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ in the equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{2}{x} \\div \\frac{4}{x} = 0.75$ is $1$.",
