    "solution": "Expanding the left hand side of the given equation, we have $6x^2-17x-45=0$. Since for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the solutions of the given equation is $-\\frac{-17}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{6}}$.  (We also could have simply noted that the roots are $-5/3$ and $9/2$, and added these, but who likes adding fractions?)",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count how many solutions there are for the equation. We have the expression $(3x+5)(2x-9)$, so that means there are two sets of parentheses. This means there are two solutions!\n\nNext, let's find out what the solutions are. We can set each set of parentheses equal to zero to find the values of x that make the whole equation equal to zero. \n\nSo, we have $(3x+5) = 0$ and $(2x-9) = 0$. \n\nFor the first equation, we get $3x = -5$ and $x = -\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nFor the second equation, we get $2x = 9$ and $x = \\frac{9}{2}$.\n\nTo find the sum of the solutions, we add the two solutions together:\n\n$-\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{-10+27}{6} = \\frac{17}{6}$.\n\nSo, the sum of the solutions of the equation $(3x+5)(2x-9) = 0$ is $\\frac{17}{6}$.",
