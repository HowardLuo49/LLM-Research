    "solution": "Completing the square, we get $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(1, 2)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The center of a circle is like the middle point. To find it, we need to look for a trick with the numbers in the equation. Let's see... there are some numbers next to the x and y, like 2 and 4. Maybe those can help us find the center. We should try to complete the square for the x and y terms to make it easier, okay? Let's work together to find the center of the circle!",
