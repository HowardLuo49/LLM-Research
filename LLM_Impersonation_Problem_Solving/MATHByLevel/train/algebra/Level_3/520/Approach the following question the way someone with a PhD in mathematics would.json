    "solution": "Completing the square, we get $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(1, 2)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0$, we first need to rewrite the equation in standard form. The standard form of the equation of a circle is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.\n\nCompleting the square for the given equation, we have \n$$x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 4y - 28 = 0$$\n$$x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = 28 + 1 + 4$$\n$$(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 33$$\n\nNow compare this equation with the standard form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$.
