    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{11} x$, we must first find the value of $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_5 (x+4)=3$ in exponential form, which gives us $5^3=x+4$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=5^3-4=125-4=121$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, we now need to find $\\log_{11} 121$. Since we know that $11^2=121$, $\\log_{11} 121=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we know that $\\log_5 (x+4)=3$. To find $\\log_{11} x$, we need to first solve for $x$. \n\nIn preschool, we can think of this as a fun little puzzle! We have to figure out what number we can put into the log function to get 3. \n\nSince $\\log_5 (x+4)=3$, that means $5^3=x+4$. Let's count up to 5 three times on our fingers! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15! We found out that $5^3 = 125$. \n\nSo, $x+4=125$. To find $x$, we subtract 4 from 125. Let's count down from 125 on our fingers! 124, 123, 122, 121. So, $x=121$. \n\nNow that we have found $x=121$, we can find $\\log_{11} x$. This means we want to know what power of 11 equals 121. Let's count how many 11s we can fit in 121! 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, 121. We found that $11^2=121$. \n\nSo, $\\log_{11} (121)=2$. \n\nOur final answer is $\\log_{11} x = 2$. Yay, we solved the puzzle! Great job, preschoolers!",
