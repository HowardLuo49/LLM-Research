    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{11} x$, we must first find the value of $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_5 (x+4)=3$ in exponential form, which gives us $5^3=x+4$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=5^3-4=125-4=121$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, we now need to find $\\log_{11} 121$. Since we know that $11^2=121$, $\\log_{11} 121=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we know that $\\log_5 (x+4)=3$. That means $5^3=x+4$. So $125=x+4$. \n\nNext, we need to find $\\log_{11} x$. We can rewrite this as $11^{\\log_{11} x}=x$. \n\nSince we know that $x=125-4=121$, we can rewrite our equation as $11^{\\log_{11} 121}=121$. \n\nSo $\\log_{11} 121=\\boxed{2}$.",
