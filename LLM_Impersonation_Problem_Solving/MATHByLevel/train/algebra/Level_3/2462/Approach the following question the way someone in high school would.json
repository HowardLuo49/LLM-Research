    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{11} x$, we must first find the value of $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_5 (x+4)=3$ in exponential form, which gives us $5^3=x+4$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=5^3-4=125-4=121$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, we now need to find $\\log_{11} 121$. Since we know that $11^2=121$, $\\log_{11} 121=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we know that $\\log_5 (x+4) = 3$. Since $\\log_a b = c$ is equivalent to $a^c = b$, we can rewrite this equation as $5^3 = x+4$. Therefore, $125 = x+4$ so $x = 121$. \n\nNext, we want to find $\\log_{11} x$, which means we want to find the power to which we must raise 11 to get x. Since $x=121$, $\\log_{11} 121 = 2$ because $11^2 = 121$. \n\nTherefore, $\\log_{11} x = \\boxed{2}$.",
