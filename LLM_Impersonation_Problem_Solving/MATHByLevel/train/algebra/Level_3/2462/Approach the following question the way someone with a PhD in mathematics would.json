    "solution": "In order to find $\\log_{11} x$, we must first find the value of $x$. We begin by writing $\\log_5 (x+4)=3$ in exponential form, which gives us $5^3=x+4$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=5^3-4=125-4=121$. After plugging this value of $x$ into the second expression, we now need to find $\\log_{11} 121$. Since we know that $11^2=121$, $\\log_{11} 121=\\boxed{2}$.",
