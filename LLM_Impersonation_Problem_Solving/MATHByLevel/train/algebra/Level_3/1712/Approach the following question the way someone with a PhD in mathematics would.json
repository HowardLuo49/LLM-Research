    "solution": "We start by completing the square.  \\[x^2-10x+24=(x-5)^2-1.\\] Since the square of a real number is at least 0, $(x-5)^2\\ge 0$ and $(x-5)^2-1 \\ge -1.$ Thus, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-1,$ which occurs when $x=\\boxed{5}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value for the quadratic expression $x^2 - 10x + 24$, we can use the concept of completing the square.\n\nFirst, rewrite the quadratic expression in the form $(x - a)^2 + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined:\n\n$x^2 - 10x + 24 = (x^2 - 10x + 25) + 24 - 25$\n$x^2 - 10x + 24 = (x - 5)^2 - 1$\n\nWe know that the minimum value of $(x - 5)^2 - 1$ occurs when $(x - 5)^2$ is at its minimum value, which is 0.
