    "solution": "We start by completing the square.  \\[x^2-10x+24=(x-5)^2-1.\\] Since the square of a real number is at least 0, $(x-5)^2\\ge 0$ and $(x-5)^2-1 \\ge -1.$ Thus, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-1,$ which occurs when $x=\\boxed{5}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum value of the quadratic expression $x^2 - 10x + 24$, we can use the formula for the vertex of a parabola: $x = -b/2a$ where the quadratic is in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. \n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = -10$, and $c = 24$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = -(-10)/2(1) = 10/2 = 5$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value for $x^2 - 10x + 24$ is $x = 5$.",
