    "solution": "We start by completing the square.  \\[x^2-10x+24=(x-5)^2-1.\\] Since the square of a real number is at least 0, $(x-5)^2\\ge 0$ and $(x-5)^2-1 \\ge -1.$ Thus, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-1,$ which occurs when $x=\\boxed{5}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see, we can find the value of $x$ that gives the lowest number by trying different numbers. Let's start with $x = 0$.\n\nWhen $x = 0$, we get $0^2 - 10(0) + 24 = 24$. \n\nLet's try another number, how about $x= 5$?\n\nWhen $x = 5$, we get $5^2 - 10(5) + 24 = 1$. \n\nOh wait, the number got lower this time! Let's try another number! Maybe $x = 10$?\n\nWhen $x = 10$, we get $10^2 - 10(10) + 24 = 24$. \n\nSo it looks like the lowest value we found was when $x=5$! That's the answer, $x = 5$ gives the minimum value for $x^2-10x+24$. Yay!",
