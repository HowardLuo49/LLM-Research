    "solution": "Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $x^{\\frac{5}{2}} = (x^\\frac{1}{2})^5 = 32 = 2^5$. Solving $x^\\frac{1}{2} = 2$ gives us $x = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $x$, we need to rewrite the equation $\\log_x32 = \\dfrac{5}{2}$ using the definition of a logarithm. We know that $\\log_ba = c$ is equivalent to $b^c = a$. \n\nSo in this case, we rewrite $\\log_x32 = \\dfrac{5}{2}$ as $x^{\\frac{5}{2}} = 32$. \n\nNow we need to find a number that we can raise to the power of $\\frac{5}{2}$ to get 32. We know that $2^5 = 32$, so $x$ must be equal to 2. \n\nTherefore, $x = 2$.",
