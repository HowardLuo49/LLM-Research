    "solution": "Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $x^{\\frac{5}{2}} = (x^\\frac{1}{2})^5 = 32 = 2^5$. Solving $x^\\frac{1}{2} = 2$ gives us $x = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find x, we need to figure out what number we can raise x to in order to get 32. Since the log of x to the base of x equals 32, we can rewrite it as $x^{5/2} = 32$. \n\nNow, we need to figure out what number raised to the power of 5/2 equals 32. The square root of 32 is 5.65685424949238, which is close to 6. So, $x = 6$.",
