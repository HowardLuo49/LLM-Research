So in this case, we are trying to find a number that we have to raise to the power of something to get 32.\n\nNow, the power that we have to raise this mystery number to is 5/2. That means we have to find which number to the power of 5/2 equals 32.\n\nHmm... Let's think about this in a fun way! Maybe we can ask ourselves what number, when we raise it to the power of 5/2, equals 32. Let's see... 2 raised to the power of 5 is 32. \n\nSo the answer is 2! Yay! We found the number!
