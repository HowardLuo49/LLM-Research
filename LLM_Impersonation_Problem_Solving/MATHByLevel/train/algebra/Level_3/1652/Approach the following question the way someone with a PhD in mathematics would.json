    "solution": "Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $x^{\\frac{5}{2}} = (x^\\frac{1}{2})^5 = 32 = 2^5$. Solving $x^\\frac{1}{2} = 2$ gives us $x = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $x$, we need to realize that the equation $\\log_x32 = \\dfrac{5}{2}$ actually represents an exponential equation in disguise. Rewriting the equation in exponential form, we get $x^{\\frac{5}{2}} = 32$. \n\nNext, we can rewrite 32 as a power of $x$ by noticing that $32 = 2^5$. Therefore, we have $x^{\\frac{5}{2}} = 2^5$. \n\nSince both sides are now written in terms of powers of $x$, we can equate the exponents to solve for $x$: $\\frac{5}{2} = 5$. \n\nThus, $x = 2^{5/2} = \\sqrt{2^5} = \\sqrt{32} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.",
