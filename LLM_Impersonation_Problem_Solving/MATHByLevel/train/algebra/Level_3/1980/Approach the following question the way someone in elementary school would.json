    "solution": "We can factor the expression $x+1$ out of each term: \\[3x(x+1) + 7(x+1) = \\boxed{(3x+7)(x+1)}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the expression with the parentheses. We see that both terms have an $(x+1)$. In elementary school, we can think of it as the same as having two groups of things, one group with $3x$ things and another group with $7$ things. So if we take out the common factor of $(x+1)$, we get $$(3x + 7)(x + 1).$$\n\nSo the factored form of $3x(x+1) + 7(x+1)$ is $(3x + 7)(x+1)$.",
