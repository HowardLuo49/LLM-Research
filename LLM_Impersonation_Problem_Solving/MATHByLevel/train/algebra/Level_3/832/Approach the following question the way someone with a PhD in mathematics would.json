    "solution": "We know that $7\\bowtie g = 7+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=9$. Therefore, $$\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=2.$$ Because the series of $\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}$ is infinite, we can substitute $2$ into the series for any $\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}$ we want. Thus, $$\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=2$$ implies that $$\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=\\sqrt{g+2}=2.$$ Squaring both sides of this new equality, we have $g+2=4$, or $g=\\boxed{2}$.",
