    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?",
    "solution": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate the sale price of the shirt after the $20\\%$ discount. To do this, we need to find $20\\%$ of $\\$30$:\n\n$20\\% \\times \\$30 = 0.20 \\times 30 = \\$6$\n\nSo, after the $20\\%$ discount, the shirt will be $\\$30 - \\$6 = \\$24$.\n\n\nNext, we need to calculate the additional discount that Mary's coupon will give.

To do this, we need to find $25\\%$ of $\\$24$:\n\n$25\\% \\times \\$24 = 0.25 \\times 24 = \\$6$\n\nSo, after Mary's coupon, the final price of the shirt will be $\\$24 - \\$6 = \\$18$.\n\n\nTo find out what single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts, we need to see what percent of $\\$30$ gives the same final price of $\\$18$. \n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n$\\frac{\\$30 - \\$18}{\\$30} = \\frac{\\$12}{\\$30} = 0.40$\n\nSo, the final price of $\\$18$ is $40\\%$ off of the original price of $\\$30$.\n\nTherefore, the single percent discount that would give the same final price as the two successive discounts is $40\\%$.",
