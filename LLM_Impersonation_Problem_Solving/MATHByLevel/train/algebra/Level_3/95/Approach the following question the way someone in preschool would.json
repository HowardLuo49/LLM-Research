Next, we take the cube root of the tower of blocks, which means finding the block that, when multiplied by itself 3 times, gives us the tower of blocks.\n\nNow, the answer is -4. So, we need to find a way to make our tower of blocks equal to -4. Hmmm, this is a tricky one! Let's try using our imagination and see if we can figure it out together.
