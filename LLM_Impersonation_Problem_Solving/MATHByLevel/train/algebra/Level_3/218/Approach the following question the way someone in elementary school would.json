    "solution": "We begin by looking at each of the two possible cases; either $x<2$ and $f(x)=9x+16=-2$, or $x\\ge2$ and $f(x)=2x-14=-2$. Tackling the first case, we find that if $9x+16=-2$, then $x=-\\frac{18}{9}=-2$. Since this also satisfies the condition $x<2$, this is our first possible value of $x$. In the second case, we see that if $2x-14=-2$, then $x=\\frac{12}{2}=6$. Since this also satisfies the condition $x\\ge2$, this is our second possible value for $x$. The sum of these two values is just $-2+6=\\boxed{4}$.",

If we solve this equation, we get $x=-2$.\n\nFor $x\\geq 2$, we have $2x-14=-2$. If we solve this equation, we get $x=6$.\n\nSo the possible values of $x$ are $-2$ and $6$.
