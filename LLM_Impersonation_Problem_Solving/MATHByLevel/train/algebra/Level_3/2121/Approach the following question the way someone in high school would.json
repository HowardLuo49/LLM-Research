    "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing out the arithmetic sequence in terms of the primes: $a, a+6, a+12, a+18$. Since all these numbers are prime, we can eliminate certain possibilities for $a$ based on divisibility rules. \n\nWe know that any prime number greater than 2 is odd, so $a$ must be odd. Also, for a number to be prime, it cannot be divisible by 2 or 5 (except for 2 and 5 themselves). \n\nSince $a$ is prime and greater than 5, it cannot be divisible by 2 or 5. The only prime numbers that end in 1, 3, 7, or 9 are 2, 3, 7, and 5. So $a$ must end in 3 or 7.\n\nLet's try these possibilities out:\nIf $a$ ends in 3, then $a = 3$ or $a = 13$. But both of these values are less than 5, so they cannot be the ones we are looking for.\n\nIf $a$ ends in 7, then $a = 7$. This satisfies all conditions given, and it is greater than 5.
