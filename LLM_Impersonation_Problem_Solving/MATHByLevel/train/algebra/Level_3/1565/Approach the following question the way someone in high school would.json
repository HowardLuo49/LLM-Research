    "solution": "Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$. Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$. In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the y-intercept of line $a$, we first need to find the slope of line $a$. Since line $a$ is parallel to $y=2x+4$, it also has a slope of 2.\n\nNext, we use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of line $a$. The point-slope form is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. Plugging in the values $m=2$ and $(x_1, y_1)=(2,5)$, we get:\n\n$y-5=2(x-2)$\n$y-5=2x-4$\n$y=2x+1$\n\nThe y-intercept of line $a$ is the y-coordinate when $x=0$. Plugging $x=0$ into the equation $y=2x+1$, we get:\n\n$y=2(0)+1$\n$y=1$\n\nTherefore, the y-intercept of line $a$ is 1.",
