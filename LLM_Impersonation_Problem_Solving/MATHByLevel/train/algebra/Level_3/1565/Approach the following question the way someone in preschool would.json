    "solution": "Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$. Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$. In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "My teacher told me that parallel lines have the same slope. The slope of $y=2x+4$ is 2, so the slope of line $a$ is also 2. \n\nI know that I can find the equation of line $a$ using the slope-intercept form, which is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nSo now I put in the slope (m=2) and the point (2,5) into the equation:\n\n$5 = 2(2) + b$\n\n$5 = 4 + b$\n\n$b = 1$\n\nSo the y-intercept of line $a$ is 1. Yay!",
