    "solution": "Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$. Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$. In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the y-intercept of line $a$, we can use the fact that it passes through the point $(2,5)$.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the values of $x=2$ and $y=5$ into the equation $y=2x+4$ to check if the point $(2,5)$ lies on that line.\n\n$5 = 2(2) + 4$  \n$5 = 4 + 4$  \n$5 = 8$\n\nSince the point $(2,5)$ is not on the line $y=2x+4$, it means that line $a$ is different from this line.
