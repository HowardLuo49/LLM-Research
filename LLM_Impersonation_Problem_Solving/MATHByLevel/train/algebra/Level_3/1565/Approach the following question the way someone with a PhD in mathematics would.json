    "solution": "Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$. Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$. In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the y-intercept of the line $a$ that is parallel to $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$, we first need to determine the slope of line $a$. Since line $a$ is parallel to $y=2x+4$, it must have the same slope as line $y=2x+4$, which is 2.\n\nNow, we can use the point-slope formula to find the equation of line $a$. The point-slope formula is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. Substituting $m = 2$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (2,5)$ into the formula, we get:\n\n$y - 5 = 2(x - 2)$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$y - 5 = 2x - 4$\n\n$y = 2x + 1$\n\nTherefore, the equation of line $a$ is $y = 2x + 1$. To find the y-intercept, we set $x = 0$ in the equation:\n\n$y = 2(0) + 1$\n\n$y = 1$\n\nTherefore, the y-intercept of line $a$ is 1.",
