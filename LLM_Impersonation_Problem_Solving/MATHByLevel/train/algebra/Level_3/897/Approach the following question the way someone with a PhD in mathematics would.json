    "solution": "We have $f(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+a_1 \\cdot z+a_0$, and $g(z)=b_1 \\cdot z+b_0$, where $a_2$ is nonzero.  Then $f(z)+g(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+(a_1+b_1) \\cdot z+(a_0+b_0)$.  The degree of this polynomial is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first considering the definitions and properties of polynomials. Since $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree two, it has the form $f(z) = a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0$, where $a_2$ is the leading coefficient and $a_0, a_1$ are constants. Similarly, since $g(z)$ is a polynomial of degree less than two, it has the form $g(z) = b_1 z + b_0$, where $b_1$ is the leading coefficient and $b_0$ is a constant.\n\nTo find the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$, I would first add the two polynomials:\n$$f(z) + g(z) = (a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0) + (b_1 z + b_0)$$\n$$= a_2 z^2 + (a_1 + b_1)z + (a_0 + b_0)$$\n\nSince the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial, the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$ is the highest power of $z$ in the expression $a_2 z^2 + (a_1 + b_1)z + (a_0 + b_0)$. Since $a_2 z^2$ has the highest power of $z$, the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$ is two.\n\nTherefore, as a mathematician with a PhD, I would conclude that the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$ is two.",
