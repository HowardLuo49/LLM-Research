    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Suppose $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are polynomials in $z$, and the degree of $g(z)$ is less than the degree of $f(z)$.  If the degree of $f(z)$ is two, what is the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$?",
    "solution": "We have $f(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+a_1 \\cdot z+a_0$, and $g(z)=b_1 \\cdot z+b_0$, where $a_2$ is nonzero.  Then $f(z)+g(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+(a_1+b_1) \\cdot z+(a_0+b_0)$.  The degree of this polynomial is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If the degree of $f(z)$ is two, that means the highest power of $z$ in the polynomial is $z^2$. Since $g(z)$ has a degree lower than $f(z), the highest power of $z$ in $g(z)$ is less than $z^2$.\n\nWhen we add two polynomials, we just combine like terms. The degree of the sum will be the highest degree among the terms. \n\nSo, if we add $f(z)$ and $g(z)$, the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$ will still be $2$ because the highest power of $z$ in $f(z)$ is $z^2$.",
