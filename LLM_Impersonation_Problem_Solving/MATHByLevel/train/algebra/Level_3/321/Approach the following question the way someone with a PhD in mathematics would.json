    "solution": "We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form.  Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x +4$.  So, the slope is $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the slope of the line, we first need to put the equation in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line. \n\nStarting with the given equation $3x + 5y = 20$, we can rearrange it to solve for $y$:\n\n$5y = -3x + 20$\n\n$y = -\\frac{3}{5}x + 4$\n\nTherefore, the slope of the line $3x + 5y = 20$ is $-\\frac{3}{5}$.",
