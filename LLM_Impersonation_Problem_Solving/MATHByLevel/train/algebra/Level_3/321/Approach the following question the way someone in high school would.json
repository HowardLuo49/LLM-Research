    "solution": "We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form.  Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x +4$.  So, the slope is $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the slope of the line $3x+5y=20$, we need to rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, which is $y=mx+b$ where $m$ is the slope. \n\nFirst, let's isolate the $y$ term by subtracting $3x$ from both sides:\n$5y=-3x+20$\n\nNext, divide both sides by 5 to solve for $y$:\n$y=-\\dfrac{3}{5}x+4$\n\nNow we can see that the slope of the line is $-\\dfrac{3}{5}$.",
