    "solution": "Multiplying the first equation by $2$ gives $10u = -14 - 4v$.  Adding this to the second equation gives $13u = -39$, so $ u= -3$.  Substituting this into $5u=-7-2v$ gives $-15=-7-2v$, so $v = 4$ and our solution is $(u,v) =\\boxed{(-3,4)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first find $u$ in terms of $v$ in the first equation. If we divide both sides by 5, we get $u = -\\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}v$.  \n\nNow let's substitute this expression for $u$ into the second equation. We get $3\\left(-\\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}v\\right) = 4v - 25$.  \n\nSimplifying, we get $-\\frac{21}{5} - \\frac{6}{5}v = 4v - 25$. Adding $\\frac{6}{5}v$ to both sides gives $-\\frac{21}{5} = \\frac{26}{5}v - 25$.  \n\nAdding $\\frac{21}{5}$ to both sides gives $\\frac{26}{5}v = 4$, so $v = \\frac{20}{13}$.  \n\nNow we can find $u$ by plugging this value of $v$ back into $u = -\\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}v$. So, $u = -\\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}\\left(\\frac{20}{13}\\right) = -\\frac{7}{5} - \\frac{40}{65} = -\\frac{189}{65}$.  \n\nTherefore, the solution to the system is $\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{189}{65}, \\frac{20}{13}\\right)}$.",
