    "gpt_response": "First, let's group like terms together: \n\\[9x^3 - 3x + 1 + h(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 3.\\]\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\\[9x^3 - 3x + (1 + h(x)) = 3x^2 - 5x + 3.\\]\nComparing the highest degree terms on both sides, we see that $9x^3 = 0x^3$, so $h(x)$ must have $0x^3$ as its highest degree term. Therefore, the leading coefficient of $h(x)$ must be $0$. \n\nNext, let's group the $x^2$ terms together:\n\\[1 + h(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 3.\\]\nSince there is no $x^2$ term on the left side of the equation, the $x^2$ term of $h(x)$ must be $0x^2$. \n\nLastly, comparing the linear terms on each side:\n\\[-3x = -5x\\]\nThis tells us that $h(x)$ must have a linear term of $-2x$.\n\nPutting it all together, we have found that $h(x) = -2x$.",
