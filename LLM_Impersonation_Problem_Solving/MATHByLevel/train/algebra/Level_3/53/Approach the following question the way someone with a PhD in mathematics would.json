    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The teacher asks Bill to calculate $a-b-c$, but Bill mistakenly calculates $a-(b-c)$ and gets an answer of 11. If the correct answer was 3, what is the value of $a-b$?",
    "solution": "Instead of calculating $a - b - c$, Bill calculated $a - b + c$.  Therefore, the value of $a - b$ is simply the average of the two, making for $\\frac{11+3}{2} = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the correct result $a-b-c$ as $x$. So, we have $x = a-b-c$ and $a-(b-c) = 11$. We also know that the correct answer was 3, so $x = 3$.\n\nUsing the given information, we have:\n\n$a-(b-c) = x$\n$a - b + c = x$\n\nSubstitute $x = 3$ into the equations:\n\n$a - b + c = 3$\n$a - b + c = 3$\n\nSince the equations are the same, it implies that $3 = 11$, which is not possible.
