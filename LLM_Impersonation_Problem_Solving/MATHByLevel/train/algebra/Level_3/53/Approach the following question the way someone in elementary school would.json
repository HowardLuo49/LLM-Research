    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The teacher asks Bill to calculate $a-b-c$, but Bill mistakenly calculates $a-(b-c)$ and gets an answer of 11. If the correct answer was 3, what is the value of $a-b$?",
    "solution": "Instead of calculating $a - b - c$, Bill calculated $a - b + c$.  Therefore, the value of $a - b$ is simply the average of the two, making for $\\frac{11+3}{2} = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay class, let's solve this problem together! So, Bill made a mistake and calculated $a-(b-c)$ instead of $a-b-c$ and got 11 instead of 3. But don't worry, we can figure out the value of $a-b$!\n\nFirst, let's check Bill's calculation. If $a-(b-c)$ equals 11, then that means $a - b + c = 11$.\n\nSince the correct answer should be 3, that means $a - b - c = 3$.\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $a-b$. To solve for this, we can subtract the equation $a - b - c = 3$ from the equation $a - b + c = 11$.\n\nSo, $(a - b + c) - (a - b - c) = 11 - 3$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $2c = 8$.\n\nThen, dividing by 2 on both sides gives us $c = 4$.\n\nNow that we have found the value of c, we can plug it back into the equation $a - b - c = 3$.\n\nSo, $a - b - 4 = 3$.\n\nAdding 4 to both sides gives $a - b = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a-b$ is 7. Great job, class!",
