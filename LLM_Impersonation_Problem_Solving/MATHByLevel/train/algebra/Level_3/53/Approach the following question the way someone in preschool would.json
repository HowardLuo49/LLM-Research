    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The teacher asks Bill to calculate $a-b-c$, but Bill mistakenly calculates $a-(b-c)$ and gets an answer of 11. If the correct answer was 3, what is the value of $a-b$?",
    "solution": "Instead of calculating $a - b - c$, Bill calculated $a - b + c$.  Therefore, the value of $a - b$ is simply the average of the two, making for $\\frac{11+3}{2} = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's pretend that numbers are like toys. \n\nFirst, we have number a, which is like a big red ball. Then we have number b, which is like a small blue block. And finally, we have number c, which is like a yellow toy car.\n\nSo, if we want to find a minus b minus c, it's like taking away the blue block and then taking away the yellow toy car. That would be 3.\n\nBut instead, Bill did a minus (b minus c), which is like taking away the blue block, and then adding back the yellow toy car. That gave him 11.\n\nSo, to find out what a minus b is, we need to find out what b minus c is first. 11 minus 3 is 8. So, b minus c is 8.\n\nNow, if we go back to our toys, we know that taking away the yellow toy car from the blue block gives us 8. So, b minus c is 8.\n\nAnd if we know that a minus (b minus c) is 11, we can figure out what a minus b is. Taking away the blue block from the big red ball and adding back the yellow toy car gives us 11.\n\nSo, the value of a minus b is 11.",
