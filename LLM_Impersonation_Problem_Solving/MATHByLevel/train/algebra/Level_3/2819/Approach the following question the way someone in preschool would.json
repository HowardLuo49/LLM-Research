    "solution": "Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$. We have the equations $20\\cdot r = a$ and $a \\cdot r = \\frac{5}{4}$. In the first equation, we solve for $r$ to get $r=\\frac{a}{20}$, and substitute this into the second equation to eliminate $r$, resulting in $a \\cdot \\frac{a}{20} = \\frac{5}{4}$, or $a = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... so we have some numbers - 20, a, and 5/4. They are in a special kind of pattern called a geometric sequence, which means they keep getting multiplied by the same number. To find the missing number a, we need to figure out what this special number is that makes everything work out. Let's see... if we start with 20 and multiply by this special number, we get a. And if we then multiply by the special number again, we get 5/4. \n\nLet's think like a detective. We start with 20 and multiply by the special number to get a.
