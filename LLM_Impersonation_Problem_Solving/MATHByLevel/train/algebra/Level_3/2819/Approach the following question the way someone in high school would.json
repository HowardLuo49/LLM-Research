    "solution": "Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$. We have the equations $20\\cdot r = a$ and $a \\cdot r = \\frac{5}{4}$. In the first equation, we solve for $r$ to get $r=\\frac{a}{20}$, and substitute this into the second equation to eliminate $r$, resulting in $a \\cdot \\frac{a}{20} = \\frac{5}{4}$, or $a = \\boxed{5}$.",
