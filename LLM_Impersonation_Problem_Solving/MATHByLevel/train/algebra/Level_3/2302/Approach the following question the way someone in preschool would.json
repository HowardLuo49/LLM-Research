    "solution": "We can begin by multiplying the second equation by two, giving us the following system of equations \\begin{align*} 4u-5v&=23\n\\\\ 4u+8v&=-16\n\\end{align*}From here we simply subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(4u-5v)-(4u+8v)=23-(-16)$, which simplifies to $-13v=39$ or $v=-3$. We now know the value of $v$, so we can just plug this into the first equation in order to solve for $u$. This gives us $4u-5(-3)=23$, or $4u=8$ and $u=2$. Since $v=-3$ and $u=2$, $u+v=2+(-3)=\\boxed{-1}$.",

We can use our fingers to help us add and find the answer. Let's count together! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... oh no, it's getting hard to count! Maybe we can ask our friend for help.
