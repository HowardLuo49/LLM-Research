    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Two regular polygons have the same perimeter. If the first has 38 sides and a side length twice as long as the second, how many sides does the second have?",
    "solution": "Let the first have side length $2s$ and the second $s$. Then the perimeter of the first is $38\\cdot2s=76s$. Since this is the perimeter of the second as well, the second has $76s/s=\\boxed{76}$ sides.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have two polygons with the same perimeter. The first polygon has 38 sides, and each side is twice as long as the sides of the second polygon. That means the first polygon's perimeter is twice as long as the second polygon's perimeter. Since the perimeters are the same, that means the second polygon must have half as many sides as the first polygon. So, if the first polygon has 38 sides, the second polygon must have 38 divided by 2, which is 19 sides. So, the second polygon has 19 sides.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 76?: Okay, so we have two polygons with the same perimeter. The first polygon has 38 sides, and each side is twice as long as the sides of the second polygon. That means the first polygon's perimeter is twice as long as the second polygon's perimeter. Since the perimeters are the same, that means the second polygon must have half as many sides as the first polygon. So, if the first polygon has 38 sides, the second polygon must have 38 divided by 2, which is 19 sides. So, the second polygon has 19 sides.",
