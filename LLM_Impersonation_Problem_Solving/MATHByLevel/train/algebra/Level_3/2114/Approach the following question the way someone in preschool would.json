    "solution": "Let the first have side length $2s$ and the second $s$. Then the perimeter of the first is $38\\cdot2s=76s$. Since this is the perimeter of the second as well, the second has $76s/s=\\boxed{76}$ sides.",
    "gpt_response": "So, let's imagine we have two shapes with the same amount of sides but different sizes. The first shape has 38 sides and each side is twice as long as the second shape. \n\nTo figure out how many sides the second shape has, we need to think about how the sides of the first shape compare to the second shape. Since the first shape has sides that are twice as long as the second shape, that means it takes up more space.\n\nIf the first shape has more sides but the same amount of perimeter, that means the sides of the second shape must be smaller and there must be more of them to make up the same amount of perimeter.\n\nSo, the second shape must have more sides than the first shape. Let's count them together!",
