    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Two regular polygons have the same perimeter. If the first has 38 sides and a side length twice as long as the second, how many sides does the second have?",
    "solution": "Let the first have side length $2s$ and the second $s$. Then the perimeter of the first is $38\\cdot2s=76s$. Since this is the perimeter of the second as well, the second has $76s/s=\\boxed{76}$ sides.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation for the perimeter of each polygon. \n\nLet's denote the side length of the first polygon as x. Since the second polygon has a side length that is twice as long as the first, its side length would be 2x. \n\nThe perimeter of a regular polygon is calculated by multiplying the number of sides by the length of each side. Therefore, the perimeter of the first polygon would be 38x and the perimeter of the second polygon would be ys, where y is the number of sides of the second polygon. \n\nSince both polygons have the same perimeter, we can set up the equation: \n\n38x = ys\n\nNow, we know that x is twice the length of y. So we can substitute 2x in place of y: \n\n38(2x) = ys\n76x = ys\n\nSince we know that 38x = 76x, we can say that y = 38. Therefore, the second polygon has 38 sides.",
