    "solution": "Inputting $f^{-1}(x)$ into $f$, we have $f(f^{-1}(x)) =4f^{-1}(x) + 5$, so $x = 4f^{-1}(x) + 5$.  Solving this equation for $f^{-1}(x)$, we get that $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x-5}{4}$. Thus, we have  \\begin{align*}\nf^{-1}(f^{-1}(9)) & = f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{9-5}{4}\\right) \\\\\n& = f^{-1}(1) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1-5}{4} \\\\\n& = \\boxed{-1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Hey kiddos! Let's solve this fun math problem together! \n\nFirst, we need to find $f^{-1}(9)$. To do that, we need to plug in 9 into the function $f(x)=4x+5$. So, $f(x)=4x+5$ becomes $9=4x+5$. \n\nNext, we need to solve for x. Subtract 5 from both sides to get $4x=4$. Divide both sides by 4 to get $x=1$.\n\nNow that we found $f^{-1}(9)$, we need to find $f^{-1}(1)$. We'll do the same steps as before by plugging in 1 into the function $f(x)=4x+5$. So, $f(x)=4x+5$ becomes $1=4x+5$. \n\nSubtract 5 from both sides to get $4x=-4$. Divide both sides by 4 to get $x=-1$.\n\nSo $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(9))=f^{-1}(1)=-1$.\n\nGreat job, preschool pals! Math is fun!",
