    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Lulu has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+44$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Lulu is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. What is $b$?",
    "solution": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$, which has a constant term of $m^2+8$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2+8 = 44$, which yields the possibilities $m=6$ and $m=-6$.\n\nIf $m=6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2+12x+44$. If $m=-6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2-12x+44$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out what the number $b$ is, we need to think about what happens when we complete the square.\n\nFirst, we start with the quadratic $x^2+bx+44$. Lulu wants to rewrite this in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. To do this, she needs to add and subtract something inside the parentheses to make it a perfect square trinomial.\n\nThe perfect square trinomial $(x+m)^2$ is equal to $x^2+2mx+m^2$. Since we want to end up with $x^2+bx+44$ in the end, we know that $2mx$ should be equal to $bx$. This means that $2m=b$. \n\nThen, we have $m^2=8$ because we want the constant term to be 8.\n\nSince $m^2=8$, then $m=\\sqrt{8}=2\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nFinally, we know that $2m=b$, so $b=2(2\\sqrt{2})=4\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nTherefore, the number $b$ is $4\\sqrt{2}$.",
