    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Lulu has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+44$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Lulu is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. What is $b$?",
    "solution": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$, which has a constant term of $m^2+8$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2+8 = 44$, which yields the possibilities $m=6$ and $m=-6$.\n\nIf $m=6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2+12x+44$. If $m=-6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2-12x+44$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$, we first expand the expression $(x+m)^2+8$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x+m)^2+8 &= x^2+2mx+m^2+8 \\\\\n&= x^2+2mx+(m^2+8)\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can see that $b=2m$ by comparing coefficients with the original quadratic $x^2+bx+44$. This tells us that $b=2m$. Now, we also know that the constant term of the original quadratic is $44$, which is equal to $m^2+8$. Therefore, we have the equation $m^2+8=44$.\n\nSolving this equation, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nm^2+8 &= 44 \\\\\nm^2 &= 36 \\\\\nm &= 6\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow that we have found $m=6$, we can substitute it back into $b=2m$ to find the value of $b$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= 2m \\\\\nb &= 2(6) \\\\\nb &= 12\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $12$.",
