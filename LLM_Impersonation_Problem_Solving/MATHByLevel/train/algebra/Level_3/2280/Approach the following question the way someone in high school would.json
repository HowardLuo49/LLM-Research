    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Lulu has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+44$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Lulu is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. What is $b$?",
    "solution": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$, which has a constant term of $m^2+8$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2+8 = 44$, which yields the possibilities $m=6$ and $m=-6$.\n\nIf $m=6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2+12x+44$. If $m=-6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2-12x+44$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$, we first need to expand the expression $(x+m)^2+8$.\n\n$(x+m)^2+8$\n$= x^2 + 2mx + m^2 + 8$\n\nFrom this expanded form, we can see that $b = 2m$ and $m^2 + 8 = 44$.\n\nSince the quadratic is in the form $x^2 + bx + 44$, we know that $b$ must be equal to $2m$. Since $m^2 + 8 = 44$, we can solve for $m$ by setting $m^2 = 44 - 8 = 36$, which means $m = 6$.\n\nTherefore, $b = 2m = 2(6) = 12$. So, the specific positive number $b$ is equal to 12.",
