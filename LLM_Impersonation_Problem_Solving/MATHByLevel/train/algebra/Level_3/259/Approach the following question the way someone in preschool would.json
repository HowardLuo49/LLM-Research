    "solution": "Simplifying, we have $x^2+30x+216=0$. Factoring, we get $(x + 12)(x + 18) = 0$. Hence, the roots are $-12$ and $-18$ and the nonnegative difference between them is $(-12) - (-18) = \\boxed{6}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's start by figuring out what all those numbers mean. We have the equation x^2+30x+180=-36. This equation is like a puzzle we need to solve. We have to find out what number x could be to make everything equal on both sides of the equation. \nTo solve this, we need to find the roots of the equation. The roots are the numbers that we can plug into the equation to make it true. \nLet's first rewrite the equation to make it easier to work with: x^2+30x+180+36=0. \nNow, we can use some special math tools to find the roots. The nonnegative difference between the roots is the difference between the two numbers we find. \nI think we might need help from a grown-up or maybe a big kid to solve this puzzle!",
