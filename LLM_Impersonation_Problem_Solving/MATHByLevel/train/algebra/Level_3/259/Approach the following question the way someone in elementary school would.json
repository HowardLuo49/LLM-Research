    "solution": "Simplifying, we have $x^2+30x+216=0$. Factoring, we get $(x + 12)(x + 18) = 0$. Hence, the roots are $-12$ and $-18$ and the nonnegative difference between them is $(-12) - (-18) = \\boxed{6}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the roots of the equation $x^2+30x+180=-36$. One way to do this is to first simplify the equation by adding 36 to both sides to get $x^2+30x+216=0$. \n\nNext, we can factor this quadratic equation to get $(x+18)(x+12)=0$. So, the roots are $x=-18$ and $x=-12$. \n\nTo find the nonnegative difference between the roots, we subtract the smaller root from the larger root: $-12-(-18)=6$. \n\nTherefore, the nonnegative difference between the roots is 6.",
