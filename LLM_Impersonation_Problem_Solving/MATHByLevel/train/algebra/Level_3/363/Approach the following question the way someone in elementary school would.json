To do this, we can start by getting rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by $(x-1)$. \n\nOn the left side of the equation, we have \\[\\frac{3x^2+2x+1}{x-1}\\times(x-1) = 3x+1\\times(x-1).\\]\n\nThis simplifies to \\[3x^2+2x+1 = (3x+1)(x-1).\\]\n\nNext, we can expand the expression on the right by distributing $3x+1$.
