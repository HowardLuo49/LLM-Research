Which digit is represented by $\\Theta$ if $252/\\Theta=\\underline{3\\Theta}+\\Theta$, where $\\underline{3\\Theta}$ represents a two-digit number with $3$ in the tens digit and $\\Theta$ in the ones digit?",
    "solution": "Rewrite $\\underline{3\\Theta}+\\Theta$ as $30+\\Theta+\\Theta=30+2\\Theta$, so we have an algebraic expression we can manipulate. Multiply by $\\Theta$ to obtain: \\begin{align*}\n252/\\Theta&=30+2\\Theta\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n252&=30\\Theta+2\\Theta^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=2\\Theta^2+30\\Theta-252\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=\\Theta^2+15\\Theta-126\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(\\Theta+21)(\\Theta-6).\n\\end{align*}Or using the quadratic formula: \\begin{align*}\n\\Theta&=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{225-4\\cdot1\\cdot-126}}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{729}}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{-15\\pm27}{2}\n\\end{align*}Either way, because $\\Theta$ must be a positive digit, $\\Theta=\\boxed{6}$.",

Since it is a two-digit number with $3$ in the tens place and $\\Theta$ in the ones place, we know that $3\\Theta=30+\\Theta=30+\\Theta$. \n\nNext, we can substitute this into the equation $252/\\Theta=3\\Theta+\\Theta$. \nThis gives us $252/\\Theta=30+\\Theta+\\Theta$. \nSimplifying further, we have $252/\\Theta=30+2\\Theta$. \n\nNow we need to find a value of $\\Theta$ that will make this equation true. \n\nLooking at the possible values for $\\Theta$ (which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), we can start plugging them in to see which one works. \n\nIf we plug in $\\Theta=4$, we get $252/4=30+2(4)$ which simplifies to $63=38$.
