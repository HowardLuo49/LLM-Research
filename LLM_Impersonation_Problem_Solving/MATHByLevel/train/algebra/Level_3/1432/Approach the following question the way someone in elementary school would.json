Which digit is represented by $\\Theta$ if $252/\\Theta=\\underline{3\\Theta}+\\Theta$, where $\\underline{3\\Theta}$ represents a two-digit number with $3$ in the tens digit and $\\Theta$ in the ones digit?",
    "solution": "Rewrite $\\underline{3\\Theta}+\\Theta$ as $30+\\Theta+\\Theta=30+2\\Theta$, so we have an algebraic expression we can manipulate. Multiply by $\\Theta$ to obtain: \\begin{align*}\n252/\\Theta&=30+2\\Theta\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n252&=30\\Theta+2\\Theta^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=2\\Theta^2+30\\Theta-252\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=\\Theta^2+15\\Theta-126\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(\\Theta+21)(\\Theta-6).\n\\end{align*}Or using the quadratic formula: \\begin{align*}\n\\Theta&=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{225-4\\cdot1\\cdot-126}}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{729}}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{-15\\pm27}{2}\n\\end{align*}Either way, because $\\Theta$ must be a positive digit, $\\Theta=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first write out the equation. We have $252/\\Theta = 3\\Theta + \\Theta$. \n\nNow, let's try to solve for $\\Theta$. We know that $3\\Theta$ is a two-digit number because the tens digit is $3$. The smallest two-digit number with $3$ in the tens digit is $30$. So, we can rewrite the equation as $252/\\Theta = 30 + \\Theta$. \n\nNow, let's find what number replaces $\\Theta$ to make the equation true. We can start by trying to divide $252$ by numbers starting from $1$ to see which one gives us $30$ when added to $30$. \n\n$252/1 = 252 \\neq 30+1 = 31$ \n\n$252/2 = 126 \\neq 30 + 2 = 32$ \n\n$252/3 = 84 \\neq 30 + 3 = 33$ \n\n$252/4 = 63 = 30 + 4 = 34$ \n\nSo, the digit represented by $\\Theta$ is $4$ because $252/4 = 63 = 30 + 4$.",
