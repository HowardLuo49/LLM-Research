    "solution": "The $y$-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the $y$-axis.  The $x$-coordinate of such a point is 0.  Setting $x=0$ in the equation gives $-2y = 5$, so $y = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $y$-intercept, we need to see where the line crosses the $y$-axis. We can do this by setting $x$ to $0$. \n\nSo, if we plug in $x=0$ into the equation $x - 2y = 5$, we get:\n\n$0 - 2y = 5$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n\n$-2y = 5$\n\n$y = -2.5$\n\nTherefore, the $y$-intercept is at $(0, -2.5)$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to -\\frac{5?: To find the $y$-intercept, we need to see where the line crosses the $y$-axis. We can do this by setting $x$ to $0$. \n\nSo, if we plug in $x=0$ into the equation $x - 2y = 5$, we get:\n\n$0 - 2y = 5$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n\n$-2y = 5$\n\n$y = -2.5$\n\nTherefore, the $y$-intercept is at $(0, -2.5)$.",
