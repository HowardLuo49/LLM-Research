    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 +11)^{12}$?",
    "solution": "The degree of the polynomial is the degree of the highest term.  Since the degree of $3x^2 +11$ is 2 and since $(x^a)^{12} = x^{12a}$ for any positive constant $a$, the answer is $2 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 + 11)^{12}$, we first expand the polynomial using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any real numbers a and b and any non-negative integer n, the expansion of $(a + b)^n$ is given by:\n\n$(a + b)^n = \\binom{n}{0} a^n b^0 + \\binom{n}{1} a^{n-1} b^1 + \\binom{n}{2} a^{n-2} b^2 + \\ldots + \\binom{n}{n} a^0 b^n$\n\nIn this case, a = 3x^2 and b = 11, and n = 12. So the expansion of $(3x^2 + 11)^{12}$ will have terms of the form $(3x^2)^k(11)^{12-k}$ for k ranging from 0 to 12.\n\nTo determine the degree of the polynomial, we need to find the highest power of x that appears in any of the terms. This will occur in the term where k = 0 or the term where k = 12. In the term where k = 0, the power of x will be 2k = 0, so x^0 = 1. In the term where k = 12, the power of x will be 2k = 24, so x^24.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 + 11)^{12}$ is 24.",
