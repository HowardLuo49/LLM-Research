    "solution": "The degree of the polynomial is the degree of the highest term.  Since the degree of $3x^2 +11$ is 2 and since $(x^a)^{12} = x^{12a}$ for any positive constant $a$, the answer is $2 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "\"Umm, well let's see. We have a big number 12 after the parentheses and a 2 on the x, so that means we have to do something 12 times maybe. So we have to multiply (3x^2 +11) by itself 12 times. That sounds like a lot of repeating! But it will give us a really big answer in the end, maybe with lots of x's and numbers. So maybe the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 +11)^{12}$ is really big too! Like maybe super duper big! I'm not sure exactly how big though, but it sounds really cool!\"",
