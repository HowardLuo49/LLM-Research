    "solution": "The degree of the polynomial is the degree of the highest term.  Since the degree of $3x^2 +11$ is 2 and since $(x^a)^{12} = x^{12a}$ for any positive constant $a$, the answer is $2 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 + 11)^{12}, we first need to expand it. This means we need to multiply $(3x^2 + 11)$ by itself 12 times. That's a lot of math! But remember, we can use the distributive property to make it easier.\n\nLet's start by multiplying $(3x^2)$ by itself 12 times. Each time we multiply, we will get a higher degree term. So, after multiplying 12 times, we will get a term with the highest degree.\n\nAfter we expand and simplify $(3x^2 + 11)^{12}, we will find that the highest degree term will have a degree of 24. So, the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 + 11)^{12}$ is 24.\n\nWow, that was a lot of math, but we did it!",
