    "solution": "Squaring the equation provided, we get $m^2+2(m)\\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) +\\frac{1}{m^2}=64,$ so $m^2+\\frac{1}{m^2}+4=\\boxed{66}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find out the value of $m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2}$. We know that $(m+\\frac{1}{m})^2 = m^2+2+\\frac{1}{m^2}$. Since $m+\\frac{1}{m}=8$, we can substitute that into the equation: $8^2= m^2+2+\\frac{1}{m^2}$. This simplifies to $64=m^2+2+\\frac{1}{m^2}$. If we subtract 2 from both sides, we get $62=m^2+\\frac{1}{m^2}$. \n\nNow let's find the value of $m^2+\\frac{1}{m^2}+4$. We add 4 to our previous result: $62+4 = 66$. Therefore, the value of $m^2+\\frac{1}{m^2}+4$ is 66.",
