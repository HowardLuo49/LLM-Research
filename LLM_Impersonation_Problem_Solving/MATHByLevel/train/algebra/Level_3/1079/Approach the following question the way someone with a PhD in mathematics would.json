    "solution": "Squaring the equation provided, we get $m^2+2(m)\\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) +\\frac{1}{m^2}=64,$ so $m^2+\\frac{1}{m^2}+4=\\boxed{66}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $m + \\frac{1}{m} = 8$, we can square this equation to find $m^{2} + 2 + \\frac{1}{m^{2}} = 64$. Rearranging this equation gives us $m^{2} + \\frac{1}{m^{2}} = 62$. \n\nNow, we can substitute this result into the expression we are trying to evaluate: \n\n$m^{2} + \\frac{1}{m^{2}} + 4 = 62 + 4 = 66$ \n\nTherefore, the value of $m^{2} + \\frac{1}{m^{2}} + 4$ is 66.",
