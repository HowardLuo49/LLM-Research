    "solution": "Squaring the equation provided, we get $m^2+2(m)\\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) +\\frac{1}{m^2}=64,$ so $m^2+\\frac{1}{m^2}+4=\\boxed{66}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the expression $m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4$. \n\nSince we know that $m + \\frac{1}{m} = 8$, we can square this equation to get $m^2 + 2m\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64$.\n\nSimplifying the middle term gives us $m^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64$.\n\nSubtracting $2$ from both sides, we get $m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 62$. \n\nNow, substitute $62$ into the expression $m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4$ to find the value. \n\n$62 + 4 = 66$\n\nSo, the value of $m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4$ is $66$.",
