    "solution": "First, we simplify the left side, and we have \\[2^x+2^x+2^x+2^x = 4\\cdot 2^x = 2^2\\cdot 2^x = 2^{x+2}.\\]Noting that $128 = 2^7$, our equation now is $2^{x+2} = 2^7$, so $x+2 = 7$.  Therefore, $x=5$, and $(x+1)(x-1) = (6)(4) = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to simplify the equation $2^x + 2^x + 2^x + 2^x = 128$. We can combine the terms on the left side to get $4 \\cdot 2^x = 128$. \n\nNext, we can simplify this to $2^{x+2} = 128$. Since $128 = 2^7$, we have $2^{x+2} = 2^7$. This implies that $x + 2 = 7$, or $x = 5$.\n\nNow that we have found the value of $x$, we can calculate $(x + 1)(x - 1)$. Substituting $x = 5$ into $(x + 1)(x - 1)$, we get $(5 + 1)(5 - 1) = 6 \\cdot 4 = 24$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $(x + 1)(x - 1)$ is 24.",
