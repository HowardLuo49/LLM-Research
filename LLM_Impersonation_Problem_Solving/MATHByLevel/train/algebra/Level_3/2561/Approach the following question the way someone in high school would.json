    "solution": "First, we simplify the left side, and we have \\[2^x+2^x+2^x+2^x = 4\\cdot 2^x = 2^2\\cdot 2^x = 2^{x+2}.\\]Noting that $128 = 2^7$, our equation now is $2^{x+2} = 2^7$, so $x+2 = 7$.  Therefore, $x=5$, and $(x+1)(x-1) = (6)(4) = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the equation $2^x + 2^x + 2^x + 2^x = 128$.\nSince we have four terms of $2^x$, we can rewrite the equation as $4 \\times 2^x = 128$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $2^x = 32$.\n\nNow, let's find the value of x. We know that $2^5 = 32$, so x must be equal to 5.\n\nPlugging in x = 5 into the expression $(x + 1)(x - 1)$, we get $(5 + 1)(5 - 1) = 6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $(x + 1)(x - 1)$ is 24.",
