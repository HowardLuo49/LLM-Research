    "solution": "First, we simplify the left side, and we have \\[2^x+2^x+2^x+2^x = 4\\cdot 2^x = 2^2\\cdot 2^x = 2^{x+2}.\\]Noting that $128 = 2^7$, our equation now is $2^{x+2} = 2^7$, so $x+2 = 7$.  Therefore, $x=5$, and $(x+1)(x-1) = (6)(4) = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this, first we need to figure out what number each \"2^x\" equals altogether. We can start by counting how many \"2^x\" there are. \nWe see there are 4 \"2^x\" all added together, so we can write it as 4(2^x) = 128. \nNow we need to figure out what one \"2^x\" equals. We see that if 4(2^x) = 128, then 2^x = 32. \nNow, we need to find the value of x. Since 2^5 = 32, we know that x = 5.\nFinally, to find the value of (x + 1)(x - 1), we can substitute x = 5 into the equation. So, (5 + 1)(5 - 1) = 6 * 4 = 24. \nTherefore, the value of (x + 1)(x - 1) is 24.",
