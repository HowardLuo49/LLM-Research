    "solution": "Repeatedly dividing by 2, we find the next terms in the sequence to be 125000, 62500, 31250, 15625,... 15625 is no longer a multiple of 2, so when we divide by 2 again, we will not get an integer, nor will it be a multiple of 2. Thus, no number in the sequence after 15625 can be an integer. Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{15625}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's start by dividing 1,000,000 by 2 to get the next number in the sequence. 1,000,000 \u00f7 2 = 500,000. Then we divide 500,000 by 2 to get the next number. 500,000 \u00f7 2 = 250,000. We can continue this pattern until we reach the last number in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n1,000,000\n500,000\n250,000\n125,000\n62,500\n31,250\n15,625\n7,812\n3,906\n1,953\n\nAs we can see, the last integer in this sequence is 1,953.",
