    "solution": "Repeatedly dividing by 2, we find the next terms in the sequence to be 125000, 62500, 31250, 15625,... 15625 is no longer a multiple of 2, so when we divide by 2 again, we will not get an integer, nor will it be a multiple of 2. Thus, no number in the sequence after 15625 can be an integer. Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{15625}$.",

Continuing this process of dividing by 2, the next number in the sequence will be 250,000, then 125,000, and so on.\n\nWe can see that each number in the sequence is obtained by dividing the previous number by 2.
