    "solution": "Writing $13.5$ as $\\frac{27}{2}$, we get \\[\\sqrt[3]{4\\div 13.5} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{4}{27/2}} = \\sqrt[3]{4\\cdot \\frac{2}{27}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{8}{27}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{2^3}{3^3}} = \\boxed{\\frac23}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember that a fraction is when we have one number on top of another number with a line in between. \n\nNow let's think about the question. The trick to find the cube root is to think about what number, when multiplied by itself three times, equals the number inside the cube root sign. \n\nIn this case, we want to find the cube root of $4 \\div 13.5$. \n\nWhen we divide $4$ by $13.5$, we get a decimal number, which is hard to work with. So we need to find a simpler way to express it. \n\nLet's think of a way to make the division simpler. We can rewrite $13.5$ as $\\frac{27}{2}$ because $13.5$ is the same as $\\frac{27}{2}$. \n\nNow, let's simplify $4 \\div \\frac{27}{2}$. We know that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. \n\nSo, $4 \\div \\frac{27}{2}$ is the same as $4 \\times \\frac{2}{27}$. \n\nNow, we need to find the cube root of $4 \\times \\frac{2}{27}$. \n\nThe cube root of $4 \\times \\frac{2}{27}$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
