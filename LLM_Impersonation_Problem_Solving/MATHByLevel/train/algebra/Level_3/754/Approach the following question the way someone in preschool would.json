    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Point $M(3,7)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. If point $A$ has coordinates $(9,3)$, what is the sum of the coordinates of point $B$?",
    "solution": "Let point $B$ have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+9)/2=3$ and $(y+3)/2=7$, or $x=-3$ and $y=11$. Thus, the sum of coordinates of point $B$ is $-3+11=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the point in the middle of $A$ and $B$ is $M(3,7)$. If $A$ is at $(9,3)$ and $M$ is at $(3,7)$, that means $B$ is on the other side! Since $M$ is the midpoint, we can find $B$ by going from $A$ to $M$ and then going the same distance in the other direction. \n\nSo $B$ is at $(9-2, 3+4)$, which is $(6, 7)$. The sum of the coordinates of $B$ is $6+7$, which is $13$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: Okay, so the point in the middle of $A$ and $B$ is $M(3,7)$. If $A$ is at $(9,3)$ and $M$ is at $(3,7)$, that means $B$ is on the other side! Since $M$ is the midpoint, we can find $B$ by going from $A$ to $M$ and then going the same distance in the other direction. \n\nSo $B$ is at $(9-2, 3+4)$, which is $(6, 7)$. The sum of the coordinates of $B$ is $6+7$, which is $13$.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No\n\nThe sum of the coordinates of $B$ is actually $6+7$, which is $13$, not 8.",
