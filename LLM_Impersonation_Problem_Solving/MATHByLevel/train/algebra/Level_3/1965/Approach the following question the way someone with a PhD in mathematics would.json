    "solution": "Note that if we factor out a 2, then Sean's sum is $2 + 4 + \\cdots + 500 = 2(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)$. Julie's sum is $1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250$. So Sean's sum divided by Julie's sum is $$\n\\frac{2(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)}{(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)} = \\boxed{2}.\n$$",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate Sean's sum, we must first determine how many even integers there are from 2 to 500. Since the first even integer is 2 and the last even integer is 500, we can use arithmetic progression formula to find the number of terms:\n\nn = (500 - 2) / 2 + 1 = 250\n\nNow, we can calculate Sean's sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSean's sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) = 250/2 * (2 + 500) = 126502\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate Julie's sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nJulie's sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) = 250/2 * (1 + 250) = 31375\n\nFinally, we can calculate Sean's sum divided by Julie's sum:\n\nSean's sum / Julie's sum = 126502 / 31375 = 4",
