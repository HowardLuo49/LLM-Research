    "solution": "Note that if we factor out a 2, then Sean's sum is $2 + 4 + \\cdots + 500 = 2(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)$. Julie's sum is $1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250$. So Sean's sum divided by Julie's sum is $$\n\\frac{2(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)}{(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)} = \\boxed{2}.\n$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find Sean's sum, I need to add up all the even integers from 2 to 500. I know that the first even integer is 2, and the last even integer is 500. To find the sum, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[ \\text{sum} = \\frac{n}{2}(first\\ term + last\\ term) \\]\n\nIn this case, n is the number of terms in the sequence. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{num terms} = \\frac{last\\ term - first\\ term}{2} + 1 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values, I get:\n\n\\[ \\text{num terms} = \\frac{500 - 2}{2} + 1 = 250 \\]\n\nSo there are 250 even integers from 2 to 500. Now I plug these values into the sum formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{sum} = \\frac{250}{2}(2 + 500) = \\frac{250}{2}(502) = 125 \\times 502 = 62750 \\]\n\nSo Sean's sum is 62750.\n\nNext, to find Julie's sum, I need to add up all the integers from 1 to 250. I know that the first integer is 1, and the last integer is 250. To find the sum, I can use the same formula as before:\n\n\\[ \\text{sum} = \\frac{n}{2}(first\\ term + last\\ term) \\]\n\nAnd first I need to find the number of terms:\n\n\\[ \\text{num terms} = \\frac{250 - 1}{1} + 1 = 250 \\]\n\nSo there are 250 integers from 1 to 250.

To find the division of Sean's sum by Julie's sum, I divide 62750 by 31375:\n\n\\[ \\frac{62750}{31375} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sean's sum divided by Julie's sum is 2.",
