    "solution": "Substituting in, we have $4-2i-2(3+2i)$. Expanding the last part, we have $4-2i-6-4i$; adding, we have $\\boxed{-2-6i}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $a-2b$, we first need to substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression. \n\nSo, $a-2b=(4-2i)-2(3+2i)$. \n\nNext, we distribute $-2$ to both terms inside the parentheses: \n\n$4-2i-6-4i$\n\nCombine like terms by adding the real parts (4 and -6) and the imaginary parts (-2i and -4i):\n\n$-2-6i$\n\nTherefore, $a-2b=-2-6i$.",
