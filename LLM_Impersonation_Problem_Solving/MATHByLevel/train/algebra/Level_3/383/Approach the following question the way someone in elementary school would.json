    "solution": "Substituting in, we have $4-2i-2(3+2i)$. Expanding the last part, we have $4-2i-6-4i$; adding, we have $\\boxed{-2-6i}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $a-2b$, first we need to substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation. \n\nSo, $a-2b = (4-2i) - 2(3+2i)$ \n\nNow, we can simplify this by distributing the negative sign to both terms inside the parentheses. \n\n$a-2b = 4-2i - 6 - 4i$ \n\nNow, we can combine like terms by adding the real parts together and the imaginary parts together. \n\n$a-2b = (4 - 6) + (-2i - 4i)$ \n\nThis simplifies to \n\n$a-2b = -2 - 6i$ \n\nSo, $a-2b$ is equal to $-2 - 6i$.",
