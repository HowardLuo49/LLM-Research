    "solution": "Substituting in, we have $4-2i-2(3+2i)$. Expanding the last part, we have $4-2i-6-4i$; adding, we have $\\boxed{-2-6i}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's look at the letter $a$, it's a number that has $4$ and $-2i$ together. So $a=4-2i$. And the letter $b$ is another number that has $3$ and $2i$ together. So $b=3+2i$. \n\nNow, they want us to find $a-2b$. To do that, we have to first find $2b$. Since $b=3+2i$, then $2b=2(3+2i)$. That means $2b = 6+4i$.\n\nNow, we can subtract $2b$ from $a$. So $a-2b$ is equal to $4-2i-(6+4i)$. \n\nCombining the real part and the imaginary part, we get:\n$(4-6) + (-2-4)i = -2-6i$\n\nTherefore, $a-2b = -2-6i$.",
