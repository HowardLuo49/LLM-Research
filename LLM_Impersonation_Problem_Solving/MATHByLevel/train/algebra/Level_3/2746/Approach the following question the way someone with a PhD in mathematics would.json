    "solution": "The absolute value of a real number is equal to $3$ if and only if the number is $3$ or $-3$.  Solving $2n-7=3$ and $2n-7=-3$ we find the solutions $n=5$ and $n=2$.  The sum of these solutions is $5+2=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the given equation $|2n - 7| = 3$, we first consider the two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: $2n - 7 = 3$\nSolving this equation gives $2n = 10$, so $n = 5$.\n\nCase 2: $2n - 7 = -3$\nSolving this equation gives $2n = 4$, so $n = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the values of $n$ for which $|2n - 7| = 3$ is $5 + 2 = 7$.",
