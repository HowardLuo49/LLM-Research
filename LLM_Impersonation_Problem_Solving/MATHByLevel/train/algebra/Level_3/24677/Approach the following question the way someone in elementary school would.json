    "solution": "We have $4 \\Delta 13 = 4^2-13=16-13=3$ and $3 \\Delta 5 = 3^2-5 = 9-5=4$. Thus we are looking for $(2^3) \\Delta (3^4) = 2^6-3^4 = 64-81 = \\boxed{-17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out what $2^{4 \\Delta 13}$ means. That means we plug in 4 for $a$ and 13 for $b$ in the equation $a \\Delta b = a^2 - b$, so $2^{4 \\Delta 13} = 2^{4^2 - 13} = 2^{16 - 13} = 2^3 = 8$.\n\nNext, let's figure out what $3^{3 \\Delta 5}$ means. That means we plug in 3 for $a$ and 5 for $b$ in the equation $a \\Delta b = a^2 - b$, so $3^{3 \\Delta 5} = 3^{3^2 - 5} = 3^{9 - 5} = 3^4 = 81$.\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $(2^{4 \\Delta 13}) \\Delta (3^{3 \\Delta 5})$. We found that $2^{4 \\Delta 13} = 8$ and $3^{3 \\Delta 5} = 81$, so we need to find $8 \\Delta 81$. \n\nPlugging in 8 for $a$ and 81 for $b$ in the equation $a \\Delta b = a^2 - b$, we get $8 \\Delta 81 = 8^2 - 81 = 64 - 81 = -17$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $(2^{4 \\Delta 13}) \\Delta (3^{3 \\Delta 5})$ is $-17$.",
