    "solution": "We have $4 \\Delta 13 = 4^2-13=16-13=3$ and $3 \\Delta 5 = 3^2-5 = 9-5=4$. Thus we are looking for $(2^3) \\Delta (3^4) = 2^6-3^4 = 64-81 = \\boxed{-17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find out what $2^{4 \\Delta 13}$ is. To do that, we need to calculate $4^2 - 13$. So, $4^2 = 16$ and $16 - 13 = 3$. So, $2^{4 \\Delta 13} = 3$.\n\nNext, we need to find out what $3^{3 \\Delta 5}$ is. To do that, we calculate $3^3 - 5$. So, $3^3 = 27$ and $27 - 5 = 22. So, $3^{3 \\Delta 5} = 22$.\n\nNow, we need to find the answer to $(2^{4 \\Delta 13}) \\Delta (3^{3 \\Delta 5})$. So, we need to calculate $3-22$. So, $3 - 22 = -19$. Therefore, the value of $(2^{4 \\Delta 13}) \\Delta (3^{3 \\Delta 5})$ is -19.",
