    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Joann ate a total of 100 lollipops in five days. Each day after the first day she ate six more than she had eaten on the previous day. How many lollipops did she eat on the third day?",
    "solution": "Let the number of lollipops Joann ate on the first day be $a-12$, so she ate $a-6$ lollipops on the second day, $a$ on the third, and so on, eating $(a-12)+(5-1)\\cdot 6=a+12$ lollipops on the last day. The total number of lollipops is $5a$, which we are told is 100. Thus, $5a=100$ and $a=20$. Since $a$ is the number of lollipops Joann ate on the third day, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$ lollipops.",
    "gpt_response": "On the first day, Joann ate a certain number of lollipops. Let's call this number x.\nOn the second day, she ate x + 6 lollipops.\nOn the third day, she ate x + 12 lollipops.\nOn the fourth day, she ate x + 18 lollipops.\nOn the fifth day, she ate x + 24 lollipops.\n\nSince she ate a total of 100 lollipops in five days, we can set up an equation:\nx + (x + 6) + (x + 12) + (x + 18) + (x + 24) = 100\n5x + 60 = 100\n5x = 40\nx = 8\nTherefore, she ate 8 lollipops on the third day.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 20?: On the first day, Joann ate a certain number of lollipops. Let's call this number x.\nOn the second day, she ate x + 6 lollipops.\nOn the third day, she ate x + 12 lollipops.\nOn the fourth day, she ate x + 18 lollipops.\nOn the fifth day, she ate x + 24 lollipops.\n\nSince she ate a total of 100 lollipops in five days, we can set up an equation:\nx + (x + 6) + (x + 12) + (x + 18) + (x + 24) = 100\n5x + 60 = 100\n5x = 40\nx = 8\nTherefore, she ate 8 lollipops on the third day.",
