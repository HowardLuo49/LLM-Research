    "solution": "Let the number of lollipops Joann ate on the first day be $a-12$, so she ate $a-6$ lollipops on the second day, $a$ on the third, and so on, eating $(a-12)+(5-1)\\cdot 6=a+12$ lollipops on the last day. The total number of lollipops is $5a$, which we are told is 100. Thus, $5a=100$ and $a=20$. Since $a$ is the number of lollipops Joann ate on the third day, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$ lollipops.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together to figure this out! \n\nOn the first day, Joann ate some lollipops, and each day after that, she ate six more than the day before. \n\nSo, on the second day, she ate 6 more lollipops than she did on the first day. \nOn the third day, she ate 6 more lollipops than she did on the second day. \nAnd so on... \n\nLet's start with the first day. She ate X lollipops on that day. \nOn the second day, she ate X + 6 lollipops. \nOn the third day, she ate (X + 6) + 6 = X + 12 lollipops. \nOn the fourth day, she ate (X + 12) + 6 = X + 18 lollipops. \nOn the fifth day, she ate (X + 18) + 6 = X + 24 lollipops. \n\nWe know that she ate a total of 100 lollipops in five days. So, we can add up all the lollipops she ate each day and set it equal to 100. \n\nX + (X + 6) + (X + 12) + (X + 18) + (X + 24) = 100 \n5X + 60 = 100 \n\nNow, we solve for X (the number of lollipops she ate on the first day). \n\n5X = 40 \nX = 8 \n\nSo Joann ate 8 lollipops on the first day. \n\nNow we can figure out how many she ate on the third day (which is X + 12). \nSo, 8 + 12 = 20 \n\nJoann ate 20 lollipops on the third day!",
