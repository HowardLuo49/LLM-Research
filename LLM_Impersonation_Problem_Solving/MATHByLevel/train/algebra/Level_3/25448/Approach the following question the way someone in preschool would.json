    "solution": "The quadratic factors as $(2x + 3)(x - 4 + x - 6) = (2x + 3)(2x - 10) = 2(2x + 3)(x - 5).$  Thus, the roots are $-\\frac{3}{2}$ and 5, and their sum is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}.$",
    "gpt_response": "The first thing we need to do is find the roots of the equation. We can do this by factoring out the common term $(2x+3)$. So, we have $(2x+3)[(x-4)+(x-6)]=0$. Now we simplify the equation to get $(2x+3)(2x-10)=0$. We now have two factors to find the roots. The roots are the numbers that make the equation equal zero. So, the roots are $x=-3/2$ and $x=5$. To find the sum of the roots, we just add them up. So, $(-3/2)+5= 3.5$. The sum of all the roots is $3.5$. Yay!",
