    "solution": "Let the price of a pen be $x$ and the price of a pencil be $y$, in cents. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \\begin{align*}\n4x + 3y &= 224, \\\\\n2x + 5y &= 154. \\\\\n\\end{align*}We can subtract the first equation from twice the second equation to obtain $7y = 84$, so $y = 12$. Therefore, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{12}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count how many pens and pencils we have in total. \n\nThere are 4 pens and 3 pencils, which gives us a total of 7 writing utensils. \n\nNext, we can add up the total cost for each set of pens and pencils. \nFor 4 pens and 3 pencils costing $\\$2.24$, we can write it out like this:\n$0.25 \\times 4 + 0.10 \\times 3 = \\$2.24$ \n\nAnd for 2 pens and 5 pencils costing $\\$1.54$, it can be written as:\n$0.25 \\times 2 + 0.10 \\times 5 = \\$1.54$\n\nNow, we can figure out the cost of 1 pencil by subtracting the cost of the pens from the total cost for each set. \n\nFor the first set: \n$2.24 - 0.25 \\times 4 = \\$1.24$\n$1.24/3 = \\$0.41 \\text{(41 cents)}$\n\nAnd for the second set:\n$1.54 - 0.25 \\times 2 = \\$1.04$\n$1.04/5 = \\$0.21 \\text{(21 cents)}$\n\nTherefore, the cost of one pencil is 21 cents!
