    "solution": "Let the price of a pen be $x$ and the price of a pencil be $y$, in cents. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \\begin{align*}\n4x + 3y &= 224, \\\\\n2x + 5y &= 154. \\\\\n\\end{align*}We can subtract the first equation from twice the second equation to obtain $7y = 84$, so $y = 12$. Therefore, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{12}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the cost of a pencil, we should first assign variables to represent the cost of a pen and a pencil. Let's let p be the cost of a pen and q be the cost of a pencil.\n\nThen, based on the information given, we can set up a system of equations:\n\n4p + 3q = 224 (since four pens and three pencils cost $2.24)\n2p + 5q = 154 (since two pens and five pencils cost $1.54)\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations. Let's start by multiplying the second equation by 2:\n\n4p + 10q = 308\n\nSubtracting this new equation from the first equation, we get:\n\n7q = 84\nq = 12\n\nSo, a pencil costs 12 cents.",
