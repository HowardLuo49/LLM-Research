    "solution": "Let the price of a pen be $x$ and the price of a pencil be $y$, in cents. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \\begin{align*}\n4x + 3y &= 224, \\\\\n2x + 5y &= 154. \\\\\n\\end{align*}We can subtract the first equation from twice the second equation to obtain $7y = 84$, so $y = 12$. Therefore, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{12}$ cents.",

That would cost $\\$2.24$. \n\nThen, we can see that two pens and five pencils cost $\\$1.54$. \n\nSo, if we subtract the cost of two pens ($\\$2.24 - \\$1.54$), we can find out how much three pencils cost. \n\n$\\$2.24 - \\$1.54 = \\$0.70$ \n\nSince we know three pencils cost $\\$0.70$, we can figure out the cost of one pencil by dividing $\\$0.70$ by three: \n\n$\\$0.70 \u00f7 3 = \\$0.2333$ \n\nSo, in cents, the cost of a pencil is $0.2333 \\times 100 = 23.33$ cents. \n\nTherefore, the cost of a pencil is 23 cents.",
