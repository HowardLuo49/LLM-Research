    "solution": "Since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, by definition $\\alpha\\beta = k$ for some constant $k$.  Plugging in, we see that $4\\cdot 9 = k$, so $k = 36$.  So when $\\beta = -72$, we have that $-72\\alpha = 36$, or $\\alpha = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we use the concept of inverse proportionality. This means that $\\alpha\\beta=k$ for some constant $k$. Given that $\\alpha = 4$ when $\\beta = 9$, we have $4\\cdot9=k$, so $k=36$. \n\nNow, when $\\beta = -72$, we can find $\\alpha$ by solving for it in the equation $\\alpha\\beta = k$. Substituting in the values we know, we have $\\alpha(-72) = 36$, which simplifies to $\\alpha = \\frac{36}{-72} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, when $\\beta = -72$, $\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2}$.",
