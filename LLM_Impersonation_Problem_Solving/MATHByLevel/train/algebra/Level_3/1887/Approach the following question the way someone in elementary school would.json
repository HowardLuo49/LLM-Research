    "solution": "Since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, by definition $\\alpha\\beta = k$ for some constant $k$.  Plugging in, we see that $4\\cdot 9 = k$, so $k = 36$.  So when $\\beta = -72$, we have that $-72\\alpha = 36$, or $\\alpha = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, first we need to understand what \"inversely proportional\" means. It means that as one number goes up, the other number goes down. \n\nWe are given that $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, and that when $\\alpha = 4$, $\\beta = 9$. This means that when $\\alpha$ goes up to a larger number, $\\beta$ goes down to a smaller number.\n\nNow we need to find $\\alpha$ when $\\beta = -72$. Since $\\beta$ is going down from 9 to -72, we know that $\\alpha$ must go up. Since $\\alpha$ was 4 when $\\beta$ was 9, it must be larger than 4 when $\\beta$ is -72.\n\nTherefore, $\\alpha$ must be greater than 4 when $\\beta = -72$, but we don't know the exact value.",
