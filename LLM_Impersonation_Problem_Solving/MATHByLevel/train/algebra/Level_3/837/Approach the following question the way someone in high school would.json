    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 7 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
    "solution": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 28 and common difference $-7$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $28+21+14+7 = \\boxed{70}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many feet the car travels from the time the brakes are applied to when it stops, we can set up a sequence. \n\nIn the first second, the car travels 28 feet. In the second second, the car travels 21 feet (28 feet - 7 feet). In the third second, the car travels 14 feet (21 feet - 7 feet). In the fourth second, the car travels 7 feet (14 feet - 7 feet). \n\nAdding up all these distances, the car travels a total of 28 feet + 21 feet + 14 feet + 7 feet = 70 feet from the time the brakes are applied to when the car stops.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 70?: To find out how many feet the car travels from the time the brakes are applied to when it stops, we can set up a sequence. \n\nIn the first second, the car travels 28 feet. In the second second, the car travels 21 feet (28 feet - 7 feet). In the third second, the car travels 14 feet (21 feet - 7 feet).
