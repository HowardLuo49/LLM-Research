    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 7 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
    "solution": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 28 and common difference $-7$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $28+21+14+7 = \\boxed{70}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, let's count each second the car travels when the brakes are applied! The car goes 28 feet in the first second. Then in the second second, it travels 21 feet (7 feet less than the first second). In the third second, it travels 14 feet, and in the fourth second, it travels 7 feet. Finally, in the fifth second, the car comes to a complete stop. So, the car travels a total of 28 + 21 + 14 + 7 = 70 feet from the time the brakes are applied to the time the car stops!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 70?: Wow, let's count each second the car travels when the brakes are applied! The car goes 28 feet in the first second. Then in the second second, it travels 21 feet (7 feet less than the first second). In the third second, it travels 14 feet, and in the fourth second, it travels 7 feet. Finally, in the fifth second, the car comes to a complete stop.
