    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 7 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
    "solution": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 28 and common difference $-7$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $28+21+14+7 = \\boxed{70}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we know that the car travels 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied. Then we can figure out how far it travels in the second second by subtracting 7 feet from the first second's distance. So in the second second, the car travels 28 - 7 = 21 feet. In the third second, it travels 21 - 7 = 14 feet. And in the fourth second, it travels 14 - 7 = 7 feet. \n\nSo in total, the car travels 28 + 21 + 14 + 7 = 70 feet from the time the brakes are applied to the time the car stops.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 70?: First, we know that the car travels 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied. Then we can figure out how far it travels in the second second by subtracting 7 feet from the first second's distance. So in the second second, the car travels 28 - 7 = 21 feet.
