    "solution": "The slope of a line is $\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. In this case, there is no vertical difference between points $A$ and $B$, so the line is simply a horizontal line with a slope of 0. Since the line is a horizontal line, its $y$-intercept equals the $y$-coordinate of all the other points on the line, 13. So, the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, points A and B have the same y-coordinate of 13! So they must be on the same level. But they have different x-coordinates, which means they are side by side.\n\nTo find the slope, we can use the formula: slope = (change in y) / (change in x). Since the y-coordinates are the same, the change in y is 0. And since the x-coordinates are different, the change in x is not 0. So the slope is 0 divided by something not 0, which is 0. \n\nNow, let's find the y-intercept. Since the line passes through points A and B, it must also pass through the point where x-intercept is 0 and y is 13. This is the y-intercept!\n\nSo, the sum of the slope and the y-intercept is 0 + 13 = 13.\n\nSo, the sum of the slope and the y-intercept of the line containing points A and B is 13! Yay!",
