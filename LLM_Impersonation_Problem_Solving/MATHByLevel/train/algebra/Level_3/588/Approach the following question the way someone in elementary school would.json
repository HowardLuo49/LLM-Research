    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Find the only positive real number $x$ for which $\\displaystyle \\frac{x-4}{9} = \\frac{4}{x-9}$.",
    "solution": "The first approach that comes to mind is probably also the best one.  So we cross-multiply to obtain $(x-4)(x-9) = 36$.  Multiplying out the left-hand side and cancelling the 36 yields $x^2-13x = 0$, or $x(x-13)=0$.  This equation has two solutions, $x=0$ and 13.  Since we are looking for positive answers, we take $x=\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the equation. We have a fraction on the left side and a fraction on the right side. We want to find a number that makes these two fractions equal to each other.\n\nLet's first cross multiply to get rid of the fractions. We can do this by multiplying $x-4$ by $x-9$ and multiplying $4$ by $9$. \n\nSo we have:\n\n$(x-4)(x-9) = 4 \\cdot 9$\n\nNow, let's simplify. \n\n$(x-4)(x-9) = 36$\n\nExpanding the left side gives us $x^2 - 9x - 4x + 36 = 36$\n\nCombining like terms gives us $x^2 - 13x = 0$\n\nNow, we can factor out an $x$ to get $x(x-13) = 0$\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us two possible solutions: $x = 0$ or $x = 13$\n\nBut we have to remember that we are looking for a positive number. So the only positive real number $x$ that works for this equation is $\\boxed{13}$.",
