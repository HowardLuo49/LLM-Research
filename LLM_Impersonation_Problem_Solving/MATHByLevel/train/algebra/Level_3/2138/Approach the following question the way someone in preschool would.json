    "solution": "Letting $x= \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \\!\\sqrt{2 - x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 2 - x$, so $x^2 + x -2 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x+2)(x-1) = 0$. Therefore, $x=-2$ or $x=1$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, this is a tricky one! It looks like there are a lot of square roots in a row. Let's start with the innermost square root and work our way out.\n\nFirst, let's let $x = \\sqrt{2 -\\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}}$.\n\nThen, we can rewrite the equation as $x = \\sqrt{2 - x}$.\n\nNow we can solve for $x$ by squaring both sides: $x^2 = 2 - x$.\n\nRearranging the equation gives us $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$.\n\nNow we can factor the equation to get $(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0$.\n\nSo, the possible solutions are $x = -2$ or $x = 1$. But since $x$ represents a square root, it has to be positive, so $x = 1$ is our answer!\n\nGreat job for sticking with me through all those steps! Math can be really fun and challenging sometimes. Keep up the good work!",
