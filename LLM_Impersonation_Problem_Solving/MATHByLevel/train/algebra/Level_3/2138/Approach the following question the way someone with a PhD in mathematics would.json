    "solution": "Letting $x= \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \\!\\sqrt{2 - x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 2 - x$, so $x^2 + x -2 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x+2)(x-1) = 0$. Therefore, $x=-2$ or $x=1$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{1}$.",

Notice that the expression under the square root is the same as $x$, thus we have $x = \\sqrt{2 - x}$. \n\nNow, let us square both sides to eliminate the square root: $x^2 = 2 - x$.
