    "solution": "Letting $x= \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \\!\\sqrt{2 - x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 2 - x$, so $x^2 + x -2 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x+2)(x-1) = 0$. Therefore, $x=-2$ or $x=1$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so we have an infinite square root here. Let's call the whole expression $x$, so it looks like this: \n\n$x = \\sqrt{2 -\\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}}$\n\nIf we look closely, we see that the expression inside the square root keeps repeating, so we can write it as:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{2 - x}$\n\nNow we can square both sides to get rid of the square root:\n\n$x^2 = 2 - x$\n\nRearranging the equation, we get a quadratic equation:\n\n$x^2 + x - 2 = 0$\n\nWe can factor this equation as:\n\n$(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0$\n\nSo the possible values for $x$ are $-2$ and $1$. Since $x$ represents a square root, it must be positive, so $x$ can't be $-2$. Therefore, our final answer is $x = 1$.\n\nSo the value of $\\sqrt{2 -\\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}}$ is equal to $1$.",
