    "solution": "First we bring $x$ to the left side to get  \\[x^2-4x+9=41.\\]We notice that the left side is almost the square $(x-2)^2=x^2-4x+4$. Subtracting 5 from both sides lets us complete the square on the left-hand side, \\[x^2-4x+4=36,\\]so  \\[(x-2)^2=6^2.\\]Therefore $x=2\\pm6$.  The positive difference between these solutions is $8-(-4)=\\boxed{12}$.",
