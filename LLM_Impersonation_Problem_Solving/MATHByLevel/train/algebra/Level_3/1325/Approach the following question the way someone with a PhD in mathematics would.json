    "solution": "We consider the signs of the two factors for all possible values of $n$.\n\nIf $n>2$, then both $n-2$ and $n+4$ are positive, so the product is positive.\n\nIf $n=2$, then $n-2=0$, so the product is 0.\n\nIf $-4<n<2$, then $n-2<0$ and $n+4>0$, so the product is negative.\n\nIf $n=-4$, then the product is 0.\n\nIf $n <-4$, then both factors are negative, and the product is positive.\n\nTherefore, only the integers $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, $0$, and $1$ satisfy the inequality, for a total of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this inequality, we first find the critical points of the function $(n-2)(n+4)$. Setting $(n-2)(n+4)=0$, we find $n=2$ and $n=-4$ as critical points. \n\nNext, we test the intervals created by these critical points. Since the inequality is less than 0, we are looking for where the function is negative. This occurs in the intervals $(-\\infty, -4)$ and $(2, \\infty)$. \n\nTherefore, the integers that satisfy $(n-2)(n+4)<0$ are the integers from $-3$ to $1$, inclusive. In other words, there are 5 integers that satisfy the inequality.",
