    "solution": "We consider the signs of the two factors for all possible values of $n$.\n\nIf $n>2$, then both $n-2$ and $n+4$ are positive, so the product is positive.\n\nIf $n=2$, then $n-2=0$, so the product is 0.\n\nIf $-4<n<2$, then $n-2<0$ and $n+4>0$, so the product is negative.\n\nIf $n=-4$, then the product is 0.\n\nIf $n <-4$, then both factors are negative, and the product is positive.\n\nTherefore, only the integers $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, $0$, and $1$ satisfy the inequality, for a total of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the numbers that make the expression $(n-2)(n+4)$ less than zero. \n\nLet's first think about what happens when we multiply two numbers. If one number is positive and the other is negative, the result is negative. If both numbers are positive, the result is positive. And if both numbers are negative, the result is positive. \n\nSo for the expression $(n-2)(n+4)$ to be less than zero (which means negative), one of the factors must be negative and the other factor must be positive.\n\nLet's think about what numbers would make each factor negative. For $n-2$ to be negative, $n$ must be less than 2. And for $n+4$ to be negative, $n$ must be greater than -4.\n\nPutting it together, we can see that the numbers that make $(n-2)(n+4)$ less than zero are between -4 and 2. So the integers that satisfy the inequality are -3, -2, and 1 (because 0 and 2 don't work). \n\nSo there are 3 integers, $n=-3, -2, 1$, that satisfy the inequality $(n-2)(n+4)<0$.",
