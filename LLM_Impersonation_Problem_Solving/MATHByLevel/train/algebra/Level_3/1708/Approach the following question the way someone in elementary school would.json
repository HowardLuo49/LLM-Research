    "solution": "We begin by solving for $x$ from the first equation $\\log_6 (4x)=2$. Expressing this in exponential form, we find that $4x=6^2$, giving us $x=\\frac{6^2}{4}=9$. After plugging this value of $x$ into $\\log_x 27$, we end up with the expression $\\log_9 27$. Since $27=(9)(3)=(9^1)(9^{\\frac12})=9^{\\frac32}$, we see that $\\log_9 27=\\boxed{\\frac32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we know that $\\log_6 (4x)=2$. This means that $6^2 = 4x$. So, $36 = 4x$ which means $x = 9$. \n\nNext, we need to find $\\log_x 27$. We can rewrite $27$ as $3^3$. So, $\\log_x 27 = \\log_x 3^3$. Since $x = 9$, we have $\\log_9 3^3$. This simplifies to $3 \\log_9 3$. \n\nTherefore, $\\log_x 27$ in simplest fractional form is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
