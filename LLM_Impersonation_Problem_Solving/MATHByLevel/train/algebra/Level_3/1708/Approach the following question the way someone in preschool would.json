    "solution": "We begin by solving for $x$ from the first equation $\\log_6 (4x)=2$. Expressing this in exponential form, we find that $4x=6^2$, giving us $x=\\frac{6^2}{4}=9$. After plugging this value of $x$ into $\\log_x 27$, we end up with the expression $\\log_9 27$. Since $27=(9)(3)=(9^1)(9^{\\frac12})=9^{\\frac32}$, we see that $\\log_9 27=\\boxed{\\frac32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to understand what $\\log$ means. It's like a special code that tells us what power we need to raise a number to get another number. So if $\\log_6 (4x)=2$, it means that $6^2=4x$. We can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by 4.\n\n$6^2=4x$\n\n$36=4x$\n\n$9=x$\n\nNow, we need to find out what power we need to raise $x$ to get 27. This is like a secret code, so we need to do a little detective work.\n\nWe know that $x=9$, so we need to find $\\log_9 27$.
