    "solution": "We begin by solving for $x$ from the first equation $\\log_6 (4x)=2$. Expressing this in exponential form, we find that $4x=6^2$, giving us $x=\\frac{6^2}{4}=9$. After plugging this value of $x$ into $\\log_x 27$, we end up with the expression $\\log_9 27$. Since $27=(9)(3)=(9^1)(9^{\\frac12})=9^{\\frac32}$, we see that $\\log_9 27=\\boxed{\\frac32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, I would write the equation $\\log_6 (4x) = 2$ in exponential form: $6^2 = 4x$. This simplifies to $36 = 4x$, or $x=9$.\n\nNext, I would substitute $x=9$ into the equation $\\log_x 27$. This gives $\\log_9 27$. I would then express this in fractional form, since $\\log_9 27$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{\\log 27}{\\log 9}$. \n\nSince $\\log 27 = \\log (3^3) = 3\\log 3$ and $\\log 9 = \\log (3^2) = 2\\log 3$, then $\\log_9 27$ simplifies to $\\frac{3\\log 3}{2\\log 3} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.",
