    "solution": "The first term is $3$, and the ratio between terms is $(9/2)/3=3/2$. Therefore, the eighth term of the sequence is $3\\cdot(3/2)^{8-1} = 3^8/2^7 = \\boxed{\\frac{6561}{128}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, I notice that each term is getting smaller. To find the eighth term, I need to keep dividing by $\\dfrac{2}{3}$.\n\nSo, the eighth term would be $\\dfrac{81}{8} \\times \\dfrac{2}{3} \\times \\dfrac{2}{3} \\times \\dfrac{2}{3} \\times \\dfrac{2}{3} = \\dfrac{6561}{256}$. \n\nTherefore, the eighth term of the sequence is $\\dfrac{6561}{256}$.",
