    "solution": "The first term is $3$, and the ratio between terms is $(9/2)/3=3/2$. Therefore, the eighth term of the sequence is $3\\cdot(3/2)^{8-1} = 3^8/2^7 = \\boxed{\\frac{6561}{128}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok so this is a geometric sequence because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by $\\dfrac{3}{2}$. To find the eighth term, we can continue this pattern by multiplying $\\dfrac{81}{8}$ by $\\dfrac{3}{2}$ again.\n\n$\\frac{81}{8} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{243}{16}$\n\nSo, the eighth term of the sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{243}{16}}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{6561?: Ok so this is a geometric sequence because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by $\\dfrac{3}{2}$. To find the eighth term, we can continue this pattern by multiplying $\\dfrac{81}{8}$ by $\\dfrac{3}{2}$ again.\n\n$\\frac{81}{8} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{243}{16}$\n\nSo, the eighth term of the sequence is $\\boxed{\\frac{243}{16}}$.",
