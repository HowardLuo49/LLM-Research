    "solution": "The first term is $3$, and the ratio between terms is $(9/2)/3=3/2$. Therefore, the eighth term of the sequence is $3\\cdot(3/2)^{8-1} = 3^8/2^7 = \\boxed{\\frac{6561}{128}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So to find the eighth term, we need to keep multiplying by $\\dfrac{3}{2}$. Let's start with $3$ and keep multiplying by $\\dfrac{3}{2}$:\n\n$3, \\dfrac{9}{2}, \\dfrac{27}{4}, \\dfrac{81}{8}, \\ldots$ \n\nAfter four multiplications, we get to the eighth term:\n\n$\\dfrac{81}{8} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{3}{2} = \\dfrac{3^4 \\times 81}{2^4 \\times 8}$\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n$\\dfrac{729 \\times 81}{16 \\times 8} = \\dfrac{59049}{128}$ \n\nSo, the eighth term of the sequence is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{59049}{128}}$.",
