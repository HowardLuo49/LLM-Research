    "solution": "Let $J$ represent James's current age and $L$ represent Louise's current age. Since James is six years older than Louise, we get $J=L+6$. We're also told in words that $J+8=4(L-4)$. We can substitute for $J$ in terms of $L$ into the second equation to get \\[(L+6)+8=4(L-4).\\] Expanding both products gives \\[ L+14=4L-16.\\] Adding 16 to both sides and subtracting 14 from both sides gives  $30=3L$, so $l=10$. So Louise is currently 10 years old, which means James is currently $10+6=16$ years old. The sum of their current ages is $10+16=\\boxed{26}$ years.",
