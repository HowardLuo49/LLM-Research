    "solution": "Let $J$ represent James's current age and $L$ represent Louise's current age. Since James is six years older than Louise, we get $J=L+6$. We're also told in words that $J+8=4(L-4)$. We can substitute for $J$ in terms of $L$ into the second equation to get \\[(L+6)+8=4(L-4).\\] Expanding both products gives \\[ L+14=4L-16.\\] Adding 16 to both sides and subtracting 14 from both sides gives  $30=3L$, so $l=10$. So Louise is currently 10 years old, which means James is currently $10+6=16$ years old. The sum of their current ages is $10+16=\\boxed{26}$ years.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! Louise is younger than James. If we count six years from now, James is six years older than Louise. \nNow let's think about the future. If we add eight years, James will be four times older than Louise was four years ago. \nLet's do some math. If we call Louise's age now x, then James's age now will be x + 6. \nIn eight years, James's age will be x + 6 + 8, and Louise's age will be x - 4. \nTherefore, the equation will be x + 6 + 8 = 4(x - 4). \nNow, let's solve the equation to find their current ages. \nAfter solving it, we will have x = 14. \nSo, Louise is currently 14 years old, and James is 14 + 6 = 20 years old. \nTo find the sum of their current ages, we will add them: 14 + 20 = 34. \nTherefore, the sum of their current ages is 34.
