    "solution": "Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, the greatest possible value of $-x^2$ is 0, which is achieved when $x=0$.  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $y = -x^2 + 5$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which is achieved when $x=0$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum value of $y$, we need to determine the vertex of the parabola defined by the equation $y = -x^2 + 5$. The vertex of a parabola of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the point $(h, k)$ where $h = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k = c - \\frac{b^2}{4a}$.\n\nIn this case, $a = -1$, $b = 0$, and $c = 5$. Plugging these values into the formulas for $h$ and $k$, we get $h = 0$ and $k = 5$. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at the point $(0, 5)$.\n\nSince the parabola opens downwards (because $a = -1$), the maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the vertex. Therefore, the maximum value possible for $y$ is $5$.",
