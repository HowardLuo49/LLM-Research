    "gpt_response": "Hmm... okie dokie! So first, we need to find out what $f^{-1}(58)$ is. That means we need to figure out what number we can put into the function $f(x)$ to get 58 out. \n\nWe know that $f(x) = 2x^3 + 4$, so we want to find $x$ when $f(x) = 58$. \n\nLet's start by setting up the equation: \n\n$2x^3 + 4 = 58$. \n\nNow, let's solve for $x$. \n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get: \n\n$2x^3 = 54$. \n\nThen, dividing by 2, we get: \n\n$x^3 = 27$. \n\nSo, the cube root of 27 is 3, because $3*3*3=27$. \n\nTherefore, $f^{-1}(58) = 3$. Yay, we did it! Great job!",
