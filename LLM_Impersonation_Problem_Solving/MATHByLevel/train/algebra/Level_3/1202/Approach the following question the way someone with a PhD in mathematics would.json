    "gpt_response": "The number $\\pi$ is irrational and approximately equal to 3.14159. The greatest integer less than $\\pi$ is 3. Therefore, the value of the floor function evaluated at $\\pi$ is $\\lfloor{\\pi}\\rfloor = 3$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: The number $\\pi$ is irrational and approximately equal to 3.14159. The greatest integer less than $\\pi$ is 3. Therefore, the value of the floor function evaluated at $\\pi$ is $\\lfloor{\\pi}\\rfloor = 3$.",
