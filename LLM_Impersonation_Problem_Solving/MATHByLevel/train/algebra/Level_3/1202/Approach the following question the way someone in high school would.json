    "solution": "We are solving for the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $\\pi$. Since $\\pi$ is approximately $3.14$, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to evaluate the floor function of pi, which is denoted by the square brackets around the number. The floor function of a number is basically rounding down to the nearest whole number. So for pi, which is approximately 3.14159, the floor function would round it down to 3. Therefore, $\\lfloor{\\pi}\\rfloor = 3$.",
