    "solution": "Simply back up from $11$. Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\\cdot 1 = 8$. So the answer is $7 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, let's see here, we have an arithmetic sequence and the fifth term is 11. That means we have to figure out what the first term, second term, third term, fourth term, and fifth term are. \n\nIf the difference between two consecutive terms is 1, that means we add 1 each time to get the next term. So, let's start with the fifth term, which is 11. If we subtract 1 from 11, we get the fourth term. If we keep doing this, we can find all the terms.\n\n11 (fifth term) - 1 = 10 (fourth term)\n10 (fourth term) - 1 = 9 (third term)\n9 (third term) - 1 = 8 (second term)\n8 (second term) - 1 = 7 (first term)\n\nSo, the first term of the arithmetic sequence is 7. \n\nNow, we have to find the product of the first two terms, which are 7 and 8. To do that, we just multiply them together!\n\n7 x 8 = 56 \n\nSo, the product of the first two terms is 56! Yay, we did it!",
