    "solution": "Simply back up from $11$. Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\\cdot 1 = 8$. So the answer is $7 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence as $a$ and the common difference as $d$. Since the fifth term of the sequence is given as $11$, we can express the terms in the sequence as follows:\n\n$a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d = 11.$\n\nWe are also given that the difference between two consecutive terms is $1$, so we have:\n\n$a + d - a = d = 1,$\n\nwhich means that the common difference $d$ is equal to $1$. \n\nUsing the fact that the fifth term of the sequence is $11$, we can plug in the values:\n\n$a + 4d = 11,$\n\n$a + 4(1) =  11,$\n\n$a + 4 = 11,$\n\n$a = 7.$\n\nTherefore, the first term of the arithmetic sequence is $7$ and the common difference is $1$. The product of the first two terms is:\n\n$7 \\times 8 = 56.$\n\nHence, the product of the first two terms of the arithmetic sequence is $56$.",
