    "solution": "Simply back up from $11$. Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\\cdot 1 = 8$. So the answer is $7 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{56}$.",

We are given that the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence is $11$ and the difference between two consecutive terms is $1$. \n\nTo find the fifth term, we can use the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n$T_n = a + (n-1)d$\n\nWhere:\n$T_n$ = $11$ (since the fifth term is $11$)\n$a$ = first term\n$d$ = common difference\n$n$ = $5$ (since we are looking for the fifth term)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$11 = a + (5-1)1$\n$11 = a + 4$\n\nSolving for $a$, we find:\n$a = 11 - 4$\n$a = 7$\n\nSo, the first term of the arithmetic sequence is $7$. \n\nNow, we need to find the second term:\n$7 + 1 = 8$\n\nThe product of the first two terms is:\n$7 \\times 8 = 56$\n\nTherefore, the product of the first two terms of the arithmetic sequence is $56$.",
