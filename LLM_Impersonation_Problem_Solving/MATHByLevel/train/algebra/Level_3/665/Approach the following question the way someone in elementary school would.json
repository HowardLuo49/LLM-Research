    "solution": "The common ratio is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2}=\\frac{1}{8}$, so the $k^{th}$ term is $2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{k-1}$. Thus we have:\n\n$2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^4=\\frac{2}{2^{12}}=\\frac{1}{2^{11}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2048}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fifth term of a geometric sequence, we need to figure out the pattern of the sequence first. In a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant number called the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, we know that the first term is 2 and the second term is $\\frac{1}{4}$. To find the common ratio, we can divide the second term by the first term: \n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\div 2 = \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nSo the common ratio is $\\frac{1}{8}$. \n\nNow, to find the fifth term, we can keep multiplying by the common ratio: \n\n$2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$ (3rd term)\n\n$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{32}$ (4th term)\n\nNow, we can find the fifth term:\n\n$\\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{256}$\n\nSo, the fifth term of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{1}{256}$.",
