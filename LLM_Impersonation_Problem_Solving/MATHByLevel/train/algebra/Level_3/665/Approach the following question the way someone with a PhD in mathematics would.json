    "solution": "The common ratio is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2}=\\frac{1}{8}$, so the $k^{th}$ term is $2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{k-1}$. Thus we have:\n\n$2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^4=\\frac{2}{2^{12}}=\\frac{1}{2^{11}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2048}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fifth term of a geometric sequence, we first need to determine the common ratio of the sequence.
