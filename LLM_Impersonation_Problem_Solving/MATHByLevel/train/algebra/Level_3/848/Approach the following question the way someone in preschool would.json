    "solution": "The graph of $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ is a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $\\sqrt{25}=5$.  Beginning at $(-5, 0)$ and working our way around the circle, we have the following 12 points on the circle:\n\n$(-5, 0)$, $(-4, 3)$, $(-3, 4)$, $(0, 5)$, $(3, 4)$, $(4, 3)$, $(5, 0)$, $(4, -3)$, $(3, -4)$, $(0, -5)$, $(-3, -4)$, $(-4, -3)$.\n\nThe greatest possible sum for any of these pairs is $3+4=\\boxed{7}$.\n\n(Of course, you could probably have guess-checked this answer relatively easily, but recognizing the equation as the graph of a circle is helpful in convincing yourself that there is no greater value of $x+y$ ... or, for example, if you wanted to find the greatest possible value of $x+y$, which is $5\\sqrt2$).",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count how many different pairs of numbers we can use to make $x^2+y^2=25$. We can try different numbers to see which ones work. \n\nIf we start with $x=0$, then we need to find $y$ such that $y^2=25$. The only possible number for $y$ is 5, because $5^2=25$. So the pair $(0,5)$ works.\n\nNext, let's try $x=1$. In this case, we can use $y=4$ since $1^2+4^2=1+16=17 \\neq 25$. So this pair doesn't work.\n\nIf we continue trying different values of $x$ and find all the pairs that work, we can see that there are 12 pairs that satisfy the condition $x^2+y^2=25$.\n\nNow, we need to find the pair with the greatest sum $x+y$. Let's list all the pairs: \\[(0,5), (0,-5), (5,0), (-5,0), (3,4), (3,-4), (-3,4), (-3,-4), (4,3), (-4,3), (4,-3), (-4,-3).\\] \n\nThe greatest sum $x+y$ among these pairs is $4+5=\\boxed{9}$.",
