    "solution": "The graph of $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ is a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $\\sqrt{25}=5$.  Beginning at $(-5, 0)$ and working our way around the circle, we have the following 12 points on the circle:\n\n$(-5, 0)$, $(-4, 3)$, $(-3, 4)$, $(0, 5)$, $(3, 4)$, $(4, 3)$, $(5, 0)$, $(4, -3)$, $(3, -4)$, $(0, -5)$, $(-3, -4)$, $(-4, -3)$.\n\nThe greatest possible sum for any of these pairs is $3+4=\\boxed{7}$.\n\n(Of course, you could probably have guess-checked this answer relatively easily, but recognizing the equation as the graph of a circle is helpful in convincing yourself that there is no greater value of $x+y$ ... or, for example, if you wanted to find the greatest possible value of $x+y$, which is $5\\sqrt2$).",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find all the ordered pairs of integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. We can do this by trying different values of $x$ and solving for $y$.\n\nLet's start with $x = 0$. If we substitute $x = 0$ into the equation, we get $0 + y^2 = 25$, which means $y^2 = 25$. This gives us $y = \\pm 5$, so the ordered pairs with $x=0$ are $(0,5)$ and $(0,-5)$.\n\nNext, let's try $x = 1$. If we substitute $x = 1$ into the equation, we get $1 + y^2 = 25$, so $y^2 = 24$. There are no integer solutions for $y$ in this case.\n\nWe continue trying different values of $x$ and see that the pairs that satisfy the equation are $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$, $(-3,-4)$, $(-4,-3)$, $(-3,4)$, $(-4,3)$, $(3,-4)$, and $(4,-3)$.\n\nTo find the greatest possible sum $x+y$ from these pairs, we just need to add the numbers together and see which one gives us the largest sum.
