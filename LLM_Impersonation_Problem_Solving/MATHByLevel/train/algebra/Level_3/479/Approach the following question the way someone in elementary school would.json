    "solution": "A quadratic has exactly one distinct solution when its discriminant is 0.  The discriminant of $4x^2 + nx + 25$ is $n^2 - 4(4)(25)$.  Setting this equal to 0 gives $n^2 - 400 = 0$, so $n^2 = 400$.  The positive solution of this equation is $n = \\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive value of $n$ when there is only one solution for the equation $4x^2+nx+25=0$, we can use the Discriminant formula. \n\nThe Discriminant formula is b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients in the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = n, and c = 25. \n\nThe equation tells us that there is only one solution for the equation, so the Discriminant must be equal to 0. \n\nSo we set up the equation: \nn^2 - 4(4)(25) = 0\nn^2 - 400 = 0\nn^2 = 400\nn = \u00b120\n\nSince we are looking for the positive value of n, the answer is 20. \n\nTherefore, the positive value of n is 20.",
