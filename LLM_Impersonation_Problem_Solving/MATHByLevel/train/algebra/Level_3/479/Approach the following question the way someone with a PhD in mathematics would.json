    "solution": "A quadratic has exactly one distinct solution when its discriminant is 0.  The discriminant of $4x^2 + nx + 25$ is $n^2 - 4(4)(25)$.  Setting this equal to 0 gives $n^2 - 400 = 0$, so $n^2 = 400$.  The positive solution of this equation is $n = \\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "When the equation $4x^2 + nx + 25 = 0$ has exactly one solution, it means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is equal to zero. \n\nThe discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$. So in this case, we have the discriminant as $(n^2) - 4(4)(25) = n^2 - 400$. \n\nFor the equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero, so we have $n^2 - 400 = 0$. \nSolving for $n$ gives us $n^2 = 400$, and therefore $n = \\pm 20$. \n\nHowever, since we are looking for the positive value of $n$, the positive value of $n$ is $\\boxed{20}$.",
