    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
    "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. We have a puppy, a larger cat, and a smaller cat. We know that all three of them together weigh 24 pounds. \n\nNext, we know that the puppy and the larger cat together weigh twice as much as the smaller cat. This means that we can represent their weights as follows: \n\nPuppy + Larger Cat = 2(Smaller Cat)\n\nAnd lastly, we know that the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh the same as the larger cat. So we can represent their weights as:\n\nPuppy + Smaller Cat = Larger Cat\n\nNow, we can set up a system of equations to solve for the weight of the puppy. Let's say the weight of the puppy is x, the weight of the smaller cat is y, and the weight of the larger cat is z. \n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\n\nx + y + z = 24\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n\nx + z = 2y\n\nAnd from the third equation, we have:\n\nx + y = z\n\nNow, we can substitute the third equation into the second equation to get:\n\nz + y = 2y\nz = y\n\nNow we can substitute z = y into the first equation:\n\nx + y + y = 24\nx + 2y = 24\n\nSince we already know that z = y, we can substitute z = y into the third equation to solve for x:\n\nx + y = y\nx = 0\n\nTherefore, the puppy weighs 0 pounds.",
