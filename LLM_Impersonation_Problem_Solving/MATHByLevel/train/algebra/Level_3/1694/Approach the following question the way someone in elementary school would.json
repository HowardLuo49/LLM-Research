    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
    "solution": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's pretend we're in a math class in elementary school! \n\nFirst, let's give names to the cats and the puppy. Let's call the puppy Sparky, the larger cat Mittens, and the smaller cat Whiskers.\n\nWe know that Sparky + Mittens + Whiskers = 24 pounds.\n\nWe also know that Sparky + Mittens = 2 x Whiskers and Sparky + Whiskers = Mittens.\n\nLet's use these equations to find out how much Sparky weighs!\n\nSince Sparky + Mittens = 2 x Whiskers, and Sparky + Whiskers = Mittens, we can substitute to find out that Mittens = 2 x Whiskers - Sparky. Then, we can substitute again to find out that Sparky + Whiskers = 2 x Whiskers - Sparky. That simplifies to Sparky = Whiskers.\n\nSo, Sparky weighs the same as Whiskers! That means the puppy weighs the same as the smaller cat. Since the three animals together weigh 24 pounds, and two cats weigh 24 pounds, the puppy must weigh 8 pounds!\n\nSo, the puppy weighs 8 pounds! Good job solving the problem in our elementary school math class!",
