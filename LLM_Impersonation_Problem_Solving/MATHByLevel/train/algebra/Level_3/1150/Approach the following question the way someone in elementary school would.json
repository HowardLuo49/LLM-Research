    "solution": "Substituting in $x=2$, we obtain the equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny+6&=a,\\\\\n5y+4&=2a.\n\\end{align*}\n\nMultiplying the first equation by $5$ and subtracting it from the second equation, we find\n\n$$-26=-3a\\Rightarrow a=\\boxed{\\frac{26}{3}}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's plug in $x=2$ into the first equation to find out what $y$ is. \nSo we have $3(2)+y=a$, which simplifies to $6+y=a$. \nNow we can substitute this value of $a$ into the second equation. \nWe get $2(2)+5y=2(6+y)$. \nThis simplifies to $4+5y=12+2y$. \nSubtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $3y=8$. \nThen dividing by $3$ gives $y=\\frac{8}{3}$. \nSo the solution is $(x,y)=(2,\\frac{8}{3})$. \nFinally, we can find $a$ by plugging in $x=2$ and $y=\\frac{8}{3}$ into the first equation $3x+y=a$. \nSo $3(2)+\\frac{8}{3}=a$, which simplifies to $6+\\frac{8}{3}=a$. \nCalculating this gives $a=\\boxed{\\frac{26}{3}}$.",
