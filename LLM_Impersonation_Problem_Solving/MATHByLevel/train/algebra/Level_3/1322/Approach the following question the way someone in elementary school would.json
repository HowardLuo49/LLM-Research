    "solution": "We use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points, which is the side length of the square.\n$\\sqrt{(3-2)^2+(4-1)^2}=\\sqrt{1+9} = \\sqrt{10}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(\\sqrt{10})^2 = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the area of the square, we need to know the distance between these two points. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem!\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of the side of the square. We can do this by finding the difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two points.\n\nThe difference between the x-coordinates is $3-2 = 1$. \nThe difference between the y-coordinates is $4-1 = 3$.\n\nNow, we can find the length of the side of the square using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$1^2 + 3^2 = c^2$\n$1 + 9 = c^2$\n$10 = c^2$\n$c = \\sqrt{10}$\n\nSince all sides of a square are equal, the area of the square is $(\\sqrt{10})^2 = 10$ square units. \n\nSo, the area of the square is 10 square units.",
