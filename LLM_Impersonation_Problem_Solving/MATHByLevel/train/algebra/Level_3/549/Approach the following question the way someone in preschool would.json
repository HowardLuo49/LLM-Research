    "solution": "Distributing the left side of the inequality, we have $x^{2}+6x+9\\leq1$, which simplifies to $x^{2}+6x+8\\leq0$. This can be factored into $(x+2)(x+4)\\leq0$, and we can now look at the three regions formed by this inequality: $x<-4, -4\\leq x\\leq -2,$ and $x>-2$. We know that the signs in each of these regions alternate, and we test any number in each of the regions to make sure. Plugging into $(x+2)(x+4)$, any $x$ less than $-4$ yields a positive product, and any $x$ greater than $-2$ also yields a positive product. The remaining interval between $-2$ and $-4$ inclusive yields a nonpositive product. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers which satisfy the inequality: $-2, -3$, and $-4$.",

So, 0 doesn't work.\nIf we put 1 in the box, we get $(1+3)^2=16$ which is greater than 1. So, 1 doesn't work.\nIf we put -1 in the box, we get $(-1+3)^2=4$ which is greater than 1. So, -1 doesn't work.\nSince none of the numbers 0, 1, or -1 work, there are 0 integers that satisfy the inequality. The big smile stays happy with no numbers in the box!",
