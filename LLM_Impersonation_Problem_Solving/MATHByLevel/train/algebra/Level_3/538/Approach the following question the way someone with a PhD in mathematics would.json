    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-6.$  Since they are in the ratio $2:1,$ the roots are $-4$ and $-2.$  Then $k$ is their product, namely $(-4)(-2) = \\boxed{8}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $k$, we first rewrite the quadratic equation in terms of its roots. Let the roots be $r$ and $2r$, such that $r:2r=1:2$. The sum of the roots is given by \n\n$$r + 2r = -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{6}{1} = -6$$\n\n$$3r = -6$$\n\n$$r = -2$$\n\nTherefore, the roots of the quadratic equation are $-2$ and $-4$. Using Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $r + 2r = -6$, and the product of the roots is $r(2r) = -k$. So, we have:\n\n$-2 + (-4) = -6$\n\n$-2(-4) = -k$\n\n$-6 = -6$\n\n$-8 = -k$\n\n$k = 8$\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ in the equation $x^2 + 6x + k = 0$ is 8.",
