    "solution": "Using the distributive property and combining like terms: \\begin{align*}\nx(3x^2-2)-5(x^2-2x+7) &= 3x^3-2x-5x^2+10x-35\\\\\n& = \\boxed{3x^3-5x^2+8x-35}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's see if we can simplify this big math problem! First, we need to remember the order in which we do things: parentheses first, then multiplication. Let's start by multiplying $x$ by everything inside the first set of parentheses. \n\nSo, $x$ times $3x^2$ is $3x^3$, and $x$ times $-2$ is $-2x$. We can write that as $3x^3-2x$. \n\nNext, let's multiply $-5$ by everything inside the second set of parentheses.\n\n$-5$ times $x^2$ is $-5x^2$, $-5$ times $-2x$ is $10x$, and $-5$ times $7$ is $-35$. So, that gives us $-5x^2+10x-35.$ \n\nNow, we just need to put everything together. So, the simplified expression is $3x^3-2x-5x^2+10x-35$. \n\nWe can combine like terms, which means adding or subtracting the coefficients of terms with the same variable part. \n\nSo, $3x^3$ doesn't have any other term like it, so we leave it alone. \n\n$-2x$ can be combined with $10x$, so that gives us $8x$.\n\nAnd $-5x^2$ doesn't have any other term like it, so we leave it alone. \n\nSo, our final answer in the form $Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D$ is $3x^3 -5x^2 + 8x -35$. \n\nYay, we did it! Math is fun!",
