    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The slope of a line is $-2$ and its $x$-intercept is $(5,0).$ What is the $y$-intercept point of the line? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "solution": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the equation of the line.}$\n\nA point-slope equation of the line is $y-0= -2(x-5),$ so the standard form of the equation of the line is $2x+y=10.$ When $x=0,$ we have $y=10,$ so the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use the slope without finding the equation.}$\n\nBecause the slope of the line is $-2,$ the line goes down $2$ steps for each $1$ step right. However, the point we are given on the line, $(5,0),$ is already to the right of the $y$-axis, which is where the $y$-intercept is.Therefore, we instead think of the slope as going up $2$ steps for each $1$ step left. We must take $1$ step left $5$ times to get to the $y$-axis from point $(5,0),$ so to stay on this line, we must also take $2$ steps up $5$ times, for a total of $10$ steps. The point that is $10$ steps up and $5$ steps to the left of $(5,0)$ is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first, let's remember what the slope and intercepts are. The slope is how steep a line is. If the slope is $-2,$ that means for every $1$ we move to the right, we go down $2.$ \n\nThe $x$-intercept is where the line crosses the $x$-axis. If the $x$-intercept is $(5,0),$ that means the line crosses the $x$-axis at $x=5$ and $y=0.$ \n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we need to find where the line crosses the $y$-axis. Since the slope is $-2,$ we know that for every $1$ we move to the right, we go down $2.$ \n\nIf the $x$-intercept is at $(5,0),$ that means when $x=5,$ $y$ is $0.$ If we go $1$ unit to the left from the $x$-intercept, we need to go up $2$ units to reach the line. So, the $y$-intercept is at $(4,2).$\n\nSo, the $y$-intercept is $(4,2)$.",
