    "solution": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the equation of the line.}$\n\nA point-slope equation of the line is $y-0= -2(x-5),$ so the standard form of the equation of the line is $2x+y=10.$ When $x=0,$ we have $y=10,$ so the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use the slope without finding the equation.}$\n\nBecause the slope of the line is $-2,$ the line goes down $2$ steps for each $1$ step right. However, the point we are given on the line, $(5,0),$ is already to the right of the $y$-axis, which is where the $y$-intercept is.Therefore, we instead think of the slope as going up $2$ steps for each $1$ step left. We must take $1$ step left $5$ times to get to the $y$-axis from point $(5,0),$ so to stay on this line, we must also take $2$ steps up $5$ times, for a total of $10$ steps. The point that is $10$ steps up and $5$ steps to the left of $(5,0)$ is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $y$-intercept point of the line, we first need to find the equation of the line using the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.\n\nSince the slope of the line is $-2$ and the $x$-intercept is $(5,0),$ we know that the line passes through the point $(5,0)$ and is perpendicular to a line with slope $-2.$\n\nThe slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope $m$ is the negative reciprocal of $m.$ So the slope of the line we are looking for is $\\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nNow that we have the slope $m = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the $x$-intercept $(5,0),$ we can substitute these values into the slope-intercept form $y = mx + b$ and solve for the $y$-intercept $b:$\n\n$0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 + b$\n\n$0 = \\frac{5}{2} + b$\n\n$- \\frac{5}{2} = b$\n\nTherefore, the $y$-intercept point is $\\boxed{\\left(0, - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)}.$",
