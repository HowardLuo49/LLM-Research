    "solution": "Since $q(4) = 3\\cdot 4 - b = 12-b$, we can write $p(q(4)) = 7$ as $p(12-b) = 7$.  Since $p(x) = 2x-7$, we have $p(12-b) = 2(12-b) - 7 = 17 - 2b$. Substituting this into $p(12-b) = 7$ gives $17-2b =7$, from which we have $b = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First we need to find $q(4)$ by plugging in $4$ into the function $q(x)$. That gives us $q(4) = 3(4) - b = 12 - b$.\n\nNext, we need to plug $q(4)$ into the function $p(x)$. So $p(q(4)) = p(12 - b) = 2(12 - b) - 7 = 24 - 2b - 7 = 17 - 2b$.\n\nSince $p(q(4)) = 7$, we have $17 - 2b = 7$. Now we need to solve for $b$. Subtracting $17$ from both sides gives us $-2b = -10$, and dividing by $-2$ gives us $b = 5$.\n\nSo, $b = 5$.",
