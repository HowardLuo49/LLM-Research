    "solution": "Since $q(4) = 3\\cdot 4 - b = 12-b$, we can write $p(q(4)) = 7$ as $p(12-b) = 7$.  Since $p(x) = 2x-7$, we have $p(12-b) = 2(12-b) - 7 = 17 - 2b$. Substituting this into $p(12-b) = 7$ gives $17-2b =7$, from which we have $b = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find $q(4)$ by plugging $4$ into the function $q(x)$. This gives us $q(4) = 3(4) - b = 12 - b$.\n\nNext, we substitute $q(4)$ back into the function $p(x)$. So, $p(q(4)) = p(12 - b) = 2(12 - b) - 7 = 24 - 2b - 7 = 17 - 2b$.\n\nSince we are given that $p(q(4)) = 7$, we set $17 - 2b = 7$ and solve for $b$:\n\n$17 - 2b = 7$\n\n$-2b = 7 - 17$\n\n$-2b = -10$\n\n$b = -10 / (-2)$\n\n$b = 5$\n\nTherefore, $b = 5$.",
