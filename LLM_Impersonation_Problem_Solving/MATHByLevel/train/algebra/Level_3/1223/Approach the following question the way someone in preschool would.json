    "solution": "Since $q(4) = 3\\cdot 4 - b = 12-b$, we can write $p(q(4)) = 7$ as $p(12-b) = 7$.  Since $p(x) = 2x-7$, we have $p(12-b) = 2(12-b) - 7 = 17 - 2b$. Substituting this into $p(12-b) = 7$ gives $17-2b =7$, from which we have $b = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have this thing called p(x) and q(x). p(x) equals 2x minus 7, and q(x) equals 3x minus b. Now, we need to find out what b is when we plug 4 into q(x) and then put that answer into p(x). So we have p(q(4)) equals 7. We need to figure out what b is to make that true. Let's try solving it together!",
