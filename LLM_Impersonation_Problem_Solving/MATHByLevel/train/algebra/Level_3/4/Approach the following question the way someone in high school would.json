    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?",
    "solution": "Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first I know that the perimeter of a rectangle is just adding up all the sides. So if the perimeter is 24 inches, that means the four sides added together equal 24 inches.\n\nSince a rectangle has opposite sides that are equal in length, I can say that each pair of sides add up to half of the perimeter. So each pair of sides is 12 inches.\n\nTo find the maximum area of a rectangle, I know that a square has the largest area for a given perimeter. So, I will try to make this rectangle as close to a square as possible.\n\nIf I split the 12 inches in half for each pair of sides, that means each side is 6 inches. So, if the length and width are both 6 inches, that means the total area is 6 inches x 6 inches = 36 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area for this rectangle is 36 square inches.",
