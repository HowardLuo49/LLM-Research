    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?",
    "solution": "Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the sides of the rectangle. One, two, three, four! The perimeter is the total of all the sides. If each side is 6 inches, then the perimeter is 24 inches. \n\nNow, let's figure out the area. To find the area, we need to multiply the length and width of the rectangle. Since we want the maximum possible area, we need to make the rectangle as close to a square as possible. So, let's make each side 6 inches.\n\nNow, let's multiply 6 inches by 6 inches. 6 x 6 is 36 square inches. So, the maximum possible area for this rectangle is 36 square inches. Yay, we did it!",
