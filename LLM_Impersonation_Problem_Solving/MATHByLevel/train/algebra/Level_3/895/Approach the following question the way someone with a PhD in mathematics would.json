    "solution": "We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle. Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2-4x+y^2-12y=-39$. Completing the square in $x$, we add $(-4/2)^2=4$ to both sides. Completing the square in $y$, we add $(-12/2)^2=36$ to both sides. The equation becomes \\begin{align*}\nx^2-4x+y^2-12y&=-39\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2-4x+4+y^2-12y+36&=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x-2)^2+(y-6)^2&=1\n\\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(2,6)$ so $h+k=2+6=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the center of the circle, we first need to rewrite the equation in standard form. Completing the square for both $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n$(x^2 - 4x) + (y^2 -12y) = -39$\n\n$(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 12y + 36) = 1$\n\n$(x-2)^2 + (y-6)^2 = 1$\n\nComparing this to the standard form of a circle: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, we see that the center of the circle is at $(h,k) = (2,6)$.\n\nTherefore, $h+k = 2 + 6 = 8$.",
