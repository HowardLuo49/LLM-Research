    "solution": "We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle. Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2-4x+y^2-12y=-39$. Completing the square in $x$, we add $(-4/2)^2=4$ to both sides. Completing the square in $y$, we add $(-12/2)^2=36$ to both sides. The equation becomes \\begin{align*}\nx^2-4x+y^2-12y&=-39\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2-4x+4+y^2-12y+36&=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x-2)^2+(y-6)^2&=1\n\\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(2,6)$ so $h+k=2+6=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's draw a circle! Remember to use lots of colors to make it look pretty. Then, we need to find the center of the circle. This is like finding the middle of the circle where it balances perfectly. We can do this by rearranging the equation to look like $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. \n\nOnce we find the equation in that form, we can see that the center of the circle is at point $(h,k)$. To find $h$ and $k$, we just need to match up the numbers in the equation. So, in this case, $h$ is the number next to the $x$ term and $k$ is the number next to the $y$ term. \n\nFinally, to find $h+k$, we just add $h$ and $k$ together. It's like counting how many cupcakes you have in total when you add them all up! So, let's find $h$ and $k$, add them together, and see what we get! Yay for math and circles!",
