    "solution": "We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle. Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2-4x+y^2-12y=-39$. Completing the square in $x$, we add $(-4/2)^2=4$ to both sides. Completing the square in $y$, we add $(-12/2)^2=36$ to both sides. The equation becomes \\begin{align*}\nx^2-4x+y^2-12y&=-39\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2-4x+4+y^2-12y+36&=1\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x-2)^2+(y-6)^2&=1\n\\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(2,6)$ so $h+k=2+6=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form by completing the square for $x$ and $y$.\n\n$x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 12y = -39$\n\n$(x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 12y + 36) = -39 + 4 + 36$\n\n$(x-2)^2 + (y-6)^2 = 1$\n\nNow we can see that the center of the circle is at point $(2,6)$, so $h=2$ and $k=6$. \n\nTherefore, $h+k = 2 + 6 = 8$. \n\nSo, the answer is 8.",
