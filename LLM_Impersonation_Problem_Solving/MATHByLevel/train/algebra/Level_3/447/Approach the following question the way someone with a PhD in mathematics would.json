    "solution": "Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3. Therefore, $p - q = \\boxed{15}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the values of $p$ and $q$, we can first expand the left side of the equation:\n\n$$(x-3)(x+3) = x^2 - 9.$$\n\nWe now have the equation:\n\n$$x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63.$$\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n$$x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0.$$\n\nWe can now use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{21 \u00b1 \\sqrt{441 - 216}}{2}.$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{21 \u00b1 \\sqrt{225}}{2}.$$\n\nThus, $x = 15$ or $x = 6$. Therefore, $p = 15$ and $q = 6$. \n\nSince $p > q$, we have $p - q = 15 - 6 = 9$. \n\nSo, the value of $p - q$ is 9.",
