    "solution": "Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3. Therefore, $p - q = \\boxed{15}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first look at the equation. We see that it has terms like $(x-3)$ and $(x+3)$, which make it a little tricky. Let's try to simplify it.\n\nWhen we multiply out $(x-3)(x+3)$, we get $x^2 + 3x - 3x - 9$. Can you see how some terms cancel out?\n\nThis simplifies to $x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63$. Now, we want to solve for $x$. Can you try to solve it?\n\nWhen we solve it, we get $x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0$. Do you see how we got this equation?\n\nNow, we need to find the two values of $x$ that make this equation true. Can you think of two numbers that multiply to 54 and add up to -21?\n\nThe two numbers are $3$ and $18$. So the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = 18$. But wait, we need to find $p$ and $q$! Can you figure out which is $p$ and which is $q$?\n\nSince $p > q$, we know that $p = 18$ and $q = 3$. Now, can you tell me the value of $p - q$?\n\nThe value of $p - q$ is $18 - 3 = 15$.
