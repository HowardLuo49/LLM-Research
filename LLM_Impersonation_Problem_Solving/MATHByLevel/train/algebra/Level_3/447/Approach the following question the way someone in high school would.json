    "solution": "Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3. Therefore, $p - q = \\boxed{15}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the two solutions $p$ and $q$, we first expand the left side of the equation to get $x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63$. \nNext, we rearrange the equation to get $x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0$. \nTo find the solutions, we can factor the quadratic to get $(x-6)(x-9) = 0$. \nThis means $x=6$ or $x=9$. \nSince $p > q$, we have $p=9$ and $q=6$. \nTherefore, $p-q = 9-6 = 3$. \n\nSo, the value of $p - q$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
