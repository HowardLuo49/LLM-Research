    "solution": "Factoring the right side, we can see that $(x-3)(x+3) = 21(x-3)$. Simplifying, we have $(x-3)(x+3) - 21(x-3) = (x-3)(x-18),$ and therefore our $p$ and $q$ are 18 and 3. Therefore, $p - q = \\boxed{15}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first simplify the left side of the equation by using the distributive property to multiply out the terms inside the parentheses. \n\n$(x - 3)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x - 3x - 9 = x^2 - 9$\n\nSo now we have the equation $x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63$.\n\nLet's move all the terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:\n\n$x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0$\n\nNow we need to find the solutions to this quadratic equation. We can factor it into: $(x - 3)(x - 18) = 0$\n\nSo the solutions are $p = 18$ and $q = 3$. Since $p > q$, we subtract $q$ from $p$ to find the difference:\n\n$18 - 3 = 15$\n\nTherefore, the value of $p - q$ is 15.",
