    "solution": "Suppose that the number of ounces of pure water necessary is equal to $w$. Then, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is $30 + w$. The acid content of the mixture will always be $30\\% \\times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid. Thus, the amount of acid in the mixture is equal to $\\frac{9}{30 + w}$. Setting this equal to $20\\% = \\frac 15$, it follows that $$\\frac{9}{30+w} = \\frac 15 \\Longrightarrow 30+w = 45.$$ Thus, $w = \\boxed{15}$ ounces of pure water.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use our math fingers to count how many ounces of pure water we need to add!\n\nFirst, we have $30$ ounces of a $30\\%$ solution of acid. This means that $30\\%$ of those $30$ ounces is acid, which is $0.30 \\times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid.\n\nNow, we want to end up with a solution that is $20\\%$ acid. This means that $20\\%$ of the total solution should be acid.\n\nLet's use our math fingers again to represent the total solution. We have $30$ ounces of the original solution and we need to add some pure water. Let's say we need to add $x$ ounces of pure water.\n\nSo the total amount of solution will be $30 + x$ ounces. We want $20\\%$ of this total amount to be acid, which means $0.20 \\times (30 + x)$ ounces should be acid.\n\nWe want this amount of acid to be equal to the amount of acid we already have, which is $9$ ounces. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n$0.20 \\times (30 + x) = 9$\n\nNow, let's solve for $x$ by using our math fingers to count and find the right amount of pure water needed to add to the solution.",
