    "solution": "Suppose that the number of ounces of pure water necessary is equal to $w$. Then, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is $30 + w$. The acid content of the mixture will always be $30\\% \\times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid. Thus, the amount of acid in the mixture is equal to $\\frac{9}{30 + w}$. Setting this equal to $20\\% = \\frac 15$, it follows that $$\\frac{9}{30+w} = \\frac 15 \\Longrightarrow 30+w = 45.$$ Thus, $w = \\boxed{15}$ ounces of pure water.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for mixtures.\n\nLet $x$ be the amount of pure water we need to add.\n\nThe amount of acid in the original solution is $30\\%$ of $30$ ounces, which is $0.30(30) = 9$ ounces.\n\nAfter adding $x$ ounces of pure water, the total amount of solution will be $30 + x$ ounces.\n\nThe amount of acid in the final solution is still $9$ ounces, but it is now $20\\%$ of the total amount of solution, which is $30 + x$ ounces.\n\nTherefore, we have the equation:\n\n$$0.20(30 + x) = 9$$\n$$6 + 0.20x = 9$$\n$$0.20x = 3$$\n$$x = \\frac{3}{0.20} = 15$$\n\nSo, we need to add $15$ ounces of pure water to the $30$ ounces of the $30\\%$ acid solution to yield a solution that is $20\\%$ acid.",
