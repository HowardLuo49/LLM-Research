    "solution": "Suppose that the number of ounces of pure water necessary is equal to $w$. Then, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is $30 + w$. The acid content of the mixture will always be $30\\% \\times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid. Thus, the amount of acid in the mixture is equal to $\\frac{9}{30 + w}$. Setting this equal to $20\\% = \\frac 15$, it follows that $$\\frac{9}{30+w} = \\frac 15 \\Longrightarrow 30+w = 45.$$ Thus, $w = \\boxed{15}$ ounces of pure water.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's pretend we have a big jug of water and we want to make a special drink with acid. Right now, we have $30$ ounces of a $30\\%$ acid solution. That means that $30\\%$ of the $30$ ounces is acid and the rest is water. \n\nTo make a $20\\%$ acid solution, we need to add even more water to dilute the acid. We want the final solution to be $20\\%$ acid. \n\nSo, we need to figure out how many ounces of pure water to add to the $30$ ounces of $30\\%$ acid solution.\n\nThe amount of acid in the original solution is $30\\%$ of $30$ ounces, which is $0.3 \\cdot 30 = 9$ ounces.\n\nSince we want the final solution to be $20\\%$ acid, we want $20\\%$ of the total solution to be acid. Let $x$ be the amount of pure water we need to add. \n\nThe total amount of acid in the final solution should be $20\\%$ of the total amount of the final solution. \n\nSo, the equation we need to solve is: \n\n\\[\\frac{9}{30 + x} = \\frac{20}{100}\\]\n\nFirst, we write the above fractions have same denominator and simplify it to:\n\n\\[180 = 600 + 20x\\]\n\nSolving this equation will give us the answer to how many ounces of pure water to add to get a $20\\%$ acid solution.",
