    "solution": "We square both sides to get rid of the square root sign.  This gives us $5+2z = 121$.  Solving for $z$ gives $z = \\boxed{58}$.  We squared an equation, so we have to test our solution to make sure it isn't extraneous.  We have\n\\[\\sqrt{5 +2 \\cdot 58} =\\sqrt{121} = 11\\]so our solution is valid.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all the solutions to this equation, we need to figure out what number $z$ is. \n\nFirst, we need to get rid of the square root. It says $\\sqrt{5+2z}$, so we need to get rid of the square root by squaring both sides. \n\nWhen we square the left side, we get rid of the square root and just have $5+2z$. When we square the right side, we get $11^2 = 121$. \n\nSo now our equation is $5+2z = 121$. \n\nNext, we need to solve for $z$. \n\nSubtract 5 from both sides to get $2z = 116$. \n\nNow, we just need to divide by 2 to find $z$. \n\n$z = \\frac{116}{2} = 58$. \n\nSo the solution to the equation $\\sqrt{5+2z} = 11$ is $z = 58$.",
