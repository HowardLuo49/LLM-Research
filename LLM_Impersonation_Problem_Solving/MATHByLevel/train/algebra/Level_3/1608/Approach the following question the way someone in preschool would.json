    "solution": "We square both sides to get rid of the square root sign.  This gives us $5+2z = 121$.  Solving for $z$ gives $z = \\boxed{58}$.  We squared an equation, so we have to test our solution to make sure it isn't extraneous.  We have\n\\[\\sqrt{5 +2 \\cdot 58} =\\sqrt{121} = 11\\]so our solution is valid.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the solution to this fun problem, we need to remember that when we see a square root, it means finding the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives us the number inside the square root. So in this case, we want to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives us $5+2z$. \n\nSince the square root of $5+2z$ is 11, that means $11$ times $11$ is equal to $5+2z$. We can write this as $11 \\times 11 = 5 + 2z$. \n\nNow, we can solve for $z$ by first solving $11 \\times 11$, which equals $121$. So our equation becomes $121 = 5 + 2z$. \n\nThen we can isolate $z$ by subtracting $5$ from both sides of the equation. This gives us $121 - 5 = 5 - 5 + 2z$, which simplifies to $116 = 2z$.\n\nLastly, we divide both sides by $2$ to find the value of $z$. So, $z = 116 / 2 = 58$. \n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation $\\sqrt{5+2z} = 11$ is $z = 58$. Yay! We found the answer! Great job everyone! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc4f",
