    "solution": "Substituting in, we have $2(2-i)+3(-1+i)$. Expanding, we have $4-2i-3+3i$; adding, we have $\\boxed{1+i}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $2a+3b$, we first substitute the given values of $a$ and $b$:\n\n$2a + 3b = 2(2-i) + 3(-1+i)$\n\nExpanding the terms:\n\n$2a + 3b = 4 - 2i - 3 + 3i$\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n$2a + 3b = 1 + i$\n\nTherefore, the value of $2a+3b$ is $1+i$.",
