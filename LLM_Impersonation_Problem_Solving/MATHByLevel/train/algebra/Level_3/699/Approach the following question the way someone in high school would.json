    "solution": "The equation is well-defined unless the denominator of the given expression is equal to $0$, that is $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$. Factoring, $2(x-1)(x-2) = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = 1,2$. Hence, $A+B = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the values of $A$ and $B$, we need to identify the values of $x$ that will make the denominator of the fraction equal to zero. This is because division by zero is undefined.\n\nSo, we set $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n\n$2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$\n\nDividing by 2, we get: $x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$\n\nThis equation factors as: $(x-1)(x-2) = 0$\n\nTherefore, $x = 1$ and $x = 2$ will make the denominator zero, so $A = 1$ and $B = 2$.\n\nFinally, $A + B = 1 + 2 = \\boxed{3}$.",
