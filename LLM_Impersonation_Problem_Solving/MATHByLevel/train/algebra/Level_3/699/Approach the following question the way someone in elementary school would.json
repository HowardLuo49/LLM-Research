    "solution": "The equation is well-defined unless the denominator of the given expression is equal to $0$, that is $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$. Factoring, $2(x-1)(x-2) = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = 1,2$. Hence, $A+B = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the question is asking us to find the sum of $A$ and $B$. We know that the domain of the equation is all real numbers except for $x = A$ and $x = B$. That means that $A$ and $B$ are the values of $x$ that will make the denominator of the fraction $2x^2 - 6x + 4$ equal to zero.\n\nTo find those values, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$\n\n$2(x^2 - 3x + 2) = 0$\n\n$2(x-1)(x-2) = 0$\n\nSo, $x = 1$ or $x = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $A = 1$ and $B = 2$. \n\nTo find the sum of $A$ and $B$, we add them together:\n\n$A + B = 1 + 2 = 3$\n\nSo, $A + B = 3$.",
