    "solution": "The equation is well-defined unless the denominator of the given expression is equal to $0$, that is $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$. Factoring, $2(x-1)(x-2) = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = 1,2$. Hence, $A+B = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)",

Hmm, let's try some numbers for x and see where it doesn't work.\n\nLet's do some exploring and see what happens! Let's remember that x can't be A or B. Let's try to figure it out!
