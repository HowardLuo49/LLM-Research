    "solution": "The equation is well-defined unless the denominator of the given expression is equal to $0$, that is $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$. Factoring, $2(x-1)(x-2) = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = 1,2$. Hence, $A+B = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the domain of the given equation, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the domain of the equation is all real numbers except for the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero.\n\nThe denominator $2x^2 - 6x + 4$ can be factored as $(2x - 2)(x - 2) = 2(x - 1)(x - 2)$. Setting this equal to zero, we get:\n\n$2(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0$\n\nThis equation is satisfied when $x = 1$ or $x = 2$. Therefore, the values of $A$ and $B$ are 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nHence, $A + B = 1 + 2 = 3$.",
