    "solution": "We begin by multiplying out the denominator and then  squaring both sides \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{5x}}{\\sqrt{3(x-1)}}&=2\\\\\n(\\sqrt{5x})^2 &=\\left(2\\sqrt{3(x-1)}\\right)^2\\\\\n5x &= 12(x-1)\\\\\n12& =7x\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{7}}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ satisfies the original equation, so it is not an extraneous solution.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we want to get rid of the square roots in the equation by squaring both sides. This gives us $\\frac{5x}{3(x-1)} = 4$. \n\nNext, we can cross multiply to get $5x = 4(3x-3)$. Distributing the 4 gives us $5x = 12x - 12$.\n\nNow we can solve for x by subtracting 12x from both sides to get $-7x = -12$. \n\nLastly, we divide both sides by -7 to find that $x = \\frac{12}{7}$. So our final answer in simplest fractional form is $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{7}}$.",
