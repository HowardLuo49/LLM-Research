    "solution": "We begin by multiplying out the denominator and then  squaring both sides \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{5x}}{\\sqrt{3(x-1)}}&=2\\\\\n(\\sqrt{5x})^2 &=\\left(2\\sqrt{3(x-1)}\\right)^2\\\\\n5x &= 12(x-1)\\\\\n12& =7x\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{7}}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ satisfies the original equation, so it is not an extraneous solution.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! Let's see, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes $\\frac{\\sqrt{5x}}{\\sqrt{3(x-1)}}$ equal to 2. Let's start by writing it out. It looks like this: \n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{5x}}{\\sqrt{3(x-1)}} = 2$\n\nHmm... this is a tricky one! Maybe we can simplify it by first getting rid of those square roots. Let's multiply both the top and the bottom by $\\sqrt{3(x-1)}$. That gives us:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{5x} \\cdot \\sqrt{3(x-1)}}{\\sqrt{3(x-1)} \\cdot \\sqrt{3(x-1)}} = 2$\n\nNow, when we multiply the square roots on the bottom, we get this:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{15x(x-1)}}{3(x-1)} = 2$\n\nWow! Look at that! Now we just need to simplify a little more. We can cancel out the square root on the top and the bottom, which gives us:\n\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{15x}}{3} = 2$\n\nSo, now we just need to solve for $x$. We can do that by multiplying both sides by 3:\n\n$\\sqrt{15x} = 6$\n\nAnd then, to get rid of that square root, we can square both sides:\n\n$15x = 36$\n\nFinally, to find the value of $x$, we just need to divide both sides by 15:\n\n$x = \\frac{36}{15}$\n\nSo, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $\\frac{36}{15}$ or simplified, $\\frac{12}{5}$. Yay, we did it! Great job, everyone!",
