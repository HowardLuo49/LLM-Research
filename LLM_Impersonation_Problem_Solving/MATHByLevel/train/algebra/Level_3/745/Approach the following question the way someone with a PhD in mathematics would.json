    "solution": "This is a finite geometric series with first term 1, common ratio 2 and 11 terms. Thus the sum is: $$\\frac{1(1-2^{11})}{1-2} = \\frac{1-2^{11}}{-1} = 2^{11}-1 = 2048-1 = \\boxed{2047}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the sequence $1+2+4+8+16+ \\cdots + 1024$, we can notice that each term in the sequence is a power of 2.\n\nLet $S$ be the sum of the sequence. We can rewrite the sum as:\n\n$S = 2^0 + 2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+ \\cdots + 2^{10}$\n\nWe can recognize that this is a geometric series with first term $a=1$ and common ratio $r=2$. The formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series is given by:\n\n$S_n = a(1-r^n)/(1-r)$\n\nPlugging in the values $a=1$, $r=2$ and $n=11$ (since we have 11 terms from $2^0$ to $2^{10}$) we get:\n\n$S = 1(1-2^{11})/(1-2) = 1(1-2048)/(-1) = -2047$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the sequence $1+2+4+8+16+ \\cdots + 1024$ is $-2047$.",
