    "solution": "We have  \\[\\sqrt[4]{2^7\\cdot3^3} = \\sqrt[4]{2^4}\\sqrt[4]{2^3\\cdot3^3} = 2\\sqrt[4]{8\\cdot27} = 2\\sqrt[4]{216}.\\] Therefore, $a+b = \\boxed{218}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have this big number $\\sqrt[4]{2^7\\cdot3^3$. Let's simplify it step by step. First, we know that $2^7$ is equal to $128$ and $3^3$ is equal to $27$. \n\nNext, we multiply $128$ and $27$ together to get $3456$. \n\nNow, we need to find the fourth root of $3456$. The fourth root of $3456$ is $6$ because $6^4$ is equal to $3456$. \n\nSo, our result is $6\\sqrt[4]{1}$. \n\nFinally, $a$ is $6$ and $b$ is $1$. When we add $a$ and $b$ together, we get $6+1=7$. \n\nTherefore, $a+b$ is equal to $7$.",
