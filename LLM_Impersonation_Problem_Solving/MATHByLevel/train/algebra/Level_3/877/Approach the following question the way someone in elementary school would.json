    "solution": "We substitute $f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 2$ into $f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x$ to find that $(x^3 - 2x - 2) + g(x) = -2 + x.$ Then, $g(x) = -2 + x - (x^3 - 2x - 2).$ Distributing, we find $g(x) = -2 + x - x^3 + 2x + 2 = \\boxed{-x^3 + 3x}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find what $g(x)$ is, first we need to think about what happens when we add $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. We know that $f(x) + g(x) = -2 + x$. If we know what $f(x)$ is, which is $x^3 - 2x - 2$, then we can substitute it into the equation. \n\nSo we have: $(x^3 - 2x - 2) + g(x) = -2 + x$. \n\nNow we need to solve for $g(x)$. First, we can simplify the left side of the equation by combining like terms: $x^3 - 2x - 2 + g(x) = -2 + x$.\n\nThen we subtract $x$ from both sides to isolate $g(x): x^3 - 2x - 2 + g(x) - x = -2$. \n\nFinally, simplify further: $x^3 - 3x - 2 + g(x) = -2$. Subtract $-2$ from both sides: $x^3 - 3x + g(x) = 0$.\n\nThis means $g(x) = 3x$. So $g(x) = 3x$.",
