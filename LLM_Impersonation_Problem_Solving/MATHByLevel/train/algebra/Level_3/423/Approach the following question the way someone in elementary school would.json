    "solution": "Simplify the two factors first.  Factor $2^4$ from $576$ to get $36$, and since $36=6^2$, the fourth root of $576$ is $(2^\\frac44)(6^\\frac24)=2\\sqrt{6}$.  Because $6^2$ evenly divides $216$, the square root of $216$ is $(6^\\frac22)(6^\\frac12)=6\\sqrt{6}$.  Multiply those two quantities together to obtain $\\boxed{72}$ as an answer.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's simplify $(576)^\\frac{1}{4}$. This means we need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself 4 times, equals 576. \n\nFirst, let's try $2^4 = 16$.\n$3^4 = 81$. \nSo, $6^4 = 1296$, which is greater than 576. \nWe need to try a smaller number. Let's try $4^4 = 256$. Still too small. \nSo $5^4 = 625$. Too big. \n\nOur number must be between 4 and 5. Let's try $4.5$. \n$4.5^4 = 410.06$. Too small. Trying $4.6$, we get $4.6^4 = 555.02$, which is closer to 576 than $4.5$. Let's try making it closer. $4.7^4 = 684.03$. \n\nWe know we are getting close now. We can tell the number should be a bit greater than 4.6 to get close to 576. \n\nSo, $(576)^\\frac{1}{4} = 4.7$\n\nNow, let's simplify $(216)^\\frac{1}{2}$ in a similar way. We need to find the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 216. \nWe already know $6^2 = 36$ and $7^2 = 49$, so we know our number should be 6-point-something. \n\nTrying $6.5^2 = 42.25$ (too small) \nTrying $6.8^2 = 46.24$ (too small) \nTrying $7^2 = 49$ (too big) \n\nWe know our number is going to be less than 7, so let's try 6.9. \n$6.9^2 = 47.61$. Close! Let's try making it closer. $6.95^2 = 48.38$. \n\nWe know our number must be greater than 6.9 but less than 6.95. \n\nSo, $(216)^\\frac{1}{2} = 6.9$\n\nNow, let's multiply our two simplified numbers together: \n$4.7 \\times 6.9 = 32.43$\n\nTherefore, $(576)^\\frac{1}{4}(216)^\\frac{1}{2} = 32.43$. \n\nMath is fun!",
