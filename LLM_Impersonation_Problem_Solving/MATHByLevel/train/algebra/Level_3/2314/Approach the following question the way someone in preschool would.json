    "gpt_response": "Okay! Let's start by thinking about what $\\log_\\frac{1}{3}9$ means. The $\\log_\\frac{1}{3}$ part is like a question: what power do we need to raise $\\frac{1}{3}$ to get 9? \n\nHmm...I know that $\\frac{1}{3}$ as a fraction is like dividing something into 3 equal parts and taking 1 part. So if I have $\\frac{1}{3}$ and I keep multiplying it by itself, I'll get smaller and smaller numbers. But if I keep doing that over and over again, I'll eventually reach 9! \n\nSo the answer to the question $\\log_\\frac{1}{3}9$ is how many times we need to multiply $\\frac{1}{3}$ by itself to get 9. And that answer is 2, because $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$ and then $\\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 9$. Yay, we did it!",
