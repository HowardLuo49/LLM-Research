    "solution": "Let $x = \\log_\\frac{1}{3}9$.  Then, we must have $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x = 9$, so $x=\\boxed{-2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To evaluate $\\log_\\frac{1}{3}9$, we can rewrite it in exponential form as $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x = 9$. \nNow, we can rewrite 9 as a power of $\\frac{1}{3}$: $9 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{-2}$. Therefore, we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{-2}$.\nBy setting the exponents equal to each other, we get $x = -2$. \nTherefore, $\\log_\\frac{1}{3}9 = -2$.",
