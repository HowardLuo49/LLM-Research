    "solution": "Let $x = \\log_\\frac{1}{3}9$.  Then, we must have $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x = 9$, so $x=\\boxed{-2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $\\log_\\frac{1}{3}9$, we need to figure out what exponent we need to raise $\\frac{1}{3}$ to get 9. In other words, we want to know $\\frac{1}{3}^x = 9$. Let's think in simpler terms to help us. If we know that $\\frac{1}{3}^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$, we can see that $\\frac{1}{9}$ is too small. Let's try a bigger exponent. If we try $\\frac{1}{3}^3$, we get $\\frac{1}{27}$, which is still too small. Let's try one more time. If we try $\\frac{1}{3}^4$, we get $\\frac{1}{81}$, which is also too small.\n\nSo, it looks like $\\frac{1}{3}^4 = \\frac{1}{81}$ is getting close to 9, but not quite. Since we're looking for 9, we need to raise $\\frac{1}{3}$ to a bigger exponent. So, the answer is 4. $\\log_\\frac{1}{3}9 = 4$.",
