Monica is trying to solve the following equation by completing the square: $$x^2-8x+8 = 0.$$She successfully rewrites the above equation in the following form: $$(x + b)^2 = c,$$where $b$ and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $b + c$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite the equation as follows, trying to create a square of a binomial on the left side: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 8x + 8 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 - 8x + 16 &= 8\\\\\n(x - 4)^2 &= 8.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b = -4$ and $c = 8$, and $b + c = \\boxed{4}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first solve the equation using the completing the square method.\n\nTo complete the square, we need to find the value to add on both sides of the equation to make it a perfect square trinomial.\n\nThe original equation is:\n$$x^2-8x+8 = 0.$$\n\nTo complete the square, we need to take half of the coefficient of $x$ and square it. Half of $-8$ is $-4$, and $(-4)^2 = 16$. So, we add $16$ to both sides of the equation:\n\n$$x^2-8x+16 = 8+16,$$\n$$(x-4)^2 = 24.$$\n\nNow our equation is in the form $(x+b)^2 = c$, where $b = -4$ and $c = 24$.\n\nTo find the value of $b + c$, we add $-4 + 24 = 20$.\n\nTherefore, $b + c = 20$.",
