    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Monica is trying to solve the following equation by completing the square: $$x^2-8x+8 = 0.$$She successfully rewrites the above equation in the following form: $$(x + b)^2 = c,$$where $b$ and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $b + c$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite the equation as follows, trying to create a square of a binomial on the left side: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 8x + 8 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 - 8x + 16 &= 8\\\\\n(x - 4)^2 &= 8.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b = -4$ and $c = 8$, and $b + c = \\boxed{4}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To complete the square, Monica started with the equation $x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0$. The process of completing the square involves rearranging the equation into a perfect square trinomial form. To do this, we first move the constant term to the other side of the equation:\n\n$x^2 - 8x = -8$\n\nNext, we determine the coefficient of the linear term by taking half of the coefficient of the linear term with respect to $x$, squaring it, and adding it to both sides of the equation:\n\n$x^2 - 8x + (-8/2)^2 = -8 + (-8/2)^2$\n\n$x^2 - 8x + 16 = -8 + 16$\n\n$x^2 - 8x + 16 = 8$\n\nThe equation is now in the form of a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(x-4)^2$. Therefore, $b = -4$ and $c = 8$. The sum of $b$ and $c$ is then $-4 + 8 = 4$. Hence, the value of $b + c$ is 4.",
