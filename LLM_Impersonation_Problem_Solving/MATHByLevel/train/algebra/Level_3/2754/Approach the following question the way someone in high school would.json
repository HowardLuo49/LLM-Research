Monica is trying to solve the following equation by completing the square: $$x^2-8x+8 = 0.$$She successfully rewrites the above equation in the following form: $$(x + b)^2 = c,$$where $b$ and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $b + c$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite the equation as follows, trying to create a square of a binomial on the left side: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 8x + 8 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 - 8x + 16 &= 8\\\\\n(x - 4)^2 &= 8.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b = -4$ and $c = 8$, and $b + c = \\boxed{4}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the equation Monica rewrote after completing the square: $$(x + b)^2 = c.$$\n\nTo get this form, we must add and subtract $\\left(\\frac{-8}{2}\\right)^2 = 16$ inside the parentheses of our expression. \n\nSo, we need to rewrite the equation as: $$(x^2 - 8x + 16) - 16 + 8 = 0.$$ \n\nThis simplifies to: $$(x - 4)^2 - 8 = 0.$$ \n\nTherefore, $b + c = -4 + 8 = 4$.",
