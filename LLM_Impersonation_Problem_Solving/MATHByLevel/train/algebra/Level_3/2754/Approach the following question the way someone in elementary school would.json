Monica is trying to solve the following equation by completing the square: $$x^2-8x+8 = 0.$$She successfully rewrites the above equation in the following form: $$(x + b)^2 = c,$$where $b$ and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $b + c$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite the equation as follows, trying to create a square of a binomial on the left side: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 8x + 8 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 - 8x + 16 &= 8\\\\\n(x - 4)^2 &= 8.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b = -4$ and $c = 8$, and $b + c = \\boxed{4}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First let's look at Monica's equation: $x^2-8x+8 = 0$. To complete the square, we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation. So we have: $x^2 - 8x = -8$. \n\nNext, we need to find $b$ and $c$ in the equation $(x + b)^2 = c$. We know that if we expand $(x + b)^2$, we get $x^2 + 2bx + b^2$. So, $2b$ has to equal $-8$. This means $b = -4$. \n\nThen, if we compare $(x + b)^2 = c$ with our original equation $x^2 - 8x = -8$, we see that $b^2 = c$, so $(-4)^2 = c$, which gives us $c = 16$. \n\nFinally, we have $b + c = -4 + 16 = 12$. So the value of $b + c$ is 12.",
