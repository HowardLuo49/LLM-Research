    "solution": "The square of the binomial $rx+s$ is  \\[(rx+s)^2=r^2x^2+2rsx+s^2.\\]If this is equal to $ax^2+12x+9$, then $s$ must be either 3 or $-3$.  Since $(rx+s)^2=(-rx-s)^2$, we may choose either $s=3$ or $s=-3$, and the solution will be the same.  We choose $s=3$.\n\nThe square of $rx+3$ is  \\[(rx+3)^2=r^2x^2+6rx+9.\\]If this is equal to $ax^2+12x+9$ then we must have $12=6r$ or $r=2$.  This gives our square: \\[\\left(2x+3\\right)^2=4x^2+12x+9.\\]Therefore $a=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $a$ such that $ax^2+12x+9$ is the square of a binomial, we need to think about what happens when we square a binomial like $(mx+n)^2$.\n\nWhen we expand this out, we get $m^2x^2+2mnx+n^2$. So, in order for $ax^2+12x+9$ to be the square of a binomial, we need it to look like this.\n\nWe see that $a$ needs to be $1$ since the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$. Now, to make the middle term $12x$ we can set $2mn=12$ which gives $mn=6$. The only way to make 9 a perfect square is to set $n=3$.\n\nSo, the square of the binomial is $(x+3)^2$. Therefore, $a=1$.",
