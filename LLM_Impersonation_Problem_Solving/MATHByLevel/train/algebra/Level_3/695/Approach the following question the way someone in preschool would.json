    "solution": "Multiplying the numerators simply yields $1$. Multiplying the denominators gives $1+\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2} -2 = 1 - 2 = -1$. So, the answer is $\\frac{1}{-1} = \\boxed{-1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the first fraction. We have $\\frac{1}{1+\\sqrt{2}}$. \n\nHmm... this big square root is kind of scary, right? Let's try to get rid of it! \n\nIf we multiply both the top and bottom by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $1-\\sqrt{2}$, we can get rid of the square root on the bottom! \n\nSo, our first fraction becomes $\\frac{1(1-\\sqrt{2})}{(1+\\sqrt{2})(1-\\sqrt{2})}$. This simplifies to $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}}{1^2-(\\sqrt{2})^2}$. \n\nFinally, simplifying gives us $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}}{1-2}$, or $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}{-1}$. Finally, our first fraction is $-\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, let's look at the second fraction: $\\frac{1}{1-\\sqrt{2}}$. \n\nWe can do the same trick again! Multiply the top and bottom by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $1+\\sqrt{2}$. \n\nThis gives us $\\frac{1(1+\\sqrt{2})}{(1-\\sqrt{2})(1+\\sqrt{2})}$. Simplifying gives us $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{1^2-(\\sqrt{2})^2}$, or $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{1-2}$. \n\nAnd finally, this simplifies to $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{-1}$, or $-\\left(1+\\sqrt{2}\\right)$.\n\nNow, let's multiply our two fractions together: $(-\\sqrt{2})\\cdot(-1-\\sqrt{2})$.
