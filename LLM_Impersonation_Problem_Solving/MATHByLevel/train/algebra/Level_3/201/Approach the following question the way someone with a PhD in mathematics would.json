    "solution": "Add the three equations together and divide by 2 to get $x+y+z = 21$. Hence, $x = 8, y = 7, z = 6$, and $\\sqrt{xyz(x+y+z)} = \\sqrt{21(8)(7)(6)} = \\sqrt{2^4\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = \\boxed{84}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Firstly, we can add up the given equations to obtain $2(x+y+z) = 42$, so $x+y+z = 21$. Now let's consider the expression we're looking for, $\\sqrt{xyz(x+y+z)}$. \n\nFrom the given equations, we can multiply them pairwise and combine them to obtain the expression we're looking for. Specifically, if we multiply the first two equations, we get $(y+z)(z+x) = yz + zx + yz + xz = 27$. Similarly, if we multiply the second and third equations, we get $(z+x)(x+y) = zx + xy + x^2 + yz = 210$. And if we multiply the first and third equations, we get $(y+z)(x+y) = xy + y^2 + xz + yz = 195$. \n\nNow, if we add the three equations we just obtained, we get $2(xy + yz + zx + x^2 + y^2) = 432$, so $xy + yz + zx + x^2 + y^2 = 216$. \n\nNow, substituting back into the expression we're looking for, we have $\\sqrt{xyz(x+y+z)} = \\sqrt{(xy + yz + zx)(x+y+z)} = \\sqrt{216 \\cdot 21} = \\sqrt{4536} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{126}}$.",
