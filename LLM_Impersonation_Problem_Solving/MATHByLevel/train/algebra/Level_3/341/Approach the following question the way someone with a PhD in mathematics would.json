    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Find $x$ such that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x = \\dfrac{13}{3}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\\dfrac{1}{3}$. We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\dfrac{13}{3}$. Solving, we get $n=2$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this equation, we first note that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\leq x < \\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1$. \n\nLet $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = a$, where $a$ is an integer. Then, we have $a + x = \\frac{13}{3}$. Substituting $x = a + \\{x\\}$ (where $\\{x\\}$ is the fractional part of $x$) into the equation gives $a + a + \\{x\\} = \\frac{13}{3}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $2a + \\{x\\} = \\frac{13}{3}$. We know that $0 \\leq \\{x\\} < 1$, so $\\frac{13}{3} \\leq 2a + \\{x\\} < \\frac{16}{3}$. \n\nSince $\\frac{13}{3} \\leq 2a + \\{x\\} < \\frac{16}{3}$, we see that $4 \\leq 2a < 5$.
