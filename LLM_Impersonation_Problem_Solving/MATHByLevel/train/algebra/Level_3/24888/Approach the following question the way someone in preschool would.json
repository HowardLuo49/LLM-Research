    "solution": "We have $$(2x)^4 + (3x)(x^3) = (2^4 \\cdot x^4) + 3(x^{1+3}) = 16x^4 + 3x^4 = \\boxed{19x^4}.$$",

Let's put the two numbers together. It's like, if I have 2 blocks and I put them together, how many blocks do I have in total? That's right, I have 4 blocks. So if I put (2x) together 4 times, how many do I have in total? That's right, I have (2x)^4!\n\nNow let's do the same with the other numbers. If I put 3 and x together, how many do I have in total? That's right, I have 3x. And if I put (x^3) together 1 time, how many do I have? That's right, I have (3x)(x^3)!\n\nSo in total, our equation simplifies to (2x)^4 + (3x)(x^3)!\n\nGreat job, preschool friend!",
