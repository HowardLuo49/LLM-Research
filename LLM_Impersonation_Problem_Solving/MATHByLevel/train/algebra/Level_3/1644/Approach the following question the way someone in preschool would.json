    "solution": "First we solve for $x$. Converting our logarithm to exponential form gives $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=x-4$. We know $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5$, so we have $5=x-4$ or $x=9$. Then we must find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3}$ where $x=9$. Let $\\log_{9}{3}=a$. Then $9^a=3$. Since $9=3^2$ we have $3^{2a}=3^1$ so $2a=1$ or $a=\\frac{1}{2}$. We want to find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{9}3}=\\frac{1}{a}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's see. We need to start by finding the value of x in the equation $\\log_{25}(x-4)=\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nHmm... what's a log again? Oh yeah, it's like the opposite of an exponent! So $\\log_{25}(x-4)=\\frac{1}{2}$ means that $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=x-4$. \n\nWait, what's $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}$? Oh right, it's the square root of 25, which is 5! So we have $5=x-4$, which means x=9.\n\nNow we need to find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3}$. Let's first find $\\log_{x}3$. That just means: what power do I need to raise x to in order to get 3? \n\nHmm... this one's a little tricky. Let's try different numbers for x. If x=9, then $\\log_{9}3$... Oh! I know this one! It's $\\frac{1}{2}$ because $9^{\\frac{1}{2}}=3$. \n\nSo, our answer is $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}}$, which is 2!\n\nYay, we did it!",
