    "gpt_response": "Okay! First, we have to multiply $4$ by $-5$, which is $-20$. Then we multiply $4$ by $5i$, which is $20i$. Next we multiply $-5i$ by $-5$, which is $25i$. Finally, we multiply $-5i$ by $5i$, which is $-25$. Adding these all together, we get $-20 + 20i + 25i - 25$. Combining like terms, we get $-45 + 45i$. So, $(4-5i)(-5+5i)$ in the form $a+bi$ is $-45+45i$.",
