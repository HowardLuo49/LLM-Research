    "solution": "The slope of a line through points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$  is: $$\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\text{slope}$$ In this case, we have: $$\\frac{y-7}{4-(-2)}=\\frac{-3}{2}$$ $$2y-14=-18$$ $$2y=-4$$ $$y=\\boxed{-2}$$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember what slope is. Slope shows us how steep a line is. It's like a hill! To find the slope between two points, we can use a formula: $$\\text{Slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.$$\n\nOur points are $P(-2,7)$ and $Q(4,y)$. We know the slope is $\\frac{-3}{2}$. \n\nLet's plug the values into our formula: $$\\frac{y - 7}{4 - (-2)} = -\\frac{3}{2}.$$\n\nSimplify the equation to get: $$\\frac{y - 7}{6} = -\\frac{3}{2}.$$ \n\nTo solve for $y$, we can cross multiply. This means we multiply the numbers on opposite sides. So we get: $$2(y-7) = -3(6).$$\n\nNow, simplify on both sides of the equation: $$2y - 14 = -18.$$\n\nFinally, isolate $y$ by adding $14$ to both sides: $$2y = -18 + 14.$$ \n\nThis gives us: $$2y = -4.$$ \n\nSo, you find your answer by dividing $-4$ by $2$: $$y = -2.$$ \n\nTherefore, when $y = -2$, the slope of the line through points $P(-2,7)$ and $Q(4,y)$ will be $\\frac{-3}{2}$.",
