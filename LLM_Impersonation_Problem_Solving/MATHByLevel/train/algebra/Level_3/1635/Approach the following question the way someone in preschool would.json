    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. George purchases a sack of apples, a bunch of bananas, a cantaloupe, and a carton of dates for $ \\$ 20$. If a carton of dates costs twice as much as a sack of apples and the price of a cantaloupe is equal to the price of a sack of apples minus a bunch of bananas, how much would it cost George to purchase a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the price of a sack of apples, $b$ the price of a bunch of bananas, $c$ the price of a cantaloupe, and $d$ the price of a carton of dates. We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 20\\\\\n2a &= d\\\\\na-b &= c\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting into the first equation for $c$ and $d$ gives $a + b + a - b + 2a = 20$, which simplifies to $4a = 20$, so $a = 5$. From here, we use $a$ to find $d = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. We put these values into the first equation to get $5 + b + c + 10 = 20$, so $b + c = \\boxed{ \\$ 5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... Let's see. George buys apples, bananas, a cantaloupe, and dates for $20. Dates cost twice as much as apples, and a cantaloupe cost the same as apples minus bananas. To find out how much bananas and a cantaloupe cost together, we have to figure out the price of each item. Then, we add the cost of bananas and the cantaloupe together.\n\nLet's say the price of apples is $x. Then, the price of dates would be $2x because they cost twice as much as apples.\n\nNow, the price of a cantaloupe is equal to the price of apples minus bananas. That means the price of a cantaloupe is x - b, where b is the cost of a bunch of bananas.\n\nSo, George spends x + 2x + (x - b) to buy apples, dates, and a cantaloupe. We know that this total cost is $20.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation x + 2x + (x - b) = 20.\n\nTo find out the cost of bananas and a cantaloupe, we need to solve this equation. But for now, let's just remember that we need to add the cost of bananas and a cantaloupe together to find the total cost.",
