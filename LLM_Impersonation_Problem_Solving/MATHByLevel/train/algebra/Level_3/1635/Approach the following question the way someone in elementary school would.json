George purchases a sack of apples, a bunch of bananas, a cantaloupe, and a carton of dates for $ \\$ 20$. If a carton of dates costs twice as much as a sack of apples and the price of a cantaloupe is equal to the price of a sack of apples minus a bunch of bananas, how much would it cost George to purchase a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the price of a sack of apples, $b$ the price of a bunch of bananas, $c$ the price of a cantaloupe, and $d$ the price of a carton of dates. We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 20\\\\\n2a &= d\\\\\na-b &= c\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting into the first equation for $c$ and $d$ gives $a + b + a - b + 2a = 20$, which simplifies to $4a = 20$, so $a = 5$. From here, we use $a$ to find $d = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. We put these values into the first equation to get $5 + b + c + 10 = 20$, so $b + c = \\boxed{ \\$ 5}$.",

Let's say the cost of a sack of apples is $a, the cost of a bunch of bananas is $b, the cost of a cantaloupe is $c, and the cost of a carton of dates is $d.\n\nWe know that the total cost of all the items is $20, so we can write the equation:\n\\[a + b + c + d = 20\\]\n\nWe also know that the cost of a carton of dates is twice as much as the cost of a sack of apples, so we can write the equation:\n\\[d = 2a\\]\n\nAnd we know that the cost of a cantaloupe is equal to the cost of a sack of apples minus a bunch of bananas, so we can write the equation:\n\\[c = a - b\\]\n\nNow we need to figure out the cost of a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe. To do this, we can substitute the values we know into the equations we wrote:\n\n\\[d = 2a\\]\n\\[c = a - b\\]\n\nSubstitute these equations into the total cost equation:\n\\[a + b + (a - b) + 2a = 20\\]\n\nNow simplify the equation:\n\\[4a = 20\\]\n\\[a = 5\\]\n\nNow that we know the cost of a sack of apples, we can find the cost of a carton of dates:\n\\[d = 2(5)\\]\n\\[d = 10\\]\n\nAnd we can find the cost of a cantaloupe:\n\\[c = 5 - b\\]\n\nNow we can find the cost of a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe together:\n\\[b + c = b + (5 - b) = 5\\]\n\nSo, it would cost George $5 to purchase a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe.",
