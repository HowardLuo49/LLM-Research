    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Lisa has 10 friends and 34 marbles. What is the minimum number of additional marbles she needs so that she can give each friend at least one marble and no two friends receive the same number of marbles?",
    "solution": "Lisa wants to minimize the number of marbles she gives to her friends without giving any two of them the same number of marbles. The minimum number of marbles she can give to a friend is 1. She then gives 2 marbles to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 10. The total number of marbles Lisa has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+10 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2}=55$.\n\nThus, Lisa needs $55-34=\\boxed{21}$ more marbles.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use a mathematical approach based on combinatorics and integer partitions. \n\nLet's denote the number of marbles given to each friend by \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{10}\\). Since each friend must receive at least one marble, we have the following constraint:\n\\[ x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_{10} = 34 + n, \\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the unknown number of additional marbles Lisa needs. \n\nAdditionally, we want to ensure that no two friends receive the same number of marbles. This means that the partitions of 34 + \\(n\\) must be distinct. \n\nTo find the minimum number of additional marbles needed, we need to find the smallest value of \\(n\\) such that the partitions of 34 + \\(n\\) are distinct. This involves considering the possible partitions of 34 + \\(n\\) and finding the smallest value of \\(n\\) that satisfies the conditions.\n\nThis problem can be quite complex and may involve considering all possible partitions and checking for duplicates. One approach to simplify the calculation is to use generating functions or computer programming to efficiently explore the partitions space and identify the solution. \n\nIn summary, a PhD mathematician would approach this problem using combinatorial techniques and possibly advanced mathematical methods to find the minimum number of additional marbles Lisa needs to satisfy the given conditions.",
