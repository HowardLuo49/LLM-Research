    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Lisa has 10 friends and 34 marbles. What is the minimum number of additional marbles she needs so that she can give each friend at least one marble and no two friends receive the same number of marbles?",
    "solution": "Lisa wants to minimize the number of marbles she gives to her friends without giving any two of them the same number of marbles. The minimum number of marbles she can give to a friend is 1. She then gives 2 marbles to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 10. The total number of marbles Lisa has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+10 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2}=55$.\n\nThus, Lisa needs $55-34=\\boxed{21}$ more marbles.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by giving one marble to each of Lisa's 10 friends. That means she has used up 10 marbles, leaving her with 24 marbles left.\n\nNow, we need to make sure no two friends have the same number of marbles. To do this, we can start by giving one additional marble to the friend with the least number of marbles. Then we give 2 marbles to the friend with the next least amount of marbles, and so on until we give 10 marbles to the friend with the most. This means we will need an additional 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55 marbles.\n\nTherefore, Lisa will need a minimum of 55 additional marbles in order to give each friend at least one marble and make sure no two friends receive the same number of marbles.",
