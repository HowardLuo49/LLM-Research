    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Lisa has 10 friends and 34 marbles. What is the minimum number of additional marbles she needs so that she can give each friend at least one marble and no two friends receive the same number of marbles?",
    "solution": "Lisa wants to minimize the number of marbles she gives to her friends without giving any two of them the same number of marbles. The minimum number of marbles she can give to a friend is 1. She then gives 2 marbles to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 10. The total number of marbles Lisa has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+10 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2}=55$.\n\nThus, Lisa needs $55-34=\\boxed{21}$ more marbles.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count how many marbles Lisa needs first. She has 10 friends, so each friend needs at least 1 marble. That means Lisa needs at least 10 marbles for her friends. But, we also don't want any two friends to have the same number of marbles, so Lisa needs to have different amounts of marbles for each friend. Since Lisa already has 34 marbles, she needs to find the next number that can be divided into 10 different amounts. Let's count... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... Lisa needs 36 marbles in total to give each friend at least one marble and make sure no two friends have the same number of marbles. Yay, we did it!",
