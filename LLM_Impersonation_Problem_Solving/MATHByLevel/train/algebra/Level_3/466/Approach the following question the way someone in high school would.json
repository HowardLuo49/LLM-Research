    "solution": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $246-x$. The product which needs to be maximized is $(x)(246-x)=246x-x^2$. Now we complete the square: \\begin{align*}\n-(x^2-246x)&=-(x^2-246x+15129-15129)\\\\\n&=-(x-123)^2+15129\\\\\n\\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, $-(x-123)^2\\le 0$. Therefore, the expression is maximized when $x-123=0$, so $x=123$. Therefore, the greatest product obtainable is $-(123-123)^2+15129=\\boxed{15129}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest product from two integers whose sum is 246, we need to think about which two numbers would give us the largest product when multiplied together.\n\nLet's say the two integers are x and y, and their sum is 246. That means x + y = 246.\n\nTo find the greatest product, we can use a simple formula: the product of two numbers is maximized when they are closest to each other. In other words, if we split 246 in half, we get 123. So, the two numbers should be as close to 123 as possible.\n\nTherefore, the greatest product would be obtained from the integers 123 and 123, because 123 x 123 = 15129.\n\nSo, the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 246 is 15129.",
