    "solution": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $246-x$. The product which needs to be maximized is $(x)(246-x)=246x-x^2$. Now we complete the square: \\begin{align*}\n-(x^2-246x)&=-(x^2-246x+15129-15129)\\\\\n&=-(x-123)^2+15129\\\\\n\\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, $-(x-123)^2\\le 0$. Therefore, the expression is maximized when $x-123=0$, so $x=123$. Therefore, the greatest product obtainable is $-(123-123)^2+15129=\\boxed{15129}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two integers be x and y, where x + y = 246. \nWe want to maximize the product of x and y, so we can set up the problem as a maximization of a function: P = xy. \nFrom the given condition, we have y = 246 - x. \nThus, P = x(246 - x) = 246x - x^2. \nTo find the maximum value of P, we take the derivative of P with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\ndP/dx = 246 - 2x = 0.\nSolving for x, we get x = 123. \nSubstitute x = 123 into the expression for P: P = 123(246 - 123) = 123(123) = 15129. \nTherefore, the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 246 is 15129.",
