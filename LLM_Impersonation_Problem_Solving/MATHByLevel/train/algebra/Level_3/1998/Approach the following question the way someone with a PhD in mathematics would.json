    "solution": "We square both sides to get rid of the square root sign.  This gives us $2-3z = 81$.  Solving for $z$ gives $z = \\boxed{-\\frac{79}{3}}$.  We squared an equation, so we have to test our solution to make sure it isn't extraneous.  We have \\[\\sqrt{2 - 3\\left(-\\frac{79}{3}\\right)} =\\sqrt{2+79} = 9,\\]so our solution is valid.",
