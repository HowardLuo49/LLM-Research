    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "When we want to find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, we need to know that we have to multiply some x terms together. So, let's find the $x^2$ term by multiplying $3x^2$ from the first parenthesis and $bx^2$ from the second parenthesis. When we multiply these together, we get $3bx^4$. However, we want the coefficient, which means we only need the number in front of the $x^4$. Since there is no other term containing $x^4$ in the expression, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $3b$.",
