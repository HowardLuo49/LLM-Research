    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$, we need to consider all possible ways in which the $x^2$ term can be obtained by multiplying the terms in each factor.\n\nFirst, let's expand the product using the distributive property:\n\n$(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4) = abx^5 - 7ax^4 - 4ax^3 + 3bx^4 - 21x^3 - 12x^2 - 2bx^3 + 14x^2 + 8x$\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, we need to identify all terms that contain $x^2$ and add them up. In this case, the $x^2$ term is obtained from multiplying $3x^2$ from the first factor with $-4$ in the second factor and $-12x^2$ from the second factor with $14$ in the first factor:\n\n$3x^2 \\cdot (-4) + (-12x^2) \\cdot 14 = -12x^2 - 168x^2 = -180x^2$\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$ is $-180$.",
