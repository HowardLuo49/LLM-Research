    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, we need to look at which terms will multiply together to give us $x^2$. In the first parenthesis, we have $3x^2$, and in the second parenthesis, we have $bx^2$.\n\nWhen we multiply those two terms together, we get $3x^2 \\cdot bx^2 = 3bx^4$. This means that the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product is $\\boxed{0}$ because there is no term that gives us $x^2$.",
