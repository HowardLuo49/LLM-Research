    "solution": "We know that $4\\oslash x = (\\sqrt{2(4)+x})^3=27$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we have $\\sqrt{8+x}=3$. Squaring both sides, we have $8+x=9$, to give us our answer of $x=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that $4 \\oslash x = 27$. This means we need to find the value of $x$ that makes this equation true.\n\nFirst, we substitute $4$ for $a$ in the formula $a \\oslash b = (\\sqrt{2a+b})^3$. So, we have $(\\sqrt{2(4)+x})^3 = 27$. \n\nNow, we simplify this to $(\\sqrt{8+x})^3 = 27$. \n\nNext, we need to find out what number to the power of $3$ equals $27$. That number is $3$, since $3^3 = 27$. \n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as $\\sqrt{8+x} = 3$. \n\nNow, we just need to find what number squared equals $8$, which is $4$. So, $8 + x = 9$.\n\nTo solve for $x$, we subtract $8$ on both sides to get $x = 1$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that makes the equation $4 \\oslash x = 27$ true is $1$.",
