    "solution": "The common difference $d$ is $85-88 = -3$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in the arithmetic sequence is $88 - 3(n - 1) = 91 - 3n$.  If $91 - 3n = -17$, then $3n = (91 + 17) = 108$, so $n = 108/3 = 36$.  Hence, $-17$ is the $36^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence, which means that $36 - 1 = \\boxed{35}$ terms appear before $-17$ does.",
    "gpt_response": "An arithmetic sequence can be defined as a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the common difference of the arithmetic sequence is -3. \n\nThe $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the position of the term. \n\nGiven that the first term $a_1$ is 88 and the common difference $d$ is -3, let's find the position of the term that is equal to -17. We set $a_n = -17$ and solve for $n$: \n\n$-17 = 88 + (n-1)(-3)$\n$-17 = 88 - 3n + 3$\n$-17 = 91 - 3n$\n\n$3n = 91 + 17$\n$3n = 108$\n$n = 36$\n\nTherefore, the term equal to -17 is the $36$th term of the sequence. \nThus, 35 terms of the arithmetic sequence 88, 85, 82, $\\dots$ appear before the number $-17$ appears.",
