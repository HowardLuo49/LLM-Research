    "solution": "The common difference $d$ is $85-88 = -3$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in the arithmetic sequence is $88 - 3(n - 1) = 91 - 3n$.  If $91 - 3n = -17$, then $3n = (91 + 17) = 108$, so $n = 108/3 = 36$.  Hence, $-17$ is the $36^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence, which means that $36 - 1 = \\boxed{35}$ terms appear before $-17$ does.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many terms of the arithmetic sequence 88, 85, 82, $\\dots$ appear before the number $-17$ appears, we need to find the value of $n$ in the sequence. \n\nTo do this, we can set up an equation. Let's call the sequence $a_n$ and notice that the common difference is $-3$. We can find the $n$th term of the sequence using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference. \n\nIn this case, $a_n = 88 + (n-1)(-3)$. We can now substitute $a_n = -17$ into the equation and solve for $n$. \n\n$-17 = 88 + (n-1)(-3)$\n$-17 = 88 - 3n + 3$\n$-17 = 91 - 3n$\n$-108 = -3n$\n$36 = n$\n\nSo, $36$ terms appear before the number $-17$ in the sequence.",
