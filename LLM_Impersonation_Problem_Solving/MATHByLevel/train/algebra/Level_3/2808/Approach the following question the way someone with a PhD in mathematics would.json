    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If $f(x) = -7x^4 + 3x^3 + x - 5$, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial such that the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 1, then what is the degree of $g(x)$?",
    "solution": "The degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 1, and the only way that $g(x)$ can cancel the term of $-7x^4$ in $f(x)$ is if $g(x)$ contains the term $7x^4$.  Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $f(x) = -7x^4 + 3x^3 + x - 5$ is a polynomial of degree 4, and $f(x) + g(x)$ has degree 1, we can deduce that $g(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree 1 in order for the sum to have degree 1. \n\nThis is because when we add two polynomials of different degrees, the resulting polynomial will have degree equal to the highest degree between the two polynomials. In this case, since $f(x)$ has degree 4 and we want the sum to have degree 1, $g(x)$ must have degree 1.",
