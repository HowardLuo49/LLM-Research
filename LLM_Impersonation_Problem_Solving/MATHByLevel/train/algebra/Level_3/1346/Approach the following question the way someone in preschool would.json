First, we see that the constant terms are already the same, so we don't need to do anything there. \n\nNow, let's look at the $x$ terms. On the left side we have $2x$ and on the right side we have $-6x$. To make these match, we need to add $-8x$ on the left side. \n\nFinally, let's look at the $x^2$ terms. On the left side we have no $x^2$ term and on the right side we have $5x^2$. To make these match, we need to add $5x^2$ on the left side.\n\nPutting it all together, we have determined that $h(x) = 5x^2-8x$.",
