    "solution": "We can solve for $x$ and $y$, then plug them in to get our answer. However, there is a nicer method. Note that \\begin{align*}\n5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2 &= (4x^2 + 4xy + y^2) + (x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2) \\\\\n&= (2x + y)^2 + (x + 2y)^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 = \\boxed{41}.\n\\end{align*}.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! First, let's solve for x and y in these two equations.
