    "solution": "Squaring both sides of the first equation, we get that $x^2-2xy+y^2=225$. So, we know that $x^2+y^2=225+2xy$. Since $xy=4$, we find $x^2+y^2=225+2(4)=\\boxed{233}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x^2+y^2$, first let's square the equation $x-y=15$ to get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 225$. \n\nSince we know that $xy=4$, we can substitute $4$ for $xy$ in the equation to get $x^2 + y^2 = 225 + 2(4) = 225 + 8 = 233$. \n\nSo, the value of $x^2+y^2$ is $233$.",
