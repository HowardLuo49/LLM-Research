    "solution": "Squaring both sides of the first equation, we get that $x^2-2xy+y^2=225$. So, we know that $x^2+y^2=225+2xy$. Since $xy=4$, we find $x^2+y^2=225+2(4)=\\boxed{233}$.",

Yes! 7 + 1 = 8 and 7 * 1 = 7, not 4. Let's keep trying. How about 4 and 1? Yes! 4 + 1 = 5 and 4 * 1 = 4! So $x = 4$ and $y = 1$. \n\nNow we can find $x^2+y^2$.
