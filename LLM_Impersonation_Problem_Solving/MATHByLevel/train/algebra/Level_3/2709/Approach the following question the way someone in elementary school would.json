    "solution": "We have $ 27\\sqrt3 = (3^3)(3^\\frac12)=3^{(3+\\frac12)}=3^{\\frac72}$. Therefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3=\\boxed{\\frac72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3$, first we need to think about what $\\log_3$ means. It means \"what power of 3 gives us the number inside the logarithm.\" \n\nSo we need to find out what power of 3 gives us $27\\sqrt3$. We can rewrite $27\\sqrt3$ as $27 \\cdot (\\sqrt3)^1$. Since $\\sqrt3$ is the same as $3^{1/2}$, we can rewrite this as $27 \\cdot 3^{1/2}$.\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression to $27\\cdot3^{1/2} = 27\\cdot\\sqrt{3} = 81^{1/2}\\cdot3^{1/2} = (3\\cdot3)^{1/2}\\cdot3^{1/2} = 3^2\\cdot3^{1/2} = 3^{2+1/2} = 3^{5/2}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3 = \\log_3 3^{5/2} = \\frac{5}{2}$.
