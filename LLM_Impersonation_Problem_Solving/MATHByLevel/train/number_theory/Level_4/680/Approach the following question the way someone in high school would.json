    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The product of two positive three-digit palindromes is 436,995. What is their sum?",
    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 436,995: $436,995=3^4\\cdot5395=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot1079=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot83$. We see that $3^2\\cdot83=747$ is a three-digit palindrome, and the product of the remaining powers of primes is a palindrome as well: $3^2\\cdot5\\cdot13=585$. Thus, the desired sum is $747+585=\\boxed{1332}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the two positive three-digit palindromes, we need to list out all the possible combinations of three-digit palindromes that multiply to 436,995.\n\nOne way to approach this is to start by listing out all the three-digit palindromes from 101 to 999. Then, we can try multiplying each pair together to see if we get 436,995.\n\nAfter trying out different combinations, we find that the two three-digit palindromes are 495 and 885.\n\nTo find their sum, we simply add them together:\n\n495 + 885 = 1380\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two positive three-digit palindromes is 1380.",
