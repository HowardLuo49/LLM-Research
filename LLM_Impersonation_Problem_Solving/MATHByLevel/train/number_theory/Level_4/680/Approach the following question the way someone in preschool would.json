    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 436,995: $436,995=3^4\\cdot5395=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot1079=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot83$. We see that $3^2\\cdot83=747$ is a three-digit palindrome, and the product of the remaining powers of primes is a palindrome as well: $3^2\\cdot5\\cdot13=585$. Thus, the desired sum is $747+585=\\boxed{1332}$.",

Maybe we can break it down into smaller numbers to help us. Ah! I think the two palindromes are 495 and 885! Now let's add them together to find the sum. 495 + 885 = 1,380. Yay, we did it!",
