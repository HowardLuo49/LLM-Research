First, we need to find out what $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$ is. \n\nWell, we know that $2^{10} = 1024$ and $5^4 = 625$, so we can multiply those to get $1024 \\times 625 = 640000$. Then, we have to multiply that by 3 to get $1920000$. \n\nNow, let's add up the digits of 1920000: 1+9+2+0+0+0+0 = 12. So, the sum of the digits of our number is 12! Yay!",
