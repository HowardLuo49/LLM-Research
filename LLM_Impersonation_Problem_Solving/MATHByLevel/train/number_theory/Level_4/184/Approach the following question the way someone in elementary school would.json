    "solution": "We have $$2^{2005}\\times5^{2007}\\times3=(2\\times5)^{2005}\\times5^2\\times3=75\\times10^{2005},$$ so the sum of the digits is $7+5=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the digits of the number $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$, we can first multiply $2^{2005}$ and $5^{2007}$. \n\n$2^{2005}$ is a very big number, but we can see that it ends in 25 since $2^5=32$. We know that $5^{2007}$ will end in a lot of zeros because it has 2007 fives multiplied together. So when we multiply the two numbers together, the last two digits will be 25.\n\nNow we just need to multiply 25 by 3, which gives us 75. The sum of the digits in 75 is 7 + 5 = 12. \n\nSo, the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$ is 12.",
