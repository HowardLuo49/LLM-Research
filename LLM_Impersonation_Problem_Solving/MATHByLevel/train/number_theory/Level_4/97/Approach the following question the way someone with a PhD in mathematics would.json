    "solution": "Since $256=2^8$ the divisors of $256$ are the powers of 2 up to $2^8$. So the sum of the proper factors of 256 is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7=\\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the proper divisors of 256, we first need to determine the divisors of 256. A proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is less than the number itself.\n\nThe divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. \n\nThe sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 256 is 255.",
