    "solution": "For $n\\ge5$, $n!$ includes the product $2\\times5=10$, which means the units digit of $n!$ is 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0). The units digits of $1!+ 2!+3!+4!$ is the units digit of $1+2+6+4=13$, which is 3. The units digit of the sum $1+2+\\ldots+9=\\frac{9(1+9)}{2}=45$ is 5. Therefore, the units digit of $(1!+1)+(2!+2)+\\ldots+(9!+9)= (1!+2!+\\ldots+9!)+(1+2+\\ldots+9)$ is $3+5=\\boxed{8}.$",
