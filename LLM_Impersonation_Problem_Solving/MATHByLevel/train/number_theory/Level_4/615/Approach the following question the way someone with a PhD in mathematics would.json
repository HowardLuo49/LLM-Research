    "solution": "Start by adding the two numbers in base 10, we have $25_{10}+36_{10}=61_{10}$. Next, it is necessary to convert $61_{10}$ to base 3. The largest power of $3$ less than or equal to $61$ is $3^3=27$. The greatest multiple of this power that is less than $61$ is $2\\cdot 3^3=54$, so the digit in the $3^3$ place is $2$. Now, we subtract $54$ from $61$ and get $7$. Since $3^2>7$, the digit in the $3^2$ place is $0$. We know that $3^1$ goes into $7$ twice without going over, so the digit in the $3^1$ place is $2$. Finally, $7-6=1$, so the digit in the $3^0$ place is $1$. Therefore, the value of $25_{10}+36_{10}$ in base 3 is $\\boxed{2021_3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $25_{10}+36_{10}$ in base 3, we first need to convert the numbers into base 3. \n\nStarting with $25_{10}$, we can represent this in base 3 by finding the largest power of 3 that is less than or equal to 25. This is $3^3=27$, so we have $25_{10}=20\\cdot3^3+2\\cdot3^0=202_{3}$. \n\nNext, for $36_{10}$, the largest power of 3 that is less than or equal to 36 is $3^3=27$. So, we have $36_{10}=12\\cdot3^3+0\\cdot3^2+0\\cdot3^1=1200_{3}$. \n\nNow, adding these two numbers in base 3 gives us:\n$202_{3}+1200_{3}=1402_{3}$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $25_{10}+36_{10}$ in base 3 is $1402_{3}$.",
