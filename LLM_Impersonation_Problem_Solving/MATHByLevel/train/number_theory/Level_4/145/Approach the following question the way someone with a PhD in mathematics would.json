    "solution": "We use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two numbers be denoted as a and b. We are given that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3780 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 18. We are also given that one of the numbers is 180.\n\nSince the LCM of two numbers is the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD, we have the equation:\n\n\\(LCM(a, b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{GCD(a, b)} = 3780\\)\n\nGiven that one of the numbers is 180, we can substitute a = 180 into the equation:\n\n\\(\\frac{180 \\cdot b}{18} = 3780\\)\n\nSolving for b:\n\n\\(180 \\cdot b = 18 \\cdot 3780\\)\n\n\\(b = \\frac{18 \\cdot 3780}{180} = 378\\)\n\nTherefore, the other number is 378.",
