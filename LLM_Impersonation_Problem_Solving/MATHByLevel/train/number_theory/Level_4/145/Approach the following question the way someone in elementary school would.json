    "solution": "We use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the other number, we need to divide the least common multiple by one of the numbers, which is 180. \n\nSo, 3780 \u00f7 180 = 21\n\nThis means that the other number is 21.",
