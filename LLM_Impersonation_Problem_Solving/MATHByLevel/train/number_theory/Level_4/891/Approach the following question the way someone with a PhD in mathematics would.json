    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Karlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.  There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.  For how many values of $m$ can this be done?",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the factors of 600 that are greater than 1. This is because each box contains more than one marble, so we are not considering 600 as a single box.\n\nThe prime factorization of 600 is $2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5^2$. To find the total number of factors of 600, we add 1 to each exponent and multiply them together: $(3+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 4 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 24$.\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the factors 1 and 600 since each box must contain more than one marble. Therefore, the number of values of m for which Karlanna can distribute the marbles equally into m total boxes is 24 - 2 = 22. \n\nSo, there are 22 values of m for which this can be done.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 22?: To solve this problem, we need to find the factors of 600 that are greater than 1.
