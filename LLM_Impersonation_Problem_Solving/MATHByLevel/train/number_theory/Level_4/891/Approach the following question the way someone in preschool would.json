    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Karlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.  There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.  For how many values of $m$ can this be done?",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many marbles go in each box. Since there are 600 marbles in total, and each box has the same amount, we can divide 600 by the number of boxes. For example, if there are 4 boxes, each box would have 600 divided by 4, which is 150 marbles. \n\nSo we need to find out how many numbers can divide 600 evenly to give us the number of marbles in each box. These numbers will be the possible values of $m$. Let's see if we can find them together! Let's start counting and dividing! 3, 4, 5, ... oh this is going to be fun! Let's keep going until we find all the values of m! Yay for math!",
