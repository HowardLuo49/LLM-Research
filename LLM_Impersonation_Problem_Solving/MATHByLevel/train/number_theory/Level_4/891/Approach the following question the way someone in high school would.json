    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Karlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.  There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.  For how many values of $m$ can this be done?",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "First of all, let's just think about how many marbles each box could possibly have. Since each box has to have more than one marble, the minimum number of marbles per box is 2. And since each box has to have an equal number of marbles, the number of marbles must be a factor of 600.\n\nNow, let's list out the factors of 600: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, 120, 150, 200, 300, 600.\n\nOut of these factors, we can see that only the following values of $m$ will allow Karlanna to distribute the 600 marbles into equal boxes:\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, 120, 150, 200, 300.\n\nSo, there are 22 values of $m$ for which Karlanna can distribute the 600 marbles into equal boxes.",
