Karlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.  There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.  For how many values of $m$ can this be done?",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many values of $m$ can this be done, we need to figure out all the factors of 600. First, we write down all the factor pairs of 600: \n1 x 600 \n2 x 300 \n3 x 200 \n4 x 150 \n5 x 120 \n6 x 100 \n8 x 75 \n10 x 60 \n12 x 50 \n15 x 40 \n20 x 30 \n\nNow we count how many factor pairs there are. There are 11 factor pairs, so there are 11 values of $m$ where Karlanna can place 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes with each box containing an equal number of marbles.",
