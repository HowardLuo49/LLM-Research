    "solution": "Rewriting and reducing the fraction, we get $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $2^6$, we obtain\n\\[\\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}\\cdot\\frac{2^6}{2^6} = \\frac{3\\cdot2^6}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{192}{10^7} = .0000192.\\]Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the fraction $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8}$. \n\n$2^3$ is equal to $2\\cdot2\\cdot2$, which is 8. \n\n$5^8$ is equal to $5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5$, which is a very big number. Let's just leave it as $5^8$ for now.\n\nSo now we have $\\frac{60}{8\\cdot5^8}$. \n\nIf we simplify 60 divided by 8, we get 7.5. \n\nSo our fraction is now $\\frac{7.5}{5^8}$. \n\nIf we divide 7.5 by $5^8$, we will get a very small decimal number. \n\nThe question is asking us how many non-zero digits are to the right of the decimal point in this decimal number. \n\nSince $5^8$ is such a big number, when we divide 7.5 by $5^8$, we will get a very small decimal number close to 0. \n\nTherefore, there will be no non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal number.",
