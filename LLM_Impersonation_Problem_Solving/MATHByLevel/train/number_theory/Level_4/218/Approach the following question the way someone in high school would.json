    "solution": "Rewriting and reducing the fraction, we get $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $2^6$, we obtain\n\\[\\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}\\cdot\\frac{2^6}{2^6} = \\frac{3\\cdot2^6}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{192}{10^7} = .0000192.\\]Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8}$, we need to simplify the fraction first. \n\nFirst, we notice that $2^3=8$ and $5^8$ is a very large number that can't be simplified further, so our fraction can be rewritten as $\\frac{60}{8\\cdot5^8}$.\n\nWe can simplify this further by dividing 60 by 8 to get 7.5. \n\nSo, our fraction simplifies to $\\frac{7.5}{5^8}$. \n\nNow we need to convert $5^8$ to a decimal. \n\n$5^8=390625$.\n\nTherefore, our fraction becomes $\\frac{7.5}{390625}$. \n\nTo divide 7.5 by 390625, we can move the decimal point of 7.5 five places to the left because $390625$ has 5 digits.\n\nAfter division, we get 0.0000192.\n\nSo there are 4 non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point: 1, 9, 2, and a 0.",
