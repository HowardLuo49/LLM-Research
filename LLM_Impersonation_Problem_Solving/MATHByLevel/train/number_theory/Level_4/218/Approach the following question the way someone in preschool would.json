    "solution": "Rewriting and reducing the fraction, we get $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $2^6$, we obtain\n\\[\\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}\\cdot\\frac{2^6}{2^6} = \\frac{3\\cdot2^6}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{192}{10^7} = .0000192.\\]Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find out how many non-zero digits are to the right of the decimal point in the number $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8}$, we first need to simplify the fraction.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the denominator by noticing that $2^3\\cdot5^8 = 2^3\\cdot(5^2)^4 = 2^3\\cdot25^4 = 2^3\\cdot625 = 2000$.\n\nSo the fraction simplifies to $\\frac{60}{2000}$. To express this fraction as a decimal, we need to divide 60 by 2000. \n\nIn preschool, we might not know how to do this division, so let's use a basic calculator to get the result:\n\n$60 \\div 2000 = 0.03$\n\nSo the decimal representation of $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8}$ is 0.03.\n\nIn the number 0.03, there are 2 non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point.",
