    "solution": "Note that $0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$, so $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186+x}$. As $x$ is positive, we want to find the smallest number greater than $186$ which is a multiple of $5$. This number is 190, which implies $\\boxed{x=4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have the equation 0.8 = y / (186 + x) and we want to find the smallest value of x. \n\nLet's try different values for x and see if we can find a solution. \n\nIf we let x = 1, then 186 + 1 = 187. \n\nNow we can plug in the values into the equation: \n\n0.8 = y / 187 \n\nTo make it easier, we can multiply both sides by 187: \n\n0.8 * 187 = y \n\n149.6 = y \n\nSince y is a positive integer, it must be rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 150. \n\nTherefore, the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation is 1.",
