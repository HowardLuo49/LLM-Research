    "solution": "Note that $0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$, so $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186+x}$. As $x$ is positive, we want to find the smallest number greater than $186$ which is a multiple of $5$. This number is 190, which implies $\\boxed{x=4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest value of $x$, we need to first isolate $x$ in the given equation:\n\n$0.8= \\frac{y}{186+x}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $186+x$ gives:\n\n$0.8(186+x) = y$\n\n$148.8 + 0.8x = y$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $y$ must be greater than or equal to 149 (as 148.8 is not an integer). We need to find the smallest $x$ such that $y$ is a positive integer.\n\nLet $y = 149$. Substituting into the equation gives:\n\n$148.8 + 0.8x = 149$\n\n$0.8x = 0.2$\n\n$x = \\frac{0.2}{0.8}$\n\n$x = 0.25$\n\nSince $x$ must be a positive integer, the smallest value of $x$ is $1$ when $y = 149$.
