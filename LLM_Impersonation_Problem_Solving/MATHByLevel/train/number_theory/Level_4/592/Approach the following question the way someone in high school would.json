    "solution": "Note that $0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$, so $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186+x}$. As $x$ is positive, we want to find the smallest number greater than $186$ which is a multiple of $5$. This number is 190, which implies $\\boxed{x=4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest value of $x$, we need to first solve for $y$ in the given equation. Multiply both sides by $186+x$, we get $0.8(186+x) = y$. Further simplifying, $y = 148.8 + 0.8x$.\n\nSince $y$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $x$ would be when $y = 149$ and $x = 1$. Therefore, the smallest value of $x$ is $1$.",
