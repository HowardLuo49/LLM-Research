    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest integer \\(b > 3\\) for which the base \\(b\\) number \\(23_b\\) is a perfect square, we need to first convert the base \\(b\\) number \\(23_b\\) into its decimal form and then check if it is a perfect square.\n\nThe base \\(b\\) number \\(23_b\\) can be written as \\(2b + 3\\) in decimal form. In order for this to be a perfect square, there must exist an integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^2 = 2b + 3\\).\n\nExpanding \\(n^2 = 2b + 3\\), we get \\(n^2 - 3 = 2b\\). Since \\(n^2 - 3\\) must be divisible by 2, this implies that \\(n^2 - 3\\) is odd.
