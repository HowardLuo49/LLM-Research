    "solution": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest integer $b$ for which $23_b$ is a perfect square, we need to think about what makes a number a perfect square.\n\nA perfect square is a number that can be written as the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of an integer with itself.\n\nSo, let's write out $23_b$ in terms of its digits. In base $b$, the number $23_b$ can be expanded as $2b + 3$. We want this number to be a perfect square, so we need to find an integer $b$ that makes $2b+3$ a perfect square.\n\nLet's try some values of $b$ and see if $2b+3$ is a perfect square:\n- When $b=4$, $2(4)+3 = 11$. 11 is not a perfect square.\n- When $b=5$, $2(5)+3 = 13$. 13 is not a perfect square.\n- When $b=6$, $2(6)+3 = 15$. 15 is not a perfect square.\n- When $b=7$, $2(7)+3 = 17$. 17 is not a perfect square.\n- When $b=8$, $2(8)+3 = 19$. 19 is not a perfect square.\n- When $b=9$, $2(9)+3 = 21$. 21 is not a perfect square.\n- When $b=10$, $2(10)+3 = 23$. 23 is not a perfect square.\n\nIt looks like none of the values we tried so far make $2b+3$ a perfect square. Let's continue:\n- When $b=11$, $2(11)+3 = 25$. 25 is a perfect square! So, the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which $23_b$ is a perfect square is $b=11$.",
