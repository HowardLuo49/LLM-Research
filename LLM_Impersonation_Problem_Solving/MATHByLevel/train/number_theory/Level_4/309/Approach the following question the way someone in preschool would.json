    "solution": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square, we have to count and see which number comes after 3 that makes the base number a perfect square.\n\nSo let's start counting! 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Oops! We made a mistake. We need to remember that in base $b$, we start counting from 0, not 1. \n\nLet's try again! 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14... Hey look, $23_{5}$ is equal to 13 in base 10, which is a perfect square because $13 = 3^2$.\n\nSo, the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which $23_b$ is a perfect square is 5. Yay, we did it!",
