    "solution": "The prime factorization of 240 is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5$. We want $c$ to be as small as possible, so $c=2$. Now we have $a\\cdot b=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=120$. For the maximum $b$, we seek the minimum $a$ while $b<a$. If $b<a$ then $a\\cdot b<a^2$, so $120<a^2$. That means $a$ is at least 11. However, 11 is not a factor of 240. The least factor of 240 greater than 11 is $2^2\\cdot3=12$. So the minimum $a$ is 12 and that makes the maximum $b=\\frac{2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^2\\cdot3}=2\\cdot5=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that the volume of the box is 240 cubic units, and the formula for the volume of a box is length times width times height. In this case, the length is $a$, the width is $b$, and the height is $c$.\n\nSo we have the equation $abc = 240$.\n\nSince $1<c<b<a$, we want to find the largest possible value of $b$. One way to approach this is to think about the factors of 240. The largest factor of 240 will be $a$, because it's the largest of the three numbers.\n\nSo let's start by listing the factors of 240: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240.\n\nThe largest factor that can be $a$ is 240. So $a = 240$. Now we need to find the largest possible value of $b$.\n\nWe substitute $a = 240$ into our equation:\n\n$240bc = 240$\n\nSimplify to $bc = 1$.\n\nSince $1<c<b$, the largest possible value of $b$ is 2. \n\nSo the largest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
