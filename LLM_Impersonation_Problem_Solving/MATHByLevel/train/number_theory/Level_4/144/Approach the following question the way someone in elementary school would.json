    "solution": "The prime factorization of 240 is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5$. We want $c$ to be as small as possible, so $c=2$. Now we have $a\\cdot b=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=120$. For the maximum $b$, we seek the minimum $a$ while $b<a$. If $b<a$ then $a\\cdot b<a^2$, so $120<a^2$. That means $a$ is at least 11. However, 11 is not a factor of 240. The least factor of 240 greater than 11 is $2^2\\cdot3=12$. So the minimum $a$ is 12 and that makes the maximum $b=\\frac{2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^2\\cdot3}=2\\cdot5=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of $b$, we need to look at the dimensions of the box and try to figure out which numbers might work. Since the volume is 240 cubic units, that means $a \\times b \\times c = 240$. We also know that $c$ is the smallest of the three numbers, $b$ is in the middle, and $a$ is the biggest. That means we need to find three numbers that multiply to 240 and are in increasing order.\n\nLet's start by listing some factors of 240:\n\n$1 \\times 240$\n\n$2 \\times 120$\n\n$3 \\times 80$\n\n$4 \\times 60$\n\n$5 \\times 48$\n\n$6 \\times 40$\n\n$8 \\times 30$\n\n$10 \\times 24$\n\n$12 \\times 20$\n\nFrom these options, we need to find a set of three numbers where $1<c<b<a$.
