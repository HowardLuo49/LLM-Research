    "solution": "We know that the modular inverse exists because $11$ and $1000$ are relatively prime. Notice that $1000 = 10^3$ and that $11 = 10 + 1$. Since $11 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$, it follows that $(10+1) \\cdot 11^{-1} = 10^3k + 1$ for some integer $k$. We recognize the potential sum of cubes factorization: if $k=1$, then $$10^3 + 1 = 1001 = 11 \\cdot (10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 \\cdot 91.$$Thus, $11^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{91} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$, we need to find a number $x$ such that $11x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nOne way to approach this is to try different values for $x$ until we find one that satisfies the equation. Since $11 \\cdot 91 = 1001$, we can start by trying $x = 91$.\n\n$11 \\cdot 91 = 1001 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$\n\nSo, the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$ is $91$.",
