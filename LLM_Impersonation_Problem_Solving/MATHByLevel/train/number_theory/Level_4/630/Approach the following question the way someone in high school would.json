    "solution": "Since $9 = 3^2$, we can convert directly to base 3 by expanding each base 9 digit into two base 3 digits:   \\begin{align*} 8_9 &= 22_3 \\\\ 1_9 &= 01_3 \\\\ 3_9 &= 10_3 \\end{align*}  Putting the base 3 digit pairs together, we get $813_9 = \\boxed{220110_3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so to convert $813_9$ to base 3, we first need to remember that in base 9, the place values go from ones, nines, eighty-ones, and so on. \n\nSo, let's break down the number $813_9$ into its place values:\n$8$ in the hundreds place\n$1$ in the nines place\n$3$ in the ones place\n\nNow, we need to convert each of these values from base 9 to base 3:\n$8_9 = 22_3$\n$1_9 = 1_3$\n$3_9 = 10_3$\n\nSo, putting it all together, $813_9 = 2210_3$.",
