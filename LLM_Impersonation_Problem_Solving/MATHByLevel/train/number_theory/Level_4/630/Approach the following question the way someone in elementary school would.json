    "solution": "Since $9 = 3^2$, we can convert directly to base 3 by expanding each base 9 digit into two base 3 digits:   \\begin{align*} 8_9 &= 22_3 \\\\ 1_9 &= 01_3 \\\\ 3_9 &= 10_3 \\end{align*}  Putting the base 3 digit pairs together, we get $813_9 = \\boxed{220110_3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $813_9$ to base 3, we need to find out how many groups of 3, 3 squared, and 3 cubed go into 813. \n\nFirst we see how many groups of 3 cubed (729) go into 813. We can fit 1 group of 3 cubed, leaving 84 remaining. \n\nNext, we see how many groups of 3 squared (9) go into 84. We can fit 9 groups of 3 squared, leaving 3 remaining. \n\nLastly, we see how many groups of 3 go into 3. We can fit 1 group of 3, leaving 0 remaining. \n\nSo when we put it all together, $813_9$ is equal to $10201_3$.",
