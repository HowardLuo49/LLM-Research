    "solution": "Since $9 = 3^2$, we can convert directly to base 3 by expanding each base 9 digit into two base 3 digits:   \\begin{align*} 8_9 &= 22_3 \\\\ 1_9 &= 01_3 \\\\ 3_9 &= 10_3 \\end{align*}  Putting the base 3 digit pairs together, we get $813_9 = \\boxed{220110_3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $813_9$ to base 3, we first need to expand the number in base 9 to base 10. This can be done by multiplying each digit by the corresponding power of 9 and summing the results. \n\n$813_9 = 8*9^2 + 1*9^1 + 3*9^0 = 648 + 9 + 3 = 660$\n\nNext, we convert the base 10 number 660 to base 3. This can be done by finding the largest power of 3 that is less than or equal to 660, subtracting it from 660, and continuing this process with the new difference until we reach 0.\n\n$660 = 3^6 + 3^5 + 2*3^2$\n\nTherefore, $660$ in base 10 is equal to $100220_3$. Thus, $813_9$ is equal to $100220_3$ in base 3.",
