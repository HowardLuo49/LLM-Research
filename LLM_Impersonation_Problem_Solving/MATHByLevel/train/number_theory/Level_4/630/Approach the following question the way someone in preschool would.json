    "solution": "Since $9 = 3^2$, we can convert directly to base 3 by expanding each base 9 digit into two base 3 digits:   \\begin{align*} 8_9 &= 22_3 \\\\ 1_9 &= 01_3 \\\\ 3_9 &= 10_3 \\end{align*}  Putting the base 3 digit pairs together, we get $813_9 = \\boxed{220110_3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the number of groups of 3 in 813. We can see that 813 divided by 3 is 271 with a remainder of 0. So, we have 0 as our first digit in base 3.\n\nNow, we take the quotient 271 and divide it by 3. We get 90 with a remainder of 1. So, our next digit in base 3 is 1.\n\nContinuing this process, we find that the base 3 representation of 813 is 1010200. Yay! We did it!",
