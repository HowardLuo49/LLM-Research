    "solution": "Since $-2187 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find what $-2187$ is equivalent to when divided by $10$. We know that when a negative number is divided by $10$, the remainder will still be negative. So we have $-2187 \\div 10 = -218$ with a remainder of $-7$. \n\nBut for this problem, we want the remainder to be between $0$ and $9$. We can add $10$ to $-7$ to get a positive integer remainder, so $-7 + 10 = 3$. Therefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies $n \\equiv -2187 \\pmod{10}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
