    "solution": "Write $3^{2004}$ as $(3^{4})^{501}$.  Since the units digit of $3^4=81$ is 1, the units digit of any power of $3^4$ is $\\boxed{1}$ as well.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit of $3^{2004}$, we can first examine the pattern of units digits when raising 3 to different powers. \n\nStarting with $3^1 = 3$, $3^2 = 9$, $3^3 = 27$, $3^4 = 81$, $3^5 = 243$, $3^6 = 729$, and so on. We observe that the units digit for powers of 3 cycles in a pattern of 3, 9, 7, 1.\n\nSince $2004$ is divisible by $4$ (as $2004 = 4 \\times 501$), we know that the units digit of $3^{2004}$ will be the same as the units digit of $3^{4}$. From the pattern observed earlier, we see that $3^4$ has a units digit of 1.\n\nHence, the units digit of $3^{2004}$ is 1.",
