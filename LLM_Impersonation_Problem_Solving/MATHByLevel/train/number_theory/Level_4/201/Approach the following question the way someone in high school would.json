    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the units digit of $3^{2004}$?",
    "solution": "Write $3^{2004}$ as $(3^{4})^{501}$.  Since the units digit of $3^4=81$ is 1, the units digit of any power of $3^4$ is $\\boxed{1}$ as well.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $3^{2004}$, we can look for a pattern. \n\nWhen we multiply the units digits of consecutive powers of 3, we see that the units digits cycle in a pattern. \n\n$3^1$ has a units digit of 3.\n$3^2$ has a units digit of 9.\n$3^3$ has a units digit of 7.\n$3^4$ has a units digit of 1.\n\nAnd the pattern repeats every 4 powers.\n\nSince 2004 is divisible by 4, we know that the units digit of $3^{2004}$ will be the same as the units digit of $3^4$, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $3^{2004}$ is 1.",
