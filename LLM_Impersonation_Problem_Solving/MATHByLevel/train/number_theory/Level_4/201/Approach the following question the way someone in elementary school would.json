    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the units digit of $3^{2004}$?",
    "solution": "Write $3^{2004}$ as $(3^{4})^{501}$.  Since the units digit of $3^4=81$ is 1, the units digit of any power of $3^4$ is $\\boxed{1}$ as well.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $3^{2004$, we can first look for a pattern. \n\nWhen we raise 3 to different powers, we notice that the units digit of the result repeats in a pattern: 3, 9, 7, 1, and then repeats again. \n\nSince 2004 is divisible by 4, we know that the units digit of $3^{2004}$ will be the same as the units digit of $3^{4}$, which is 1. \n\nSo, the units digit of $3^{2004}$ is 1.",
