    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$, we need to add up the numbers in each column, just like when we add numbers in normal addition.\n\nLet's add up the numbers in the rightmost column:\n$1_{b} + 4_{b} = 5_{b}$\nThis is the same as $1b + 4b = 5b$.\n\nNow let's add up the numbers in the middle column:\n$6_{b} + 3_{b} = 9_{b}$\nThis is the same as $6b + 3b = 9b$.\n\nFinally, let's add up the numbers in the leftmost column:\n$1_{b} + 1_{b} = 3_{b}$\nThis is the same as $1b + 1b = 3b$.\n\nNow we can put it all together:\n\n$5b + 9b = 14b$\n$14b = 3b$\n$b = 3$\n\nSo, the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$ is 3.",
