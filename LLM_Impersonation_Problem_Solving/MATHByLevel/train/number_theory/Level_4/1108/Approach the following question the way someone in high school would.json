    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$, we must add the numbers in base $b$ as if they were in a normal base-10 equation. \nSo, we start by adding the rightmost digits together, which gives us:\n$1 + 4 = 5$.\nSince $5$ is $5$ in any base, we write down $5$ in base $b$ as $5_{b}$.\n\nNext, we add the next set of digits to the left:\n$6 + 3 = 9$.\nAgain, we write down $9$ in base $b$ as $9_{b}$.\n\nFinally, we add the leftmost set of digits together:\n$1 + 1 = 2$.\nSo, in base $b$, $2$ is $2_{b}$.\n\nTherefore, the given equation in base $b$ is $5_{b}9_{b}2_{b}=315_{b}$.\n\nNow, we convert each of these numbers to base 10:\n$5b^{2} + 9b + 2 = 3b^{2} + b + 5$\n\nNow, we solve for $b$:\n$5b^{2} + 9b + 2 = 3b^{2} + b + 5$\n$2b^{2} + 8b - 3 = 0$\n$(2b - 1)(b + 3) = 0$\n\nTherefore, $b = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $b = -3$.\n\nSince we cannot have a fractional base, the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{b = -3}$.",
