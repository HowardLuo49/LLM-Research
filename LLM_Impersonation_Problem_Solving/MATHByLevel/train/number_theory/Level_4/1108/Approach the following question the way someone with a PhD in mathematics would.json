    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$, we must convert each number to base 10 in order to solve the equation. Let's start by converting each number:\n\n$161_{b}= b^{2}+6b+1$\n\n$134_{b}= b^{2}+3b+4$\n\n$315_{b}= 3b^{2}+b+5$\n\nNow we substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n$(b^{2}+6b+1) + (b^{2}+3b+4) = 3b^{2}+b+5$\n\n$2b^{2}+9b+5 = 3b^{2}+b+5$\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n$b^{2} = 8b$\n\nThis implies that $b=8$ is the only solution that satisfies the equation. Thus, the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation $161_{b}+134_{b}=315_{b}$ is $b=8$.",
