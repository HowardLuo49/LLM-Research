The greatest common divisor of two integers is $(x+2)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+2)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 24, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 2) \\cdot x(x + 2)}{24} = \\frac{x(x + 2)^2}{24}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, or 3, but when $x = 4$, this expression is $4 \\cdot 6^2/24 = 6$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 6 and 24 is 6, and $x + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$.  The least common multiple is 24, and $x(x + 2) = 4 \\cdot (4 + 2) = 24$, so $x = 4$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers such that $a = 24$ without loss of generality. We know that their greatest common divisor is $x + 2$ and their least common multiple is $x(x + 2)$.\n\nSince the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $x + 2$, we can write $a = (x + 2)m$ and $b = (x + 2)n$ for some positive integers $m$ and $n$.\n\nSimilarly, since the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is $x(x + 2)$, we can write $a = x(x + 2)k$ and $b = x(x + 2)l$ for some positive integers $k$ and $l$.\n\nSince $a = 24$ and $b = (x + 2)n$, we have $24 = (x + 2)m$. Thus, $m = \\frac{24}{x + 2}$, which implies that $x + 2$ divides 24.\n\nWe also have $24 = x(x + 2)k$, which simplifies to $12 = x(x + 2)k$.\n\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we need to find the smallest possible integer $x$ such that $x + 2$ divides 24 and $12 = x(x + 2)k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nOne possible solution is $x = 2$, which gives $m = 8$, $n = 6$, $k = 1$, and $l = 2$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer is $b = (2 + 2)\\cdot 6 = 24$.",
