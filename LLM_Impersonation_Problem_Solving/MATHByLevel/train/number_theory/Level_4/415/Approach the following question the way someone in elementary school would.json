    "solution": "Notice that by the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + 8 = (n+2)(n^2 - 2n + 4)$ is an integer divisible by $n+2$. Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9, n+2) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9 - (n^3 + 8), n+2) \\\\ \n& = \\text{gcd}\\,(1,n+2) \\\\\n& = \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor, we need to see if there is a number that can divide both $n^3 + 3^2$ and $n + 2$ without leaving a remainder. \n\nLet's first simplify $n^3 + 3^2$ to $(n+3)(n^2 - 3n + 9)$ and see if we can simplify $n + 2$.\n\nSince $n > 2^3$, we know that $n + 2$ is greater than $2 + 2 = 4$. Therefore, $n + 2$ cannot be simplified further.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a common divisor between $(n+3)(n^2 - 3n + 9)$ and $(n + 2)$. Since we know that $n^2 - 3n + 9$ can be simplified further as $(n-3)^2$ and $(n-3)(n+3)$, we can see that both $(n-3)$ and $(n+3)$ are factors of $n+2$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $n^3 + 3^2$ and $n + 2$ is $n-3$ or $n + 3$.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of $n^3 + 3^2$ and $n + 2$ is either $n-3$ or $n+3$.",
