    "solution": "Notice that by the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + 8 = (n+2)(n^2 - 2n + 4)$ is an integer divisible by $n+2$. Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9, n+2) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9 - (n^3 + 8), n+2) \\\\ \n& = \\text{gcd}\\,(1,n+2) \\\\\n& = \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this problem by first recognizing the significance of the expression $n^3 + 3^2$ in relation to the given integer $n$. In this case, we can rewrite the expression as $n^3 + 9$, which is a perfect cube trinomial.\n\nNext, we can consider the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of $n^3 + 9$ and $n + 2$. By performing divisions, we can simplify the expressions and eventually arrive at the greatest common divisor.\n\nSpecifically, we start by dividing the larger expression by the smaller expression and taking the remainder. This process is repeated until we reach a remainder of zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.\n\nIn this case, the greatest common divisor of $n^3 + 9$ and $n + 2$ can be found by applying the Euclidean algorithm. The process may involve performing long divisions and simplifying expressions until a non-zero remainder is obtained, indicating the greatest common divisor.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem, the greatest common divisor of $n^3 + 9$ and $n + 2$ can be determined through a systematic application of mathematical principles, culminating in a definitive solution.",
