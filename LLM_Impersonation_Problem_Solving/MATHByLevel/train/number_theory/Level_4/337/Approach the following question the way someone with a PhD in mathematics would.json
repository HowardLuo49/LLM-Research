    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. George is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
    "solution": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the total amount of change George is trying to get as x cents. \n\nGiven that when receiving the most quarters possible, he receives 3 pennies in change, we can set up the equation:\n25q + 3 = x, where q represents the number of quarters.\n\nSimilarly, when receiving the most dimes possible, he receives 8 pennies in change, we can set up the equation:\n10d + 8 = x, where d represents the number of dimes.\n\nTo solve for x, we need to find the values of q and d that satisfy both equations. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can rearrange to get:\nx - 3 = 25q\nx = 25q + 3\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n10d + 8 = 25q + 3\n10d = 25q - 5\n\nSince q and d have to be integers, we can find the possible values of q and d that satisfy the equation:\n\nq = 1, d = 2\nq = 2, d = 5\nq = 3, d = 8\n\nCalculating the sum of the possible amounts of change:\nFor q = 1, x = 25(1) + 3 = 28 cents\nFor q = 2, x = 25(2) + 3 = 53 cents\nFor q = 3, x = 25(3) + 3 = 78 cents\n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible amounts of change that George is trying to get is 28 cents + 53 cents + 78 cents = 159 cents.",
