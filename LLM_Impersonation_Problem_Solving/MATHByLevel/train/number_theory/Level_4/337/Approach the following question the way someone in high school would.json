    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. George is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
    "solution": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out the value of 3 pennies. Since 1 penny is worth 1 cent, 3 pennies is worth 3 cents.\n\nNext, let's figure out the value of 8 pennies. Again, since 1 penny is worth 1 cent, 8 pennies is worth 8 cents.\n\nNow, let's find the value of the change George is trying to get when he receives the most quarters possible. Quarters are worth 25 cents each. Since he needs 3 pennies to meet the amount, the change he is trying to get is 25 cents - 3 cents = 22 cents.\n\nLastly, let's find the value of the change George is trying to get when he receives the most dimes possible. Dimes are worth 10 cents each. Since he needs 8 pennies to meet the amount, the change he is trying to get is 10 cents - 8 cents = 2 cents.\n\nTo find the sum of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get, we add up the values we found:\n\n3 cents + 8 cents + 22 cents + 2 cents = 35 cents\n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible amounts of change that George is trying to get is 35 cents.",
