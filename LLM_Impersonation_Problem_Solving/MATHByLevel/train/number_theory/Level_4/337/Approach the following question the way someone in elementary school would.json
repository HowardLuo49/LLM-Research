    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. George is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
    "solution": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how much change George is trying to get, we need to find out how many quarters and pennies he could get. \n\nFirst, let's look at when he gets the most quarters possible. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. That means he could get 3 pennies, which is equal to 1 quarter and 3 pennies. So, he could get 25 cents + 3 cents = 28 cents.\n\nNow, let's look at when he gets the most dimes possible. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. That means he could get 8 pennies, which is equal to 8 cents. So, he could get 10 cents + 8 cents = 18 cents.\n\nThe possible amounts of change that George is trying to get are 28 cents and 18 cents. The sum of these two amounts is 28 cents + 18 cents = 46 cents. So, George is trying to get 46 cents in change.",
