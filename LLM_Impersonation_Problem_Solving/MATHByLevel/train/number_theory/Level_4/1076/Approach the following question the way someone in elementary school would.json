    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation, we first need to figure out what the last two digits of $7^{2005}$ are.\n\nLet's start by finding a pattern in the last two digits of the powers of 7:\n$7^1$ = 07\n$7^2$ = 49\n$7^3$ = 43\n$7^4$ = 01\n$7^5$ = 07\n$7^6$ = 49\n...\n\nWe can see that the last two digits of the powers of 7 repeat in a pattern: 07, 49, 43, 01. Since the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we can find the remainder when 2005 is divided by 4. \n\n$2005 \\div 4 = 501$ with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the last two digits of $7^{2005}$ will be the same as the first power of 7 which is 07.
