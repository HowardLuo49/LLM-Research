    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$, we first need to calculate the value of $7^{2005}$. Unfortunately, computing such a large number by hand would take a lot of time and effort. However, we can still find the digit in the tens place without calculating the exact value.\n\nIn the decimal notation of a number, the digit in the tens place is determined by the remainder when the number is divided by 100 (since the tens place represents the number of tens in a number). So we need to find the remainder when $7^{2005}$ is divided by 100.\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. Since the remainder when dividing by 100 depends only on the last two digits of the number, we can find a pattern in the last two digits of powers of 7. \n\nWhen we calculate the first few powers of 7, we see that the pattern of the ones digits cycles through 7, 9, 3, and 1 (7^1 = 7, 7^2 = 49, 7^3 = 343, 7^4 = 2401). Once we reach 7^4, the pattern repeats. \n\nTherefore, we can reduce the exponent 2005 modulo 4, which would give us the exponent in the cycle. 2005 = 4 * 501 + 1, so the exponent in the cycle is 1. \n\nThis means that the ones digit of $7^{2005}$ is the same as the ones digit of $7^1$. Since $7^1 = 7$, the ones digit of $7^{2005}$ is 7.\n\nNow, for the tens digit, we need to consider how the tens digit changes as we raise 7 to higher powers. The tens digit of the powers of 7 follows a pattern as well. Starting from $7^1$, the tens digit is 0. Then for $7^2$, the tens digit is 4. For $7^3$, the tens digit is 4 again. For $7^4$, the tens digit is 0 back. \n\nThis means that the tens digit also follows a cycle of 0, 4, 4, 0. Since we have found that the ones digit of $7^{2005}$ is 7, we can conclude that the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is 4.\n\nTherefore, the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation is 4.",
