    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 159137: $159137=11\\cdot14467=11\\cdot17\\cdot851=11\\cdot17\\cdot23\\cdot37$. The positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is therefore $37-23=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the two largest prime factors of 159137, we first need to factorize it. By using a calculator or a prime factorization calculator, we find that the prime factorization of 159137 is $11 \\times 14467$. \n\nThe two largest prime factors are 11 and 14467. The positive difference between these two numbers is $14467 - 11 = 14456$. \n\nSo, the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is 14456.",
