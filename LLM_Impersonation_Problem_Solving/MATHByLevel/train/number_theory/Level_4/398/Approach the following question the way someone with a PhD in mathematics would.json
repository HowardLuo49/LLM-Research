    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 159137: $159137=11\\cdot14467=11\\cdot17\\cdot851=11\\cdot17\\cdot23\\cdot37$. The positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is therefore $37-23=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the two largest prime factors of $159137$, we first need to factorize the given number. \n\n$159137 = 401 \\times 397$\n\nThe two largest prime factors of $159137$ are $401$ and $397$. \n\nThus, the positive difference between these two prime factors is $401 - 397 = 4$. \n\nTherefore, the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of $159137$ is $4$.",
