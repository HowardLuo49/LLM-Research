    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 159137: $159137=11\\cdot14467=11\\cdot17\\cdot851=11\\cdot17\\cdot23\\cdot37$. The positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is therefore $37-23=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137, we first need to find the prime factors of 159137. \n\n159137 = 13 x 12241\n\nSo, the prime factors of 159137 are 13 and 12241. The two largest prime factors are 13 and 12241. \n\nNow, to find the positive difference between the two largest prime factors, we subtract the smaller prime factor from the larger prime factor:\n\n12241 - 13 = 12228\n\nSo, the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is 12228.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 14?: To find the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137, we first need to find the prime factors of 159137. \n\n159137 = 13 x 12241\n\nSo, the prime factors of 159137 are 13 and 12241.
