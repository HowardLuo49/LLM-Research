    "solution": "For the greatest common divisor of 15 and $n$ to be equal to 3, $n$ must be divisible by 3 but not divisible by 5.  In other words, $n$ is divisible by 3, but not by 15.\n\nThe greatest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 100 is 99, so there are $99/3 = 33$ multiples of 3 from 1 to 100.  We must subtract from this the number of multiples of 15 from 1 to 100.\n\nThe greatest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 100 is 90, so there are $90/15 = 6$ multiples of 15 from 1 to 100.  Therefore, there are $33 - 6 = \\boxed{27}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 3, but not 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integers $n$ between 1 and 100 have a greatest common divisor of 3 with 15, you can try counting them one by one. \n\nFirst, let's list out all the numbers between 1 and 100: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, .... 97, 98, 99, 100. \n\nThen, look at each number and see if its greatest common divisor with 15 is 3. You can do this by finding the factors of each number and seeing if 3 is one of them. \n\nFor example: \n- For 1, the greatest common divisor with 15 is not 3 because 1 goes into 15 but 3 does not.\n- For 3, the greatest common divisor with 15 is 3 because 3 goes into both 3 and 15.\n\nContinue this process for all the numbers between 1 and 100. Count up how many numbers have 3 as their greatest common divisor with 15. That will be your final answer.",
