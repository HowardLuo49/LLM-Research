    "solution": "Only square numbers have an odd number of factors. The $\\boxed{6}$ two-digit squares are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many positive two-digit numbers have an odd number of positive factors, let's start by listing all the two-digit numbers. \n\n1. We have 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99\n\nNow, let's figure out how many of these numbers have an odd number of factors. Factors are numbers that can multiply together to give the original number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nTo have an odd number of factors, the number must be a perfect square. This is because perfect squares have an odd number of factors since the square root counts as one of the factors. \n\nSo, we need to find which perfect squares are between 10 and 99. We have 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.\n\nSo, there are 8 two-digit numbers that have an odd number of factors: 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81. \n\nI hope this helps you count how many two-digit numbers have an odd numbers of positive factors!",
