    "solution": "Only square numbers have an odd number of factors. The $\\boxed{6}$ two-digit squares are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's first remember what factors are. Factors are numbers that can multiply together to give you a certain number. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nTo find out which two-digit numbers have an odd number of factors, we need to think about how many factors each number has. The only numbers that have an odd number of factors are perfect squares. That's because perfect squares have one factor that is counted twice - the square root of the number.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the perfect squares are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81. That's a total of 6 numbers that have an odd number of factors.\n\nSo, the answer is 6 positive two-digit integers have an odd number of positive factors.",
