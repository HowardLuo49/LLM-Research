    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we can try different values of $n$ and see which one works. \n\nWe can start by calculating $17 \\times 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 4 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 6 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, and $17 \\times 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ is $n = 5$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$, we can try different values of $n$ and see which one works. \n\nWe can start by calculating $17 \\times 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 4 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, $17 \\times 6 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, and $17 \\times 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ is $n = 5$.",
