    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we know that we need to find a number $n$ that when multiplied by 17 and then divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 1234. Let's start by finding what 17 times 1 is: 17. But when we divide 17 by 7, we get a remainder of 3. So that's not it! Let's try 17 times 2: 34. And when we divide 34 by 7, we get a remainder of 6. Still not 1234! Let's keep going...",
