    "solution": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8, we could keep raising 5 to various powers until we find a pattern. But that sounds like a lot of work! Instead, let's try to simplify the problem by breaking down the numbers.\n\nFirst, we know that $5^2 = 25$. Since we're looking for the remainder when dividing by 8, we can reduce 25 by finding its remainder when divided by 8: $25 \\mod 8$ is 1.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a pattern with the remainders when we keep squaring 5:\n$5^1 \\mod 8 = 5$\n$5^2 \\mod 8 = 1$\n$5^3 \\mod 8 = 5$\n$5^4 \\mod 8 = 1$\nand so on.\n\nSince we see a pattern emerge where the remainders alternate between 5 and 1, we can determine that $5^{137} \\mod 8$ will have the same remainder as $5^1$ since 137 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8 is 5.",
