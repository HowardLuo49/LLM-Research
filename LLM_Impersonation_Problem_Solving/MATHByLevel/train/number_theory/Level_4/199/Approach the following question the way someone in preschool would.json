    "solution": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! \n\n1. First, we know that $5^1$ is equal to 5.\n2. Next, let's see what happens when we keep multiplying by 5: \n   $5^2 = 25$\n   $5^3 = 125$\n   $5^4 = 625$\n3. Now, let's see if we can find a pattern. When we divide each of these results by 8, we get:\n   $25 \\div 8 = 3$ with a remainder of 1\n   $125 \\div 8 = 15$ with a remainder of 5\n   $625 \\div 8 = 78$ with a remainder of 1\n4. So, the pattern for the remainders seems to be 1, 5, 1, 5,... Let's see if we can find a simpler way to calculate the remainder for $5^{137}$.\n5. Since $137$ is an odd number, the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8 will be the same as the remainder when $5$ is divided by 8. This means that the remainder is 5.\n6. Yay! We figured it out! So the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8 is 5. Great job, everyone!",
