    "solution": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8, we can start by looking at the remainders when powers of 5 are divided by 8. \n\nFirst, let's find the remainders when the first few powers of 5 are divided by 8:\n$5^1$ divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 5\n$5^2$ divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 1\n$5^3$ divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 5\n$5^4$ divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 1\n\nWe notice a pattern that repeats every two powers of 5. Since 137 is an odd number, it can be written as 2 times a whole number plus 1 (137 = 68 x 2 + 1). Therefore, $5^{137} = 5^{68 x 2 + 1}$.\n\nSo, we see that $5^{137} = (5^2)^{68} * 5^1$. \nUsing the previous remainders we found, this computation becomes $1^{68} * 5 = 5$.\n\nTherefore, when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8, the remainder is 5.",
