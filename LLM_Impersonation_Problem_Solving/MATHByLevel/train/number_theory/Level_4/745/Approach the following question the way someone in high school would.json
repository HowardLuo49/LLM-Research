    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When a positive integer is expressed in base 7, it is $AB_7$, and when it is expressed in base 5, it is $BA_5$.  What is the positive integer in decimal?",
    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know that the positive integer is expressed as $AB_7$ in base 7 and $BA_5$ in base 5. We want to find the decimal value of this positive integer.\n\nLet's first convert $AB_7$ to decimal. We can use the formula for converting from any base to decimal: $a_n \\cdot b^n + a_{n-1} \\cdot b^{n-1} + ... + a_0 \\cdot b^0$, where $a_n$ represents the digit in the nth place and $b$ is the base.\n\nFor $AB_7$, we have $10 \\cdot 7^1 + 11 \\cdot 7^0 = 70 + 11 = 81$ in decimal.\n\nNow let's convert $BA_5$ to decimal. Using the same formula, we have $11 \\cdot 5^1 + 10 \\cdot 5^0 = 55 + 10 = 65$ in decimal.\n\nTherefore, the positive integer in decimal is $\\boxed{81}$.",
