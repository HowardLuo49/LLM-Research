    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the numbers! In base 7, the number is $AB_7$. That means the number is in between $70$ and $79$. In base 5, the number is $BA_5$. That means the number is in between $50$ and $59$. The only number that fits in both ranges is $54$. So, the positive integer in decimal is 54!",
