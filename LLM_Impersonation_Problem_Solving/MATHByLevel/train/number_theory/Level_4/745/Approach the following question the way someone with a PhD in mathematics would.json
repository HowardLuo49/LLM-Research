    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integer in decimal, we must first convert the given expressions in base 7 and base 5 into decimal form.\n\nLet the positive integer be represented as x in decimal form. \nIn base 7, the number is expressed as $AB_7 = 7A + B$ \nIn base 5, the number is expressed as $BA_5 = 5B + A$\n\nNow, we can set up a system of equations using these expressions:\n$7A + B = x$\n$5B + A = x$\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we can get the values of A and B. \n\nFrom the first equation, we get: \n$A = (x - B)/7$\n\nSubstitute this value of A into the second equation:\n$5B + (x - B)/7 = x$\n$35B + x - B = 7x$\n$34B = 6x$\n$B = 6x/34 = 3x/17$\n\nSince B is a positive integer, x must be a multiple of 17. Let x be 17k for some positive integer k.\n\nNow, substitute x = 17k back into the equation for B:\n$B = 3(17k)/17 = 3k$\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of A and B back into the equation in base 7:\n$A = (17k - 3k)/7 = 2k$\n\nTherefore, the positive integer in decimal form is \n$7(2k)+3k = 17k$\nThus, the positive integer in decimal form is a multiple of 17.",
