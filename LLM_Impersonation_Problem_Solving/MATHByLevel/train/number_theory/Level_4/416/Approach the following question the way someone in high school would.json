    "solution": "We can write 1234567890 as \\[12 \\cdot 10^8 + 34 \\cdot 10^6 + 56 \\cdot 10^4 + 78 \\cdot 10^2 + 90.\\] Note that \\[10^8 - 1 = 99999999 = 99 \\cdot 1010101,\\] is divisible by 99, so $12 \\cdot 10^8 - 12$ is divisible by 99.\n\nSimilarly, \\begin{align*}\n10^6 - 1 &= 999999 = 99 \\cdot 10101, \\\\\n10^4 - 1 &= 9999 = 99 \\cdot 101, \\\\\n10^2 - 1 &= 99 = 99 \\cdot 1\n\\end{align*} are also divisible by 99, so $34 \\cdot 10^6 - 34$, $56 \\cdot 10^4 - 56$, and $78 \\cdot 10^2 - 78$ are all divisible by 99.\n\nTherefore, \\[12 \\cdot 10^8 + 34 \\cdot 10^6 + 56 \\cdot 10^4 + 78 \\cdot 10^2 + 90 - (12 + 34 + 56 + 78 + 90)\\] is divisible by 99, which means that $1234567890$ and $12 + 34 + 56 + 78 + 90$ leave the same remainder when divided by 99.\n\nSince $12 + 34 + 56 + 78 + 90 = 270 = 2 \\cdot 99 + 72$, the remainder is $\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 1,234,567,890 is divided by 99, I would use long division. I would first divide 1,234 by 99 which is 12 with a remainder of 46. Then I would bring down the next digit, 5, to make 465. I would then divide 465 by 99 which is 4 with a remainder of 69. I would bring down the next digit, 6, to make 696. I would divide 696 by 99 which is 7 with a remainder of 3. Finally, I would bring down the last digit, 7, to make 37. I would divide 37 by 99 which is 0 with a remainder of 37. Therefore, the remainder when 1,234,567,890 is divided by 99 is 37.",
