    "solution": "When adding the numbers, we notice that $4+4$ leaves a residue of $2$ when divided by $6.$ Thus, the sum will have a rightmost digit of $2,$ and we must carry-over. This yields that $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{} & \\stackrel{}{4}_6 \\\\ &+ & & 1 & 4_6 \\\\ \\cline{2-5} && & 2 & 2_6 \\\\ \\end{array}$$ The sum is therefore $\\boxed{22_6}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's add together $4_6$ and $14_6$ just like adding regular numbers. \n\nStart by adding together the rightmost columns, which are the ones places. We have $4 + 4 = 10,$ but in base $6$ this is written as $10 = 1\\text{0}_6.$ So, we write the $0$ in the ones place of our answer and carry the $1$ to the next column.\n\nNext, we add together the next column, which is the sixes place. We have $1 + 1 = 2,$ so we write $2$ in the sixes place.\n\nTherefore, $4_6 + 14_6 = 20_6.$",
