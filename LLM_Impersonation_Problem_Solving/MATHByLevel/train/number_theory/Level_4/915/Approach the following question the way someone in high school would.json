    "solution": "When adding the numbers, we notice that $4+4$ leaves a residue of $2$ when divided by $6.$ Thus, the sum will have a rightmost digit of $2,$ and we must carry-over. This yields that $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{} & \\stackrel{}{4}_6 \\\\ &+ & & 1 & 4_6 \\\\ \\cline{2-5} && & 2 & 2_6 \\\\ \\end{array}$$ The sum is therefore $\\boxed{22_6}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have $4_6 + 14_6.$ When adding in base $6$, we need to carry over when the sum is greater than $6$. \n\nStarting with the ones place, $4_6 + 4_6 = 10_6$. Since $10_6$ is greater than $6$, we need to carry over. \n\nSo, we put down the $0$ in the ones place and carry over the $1$ to the next column. \n\nNext, we have $1_6 + 1_6 + 1_6 = 3_6$.\n\nTherefore, $4_6 + 14_6 = 30_6$ in base $6$.",
