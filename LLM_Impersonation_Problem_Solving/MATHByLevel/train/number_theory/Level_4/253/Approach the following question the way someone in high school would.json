    "solution": "Since $3^3=27=2\\cdot13+1$ we find that  \\[3^3\\equiv1\\pmod{13}.\\] Therefore \\[3^{1999}\\equiv3^{3\\cdot666+1}\\equiv1^{666}\\cdot3\\equiv3\\pmod{13}.\\] The remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by 13 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by $13$, we need to look for a pattern in the remainders when powers of $3$ are divided by $13$.
