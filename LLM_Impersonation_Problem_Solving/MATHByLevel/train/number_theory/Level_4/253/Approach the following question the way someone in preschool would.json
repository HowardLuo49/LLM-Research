    "solution": "Since $3^3=27=2\\cdot13+1$ we find that  \\[3^3\\equiv1\\pmod{13}.\\] Therefore \\[3^{1999}\\equiv3^{3\\cdot666+1}\\equiv1^{666}\\cdot3\\equiv3\\pmod{13}.\\] The remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by 13 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by $13, we can start by using our fingers to count. \n\nFirst, let's see what happens with smaller numbers. When we divide $3^1$ by 13, we get a remainder of 3. When we divide $3^2$ by 13, we get a remainder of 9. When we divide $3^3$ by 13, we get a remainder of 1. When we divide $3^4$ by 13, we get a remainder of 3 again. \n\nSo it looks like the remainders keep repeating in a pattern of 3, 9, 1, 3, 9, 1, and so on. \n\nNow, to find the remainder for $3^{1999}$, we can try to find where 1999 falls in this pattern. \n\nSince 1999 is odd, we know that the remainder will be either 3 or 9. To figure this out, we can first try to see what 1999 is when divided by 3. \n\n1999 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. \n\nSo, it looks like the remainder for $3^{1999}$ when divided by 13 is 3!\n\nYay! We did it!",
