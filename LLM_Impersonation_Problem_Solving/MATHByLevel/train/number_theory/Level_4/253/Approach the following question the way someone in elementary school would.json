    "solution": "Since $3^3=27=2\\cdot13+1$ we find that  \\[3^3\\equiv1\\pmod{13}.\\] Therefore \\[3^{1999}\\equiv3^{3\\cdot666+1}\\equiv1^{666}\\cdot3\\equiv3\\pmod{13}.\\] The remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by 13 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by $13, we can start by finding the remainders of $3^n$ when divided by $13$ for some smaller values of $n$.\nWhen we compute the first few powers of $3$ modulo $13$, we get the following remainders:\n$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^4 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^5 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$\n$3^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$\n\nNotice that the remainders of $3^n$ cycle in a pattern of length $3$, with remainders of $1, 9,$ and $3$. Therefore, to find the remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by $13$, we find the remainder when $1999$ is divided by $3$, which is $2$. \nTherefore, the remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by $13$ is the same as the remainder when $3^2$ is divided by $13$, which is $9$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $3^{1999}$ is divided by $13$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",
