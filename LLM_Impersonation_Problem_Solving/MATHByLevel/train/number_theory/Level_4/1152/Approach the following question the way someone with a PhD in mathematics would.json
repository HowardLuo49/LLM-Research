    "solution": "First, we find the repeating decimal expansion of 5/14: $$ \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{5}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{25}{70} = \\frac{25}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = (3.\\overline{571428})(0.1) = 0.3\\overline{571428}. $$The $1314^{\\text{th}}$ digit after the decimal point is the $1313^{\\text{th}}$ digit in the 6-digit repeating block 5-7-1-4-2-8.  Since $1313 \\div 6$ leaves a remainder of 5, our answer is the $5^{\\text{th}}$ digit in the 6-digit block, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $1314^{\\text{th}}$ digit past the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{14}$, we first need to write it in decimal form. We know that $\\frac{5}{14} = 0.\\overline{357142}$, where the bar denotes a repeating decimal.\n\nTo find the repeating pattern, we can multiply by 1000 to shift the decimal point 3 places to the right:\n$1000 \\times \\frac{5}{14} = 357.\\overline{142857}$.\n\nSubtracting the original number, $0.\\overline{357142}$, we get:\n$1000 \\times \\frac{5}{14} - \\frac{5}{14} = 356.785714 - 0.\\overline{357142} = 356.428572$.\n\nThis result shows us that the pattern of the repeating decimal is 6 digits long, with the repeating pattern being $142857$. \n\nSince $1314 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 6$, the $1314^{\\text{th}}$ digit past the decimal point will be the 6th digit in the repeating pattern, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",
