    "solution": "First, we find the repeating decimal expansion of 5/14: $$ \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{5}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{25}{70} = \\frac{25}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = (3.\\overline{571428})(0.1) = 0.3\\overline{571428}. $$The $1314^{\\text{th}}$ digit after the decimal point is the $1313^{\\text{th}}$ digit in the 6-digit repeating block 5-7-1-4-2-8.  Since $1313 \\div 6$ leaves a remainder of 5, our answer is the $5^{\\text{th}}$ digit in the 6-digit block, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see, let's try to find the decimal form of $\\dfrac{5}{14}$ first. We know that the decimal form of $\\frac{1}{14}$ is $0.\\overline{071428}$. So we can use that to help us find $\\frac{5}{14}$. Let's see, $5 \\times 0.\\overline{071428}$ is $0.\\overline{357140}$.\n\nNow we need to find the $1314^{\\text{th}}$ digit past the decimal point in $0.\\overline{357140}$. Let's count to see which digit that is. Um....okay, so the pattern of the decimals is 357140, and it repeats forever. Let's see, 1314 divided by 6 is about 219 with a remainder of 0.....sooo....let's see....uh....I think the $1314^{\\text{th}}$ digit is a $5$!\n\nSo yeah, the $1314^{\\text{th}}$ digit past the decimal point in $\\frac{5}{14}$ is a $5$! Yay!",
