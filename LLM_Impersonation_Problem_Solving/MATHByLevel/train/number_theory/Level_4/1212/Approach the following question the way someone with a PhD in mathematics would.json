    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. To express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$. If 400 were expressed as a sum of at least two distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 400 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 400 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 400 is $2^8=256$.  The difference between 400 and 256 is 144. The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7=128$.  The difference between 144 and 128 is 16.  Since $16=2^4$, we have found that $400=2^8+2^7+2^4$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express 400 as a sum of powers of 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 400, subtract it from 400, and repeat the process with the remaining value until we have expressed 400 as a sum of powers of 2.\n\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 400 is 256, because 2^8 = 256. Subtracting 256 from 400, we get 144. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 144 is 128 (2^7). Subtracting 128 from 144, we get 16. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 16 is 16 itself (2^4). Continuing this process, we find that 400 can be expressed as 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^4.\n\nThe sum of the exponents in this expression is 8 + 7 + 4 = 19. Therefore, the least possible sum of the exponents of distinct powers of 2 that add up to 400 is 19.",
