    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. To express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$. If 400 were expressed as a sum of at least two distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 400 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 400 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 400 is $2^8=256$.  The difference between 400 and 256 is 144. The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7=128$.  The difference between 144 and 128 is 16.  Since $16=2^4$, we have found that $400=2^8+2^7+2^4$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least possible sum of the exponents of the powers of 2 that add up to 400, we need to express 400 as a sum of powers of 2. \n\nLet's start by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 400. We know that $2^8 = 256$ and $2^9 = 512$, so the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 400 is $2^8 = 256$. \n\nNext, we need to find the remaining amount to get to 400, which is $400 - 256 = 144$. \n\nNow we need to express 144 as a sum of powers of 2. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 144 is $2^7 = 128$. The remaining amount is $144 - 128 = 16$. \n\nNext, we need to express 16 as a sum of powers of 2. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 16 is $2^4 = 16$. \n\nTherefore, 400 can be expressed as $400 = 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^4$. \n\nThe sum of the exponents of these powers is $8 + 7 + 4 = 19$. \n\nSo, the least possible sum of the exponents of the powers of 2 that add up to 400 is 19.",
