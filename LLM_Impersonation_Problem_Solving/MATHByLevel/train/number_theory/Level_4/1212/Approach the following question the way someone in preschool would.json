    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. To express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$. If 400 were expressed as a sum of at least two distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 400 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 400 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 400 is $2^8=256$.  The difference between 400 and 256 is 144. The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7=128$.  The difference between 144 and 128 is 16.  Since $16=2^4$, we have found that $400=2^8+2^7+2^4$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, we can try different combinations of powers of 2 until we reach 400! Let's start counting on our fingers, 2 to the power of 1 is 2, 2 to the power of 2 is 4, 2 to the power of 3 is 8, 2 to the power of 4 is 16, 2 to the power of 5 is 32, 2 to the power of 6 is 64, 2 to the power of 7 is 128, 2 to the power of 8 is 256, and 2 to the power of 9 is 512. Oh no! We went over 400. Let's go back to the last number, which is 256. \n\nNow we need to break down 144 by adding powers of 2: 400 - 256 = 144. We can see that we can express 144 as 2^7 + 2^4. The sum of the exponents is 7 + 4 = 11. Therefore, the least possible sum of the exponents of the powers of 2 that make up 400 is 11. Yay! We did it!",
