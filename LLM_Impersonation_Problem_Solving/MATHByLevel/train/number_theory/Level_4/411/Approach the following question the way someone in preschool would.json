    "solution": "We use the Euclidean Algorithm. \\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(11n+3, 6n+1) &= \\gcd(6n+1, (11n+3) - (6n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(6n+1, 5n+2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5n+2, (6n+1)-(5n+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5n+2, n-1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n-1, (5n+2)-5(n-1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n-1, 7).\n\\end{align*}Therefore, if $n-1$ is a multiple of 7, then the greatest common divisor of $11n+3$ and $6n+1$ is 7. Otherwise, the greatest common divisor is 1. This implies that the maximum possible value for the greatest common divisor of $11n+3$ and $6n+1$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

What's the biggest number that can divide both of them evenly? Hmm... let's try some numbers. Let's start with 1. Nope, that won't work 'cause they're both bigger than 1. How 'bout 2? Nope, that won't work either. Let's keep trying some numbers like 3, 4, 5, etc. Oh! I see it now! The biggest number that can divide both 11n+3 and 6n+1 evenly is 1. 'Cause they don't have any common factors other than 1. So, the greatest common divisor is 1. Yay for math!",
