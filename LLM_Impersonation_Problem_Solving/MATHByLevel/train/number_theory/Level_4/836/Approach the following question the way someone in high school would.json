    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check only composite numbers:\n\n$\\bullet$ For $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $6$, $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $12$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest abundant number, we need to first understand what proper divisors are. Proper divisors of a number are all the divisors of that number excluding the number itself. \n\nLet's start by finding the proper divisors of the smallest natural numbers:\n- The proper divisors of 1 are none (as it has no divisors)\n- The proper divisors of 2 are 1\n- The proper divisors of 3 are 1\n- The proper divisors of 4 are 1 and 2\n- The proper divisors of 5 are 1\n- The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3\n\nWe can continue this pattern to find the proper divisors of larger numbers. We'll need to calculate the sum of these proper divisors for each number and compare it to the number to see if it's abundant.\n\nAfter doing this for some numbers, we find that the smallest abundant number is 12. The proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The sum of these divisors is 16, which is greater than 12, making 12 an abundant number.",
