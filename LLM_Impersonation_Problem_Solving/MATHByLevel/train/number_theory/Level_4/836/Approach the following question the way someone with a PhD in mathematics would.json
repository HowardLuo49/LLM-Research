    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A natural number is abundant if it is less than the sum of its proper divisors. What is the smallest abundant number?",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check only composite numbers:\n\n$\\bullet$ For $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $6$, $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $12$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest abundant number, one must first understand the concept of proper divisors and how they relate to the sum of a number's divisors.\n\nProper divisors of a natural number n are all positive integers less than n that divide n evenly, excluding n itself. For example, the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\nAn abundant number is a natural number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. Mathematically, an abundant number n satisfies the inequality \u03c3(n) > 2n, where \u03c3(n) represents the sum of the divisors of n.\n\nTo find the smallest abundant number, we can start by examining the first few natural numbers and calculating their sum of proper divisors. Let's consider n = 12 again. The sum of the proper divisors of 12 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12. Therefore, 12 is an abundant number.\n\nBy systematically checking larger natural numbers, we can determine the smallest abundant number. This process may involve computational methods or specific algorithms to efficiently identify abundant numbers and compare their sums to the numbers themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the smallest abundant number is 12, as it is the first natural number for which the sum of its proper divisors exceeds the number itself.
