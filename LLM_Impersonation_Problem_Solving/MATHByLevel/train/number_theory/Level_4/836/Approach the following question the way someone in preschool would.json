    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check only composite numbers:\n\n$\\bullet$ For $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $6$, $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $12$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest abundant number, we need to look for a number where the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. Let's start with the smallest natural number, which is 1. The proper divisors of 1 are just 1. The sum of these divisors is 1, which is not greater than 1. So 1 is not an abundant number. Let's try the next smallest number, which is 2. The proper divisors of 2 are 1. The sum of these divisors is 1, which is not greater than 2. So 2 is also not an abundant number.\n\nLet's continue this process and keep looking for a number where the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. We will eventually find the smallest abundant number.",
