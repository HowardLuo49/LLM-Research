    "solution": "We start subtract the rightmost digits, keeping in mind that we are in base $8$.\n\nSince $5$ is less than $7$, we must borrow $1$ from the $2$, which then becomes $1$. Since $15_8-7_8=6_8$, we have $6$ in the rightmost digit. Since the $1$ left over is less than $3$, we must borrow $1$ from the $3$, which becomes a $2$. $11_8-3_8=6_8$, so we have $6$ in the second rightmost digit. Since $2-2=0$, the third rightmost digit is 0. In the usual notation, this process looks like $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\cancelto{2}{3}& \\cancelto{1}{2} & 5_8\\\\ & & - & 2 & 3 & 7_8\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & & & 6& 6_8\\\\ \\end{array}$$Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{66_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's line up the numbers like this:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & 3 & 2 & 5_{8} \\\\\n& - & 2 & 3 &7_{8} \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nStarting from the right, we subtract 7 from 5. Since 5 is smaller than 7, we borrow from the next column. So, the 2 turns into a 12.\n\nThen, we have 15 (which is 1 ten and 5 ones) minus 7, which equals 6. \n\nNow, let's subtract the 3 from the 2, which turns into 12 since we borrowed before.\n\nLastly, we subtract 1 from 1 and get 0.\n\nTherefore, $325_{8}-237_{8}=106_{8}$.",
