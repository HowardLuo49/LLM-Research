    "solution": "An integer congruent to 1 (mod 9) can be written in the form $9n + 1$ for some integer $n$.  We want to count the number of integers $n$ such that $$ 1 \\le 9n + 1 \\le 200. $$Subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality, we get $0 \\le 9n \\le 199$.  Dividing by 9 we get $0 \\le n \\le 22\\, \\frac{1}{9}$.  There are $22 - 0 + 1 = \\boxed{23}$ values of $n$ corresponding to positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive that are congruent to 1 (mod 9).",

In other words, a and b leave the same remainder when divided by 9.\n\nSo, let's consider the set of positive integers from 1 to 200 and determine which ones are congruent to 1 mod 9.

This means that the numbers congruent to 1 mod 9 can be found by adding 1 repeatedly to multiples of 9.\n\nStarting from the smallest multiple of 9 greater than 1 (which is 9 itself), we can find the numbers congruent to 1 mod 9 by adding multiples of 9 to 1 until we reach 200. This gives us the following sequence:\n\n1, 10, 19, 28, ..., 199\n\nTo determine how many numbers in this sequence are less than or equal to 200, we can calculate the last element of the sequence that is less than or equal to 200. In this case, the last element before surpassing 200 is 199.\n\nThus, the numbers from 1 to 200 that are congruent to 1 mod 9 are 1, 10, 19, 28, ..., 199. Counting these numbers, we see that there are 23 integers in this sequence that are less than or equal to 200.
