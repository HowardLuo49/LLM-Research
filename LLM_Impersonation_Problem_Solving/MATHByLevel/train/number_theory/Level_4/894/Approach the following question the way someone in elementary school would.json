    "solution": "An integer congruent to 1 (mod 9) can be written in the form $9n + 1$ for some integer $n$.  We want to count the number of integers $n$ such that $$ 1 \\le 9n + 1 \\le 200. $$Subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality, we get $0 \\le 9n \\le 199$.  Dividing by 9 we get $0 \\le n \\le 22\\, \\frac{1}{9}$.  There are $22 - 0 + 1 = \\boxed{23}$ values of $n$ corresponding to positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive that are congruent to 1 (mod 9).",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many numbers are congruent to 1 (mod 9) out of the 200 smallest positive integers, we can start by counting by 9s. That means we start with 1, then add 9 to get 10, add 9 again to get 19, and so on.\n\nWe can see that every 9 numbers will be congruent to 1 (mod 9) because when we divide them by 9, there will always be a remainder of 1.\n\nSo out of the 200 smallest positive integers, we can count how many groups of 9 there are. Since 200 divided by 9 is around 22 with a remainder of 2, that means there are 22 groups of 9 and 2 more numbers left over.\n\nTherefore, there are 22 groups of numbers congruent to 1 (mod 9), which is 22 x 9 = 198 numbers. So out of the 200 smallest positive integers, 198 of them are congruent to 1 (mod 9).",
