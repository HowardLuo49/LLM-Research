    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $a-b=6$ and $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) = 9$. Find the smallest possible value of $b$.",
    "solution": "Recall that $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. By the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) &= \\text{gcd}(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(a^2-2ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}((a-b)^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(36, ab).\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Trying values of $b$,  we find that $b = 1 \\Rightarrow a=7$ and $ab = 7\\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 1$. If $b = 2$, then $a=8$ and $ab=16 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 4$. Finally, $b = 3 \\Rightarrow a=9$ and $ab=27 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $b$ is  $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $a-b=6$, so we could say that $a=b+6$. Then, we can substitute $a=b+6$ into the equation given. This would give us $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{(b+6)^3+b^3}{b+6+b}, b(b+6)\\right) = 9$.\n\nSimplifying the numerator of the first fraction would give $3b^2 + 36b + 216 + b^3 = b^3 + 9b^2 + 36b + 216$. So the fraction becomes $\\frac{b^3+9b^2+36b+216}{2b+6}$.\n\nNotice that we can factor out a 9 from the denominator and the numerator to give $9\\frac{b^3+9b^2+36b+216}{2b+6}$. Canceling out the $b+6$'s, we are left with $9\\frac{b^2+9b+36}{2}$.\n\nWe want this fraction to be divisible by 9, so we can experiment with values of $b$ to see which ones work. Trying $b=3$ gives $9\\frac{90}{2}$ which is divisible by 9. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $b$ would be $\\boxed{3}$.",
