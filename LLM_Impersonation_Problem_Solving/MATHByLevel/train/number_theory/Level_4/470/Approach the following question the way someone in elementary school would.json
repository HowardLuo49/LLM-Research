    "solution": "Recall that $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. By the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) &= \\text{gcd}(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(a^2-2ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}((a-b)^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(36, ab).\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Trying values of $b$,  we find that $b = 1 \\Rightarrow a=7$ and $ab = 7\\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 1$. If $b = 2$, then $a=8$ and $ab=16 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 4$. Finally, $b = 3 \\Rightarrow a=9$ and $ab=27 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $b$ is  $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok so first we know that $a-b=6$. That means $a$ has to be $6$ more than $b$. Let's try some numbers to see what works. \n\nLet's start with $b=1$. If $b=1$, then $a=7$. Let's plug these values into the gcd, which means we need to find $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{7^3+1^3}{7+1}, 7\\right)$. This simplifies to $\\text{gcd}(344, 7)$. But the greatest common divisor of $344$ and $7$ isn't $9$, so $b=1$ doesn't work.\n\nNext, let's try $b=2$. If $b=2$, then $a=8$. We plug these values into the gcd again. So now we have to find $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{8^3+2^3}{8+2}, 16\\right)$, which simplifies to $\\text{gcd}(520, 16)$. The greatest common divisor of $520$ and $16$ is $8$, which isn't $9$, so $b=2$ doesn't work either.\n\nLet's keep trying different values for $b$ until we find one that works.",
