    "solution": "Recall that $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. By the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) &= \\text{gcd}(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(a^2-2ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}((a-b)^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(36, ab).\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Trying values of $b$,  we find that $b = 1 \\Rightarrow a=7$ and $ab = 7\\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 1$. If $b = 2$, then $a=8$ and $ab=16 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 4$. Finally, $b = 3 \\Rightarrow a=9$ and $ab=27 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $b$ is  $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's use our number blocks to help us solve this problem! We know that $a-b=6$, so let's represent $a$ as a stack of blocks and $b$ as a shorter stack of blocks. Since $a-b = 6$, we need to add 6 more blocks to $b$ to match the height of $a$.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest possible value of $b$, so let's start with a small number like 1 for $b$. That means $a$ would be 7. Now we need to calculate $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right)$. Let's start by plugging in those values and see if we get 9.
