    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When $x$ is divided by each of $4$, $5$, and $6$, remainders of $3$, $4$, and $5$ (respectively) are obtained. What is the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$?",
    "solution": "Note that $x+1$ is divisible by $4$, $5$, and $6$. Therefore, it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is $60$. Therefore, the smallest value for $x+1$ is $60$ and the smallest possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$ that satisfies these conditions, we can set up a system of congruences.\n\nLet $x$ be the positive integer we are looking for. We can express this system of congruences using modular arithmetic:\n\n$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$\n$x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$\n$x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$\n\nFrom the first congruence, we can write $x = 4a + 3$, where $a$ is an integer. Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $4a + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. This implies that $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nTherefore, $a = 5b + 4$, where $b$ is an integer. Substituting this back into the first congruence, we get $x = 4(5b + 4) + 3 = 20b + 19$. \n\nNow, substituting $x = 20b + 19$ into the third congruence, we get $20b + 19 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$, which simplifies to $2b + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$. This implies that $2b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}$, so $b \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $b = 3c + 2$, where $c$ is an integer. Substituting this back into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 20(3c + 2) + 19 = 60c + 59$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer value of $x$ that satisfies these conditions is when $c = 0$, which gives $x = 59$. Therefore, the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
