    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. An $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "An abundant number is a number that has lots of friends that add up to more than the number. Let's find all the abundant numbers less than 25!\n\nFirst, let's find the factors of each number less than 25. \n\nFor 12, its factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, which add up to 16.\n\nFor 18, its factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, which add up to 21.\n\nFor 20, its factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, which add up to 22.\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{3}$ numbers less than 25 that are abundant numbers.
