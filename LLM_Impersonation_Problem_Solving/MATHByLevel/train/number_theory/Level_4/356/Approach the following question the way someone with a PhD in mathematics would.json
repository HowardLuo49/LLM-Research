    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the numbers less than 25 that are abundant, we first need to find the proper factors of each number less than 25 and then calculate their sum.\n\nLet's consider each number less than 25:\n\nFor 12: The proper factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The sum of these factors is 1+2+3+4+6 = 16, which is greater than 12. Therefore, 12 is an abundant number.\n\nFor 18: The proper factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9. The sum of these factors is 1+2+3+6+9 = 21, which is greater than 18. Therefore, 18 is an abundant number.\n\nFor 20: The proper factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. The sum of these factors is 1+2+4+5+10 = 22, which is greater than 20. Therefore, 20 is an abundant number.\n\nFor 24: The proper factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12. The sum of these factors is 1+2+3+4+6+8+12 = 36, which is greater than 24. Therefore, 24 is an abundant number.\n\nTherefore, the numbers less than 25 that are abundant numbers are 12, 18, 20, and 24. There are a total of 4 numbers less than 25 that are abundant.",
