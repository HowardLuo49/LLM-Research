    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. An $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers, we need to first list out the proper factors of each number and then calculate the sum of those factors. If the sum is greater than the number itself, then the number is considered abundant.\n\nLet's start with the number 12:\nThe factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The sum of the proper factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12.\n\nNow let's check for other numbers less than 25:\n- For 1: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 2: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 3: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 4: 1 + 2 is not greater than 4, so it is not abundant.\n- For 5: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 6: Already calculated, it is abundant.\n- For 7: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 8: 1 + 2 + 4 is not greater than 8, so it is not abundant.\n- For 9: 1 + 3 is not greater than 9, so it is not abundant.\n- For 10: 1 + 2 + 5 is not greater than 10, so it is not abundant.\n- For 11: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 12: Already calculated, it is abundant.\n- For 13: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 14: 1 + 2 + 7 is not greater than 14, so it is not abundant.\n- For 15: 1 + 3 + 5 is not greater than 15, so it is not abundant.\n- For 16: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 is greater than 16, so it is abundant.\n- For 17: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 18: 1 + 2 + 3 + 9 is greater than 18, so it is abundant.\n- For 19: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 20: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 is not greater than 20, so it is not abundant.\n- For 21: 1 + 3 + 7 is not greater than 21, so it is not abundant.\n- For 22: 1 + 2 + 11 is not greater than 22, so it is not abundant.\n- For 23: 1 is not greater than its proper factors, so it is not abundant.\n- For 24: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 is greater than 24, so it is abundant.\n\nTherefore, the numbers less than 25 that are abundant are 12, 16, 18, and 24.
