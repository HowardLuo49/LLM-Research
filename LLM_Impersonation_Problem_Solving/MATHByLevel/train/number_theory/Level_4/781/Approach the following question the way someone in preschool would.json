    "solution": "We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Note that $428,\\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$. Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 3425}{125 \\cdot 8000}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3425}{8000}.\n\\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{3425}{8000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5^2\\cdot 137}{5^2\\cdot 320} \\\\\n&= \\frac{137}{320}.\n\\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's see how we can write the number $0.428125$ as a fraction. Hmm... let's start by counting the number of digits after the decimal point. There are six digits, so we can write this as $\\frac{428125}{1000000}$. Now we need to simplify this fraction. Hmm... I see that both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of $125$. So if we divide the numerator and denominator by $125$, we get $\\frac{3425}{8000}$. Now we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by $25$, which gives us $\\frac{137}{320}$. So, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$.",
