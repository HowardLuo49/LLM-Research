    "solution": "We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Note that $428,\\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$. Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 3425}{125 \\cdot 8000}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3425}{8000}.\n\\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{3425}{8000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5^2\\cdot 137}{5^2\\cdot 320} \\\\\n&= \\frac{137}{320}.\n\\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To write $0.428125$ as a fraction, we can start by looking at the decimal places. Since there are $6$ decimal places in $0.428125$, we can multiply $0.428125$ by $10^6$ to get rid of the decimal places. This gives us $428125 = \\frac{428125}{1}$. \n\nNow, to simplify this fraction, we can see that both $428125$ and $1$ are divisible by $5$. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $5$, we get $\\frac{428125/5}{1/5} = \\frac{85625}{0.2}$.\n\nIn order to simplify further, we can recognize that $0.2$ can be represented as $\\frac{2}{10}$. So we can now simplify the fraction to get $\\frac{85625}{2/10} = \\frac{85625 \\cdot 10}{2} = \\frac{856250}{2} = 428125$.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is $\\frac{428125}{1}$, which means $a=428125$ and $b=1$. So, $a+b = 428125+1 = 428126$. \n\nTherefore, in simplest terms, $a+b = 428126$.",
