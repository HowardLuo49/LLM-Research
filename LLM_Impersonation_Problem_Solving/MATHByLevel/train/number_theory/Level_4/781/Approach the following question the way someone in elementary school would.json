    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The number $0.428125$ can be written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$. When this fraction is in simplest terms, what is $a+b$?",
    "solution": "We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Note that $428,\\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$. Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 3425}{125 \\cdot 8000}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3425}{8000}.\n\\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{3425}{8000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5^2\\cdot 137}{5^2\\cdot 320} \\\\\n&= \\frac{137}{320}.\n\\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To turn this decimal into a fraction, we can count the decimal places. There are six decimal places, so we can multiply $0.428125$ by $10^6$ to get rid of the decimal point. That gives us $428125$. So the fraction is $\\frac{428125}{1000000}$.\n\nNow we can simplify this fraction by dividing the top and bottom by $125$. That gives us $\\frac{3425}{8000}$.\n\nFinally, we can simplify this fraction even more by dividing the top and bottom by $25$. That gives us $\\frac{137}{320}$.\n\nSo when this fraction is in simplest terms, $a=137$ and $b=320$. To find $a+b$, we can just add them up: $137+320=\\boxed{457}$.",
