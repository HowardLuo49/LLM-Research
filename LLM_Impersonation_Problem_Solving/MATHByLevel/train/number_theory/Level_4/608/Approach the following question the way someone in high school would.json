    "solution": "We can use the distributive property of multiplication to multiply a three-digit palindrome $aba$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) with 101: $$ 101 \\cdot aba = (100 + 1) \\cdot aba = aba00 + aba = ab(2a)ba. $$Here, the digits of the product are $a$, $b$, $2a$, $b$, and $a$, unless carrying occurs.  In fact, this product is a palindrome unless carrying occurs, and that could only happen when $2a \\ge 10$.  Since we want the smallest such palindrome in which carrying occurs, we want the smallest possible value of $a$ such that $2a \\ge 10$ and the smallest possible value of $b$.  This gives us $\\boxed{505}$ as our answer and we see that $101 \\cdot 505 = 51005$ is not a palindrome.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so first let's remember that a palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, we want to find the smallest three-digit palindrome number.\n\nThe smallest three-digit palindrome is 101. But when we multiply 101 by 101, we get 10,201 which is a five-digit palindrome.\n\nSo, let's try the next smallest three-digit palindrome, which is 111. When we multiply 111 by 101, we get 11,211 which is also a five-digit palindrome.\n\nLet's try the next smallest three-digit palindrome, which is 121. When we multiply 121 by 101, we get 12,221 which is still a five-digit palindrome.\n\nThe next smallest three-digit palindrome is 131. When we multiply 131 by 101, we get 13,231 which is not a palindrome. So, the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome is 131.",
