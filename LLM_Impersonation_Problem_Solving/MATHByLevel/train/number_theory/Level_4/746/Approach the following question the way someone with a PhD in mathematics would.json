    "solution": "Since $-3737 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ that satisfies $n \\equiv -3737 \\pmod{8}$, we can start by simplifying the congruence. Since $-3737$ is already a negative number, we can rewrite it as $-3737 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$, as adding or subtracting multiples of $8$ will not affect the residue class.\n\nTherefore, the congruence simplifies to $n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$. This means that $n$ is congruent to $7$ when divided by $8$. The integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence is $7$. \n\nHence, the integer $n$ we are looking for is $n=7$.",
