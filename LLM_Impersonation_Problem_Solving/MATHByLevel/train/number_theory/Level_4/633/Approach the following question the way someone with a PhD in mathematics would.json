The letters of the alphabet are given numeric values based on the two conditions below.\n\n$\\bullet$  Only the numeric values of $-2,$ $-1,$ $0,$ $1$ and $2$ are used.\n\n$\\bullet$  Starting with A and going through Z, a numeric value is assigned to each letter according to the following pattern: $$\n1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0,\\ldots\n$$\n\nTwo complete cycles of the pattern are shown above.
