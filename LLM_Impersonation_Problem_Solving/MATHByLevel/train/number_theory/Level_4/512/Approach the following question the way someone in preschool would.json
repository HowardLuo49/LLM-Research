    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A two-digit integer $AB$ equals $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the three-digit integer $AAB$, where $A$ and $B$ represent distinct digits from 1 to 9. What is the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer $AAB$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite $AB$ as $10A+B$ and $AAB$ as $100A+10A+B$. Now we set $AAB=9\\cdot AB$ since $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of $AAB$. \\begin{align*}\n100A+10A+B&=9(10A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=90A+9B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5A&=2B\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ such that $5A=2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$. So $AAB=\\boxed{225}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see. We have a two-digit number $AB$ that is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of a three-digit number $AAB$. That means $10A + B = \\frac{1}{9}(100A + 10A + B)$. We can simplify this to $10A + B = \\frac{111A}{9}$. \nLet's try some numbers to find the smallest possible value of $AAB$. Let's start with $A=1$.\nPlugging in $A=1$ gives us $10 + B = 12$, so $B=2$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $AAB$ is $\\boxed{122}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 225?: Hmm let's see. We have a two-digit number $AB$ that is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of a three-digit number $AAB$.
