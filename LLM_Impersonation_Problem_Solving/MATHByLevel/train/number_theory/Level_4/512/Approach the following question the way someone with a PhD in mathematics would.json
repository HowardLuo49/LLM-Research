    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A two-digit integer $AB$ equals $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the three-digit integer $AAB$, where $A$ and $B$ represent distinct digits from 1 to 9. What is the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer $AAB$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite $AB$ as $10A+B$ and $AAB$ as $100A+10A+B$. Now we set $AAB=9\\cdot AB$ since $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of $AAB$. \\begin{align*}\n100A+10A+B&=9(10A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=90A+9B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5A&=2B\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ such that $5A=2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$. So $AAB=\\boxed{225}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up the following equation:\n$$AB = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot AAB$$\n\nExpanding $AAB$ and substituting in the given values for $A$ and $B$, we get:\n$$10A + B = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot (100A + 10A + B)$$\n$$10A + B = \\frac{110A + 9B}{9}$$\n$$90(10A + B) = 110 A + 9B$$\n$$900A + 90B = 110A + 9B$$\n$$790A = -81B$$\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits from 1 to 9, the smallest possible positive integer value for $A$ is 1. Substituting $A = 1$ into the equation, we find:\n$$790 = -81B$$\n$$B = \\frac{-790}{81}$$\n\nSince $B$ must be an integer, the smallest positive integer value for $B$ that satisfies the equation is $B = 10$. Therefore, the smallest possible value for the three-digit integer $AAB$ is $\\boxed{110}$.",
