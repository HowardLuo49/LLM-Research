    "gpt_response": "Ok, first we need to calculate $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + 100^3$. That means we need to find the sum of the cubes of the first 100 numbers. \n\nTo do that, we can use the formula for sum of cubes of the first n numbers, which is $\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$. When we plug in 100 for n, we get $\\left(\\frac{100(100+1)}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{100(101)}{2}\\right)^2 = 5050^2 = 25502500$.\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when that big number is divided by 6. To do that, we divide 25502500 by 6 and find the remainder. \n\n25502500 \u00f7 6 = 4250416 remainder 4\n\nSo, the remainder when $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + 100^3$ is divided by 6 is 4.",
