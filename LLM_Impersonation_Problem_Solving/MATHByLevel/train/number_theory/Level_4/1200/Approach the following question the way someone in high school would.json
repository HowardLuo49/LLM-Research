    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. How many of its positive integer factors are perfect squares?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many of the positive integer factors of 2160 are perfect squares, we look at the exponents of each prime factor. Since we want perfect squares, we need to have even exponents.\n\nFor the prime factorization $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$, we have the following options:\n\n- For the factor of 2, we can have 0, 2, or 4 as the exponent.\n- For the factor of 3, we can have 0 or 2 as the exponent.\n- For the factor of 5, we can have 0 as the exponent.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares is the product of the number of choices for each prime factor: (3 choices for 2) * (2 choices for 3) * (1 choice for 5) = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. \n\nSo, there are 6 positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares.",
