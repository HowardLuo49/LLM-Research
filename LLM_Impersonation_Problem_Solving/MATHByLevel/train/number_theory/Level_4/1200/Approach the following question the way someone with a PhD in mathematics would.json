    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. How many of its positive integer factors are perfect squares?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares, we first need to consider the prime factorization of 2160, which is given as $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. \n\nA perfect square factor must have all exponents in its prime factorization divisible by 2. This means that for a factor to be a perfect square, the prime factorization of the factor must have exponents that are multiples of 2. \n\nIn the prime factorization of 2160, we have:\n\n- Exponent of 2: 4 (which is divisible by 2)\n- Exponent of 3: 3 (which is not divisible by 2)\n- Exponent of 5: 1 (which is not divisible by 2)\n\nTo form a perfect square factor, we can choose the exponents of 2 in the prime factorization (0, 2, or 4) and the exponent of 3 in the prime factorization (0 or 2), as the exponent of 5 is already 1. \n\nTherefore, there are 3 choices for the exponent of 2 (0, 2, or 4) and 2 choices for the exponent of 3 (0 or 2). Multiplying these choices together for the exponents of 2 and 3 gives us a total of 3 * 2 = 6 perfect square factors of 2160. \n\nHence, there are 6 positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares.",
