    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$. Therefore, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.\nThe largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $8^3=512$. Therefore, there are $8$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\nHowever, we cannot simply add those two numbers together because there are numbers that are both a perfect cube and a perfect square. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it needs to be a $2 \\cdot 3 =6$th power. The largest 6th power less than $555$ is $2^6=64$, so there are $2$ 6th powers less than $555$.\nTherefore, there are $23+8-2=\\boxed{29}$ integers that are either a perfect cube or perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the number of positive integers less than 555 that are either perfect cubes or perfect squares, we first need to identify the set of perfect squares and perfect cubes less than 555.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than 555 is $8^3 = 512$, and the largest perfect square less than 555 is $23^2 = 529$.
