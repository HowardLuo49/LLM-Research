    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many positive integers less than $555$ are either a perfect cube or a perfect square?",
    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$. Therefore, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.\nThe largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $8^3=512$. Therefore, there are $8$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\nHowever, we cannot simply add those two numbers together because there are numbers that are both a perfect cube and a perfect square. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it needs to be a $2 \\cdot 3 =6$th power. The largest 6th power less than $555$ is $2^6=64$, so there are $2$ 6th powers less than $555$.\nTherefore, there are $23+8-2=\\boxed{29}$ integers that are either a perfect cube or perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's think about all the perfect squares less than $555$. We know that the perfect squares are $1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9, 4^2=16, 5^2=25, 6^2=36, 7^2=49, 8^2=64, 9^2=81, 10^2=100, 11^2=121, 12^2=144, 13^2=169, 14^2=196, 15^2=225, 16^2=256, 17^2=289, 18^2=324, 19^2=361, and 20^2=400$. So, there are $20$ perfect squares less than $555$. \n\nNext, let's think about all the perfect cubes less than $555$. We know that the perfect cubes are $1^3=1, 2^3=8, 3^3=27, 4^3=64, 5^3=125, 6^3=216, 7^3=343$. So, there are $7$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\n\nNow, we have to make sure we are not counting any numbers twice. We see that $1$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, but it only counts once. \n\nSo, there are $20+7=27$ positive integers less than $555$ that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube.",
