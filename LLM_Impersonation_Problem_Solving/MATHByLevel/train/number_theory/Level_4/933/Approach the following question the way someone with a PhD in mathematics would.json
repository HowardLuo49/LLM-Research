    "solution": "We start by changing the expressions to base 10 in terms of $a$ and $b$. We also know that the two expressions should be equal since they represent the same number. \\begin{align*}\n12_a&=21_b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n1\\cdot a+2\\cdot 1&=2\\cdot b +1\\cdot1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na+2&=2b+1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na&=2b-1.\n\\end{align*}For the smallest base-10 integer, we would want the smallest bases $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ must be greater than 2, we'll let $b=3$ and that means $a=2\\cdot3-1=5$. In these bases, the base-10 integer is $a+2=5+2=\\boxed{7}$. We can check that the base-$b$ expression also works and get $2\\cdot b+1=2\\cdot3+1=7$.\n\nAlternatively, we can just try different bases. The smallest possible value for $a$ and $b$ is 3. If we let $a=3$, we'd need a smaller base for $b$ (since we have $2\\cdot b\\approx1\\cdot a$), which isn't possible. When we let $b=3$, we get $21_3=7$ and try to find $b$ such that $12_b=7$. If $b+2=7$, then $b=5$ and we still get $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $12_a$ in one base and $21_b$ in another base, we need to determine the values of $a$ and $b that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that $12_a = a + 2$ and $21_b = 2b + 1$. Setting these equal to each other and simplifying, we get:\n\n$a + 2 = 2b + 1$\n\n$a - 1 = 2b$\n\nFrom here, we can see that $a-1$ must be even in order for $b$ to be an integer. This means that $a$ must be odd. Since $a$ and $b$ are bases larger than 2, the smallest possible odd number greater than 2 is 3. Therefore, $a=3$ and $b=1$.\n\nPlugging these values back into the original equations, we find that $12_3 = 3+2 = 5$ and $21_4 = 2(4) + 1 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $12_a$ in one base and $21_b$ in another base is 5.",
