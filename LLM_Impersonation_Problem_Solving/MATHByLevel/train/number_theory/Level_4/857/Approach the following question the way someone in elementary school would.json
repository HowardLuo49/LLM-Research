    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A day can be evenly divided into 86,400 periods of 1 second; 43,200 periods of each 2 seconds; or in many other ways. In total, how many ways are there to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers?",
    "solution": "A day has $86,\\!400$ seconds. $86,\\!400=2^7\\cdot3^3\\cdot5^2$, so 86,400 has $(7+1)(3+1)(2+1)=96$ positive factors. Thus there are $96/2=48$ (unordered) pairs of factors each of whose product is $86,\\!400.$ Since ``$n$ periods of $m$ seconds'' is different from ``$m$ periods of $n$ seconds,'' we need to multiply $48$ by $2$ to get our final answer of $\\boxed{96}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's think about this problem. We want to know how many ways we can divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds. \n\nLet's start with a simpler example. Say we have a day divided into 3 periods of 1 second each. Well, there's only 1 way to do that - we just have 3 seconds in a row.\n\nNow, let's try dividing a day into 3 periods of 2 seconds each. We could have 2 seconds, then 2 seconds, then 2 seconds. Or we could have 4 seconds, then 2 seconds, then 2 seconds. Or we could have 1 second, then 2 seconds, then 2 seconds, and so on. There are actually 6 different ways to divide the day into 3 periods of 2 seconds each.\n\nSo, for any given $n$ and $m$, we just need to figure out how many ways we can arrange those periods in a day. This is where things get a bit tricky, but if we keep practicing and trying different examples, we can figure it out!",
