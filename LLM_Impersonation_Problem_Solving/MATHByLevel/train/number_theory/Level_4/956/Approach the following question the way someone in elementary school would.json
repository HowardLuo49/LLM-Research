    "solution": "The value of 121 base $n$ is $1\\cdot n^2+2\\cdot n^1+1\\cdot n^0=n^2+2n+1$.  Since $n^2+2n+1=(n+1)^2$, the digit string 121 is a perfect square in any base except binary (where the digit 2 is not allowed).  There are $10-3+1=\\boxed{8}$ integers between 3 and 10 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the values of $121_n$ for each possible value of $n$ from 3 to 10. \n\nIf $n = 3$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot3^2 + 2\\cdot3 + 1 = 16$\n\nIf $n = 4$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot4^2 + 2\\cdot4 + 1 = 25$\n\nIf $n = 5$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot5^2 + 2\\cdot5 + 1 = 36$\n\nIf $n = 6$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot6^2 + 2\\cdot6 + 1 = 49$\n\nIf $n = 7$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot7^2 + 2\\cdot7 + 1 = 64$\n\nIf $n = 8$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot8^2 + 2\\cdot8 + 1 = 81$\n\nIf $n = 9$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot9^2 + 2\\cdot9 + 1 = 100$\n\nIf $n = 10$, then $121_n = 1\\cdot10^2 + 2\\cdot10 + 1 = 121$\n\nFrom these values, we see that $121_n$ is a perfect square only when $n=5$ and $n=3$.
