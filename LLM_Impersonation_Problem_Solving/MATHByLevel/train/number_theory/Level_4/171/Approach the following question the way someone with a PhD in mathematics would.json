    "solution": "We start by writing out some powers of five modulo 7. \\begin{align*}\n5^1 &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^3 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^4 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^5 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^6 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we have that $5^6 \\equiv 1$ modulo 7. Thus, $5^{2010} \\equiv (5^6)^{335} \\equiv 1^{335} \\equiv \\boxed{1}$ modulo 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of $5^{2010}$ when divided by 7, we can utilize Fermat's Little Theorem. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nIn this case, we have $p=7$ and $a=5$. Since 7 is a prime number and 5 is not divisible by 7, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem. \n\nWe know that $7-1=6$, so $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, we can rewrite $5^{2010}$ as $(5^6)^{335} \\cdot 5^0$. Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we have $5^{2010} \\equiv 1^{335} \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder of $5^{2010}$ when divided by 7 is 1.",
