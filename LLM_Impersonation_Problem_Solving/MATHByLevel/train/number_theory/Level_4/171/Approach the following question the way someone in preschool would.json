    "solution": "We start by writing out some powers of five modulo 7. \\begin{align*}\n5^1 &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^3 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^4 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^5 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^6 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we have that $5^6 \\equiv 1$ modulo 7. Thus, $5^{2010} \\equiv (5^6)^{335} \\equiv 1^{335} \\equiv \\boxed{1}$ modulo 7.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count to see what happens when we keep adding $5$ over and over again. When we get to $35$, we find that it can be divided by $7$ evenly because $35$ divided by $7$ is $5$. So, if we keep adding $5$ after that, we'll see that the remainder will always be $5$ when we divide by $7$. So, the remainder of $5^{2010}$ when divided by $7$ is $5$. Yay!",
