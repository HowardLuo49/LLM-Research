    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $T$ be a positive integer whose only digits are 0s and 1s. If $X = T \\div 12$ and $X$ is an integer, what is the smallest possible value of $X$?",
    "solution": "Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.  Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4.  By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100.  Calculating, $X = \\boxed{925}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of X, we need to find the smallest possible value of T that is divisible by 12. Since T can only consist of the digits 0 and 1, the smallest T that is divisible by 12 is the number 1000, which equals 12*83. Therefore, if we divide 1000 by 12, we get X = 83, which is the smallest possible value of X.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 925?: To find the smallest possible value of X, we need to find the smallest possible value of T that is divisible by 12. Since T can only consist of the digits 0 and 1, the smallest T that is divisible by 12 is the number 1000, which equals 12*83. Therefore, if we divide 1000 by 12, we get X = 83, which is the smallest possible value of X.",
