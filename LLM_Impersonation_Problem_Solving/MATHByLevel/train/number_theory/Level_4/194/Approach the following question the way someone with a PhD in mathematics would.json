    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $T$ be a positive integer whose only digits are 0s and 1s. If $X = T \\div 12$ and $X$ is an integer, what is the smallest possible value of $X$?",
    "solution": "Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.  Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4.  By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100.  Calculating, $X = \\boxed{925}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of $X$, we need to consider the properties of the number $T$ made up of only 0s and 1s that satisfies $X = T \\div 12$. \n\nFirst, let's consider the divisibility rule for 12. A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. Since $T$ only contains the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits will determine if $T$ is divisible by 3. \n\nFor $T$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since $T$ only contains the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits will be a multiple of 1. Thus, $T$ will be divisible by 3 if it contains an even number of 1s.\n\nNext, let's look at the divisibility rule for 4. A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. Since $T$ only contains the digits 0 and 1, the last two digits of $T$ will be either 00, 01, 10, or 11. Among these options, only 00 and 12 are divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for $X$ occurs when $T$ is the smallest number made up of only 0s and 1s that satisfies the divisibility criteria for both 3 and 4. From our analysis, the number $T = 1100$ satisfies both divisibility criteria and can be divided by 12 without a remainder.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is $1100 \\div 12 = 91$.",
