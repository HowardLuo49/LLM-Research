    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $T$ be a positive integer whose only digits are 0s and 1s. If $X = T \\div 12$ and $X$ is an integer, what is the smallest possible value of $X$?",
    "solution": "Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.  Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4.  By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100.  Calculating, $X = \\boxed{925}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have a number $T$ made up of only 0s and 1s. We want to divide $T$ by 12 and get a whole number. \n\nTo figure this out, let's start by finding multiples of 12: \n12 x 1 = 12\n12 x 2 = 24\n12 x 3 = 36\n12 x 4 = 48\n12 x 5 = 60\n...\n\nWe notice that when we reach 12 x 5, we get 60, which is the smallest multiple of 12 that ends in 0 and is made up of only 0s and 1s. So, if we let $T$ be a number with only 0s and 1s that equals 60, then when we divide $T$ by 12, we get $X = 60 \\div 12 = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is 5.",
