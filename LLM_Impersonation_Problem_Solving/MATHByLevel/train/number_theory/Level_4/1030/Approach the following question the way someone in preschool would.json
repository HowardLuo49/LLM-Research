    "solution": "From the middle column, we see that $A_6+4_6=13_6$, so $A+4=1\\cdot6+3=9$ and $A=5$. Since the rightmost column tells us that $B_6+1_6=A_6$, $B=5-1=4$. Therefore, $A+B=5+4=\\boxed{9}$.",

So, let's see, when we count up from $A$ to $1$ in base 6, we get $3$ and from $B$ to $4$ in base 6, we get $A$. \n\nSo, if we convert $3A$ to base 10, we get $3 \\times 6 + 10 = 28$. \n\nTherefore, $A + B = 2 + 8 = 10$. \n\nYay, we found it!
