    "solution": "We start from $2^1$ and consider the remainder when successive powers of 2 are divided by 7.  \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^2 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^3 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n2^4 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^5 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^6 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n&\\hphantom{\\text{ leaves a re}}\\vdots\n\\end{align*} Since 2004 is divisible by 3 (the digits sum to 6, which is a multiple of 3), we find that $2^{2005}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$ when divided by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7, we can use the concept of remainders in modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, let's simplify the problem by finding the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7. We can start by finding the remainders for some smaller powers of 2:\n\n$2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n$2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ (since $2^3 = 8$ and $8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$)\n$2^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ (because $2^4 = 16$ and $16 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$)\n$2^5 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ \n\nWe can see that there is a pattern where the remainders repeat every 3 powers of 2. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$2^{2005} = 2^{3 \\cdot 668 + 1} = (2^3)^{668} \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1^{668} \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n\nSo, the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7 is 2.",
