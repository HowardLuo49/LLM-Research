    "solution": "We start from $2^1$ and consider the remainder when successive powers of 2 are divided by 7.  \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^2 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^3 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n2^4 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^5 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^6 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n&\\hphantom{\\text{ leaves a re}}\\vdots\n\\end{align*} Since 2004 is divisible by 3 (the digits sum to 6, which is a multiple of 3), we find that $2^{2005}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$ when divided by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If we keep doubling 2, we get these remainders when dividing by 7: 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1...Hmmm...I think it just keeps repeating and never gets a remainder of 0. So the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7 is...3! Yay!",
