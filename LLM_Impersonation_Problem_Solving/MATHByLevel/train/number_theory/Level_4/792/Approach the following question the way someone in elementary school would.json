    "solution": "We start from $2^1$ and consider the remainder when successive powers of 2 are divided by 7.  \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^2 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^3 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n2^4 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^5 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^6 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n&\\hphantom{\\text{ leaves a re}}\\vdots\n\\end{align*} Since 2004 is divisible by 3 (the digits sum to 6, which is a multiple of 3), we find that $2^{2005}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$ when divided by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7, we can start by finding the remainders of smaller powers of 2 when divided by 7. \n\nLet's start with $2^1$, which is equal to 2. When 2 is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. \n\nNext, let's find $2^2$, which is equal to 4. When 4 is divided by 7, the remainder is 4. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we find that $2^3$ is equal to 8. When 8 is divided by 7, the remainder is 1. \n\nSince the remainders of $2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$ cycle through 2, 4, 1, we can conclude that the remainders of $2^n$ will also cycle through 2, 4, 1 with every third power.\n\nSince 2005 is not a multiple of 3, we know that the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7 will be the same as the remainder when $2^2$ (which is 4) is divided by 7.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7 is 4.",
