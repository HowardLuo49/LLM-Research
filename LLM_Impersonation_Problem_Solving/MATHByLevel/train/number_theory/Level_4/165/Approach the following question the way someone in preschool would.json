    "solution": "$x$ must be a divisor of 2007. To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor. The total number of divisors is then $3\\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223). Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair. So there are $\\boxed{6}$ ordered pairs.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! To find out how many ordered pairs of positive integers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $xy=2007$, we need to think about breaking apart the number 2007 into its factors. We know that 2007 is the same as $3^{2}\\times223$, so that means we can make pairs using those factors. \n\nLet's start with the factor 1: we can pair that with 2007.\nThen we have the factors 3 and 669. So we can pair 3 with 669 and vice versa.\nNext we have the factors 9 and 223. We can pair 9 with 223 and vice versa.\n\nThat's all the pairs we can make using the factors of 2007! So, the final answer is 6 ordered pairs: (1, 2007), (2007, 1), (3, 669), (669, 3), (9, 223), and (223, 9). Yay, we did it!",
