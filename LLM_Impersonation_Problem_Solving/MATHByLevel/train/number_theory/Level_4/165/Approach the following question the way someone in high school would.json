    "solution": "$x$ must be a divisor of 2007. To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor. The total number of divisors is then $3\\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223). Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair. So there are $\\boxed{6}$ ordered pairs.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find all the factors of 2007. We know that 2007 can be factored into $3^{2} \\times 223$. To find all the factors, we can use the prime factorization. \n\nSince $2007 = 3^{2} \\times 223$, the factors of 2007 are all possible combinations of multiplying the prime factors.
