    "solution": "The greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer is $777_8$, which is equal to $7 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 7 = 511$.  This number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so we subtract 1, to get $\\boxed{776_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5, we need to look for the largest number we can make with 3 digits in base 8 that is also divisible by 5.\n\nThe largest 3-digit number in base 8 is 777 (which is 8^2 + 8^1 + 8^0 = 512 + 64 + 1 = 577 in base 10). But 777 is not divisible by 5.\n\nThe next largest 3-digit number in base 8 is 767. Let's convert it to base 10 to see if it is divisible by 5: 7*8^2 + 6*8^1 + 7*8^0 = 7*64 + 6*8 + 7 = 448 + 48 + 7 = 503. Since 503 is not divisible by 5, 767 is not the answer.\n\nThe next largest 3-digit number in base 8 is 757. Let's convert it to base 10: 7*8^2 + 5*8^1 + 7*8^0 = 7*64 + 5*8 + 7 = 448 + 40 + 7 = 495. Since 495 is divisible by 5, the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5 is 757 (which is 495 in base 10).\n\nSo, our answer is 757 in base 8.",
