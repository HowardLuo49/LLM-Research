    "solution": "Factoring out the highest power of 2 that divides 180, we get $180=2^2\\cdot45$. Thus, the odd factors of 180 are all the factors of $45=3^2\\cdot5^1$, which has $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many odd whole numbers are factors of 180, we can first list all the factors of 180. \n\nThe factors of 180 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, and 180.\n\nNow, we can count the odd factors. Odd numbers are numbers that end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. \n\nFrom the list of factors, the odd factors are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45.\n\nThere are 6 odd whole numbers factors of 180.",
