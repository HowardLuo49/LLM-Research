    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the sum of all these factorials, let's first calculate the units digit of each factorial.\n\nFor $1!$, the units digit is simply 1.\nFor $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$, the units digit is 2.\nFor $3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$, the units digit is 6.\nFor $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$, the units digit is 4.\nFor $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$, the units digit is 0.\nFor $6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720$, the units digit is 0.\nAnd so on...\n\nWe can notice a pattern here: as soon as we get to a factorial of 5 or above, the units digit will always be 0. This is because any number multiplied by 5 or above will have a units digit of 0.\n\nTherefore, when we sum all these factorials up to $2006!$, the only factorials that contribute to the units digit will be $1!$, $2!$, $3!$, and $4!$. Adding these up, we get $1 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 13$.\n\nThe units digit of this sum is 3, so the final answer is 3.",
