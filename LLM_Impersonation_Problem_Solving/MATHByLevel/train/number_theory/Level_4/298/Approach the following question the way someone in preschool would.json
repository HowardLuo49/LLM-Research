    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's try to find the units digit of each factorial first.\n\n1! = 1\n2! = 2\n3! = 6\n4! = 24\n5! = 120\n6! = 720\n\nWe can see that 5! and any factorial greater than 5 will have a units digit of 0. So, when we add up all the factorials from 1! to 2006!, only the factorials from 1! to 4! will affect the units digit of the sum.\n\n1 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 13\n\nThe units digit of 13 is 3. So, the units digit of the sum $$1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 2006!$$ will be 3.",
