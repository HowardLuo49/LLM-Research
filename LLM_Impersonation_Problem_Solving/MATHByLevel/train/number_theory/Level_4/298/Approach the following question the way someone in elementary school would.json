    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find the units digit of each factorial. \n\n$1! = 1$, so the units digit is 1. \n$2! = 2$, so the units digit is 2. \n$3! = 6$, so the units digit is 6. \n$4! = 24$, so the units digit is 4. \n$5! = 120$, so the units digit is 0. \n\nFrom here, we can see that the units digit of the factorial of any number greater than 4 will be 0, since it will always be divisible by 10.\n\nSo when we add up all the factorials from 1 to 2006, we just need to add up the units digits of the first few factorials:\n\n$1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 0 + \\cdots$\n\nThis sum will repeat every 4 factorials, so we just need to find how many times 2006 can be divided by 4. Since $2006 \\div 4 = 501$ with a remainder of 2, we only need to add up the units digits of the factorials up to $4 \\times 500$.\n\nSo our sum will be $1 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 13$, and the units digit of this sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
