    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10. What is the largest possible value of $m$?",
    "solution": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of $m$, we need to find the largest possible values of $x$ and $y$ and then multiply them together with $10x+y$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10, the largest possible values they can take are 7 and 5 (as 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers less than 10).\n\nSo, let's choose $x=7$ and $y=5$, then $m = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (10(7) + 5) = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 75 = 2625$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is $\\boxed{2625}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 795?: To find the largest possible value of $m$, we need to find the largest possible values of $x$ and $y$ and then multiply them together with $10x+y$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10, the largest possible values they can take are 7 and 5 (as 2, 3, and 5 are the prime numbers less than 10).\n\nSo, let's choose $x=7$ and $y=5$, then $m = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (10(7) + 5) = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 75 = 2625$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is $\\boxed{2625}$.",
