    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10. What is the largest possible value of $m$?",
    "solution": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this down! We know that $m$ is made up of three prime factors: $x$, $y$, and $10x+y$. Each of these numbers are less than 10 and are prime numbers. \n\nTo find the largest possible value of $m$, we need to find the largest prime numbers less than 10 to use for $x$ and $y$. The largest prime number less than 10 is 7. So, let's use 7 for $x$.\n\nNow we need to find the largest prime number less than 10 to use for $y$. The largest prime number less than 10 is also 7, but since $x$ and $y$ cannot be the same, we can't use 7 again. The next largest prime number less than 10 is 5, so let's use 5 for $y$. \n\nNow we need to find the value of $10x+y$. Substituting in the values we found, we get $10(7)+5 = 70+5 = 75$. \n\nFinally, to find the largest possible value of $m$, we multiply $x$, $y$, and $10x+y$ together. So, $7*5*75 = 2625$. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is 2625.",
