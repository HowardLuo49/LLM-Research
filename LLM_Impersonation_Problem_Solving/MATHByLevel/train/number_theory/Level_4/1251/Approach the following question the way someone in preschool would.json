The number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10. What is the largest possible value of $m$?",
    "solution": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$.",

We know that $m$ is a three-digit number, so the largest possible value for $x$ is 9 and for $y$ is 9 as well.\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $m$, we want to find the largest possible values of $x$ and $y$. \n\nTo maximize the value of $m$, we should choose the largest possible values for $x$ and $y$ that are less than 10. \n\nSo, let's choose $x=7$ and $y=5$, which are the largest prime numbers less than 10. \n\nThe three prime factors are $7$, $5$, and $10(7)+5=75$. \n\nNow, let's multiply these three prime factors together to find the largest possible value of $m$:\n\n$m=7*5*75=2625$\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is $2625$.\n\nYay, we did it! \ud83c\udf89",
