    "solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we need to figure out what $AAA_4$ is in base 10 first. Since each $A$ is a digit in base 4, we know that $A$ can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. \n\nIn base 4, $AAA_4$ represents $A \\times 4^2 + A \\times 4^1 + A \\times 4^0 = 16A + 4A + A = 21A$. \n\nIf we convert this to base 10, we get that $AAA_4 = 21A = 33_b$. \n\nThis means that $33_b$ in base 10 is equivalent to 21 times $A$ in base 10. So, $33_b = 21A$. \n\nWe need to find the smallest $A$ and $b$ such that $33_b = 21A$. Since $b$ is greater than 5, the smallest possible base that will work is 6. \n\nIn base 6, $33_6 = 3 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0 = 18 + 3 = 21$. \n\nSo, $A = 3$ and $b = 6$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible sum $A + b$ is $3 + 6 = 9$.",
