    "solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so $AAA_4$ can be written as $33_b$. This means that each of the digits of $AAA_4$ is equal to 3 when expressed in base $b$. The smallest digit in base 4 is 0, so $A$ must be 0. \n\nTo find the smallest possible sum $A+b$, we need to find the smallest base $b$ that is greater than 5. The smallest base that fits this criteria is 6. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible sum $A+b$ is $0+6=6$. Yay!",
