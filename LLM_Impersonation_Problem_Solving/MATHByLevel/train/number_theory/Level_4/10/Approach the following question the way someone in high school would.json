    "solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that $AAA_4$ can be written as $33_b$. This means that each $A$ in base 4 is equal to 3 in base $b$. Since $A$ is a digit in base 4, it must be less than or equal to 3. \n\nLet's start by finding the smallest possible base $b$ that makes $A=3$. In base 4, we have $AAA_4 = 3*4^2 + 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 57$. This is equal to $3*4^2 + 3*4^0$ in base $b$. \n\nNow, we need to find the smallest base $b$ greater than 5 that will allow this equation to hold. We know that $b > 5$, so let's start with $b=6$. \n\nIn base 6, $57$ is equal to $3*6^2 + 3*6^0 = 111_6$. This means that $A=3$ in base 4 corresponds to 1 in base 6. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible sum $A+b$ is $3+6=9$.",
