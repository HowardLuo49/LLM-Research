    "solution": "Since $-3736 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a number that when divided by 6, the remainder is the same as when we divide -3736 by 6. Let's start by dividing -3736 by 6. \n\n-3736 divided by 6 equals -622 with a remainder of 4. \n\nWhen we divide -3736 by 6, we get a remainder of 4. This means that \"-3736 is congruent to 4 modulo 6.\" So, $n = 4$. \n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ we are looking for is 4.",
