    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For what base-6 digit $d$ is $2dd5_6$ divisible by the base 10 number 11? (Here $2dd5_6$ represents a base-6 number whose first digit is 2, whose last digit is 5, and whose middle two digits are both equal to $d$).",
    "solution": "We write $2dd5_6$ in base 10 to get $2dd5_6=2\\cdot 6^3+d\\cdot 6^2 +d\\cdot 6 + 5= 437 + 42d$. We can subtract $39\\cdot 11$ from this quantity without changing whether it is divisible by 11. This subtraction yields $437 + 42d-429 = 8 + 42d$. We can subtract $33d$ from this quantity, again not changing whether it is divisible by 11, leaving $8+9d$. Now we try the possible values $d=0,1,2,3,4,5$ for a base-6 digit, and we find that only $d=\\boxed{4}$ results in a number which is divisible by 11.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm...Let's count to 11 in base 6! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11! So, if we add up all the digits in $2dd5_6$, it should be divisible by 11. Let's see...\n\n$2 + d + d + 5$ has to be divisible by 11. So in order to figure out what $d$ is, we need to find a number that makes $2 + d + d + 5$ divisible by 11. Let's try different numbers for $d$ and see which one works! Let's start counting...1, 2, 3, 4, 5...oops, we ran out of fingers. Um...maybe we can ask a teacher for help with this one, it seems like a tough question!",
