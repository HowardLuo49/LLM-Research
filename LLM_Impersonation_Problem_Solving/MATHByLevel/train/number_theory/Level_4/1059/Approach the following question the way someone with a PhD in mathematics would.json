    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For what base-6 digit $d$ is $2dd5_6$ divisible by the base 10 number 11? (Here $2dd5_6$ represents a base-6 number whose first digit is 2, whose last digit is 5, and whose middle two digits are both equal to $d$).",
    "solution": "We write $2dd5_6$ in base 10 to get $2dd5_6=2\\cdot 6^3+d\\cdot 6^2 +d\\cdot 6 + 5= 437 + 42d$. We can subtract $39\\cdot 11$ from this quantity without changing whether it is divisible by 11. This subtraction yields $437 + 42d-429 = 8 + 42d$. We can subtract $33d$ from this quantity, again not changing whether it is divisible by 11, leaving $8+9d$. Now we try the possible values $d=0,1,2,3,4,5$ for a base-6 digit, and we find that only $d=\\boxed{4}$ results in a number which is divisible by 11.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine for what base-6 digit $d$ the number $2dd5_6$ is divisible by 11 in base 10, we first convert the number to base 10. \n\nThe number $2dd5_6$ can be expressed as $2 \\cdot 6^3 + d \\cdot 6^2 + d \\cdot 6 + 5$. This simplifies to $2 \\cdot 216 + d \\cdot 36 + d \\cdot 6 + 5 = 432 + 36d + 6d + 5 = 437 + 42d$.\n\nFor $2dd5_6$ to be divisible by 11 in base 10, the difference between the sum of the digits at odd positions and the sum of the digits at even positions must be divisible by 11. \n\nSince $437 + 42d = (4 + 7) - (3 + 2d)$, we have $11 | 11 - d$. This implies that $d$ must equal 4 for $2dd5_6$ to be divisible by 11 in base 10.\n\nTherefore, the base-6 digit $d$ that makes $2dd5_6$ divisible by 11 in base 10 is 4.",
