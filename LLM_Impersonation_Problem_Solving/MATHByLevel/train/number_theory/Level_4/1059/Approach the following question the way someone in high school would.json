    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For what base-6 digit $d$ is $2dd5_6$ divisible by the base 10 number 11? (Here $2dd5_6$ represents a base-6 number whose first digit is 2, whose last digit is 5, and whose middle two digits are both equal to $d$).",
    "solution": "We write $2dd5_6$ in base 10 to get $2dd5_6=2\\cdot 6^3+d\\cdot 6^2 +d\\cdot 6 + 5= 437 + 42d$. We can subtract $39\\cdot 11$ from this quantity without changing whether it is divisible by 11. This subtraction yields $437 + 42d-429 = 8 + 42d$. We can subtract $33d$ from this quantity, again not changing whether it is divisible by 11, leaving $8+9d$. Now we try the possible values $d=0,1,2,3,4,5$ for a base-6 digit, and we find that only $d=\\boxed{4}$ results in a number which is divisible by 11.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's convert $2dd5_6$ into base 10. \n\n$2dd5_6 = 2(6^3) + d(6^2) + d(6) + 5 = 2(216) + d(36) + d(6) + 5 = 432 + 36d + 6d + 5 = 437 + 42d$\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $d$ such that $437 + 42d$ is divisible by 11.\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 11, we can alternate adding and subtracting the digits. If the result is a multiple of 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11. \n\nSo, starting with $437 + 42d$:\n4 - 3 + 7 + 4 - 2 + d = 10 + d\n\nFor this to be divisible by 11, $d$ must be 1, so the value of $d$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
