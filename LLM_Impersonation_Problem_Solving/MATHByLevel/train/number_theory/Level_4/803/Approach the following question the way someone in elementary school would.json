    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Nine stones are arranged in a straight line. They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10. The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17. The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on. The counting continues in this manner. Which of the original stones is counted as 99? Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone.",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have to figure out which original stone is counted as 99. Let's see, we know that the stones are counted in a pattern going left to right, then right to left, then left to right again. \n\nFirst, we count up to 17, then down from 17 to 10. After that, we continue left to right until we get to 27. This means that the stone originally counted as 1 will be counted as 17, 27, 37, 47, and so on. \n\nSince 99 is a 2-digit number, we know that the stone will be counted past 90. If we count up by 10s from 17, we can see that 97 is counted as the stone originally counted as 9. So, the stone originally counted as 9 will be counted as 97, 107, 117, etc. \n\nFinally, we count up to 99. The first digit assigned to the stone originally counted as 9 is $\\boxed{9}$.",
