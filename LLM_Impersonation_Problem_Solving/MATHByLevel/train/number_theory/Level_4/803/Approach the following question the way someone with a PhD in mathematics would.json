    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Nine stones are arranged in a straight line. They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10. The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17. The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on. The counting continues in this manner. Which of the original stones is counted as 99? Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone.",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the stones as $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9$ going from left to right. \n\nWhen the counting reaches 99, it means that the counting has gone through all the numbers from 1 to 9 for the first time, then circled back and started a second round of counting. \n\nAfter the first round of counting, the stone that was originally stone 1 will be counted as stone 17. Therefore, after two rounds of counting, the stone originally numbered as 1 will be counted as 17 + 9 = 26. \n\nSince the counting continues in this manner, we can see that after $k$ rounds, the stone originally numbered as 1 will be counted as $17 + 9(k-1)$.\n\nThus, we need to solve the equation $17 + 9(k-1) = 99$ for $k$. Simplifying, we get $9k = 99 \\Rightarrow k = 11$. \n\nTherefore, after 11 rounds of counting, the stone originally numbered as 1 will be counted as $17 + 9 (11 - 1) = 98$. \n\nAs the pattern reverses in the following round, the stone originally numbered as 2 will be counted as 18 and so on. \n\nHence, the original stone that is counted as 99 is stone $\\boxed{8}$.",
