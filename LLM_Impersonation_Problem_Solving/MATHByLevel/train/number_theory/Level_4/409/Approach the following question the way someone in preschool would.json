    "solution": "Notice that $1001=10\\cdot 100+1$. Therefore, $$10\\cdot 100\\equiv -1 \\pmod{1001},$$which implies that $$10\\cdot -100\\equiv 1\\pmod{1001}.$$The inverse of $10\\pmod{1001}$ is $-100$, but we need an answer in the interval from $0$ to $1000$. The equivalent residue in this interval is $-100+1001 = \\boxed{901}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: $10\\cdot 901 = 9010 = 9(1001)+1 \\equiv 1\\pmod{1001}$, so $901$ is indeed the inverse of $10\\pmod{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If we have the number $10$, we can figure out what it's the same as when we have just $1$ of them. What's $10$ divided by $10$? That's $1$! So $10^{-1}$ is the same as $1$. So $10^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{1001}$.",
