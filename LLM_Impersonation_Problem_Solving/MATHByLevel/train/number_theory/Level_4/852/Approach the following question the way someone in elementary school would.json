    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, I can't just divide 1121 by 12 because we're in base 5. So I need to remember that 12 in base 5 means 1 five and 2 ones. \n\nLet's start by dividing the units place. 1 five divided by 1 five is 1 and there are 0 remainders. \n\nNext, we divide the tens place. In base 5, we have 1 five and 2 ones. We can't divide 1 five by 2, so we have to borrow. We can make the 1 five into 5 ones. So, now we have 5 ones and 2 ones which is 7 ones. 7 ones divided by 2 ones is 3 with a remainder of 1. \n\nFinally, we bring down the 1 from the hundreds place. Now we have 11 ones. 11 ones divided by 1 five is 2 with 1 remainder.\n\nSo, the quotient of 1121 base 5 divided by 12 base 5 is 132 base 5.",
