    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by thinking about the largest possible number when all the digits are 2's. The largest digit we can have is a 2, so we'll use as many 2's as possible.\n\nIf we add up as many 2's as possible until the sum is 11, we get 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10. \n\nBut we need a total of 11. So we can replace one of the 2's with a 3. \n\nNow, we have 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11.\n\nSo, the largest number we can form is 32222.\n\nThat's it!",
