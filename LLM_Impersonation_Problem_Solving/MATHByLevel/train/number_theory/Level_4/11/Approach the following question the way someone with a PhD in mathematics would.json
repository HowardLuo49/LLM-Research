    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the largest number, all of whose digits are 3 or 2, and whose digits add up to $11$?",
    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the largest number satisfying the given conditions. Since the sum of the digits of $n$ is $11$, it must have at least two digits. Let us consider the cases where $n$ has $2$ digits and $3$ digits separately.\n\nCase 1: $n$ has 2 digits.\nLet $n = 10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the digits of $n$. Since $n$ is the largest number satisfying the conditions, we maximize $a$ and $b$ subject to the condition that $3a + 2b = 11$. The largest possible values for $a$ and $b$ subject to this constraint are $a = 3$ and $b = 2$. Therefore, in this case, the largest number is $n = 10(3) + 2 = 32$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ has 3 digits.\nLet $n = 100c + 10d + e$, where $c$, $d$, and $e$ are the digits of $n$. Similarly, we want to maximize $c$, $d$, and $e$ subject to the condition that $3c + 2d + e = 11$. The largest possible values for $c$, $d$, and $e$ subject to this constraint are $c = 3$, $d = 2$, and $e = 2$. Therefore, in this case, the largest number is $n = 100(3) + 10(2) + 2 = 322$.\n\nComparing the results from the two cases, we see that the largest number satisfying the conditions is $322$.",
