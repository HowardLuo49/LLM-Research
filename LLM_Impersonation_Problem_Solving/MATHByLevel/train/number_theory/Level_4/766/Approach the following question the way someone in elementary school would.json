    "solution": "The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $210$ is equal to $(1 + 2)(1 + 3)(1+5)(1+7)$, as each factor of $210$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the answer is equal to $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{576}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the positive whole number divisors of 210, we need to list out all the divisors first. The divisors of 210 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, and 210.\n\nNext, we add up all these numbers to find the sum. So, 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 21 + 30 + 35 + 42 + 70 + 105 + 210 = 576.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the positive whole number divisors of 210 is 576.",
