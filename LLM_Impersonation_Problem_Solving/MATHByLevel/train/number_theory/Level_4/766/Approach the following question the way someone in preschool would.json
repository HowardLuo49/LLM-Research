    "solution": "The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $210$ is equal to $(1 + 2)(1 + 3)(1+5)(1+7)$, as each factor of $210$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the answer is equal to $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{576}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! The positive whole number divisors of 210 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, and 210. Now let's add them all up. 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 21 + 30 + 35 + 42 + 70 + 105 + 210 = 448. So, the sum of the positive whole number divisors of 210 is 448! Yay, we did it!",
