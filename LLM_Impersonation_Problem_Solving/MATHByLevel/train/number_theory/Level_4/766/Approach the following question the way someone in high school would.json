    "solution": "The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $210$ is equal to $(1 + 2)(1 + 3)(1+5)(1+7)$, as each factor of $210$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the answer is equal to $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{576}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the positive whole number divisors of 210, we first need to list out all the divisors of 210. We start by factoring 210 into its prime factors: 2 x 3 x 5 x 7. \n\nThen we can find all the divisors by combining the prime factors in different ways. The divisors of 210 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, and 210. \n\nFinally, we add up all these divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 21 + 30 + 35 + 42 + 70 + 105 + 210 = 576. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the positive whole number divisors of 210 is 576.",
