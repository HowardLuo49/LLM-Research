    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The integers 195 and 61 are expressed in base 4 and added.  What is the resulting sum, expressed in base 4?",
    "solution": "Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61.  Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\\boxed{10000}$.",

Hmm...we start back at 1 and add another column to keep track of our numbers. \n\nWhen we add the numbers 195 and 61 in base 4, we have to remember to carry over if the total is more than 4. Let's see...5 plus 1 is 6, but that is greater than 4 so we have to carry over to the next column. Similarly, when adding 6 and 1, we get 7, which is greater than 4 so we have to carry over again.\n\nSo, the resulting sum of 195 and 61 in base 4 is 1, 0, 1, 0. Yay, we did it! 1, 0 is for the ones place, where we carry over to the next column, and 1, 0 is for the tens place. That's our answer in base 4!",
