    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The integers 195 and 61 are expressed in base 4 and added.  What is the resulting sum, expressed in base 4?",
    "solution": "Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61.  Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\\boxed{10000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To add the integers 195 and 61 in base 4, we need to convert them to base 10 first. \n\n195 in base 4 is equivalent to 1*(4^3) + 2*(4^2) + 3*(4^1) + 3*(4^0) = 64 + 32 + 12 + 3 = 111 in base 10.\n\n61 in base 4 is equivalent to 1*(4^2) + 3*(4^1) + 1*(4^0) = 16 + 12 + 1 = 29 in base 10.\n\nNow, adding 111 and 29 in base 10 gives us 140.\n\nWe then need to convert 140 back to base 4. \n\n140 divided by 4 is 35 with a remainder of 0. \n35 divided by 4 is 8 with a remainder of 3. \n8 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 0. \n2 divided by 4 is 0 with a remainder of 2. \n\nSo, the resulting sum of 195 and 61, expressed in base 4, is 203.",
