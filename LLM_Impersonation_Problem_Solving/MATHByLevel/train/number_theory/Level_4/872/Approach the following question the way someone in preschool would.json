    "solution": "Notice that $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$ differ by $83^2$. Therefore, if they have a common divisor, then that divisor must also be a divisor of $83^2$. (To see why this is true, suppose $d$ is a divisor of $83^9+1$, so that $83^9+1 = dm$ for some integer $m$; also suppose that $d$ is a divisor of $83^9+83^2+1$, so that $83^9+83^2+1=dn$ for some integer $n$. Then $83^2=d(n-m)$.)\n\nSince $83$ is prime, the only (positive) divisors of $83^2$ are $1$, $83$, and $83^2$ itself. But $83$ cannot be a divisor of $83^9+1$ (which is clearly $1$ more than a multiple of $83$). Therefore, $\\gcd(83^9+1,83^9+83^2+1)=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to see if we can share the toys between the two numbers. We can see that $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$ both have $83^9$ in them. So we can take out the $83^9$ from both of them. That leaves us with $1$ for the first number and $83^2 +1$ for the second number. \nNow we need to check if we can share more toys between $1$ and $83^2+1$. We see that we cannot share anymore toys between the two numbers. So the greatest number of toys that the two numbers can share is $1$. Therefore, the $\\gcd(83^9+1,83^9+83^2+1) = 1$.",
