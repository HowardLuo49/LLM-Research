    "solution": "Prime factorizing gives $n = 2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$. Since any positive factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ where $0 \\le a \\le 23$ and $0 \\le b \\le 12$, there are $(23+1)(12+1) = 24 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{312}$.",

Now, let's count how many different groups we can make using these blocks. We can put each block in or out of our group, so we have 2 choices for each block.
