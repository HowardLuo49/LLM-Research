    "solution": "Prime factorizing gives $n = 2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$. Since any positive factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ where $0 \\le a \\le 23$ and $0 \\le b \\le 12$, there are $(23+1)(12+1) = 24 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{312}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of natural number factors of n, we can use the prime factorization of n. \n\nGiven that $n = 2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 4^6\\cdot 6^7$, we can simplify this expression by noting that $4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{12}$ and $6^7 = 2^7 \\cdot 3^7$. \n\nTherefore, we can rewrite n as $n = 2^{4+12+7} \\cdot 3^{5+7}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $n = 2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$. \n\nTo find the number of natural number factors of n, we can use the formula for the number of factors of a number given its prime factorization. \n\nIn general, if a number is expressed as $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are distinct prime factors and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ are their respective exponents, then the number of factors of this number is given by $(a_1 + 1) \\cdot (a_2 + 1) \\cdot ... \\cdot (a_k + 1)$. \n\nTherefore, for n = $2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$, the number of factors of n is $(23+1) \\cdot (12+1) = 24 \\cdot 13 = 312$. \n\nHence, n has 312 natural number factors.",
