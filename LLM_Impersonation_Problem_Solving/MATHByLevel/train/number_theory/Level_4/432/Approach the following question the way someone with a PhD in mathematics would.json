    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. How many three-digit perfect squares are palindromes?",
    "solution": "The possible units digits of a perfect square are 0 ($0^2$), 1 ($1^2$, $9^2$), 4 ($2^2$, $8^2$), 9 ($3^2$, $7^2$), 6 ($4^2$, $6^2$), and 5 ($5^2$). Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0. The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ perfect squares that are palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to consider the form of a three-digit perfect square. Let's denote the three-digit perfect square as \\(n^2\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer. The smallest three-digit perfect square is 100 and the largest is 316. Therefore, we need to find all palindromes within the range of 100 to 316.\n\nLet's denote a generic three-digit palindrome as \\(aba\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits. Since it is a palindrome, it reads the same forward and backward. This implies that the first digit and the last digit are the same, which means \\(a\\) can be any of the digits from 1 to 9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit perfect squares that are palindromes is equal to the number of different choices for \\(a\\). Since each digit from 1 to 9 can be used for \\(a\\), there are a total of 9 choices. \n\nHence, the number of three-digit perfect squares that are palindromes is 9.",
