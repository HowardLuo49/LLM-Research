    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. How many three-digit perfect squares are palindromes?",
    "solution": "The possible units digits of a perfect square are 0 ($0^2$), 1 ($1^2$, $9^2$), 4 ($2^2$, $8^2$), 9 ($3^2$, $7^2$), 6 ($4^2$, $6^2$), and 5 ($5^2$). Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0. The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ perfect squares that are palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, I know that a three-digit perfect square is a number between 100 and 999 that is the square of a whole number. So, I need to find all the three-digit perfect squares that are also palindromes. Let me start by squaring the smallest three-digit number (10) and see if it's a palindrome. The square of 10 is 100, which is a palindrome! So, I know that 100 is a three-digit perfect square that is also a palindrome. Now, I need to keep squaring numbers between 10 and 31 (the square root of 999, the largest three-digit number) to see if any others are palindromes.
