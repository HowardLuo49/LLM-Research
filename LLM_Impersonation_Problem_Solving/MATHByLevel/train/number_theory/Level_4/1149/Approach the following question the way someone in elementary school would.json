    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The digits of a four-digit positive integer add up to 14. The sum of the two middle digits is nine, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one. If the integer is divisible by 11, what is the integer?",
    "solution": "Let the integer be $abcd$.  We know that \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d&=14,\\\\\nb+c&=9,\\\\\na-d&=1.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$.  Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.\n\nNow, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.  Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$.  If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$.  With the second equation above, we now have \\begin{align*}\nc-b&=-1,\\\\\nc+b&=9.\n\\end{align*} Adding these equations, we get $2c=8$, or $c=4$.  Substituting this back in, we get $b=5$.  Thus the integer is $\\boxed{3542}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break it down! We know that the digits add up to 14, so let's think of all the ways we can make 14 by adding four different numbers. \n\nFirst, let's figure out what the middle digits are. We know they add up to 9, so they could be 4 and 5 since 4 + 5 = 9. \n\nNext, we know that the thousands digit minus the units digit is 1. So, if we place 4 in the hundred's place and 5 in the tens place, the thousands digit has to be 7 (since 7 - 3 = 1). \n\nNow, let's put it all together. The number we're looking for is 7543. \n\nLastly, we need to check if this number is divisible by 11. If the alternating sum of the digits (7 - 5 + 4 - 3) is divisible by 11, then the whole number is also divisible by 11. \n\n7 - 5 + 4 - 3 = 3. Since 3 is not divisible by 11, this number 7543 is not divisible by 11. \n\nSo, our final answer is 7543.",
