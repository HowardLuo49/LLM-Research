    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The digits of a four-digit positive integer add up to 14. The sum of the two middle digits is nine, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one. If the integer is divisible by 11, what is the integer?",
    "solution": "Let the integer be $abcd$.  We know that \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d&=14,\\\\\nb+c&=9,\\\\\na-d&=1.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$.  Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.\n\nNow, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.  Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$.  If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$.  With the second equation above, we now have \\begin{align*}\nc-b&=-1,\\\\\nc+b&=9.\n\\end{align*} Adding these equations, we get $2c=8$, or $c=4$.  Substituting this back in, we get $b=5$.  Thus the integer is $\\boxed{3542}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see...we know that our number has four digits and the digits add up to 14. That's a lot of numbers to add together! But we can remember that the sum of the two middle digits is nine and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one. \n\nSo let's start by thinking about what our number could be. We know it's divisible by 11, so it must be a multiple of 11. \n\nHmm...let's try some numbers and see what works. How about starting with 1100? That adds up to 2, but that's not 14. Let's try another one...how about 2200? That adds up to 4, still not 14. Let's keep trying.\n\nWhat about 3300? That adds up to 6, still not 14. Let's keep going...\n\n4400? No, that's still not right. 5500? Nope. 6600? Almost there! That adds up to 12, and the middle digits add up to 9, but the thousands digit minus the units digit is not one.\n\nLet's try 7710...yes! That works! The digits add up to 15, the middle digits add up to 9, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one. And it's divisible by 11! \n\nSo our four-digit number is 7710.
