    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are integers such that   $$3b = 8 - 2a.$$How many of the first six positive integers must be divisors of $2b + 12$?",
    "solution": "Note that it is possible that $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, since $3\\cdot 2 = 8 - 2 \\cdot 1$. Then $2b + 12 = 16$. Since $3,$ $5,$ and $6,$ are not factors of $16$, it is not true that these numbers must be divisors of $2b + 12.$\n\nIt only remains to check whether $1$, $2$, and $4$ must be divisors of $2b + 12$. The distributive property gives us   $$8 - 2a = 2 \\cdot 4 - 2a = 2(4 -a),$$so $2$ is a factor of $3b$. Note that   $$b = 3b - 2b,$$so since $2$ is a factor of $3b$ and $2$ is a factor of $2b,$ $2$ must be a factor of $b.$ So we can say $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$. Substituting gives us    \\begin{align*}\n2b + 12 &= 2(2n) + 12\\\\\n&= 4n + 4 \\cdot 3\\\\\n&= 4(n + 3),\n\\end{align*}so $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$. Since $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $4$ and $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$, it must be true that $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $2b + 12$. So our final answer is $\\boxed{3}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first manipulate the given equation to find a relationship between $b$ and $a$. \n\nGiven: \n$$3b = 8 - 2a$$\n\nRearranging, we get:\n$$2a = 8 - 3b$$\n$$2a = 2(4) - 3b$$\n$$2a = 2(4) - 3b$$\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n$$a = 4 - \\frac{3b}{2}$$\n\nThus, $a$ is an integer if and only if $3b$ is even. This implies that $b$ must be even, as well.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $2b + 12$. Since $b$ is even, $2b$ is also even. Adding 12 to an even number results in an even number. Therefore, $2b + 12$ is always even.\n\nThe divisors of an even number are also even numbers. Thus, to determine how many of the first six positive integers are divisors of $2b + 12$, we need to find the number of even integers among the first six positive integers.\n\nAmong the first six positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, only integers 2, 4, and 6 are even. Therefore, three of the six positive integers must be divisors of $2b + 12$. \n\nIn conclusion, three of the first six positive integers must be divisors of $2b + 12$.",
