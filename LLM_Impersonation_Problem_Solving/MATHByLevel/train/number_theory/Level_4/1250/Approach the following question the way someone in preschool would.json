    "solution": "Reducing each factor modulo 19 first, we see that $2001 \\cdot 2002 \\cdot 2003 \\cdot 2004 \\cdot 2005 \\equiv 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 \\equiv 30240 \\equiv \\boxed{11} \\pmod{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together to find the remainder! 2005 divided by 19 is 105 with a remainder of 10. So let's keep that 10 and multiply it by 2004. 2004 divided by 19 is 105 with a remainder of 9. So let's keep that 9 and multiply it by 2003. 2003 divided by 19 is 105 with a remainder of 8. Let's keep that 8 and multiply it by 2002. 2002 divided by 19 is 105 with a remainder of 7. So let's keep that 7 and multiply it by 2001. 2001 divided by 19 is 105 with a remainder of 6. Now let's multiply that by the remainder we had from before, which is 10. 6 times 10 is 60. So the remainder when we divide $2001 \\cdot 2002 \\cdot 2003 \\cdot 2004 \\cdot 2005$ by 19 is 60. Yay, we did it!",
