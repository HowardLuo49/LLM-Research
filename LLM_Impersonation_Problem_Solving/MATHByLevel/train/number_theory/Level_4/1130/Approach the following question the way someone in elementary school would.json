    "solution": "Any factor of $8000=2^6\\cdot5^3$ is in the form $2^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le3$. To count the number of perfect square factors, we must count the factors of $2^6\\cdot5^3$ that have $a=0$, $2$, $4$ or $6$ and $b=0$ or $2$. This gives $4\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ perfect square factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many factors of 8000 are perfect squares, first let's figure out how many factors 8000 has. \n\n8000 can be written as 2^6 * 5^3. To find out the number of factors, we add 1 to each of the exponents and then multiply them together: (6+1)(3+1) = 7 * 4 = 28. \n\nNow, let's see how many of these factors are perfect squares. We see that the exponents must be even for a number to be a perfect square. Out of the 28 factors, 3 of them have odd exponents (when either the 2 or the 5 has an odd exponent). \n\nSo, there are 28 - 3 = 25 factors of 8000 that are perfect squares. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 25 factors of 8000 are perfect squares!",
