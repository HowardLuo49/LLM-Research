    "solution": "Any factor of $8000=2^6\\cdot5^3$ is in the form $2^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le3$. To count the number of perfect square factors, we must count the factors of $2^6\\cdot5^3$ that have $a=0$, $2$, $4$ or $6$ and $b=0$ or $2$. This gives $4\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ perfect square factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the factors of 8000, we first decompose 8000 into its prime factorization: 8000 = 2^6 * 5^3. \n\nTo determine the number of factors, we use a method called the exponent counting method. We add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiply these quantities together. \n\nIn this case, we have (6+1) * (3+1) = 7 * 4 = 28 factors of 8000.\n\nFor a factor to be a perfect square, the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. This means we need to count the number of factors that have even exponents of 2 and 5.\n\nFor the factor to be a perfect square, each prime factor must appear an even number of times in the factorization. This can be achieved by choosing one of the possible exponents for each prime factor (0, 2, 4, 6 for 2 and 0, 2 for 5). \n\nFor the prime factor 2, we have 4 choices (0, 2, 4, 6). For the prime factor 5, we have 2 choices (0, 2). \n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of 8000 that are perfect squares is 4 * 2 = 8.",
