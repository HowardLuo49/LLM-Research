    "solution": "Any factor of $8000=2^6\\cdot5^3$ is in the form $2^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le3$. To count the number of perfect square factors, we must count the factors of $2^6\\cdot5^3$ that have $a=0$, $2$, $4$ or $6$ and $b=0$ or $2$. This gives $4\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ perfect square factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of 8000 that are perfect squares, we first need to find the prime factorization of 8000. \n\n8000 = 2^4 * 5^3\n\nA perfect square factor will have all of its prime factors raised to even powers. In this case, the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 8000 will be in the form 2^a * 5^b where both a and b are even numbers.\n\nTo find the number of perfect square factors, we need to consider all possible combinations of even powers of 2 and 5 that are less than or equal to the exponents in the prime factorization of 8000. \n\nFor the factor of 2, we can have 2^0, 2^2, and 2^4. \nFor the factor of 5, we can have 5^0 and 5^2.\n\nSo, the perfect square factors of 8000 are:\n2^0 * 5^0 = 1\n2^2 * 5^0 = 4\n2^4 * 5^0 = 16\n2^0 * 5^2 = 25\n2^2 * 5^2 = 100\n2^4 * 5^2 = 400\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 6 perfect square factors of 8000.",
