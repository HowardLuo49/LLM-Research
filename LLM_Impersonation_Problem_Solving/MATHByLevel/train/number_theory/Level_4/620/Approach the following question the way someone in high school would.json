    "solution": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest base $b$ such that 62 can be expressed as a three-digit number in base $b$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the largest power of $b$ that is less than or equal to 62. Since $b^4 = 16^2 = 256$ is greater than 62, we know that we can represent 62 using at most 3 digits in base $b$.\n\nNext, we need to find the largest $b$ such that $b^2$ does not exceed 62. We see that $7^2 = 49$ is less than 62, but $8^2 = 64$ is greater than 62. Therefore, the base $b$ must be at least 8.\n\nBy trying out different bases, we see that 8 is the smallest base that can represent 62 using only three digits as $62 = 76_{8}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits is $b = 8$.",
