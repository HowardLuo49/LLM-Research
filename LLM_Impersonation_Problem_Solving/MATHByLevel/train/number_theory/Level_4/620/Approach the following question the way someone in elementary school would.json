    "solution": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the smallest whole number $b$ where we can write 62 with only three digits, we need to think about the highest value each digit can be. Since the largest digit in a base $b$ system is $b-1$, the highest value we can have for a 3-digit number in base $b$ is $(b-1)(b^2) + (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^3 - b^2 + b^2 - b + b - 1 = b^3 - 1$. \n\nThis means that $b^3 - 1 \\ge 62$. To find the smallest whole number $b$ that satisfies this inequality, we can try different values of $b$ starting from 2. \n\n$2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$ which is too small. \n$3^3 - 1 = 27 - 1 = 26$ which is also too small. \n$4^3 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63$ which is just barely too big. \n\nTherefore, the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits is $\\boxed{4}$.",
