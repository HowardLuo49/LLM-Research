    "solution": "Noticing that $190\\equiv0\\pmod{19}$ and $-200+190=-10$, we can say that  \\[-200\\equiv n\\pmod{19}\\]if and only if  \\[-10\\equiv n\\pmod{19}.\\]This is not in the range $0\\leq n<19$, but adding 19 again gives \\[9\\equiv n\\pmod{19}.\\]The answer is $n=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ that satisfies $0\\le n < 19$ and $-200 \\equiv n \\pmod{19}$, we can start by finding the remainder when $-200$ is divided by $19$. \n\nWhen we divide $-200$ by $19$, we get a quotient of $-10$ and a remainder of $9$.
