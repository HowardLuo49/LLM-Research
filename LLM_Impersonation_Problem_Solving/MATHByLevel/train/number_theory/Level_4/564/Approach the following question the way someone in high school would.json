    "solution": "Since $x-3$ is a multiple of $7$, we know that $x\\equiv 3\\pmod 7$.\n\nSince $y+3$ is a multiple of $7$, we know that $y\\equiv -3\\pmod 7$.\n\nTherefore, \\begin{align*}\nx^2+xy+y^2+n &\\equiv (3)^2 + (3)(-3) + (-3)^2 + n \\\\\n&\\equiv 9 - 9 + 9 + n \\\\\n&\\equiv 9 + n \\qquad\\pmod 7.\n\\end{align*}In other words, $9+n$ is a multiple of $7$.
