    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. How many prime numbers between 30 and 65 have a prime remainder when divided by 10?",
    "solution": "If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite.  Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\\boxed{4}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count together! First, let's look at the numbers between 30 and 65: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65.\n\nNow let's see which of these numbers are prime. A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and can only be divided by itself and 1. Let's pick out the prime numbers: 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61.\n\nNow lets divide them by 10. When we divide these prime numbers by 10, do we get a prime number as a remainder? \n\nLet's try it out!\n\n31 divided by 10 is 3 with a remainder of 1 (which is a prime number)\n37 divided by 10 is 3 with a remainder of 7 (which is also a prime number)\n41 divided by 10 is 4 with a remainder of 1 (which is a prime number)\n43 divided by 10 is 4 with a remainder of 3 (which is not a prime number)\n47 divided by 10 is 4 with a remainder of 7 (which is a prime number)\n53 divided by 10 is 5 with a remainder of 3 (which is not a prime number)\n59 divided by 10 is 5 with a remainder of 9 (which is not a prime number)\n61 divided by 10 is 6 with a remainder of 1 (which is a prime number)\n\nSo, out of the prime numbers between 30 and 65, 31, 37, 41, 47, and 61 have a prime remainder when divided by 10! Yay! Good job counting with me!",
