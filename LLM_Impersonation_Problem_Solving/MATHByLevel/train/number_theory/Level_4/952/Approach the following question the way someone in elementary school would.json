    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many prime numbers between 30 and 65 have a prime remainder when divided by 10?",
    "solution": "If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite.  Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\\boxed{4}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the prime numbers between 30 and 65, let's list out the numbers between 30 and 65: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65. \n\nNow, let's find which of these numbers are prime. A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving a remainder. \n\nFrom the list, we see that the prime numbers between 30 and 65 are: 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61. \n\nNext, we need to check which of these prime numbers, when divided by 10, have a prime remainder. When we divide 31 by 10, we get a remainder of 1, which is a prime number. When we divide 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61 by 10, we get remainders of 7, 1, 3, 7, 3, 9, 1. None of these remainders are prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, the only prime number between 30 and 65 that has a prime remainder when divided by 10 is 31.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4?: To find the prime numbers between 30 and 65, let's list out the numbers between 30 and 65: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65. \n\nNow, let's find which of these numbers are prime.
