    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many prime numbers between 30 and 65 have a prime remainder when divided by 10?",
    "solution": "If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite.  Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\\boxed{4}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the prime numbers between 30 and 65 that have a prime remainder when divided by 10, we must first identify the prime numbers within that range. The prime numbers between 30 and 65 are 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, and 61.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these prime numbers have a prime remainder when divided by 10. To do this, we calculate the remainder of each prime number when divided by 10:\n\n31 mod 10 = 1\n37 mod 10 = 7\n41 mod 10 = 1\n43 mod 10 = 3\n47 mod 10 = 7\n53 mod 10 = 3\n59 mod 10 = 9\n61 mod 10 = 1\n\nAmong the prime numbers between 30 and 65, the prime numbers that have a prime remainder when divided by 10 are 31, 41, and 61. Thus, there are 3 prime numbers between 30 and 65 that have a prime remainder when divided by 10.",
