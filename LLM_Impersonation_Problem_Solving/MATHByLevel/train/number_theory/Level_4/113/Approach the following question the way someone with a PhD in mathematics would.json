    "solution": "Both $m$ and $n$ can be written in the form $11k+5$. For $m$, we have that $11k+5 \\ge 100$, so $k \\ge \\frac{95}{11}$, so since $k$ must be an integer, we have that $k = 9$, so $m = 11(9) + 5 = 104$. For $n$, we have that $11l+5 \\ge 1000$, so $l \\ge \\frac{995}{11}$, so since $l$ must be an integer, we have that $l = 91$, so $n = 11(91) + 5 = 1006$. Therefore, $n-m = 1006 - 104 = \\boxed{902}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive, three-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11), we first note that 5 is less than 11, so the smallest positive integer congruent to 5 (mod 11) is simply 5 itself. Thus, $m = 5$.\n\nNext, to find the smallest positive, four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11), we need to determine the next integer greater than 5 that is divisible by 11. This integer will be 11 * 1 + 5 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive, four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11) is 16. Thus, $n = 16$.\n\nFinally, we can find $n - m$ by subtracting $m$ from $n$:\n$16 - 5 = 11$\n\nTherefore, $n - m = 11$.",
