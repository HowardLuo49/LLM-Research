    "solution": "Both $m$ and $n$ can be written in the form $11k+5$. For $m$, we have that $11k+5 \\ge 100$, so $k \\ge \\frac{95}{11}$, so since $k$ must be an integer, we have that $k = 9$, so $m = 11(9) + 5 = 104$. For $n$, we have that $11l+5 \\ge 1000$, so $l \\ge \\frac{995}{11}$, so since $l$ must be an integer, we have that $l = 91$, so $n = 11(91) + 5 = 1006$. Therefore, $n-m = 1006 - 104 = \\boxed{902}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this down. We need to find the smallest three-digit and four-digit integers that when divided by 11 leave a remainder of 5. \n\nTo find the smallest three-digit integer that satisfies this, we can start with 100 and keep adding multiples of 11 until we find one that leaves a remainder of 5. We can see that 105 satisfies this condition, so $m = 105$. \n\nNext, we need to find the smallest four-digit integer that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 11. We can start with 1000 and do the same process as before. We find that 1001 satisfies this condition, so $n = 1001$. \n\nFinally, to find $n-m$, we just need to subtract $m$ from $n$, so $n-m = 1001 - 105 = \\boxed{896}$.",
