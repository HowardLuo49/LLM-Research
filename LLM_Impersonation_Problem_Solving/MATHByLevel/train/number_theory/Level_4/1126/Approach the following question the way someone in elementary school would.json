    "solution": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue of $-811$ modulo $24$, we can first calculate $811 \\div 24 = 33$ with a remainder of $-17$. Since we want a positive residue, we can add $24$ to $-17$ to get $7$. Therefore, the residue of $-811$ modulo $24$ is $7$.",
