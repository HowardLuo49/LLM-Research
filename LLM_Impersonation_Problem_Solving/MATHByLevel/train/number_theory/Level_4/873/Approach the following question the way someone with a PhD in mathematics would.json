    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. To express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$. If 1562 were expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 1562 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 1562 is $2^{10}=1024$.  The difference between 1024 and 1562 is $538$. The largest power of 2 less than 538 is $2^9=512$.  The difference between 538 and 512 is 26.  The largest power of 2 less than 26 is $2^4=16$, which leaves us with $26-16=10$. Continuing the process, we get $2^3=8$ and $2^1=2$. So, we have found that $1562=2^{10}+2^9+2^4+2^3+2^1$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{27}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, we need to find the largest powers of 2 that can sum up to 1562. The largest power of 2 less than 1562 is 2^10 = 1024. Subtracting 1024 from 1562 leaves us with 538. The largest power of 2 less than 538 is 2^9 = 512. Subtracting 512 from 538 leaves us with 26. The largest power of 2 less than 26 is 2^4 = 16. Subtracting 16 from 26 leaves us with 10. The largest power of 2 less than 10 is 2^3 = 8. Subtracting 8 from 10 leaves us with 2. The largest power of 2 less than 2 is 2^1 = 2. Subtracting 2 from 2 leaves us with 0.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the exponents of these powers is 10 + 9 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 27. Thus, the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers when expressing 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of 2 is 27.",
