    "solution": "Subtract 4609 from both sides of the congruence to obtain $x\\equiv -2505\\pmod{12}$. By dividing 2505 by 12, we find that the least integer $k$ for which $-2505+12k>0$ is $k=209$. Adding $12\\cdot 209$ to $-2505$, we find that $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{12}$. Thus $\\boxed{3}$ is the least integer satisfying the given congruence.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer $x$ that satisfies $x+4609 \\equiv 2104 \\pmod{12}$, we can start by subtracting 4609 from both sides of the congruence to isolate $x$. This gives us $x \\equiv 2104-4609 \\pmod{12}$. Simplifying further, we get $x \\equiv -2505 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nNext, we want to find an equivalent positive residue for $-2505 \\pmod{12}$. Since $-2505 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{12}$, the least positive integer $x$ that satisfies the congruence is $\\boxed{3}$.",
