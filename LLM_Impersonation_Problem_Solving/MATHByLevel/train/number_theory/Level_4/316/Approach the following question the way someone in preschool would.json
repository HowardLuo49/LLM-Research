    "solution": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find a palindrome, we need to add the same number to the beginning of 40,305 as it is at the end. So we can start by trying to add the number 3 to the beginning of 40,305 to make it a palindrome. This would give us 340,305. But that's not a palindrome because the last digit is not the same as the first. So we can try adding another 3 to the beginning, giving us 303,305. But that's still not a palindrome. And if we keep adding 3's to the beginning, we'll never get a palindrome.\n\nSo let's try adding a different number to 40,305. Let's try adding the number 9 to the beginning of 40,305 to make 9,403,305. And wow! That is a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward. So the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is 9.",
