    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward. For example, 343 and 1221 are palindromes. What is the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome?",
    "solution": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So to find the least number we need to add to 40,305 to make it a palindrome, we can start by checking if 40,305 is already a palindrome. It's not because it reads differently from left to right (40,305).\n\nNext, we can try adding numbers to 40,305 and checking if the result is a palindrome. We can start by adding 1 to 40,305 to get 40,306. But that's not a palindrome either.\n\nWe can continue this process and try adding 2 to 40,305 to get 40,307. But that's still not a palindrome.\n\nWe can keep trying different numbers until we finally find a number that, when added to 40,305, creates a palindrome. This might take a while, so let's keep trying different numbers until we find the answer!",
