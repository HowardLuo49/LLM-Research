To test whether an integer, $n$, is prime, it is enough to be sure that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$. If you want to check that a number between 900 and 950 is prime with this rule, what is the largest prime divisor you need to test?",
    "solution": "You need to test the primes less than a number between $\\sqrt{900}=30$ and $\\sqrt{950}<31$, so the largest prime divisor you need to test is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To check if a number between 900 and 950 is a special kind of number called prime, we just need to divide it by some other special numbers called primes. We have to make sure that none of the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of our number can divide it evenly.\n\nSo, if we want to check if a number between 900 and 950 is prime, we need to find the largest prime number that is less than or equal to the square root of our number. The square root of 950 is about 30.82, so we need to find the largest prime number less than or equal to 30.\n\nThe largest prime number less than or equal to 30 is 29. So if we want to check if a number between 900 and 950 is prime, we just need to divide it by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 to see if any of those numbers can divide it evenly. If none of them can, then our number is prime! Yay! \ud83c\udf89",
