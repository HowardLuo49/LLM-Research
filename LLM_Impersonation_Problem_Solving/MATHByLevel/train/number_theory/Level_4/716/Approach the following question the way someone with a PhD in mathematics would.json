To test whether an integer, $n$, is prime, it is enough to be sure that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$. If you want to check that a number between 900 and 950 is prime with this rule, what is the largest prime divisor you need to test?",
    "solution": "You need to test the primes less than a number between $\\sqrt{900}=30$ and $\\sqrt{950}<31$, so the largest prime divisor you need to test is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest prime divisor we need to test for a number between 900 and 950, we first find the square root of the largest number in the range:\n\n\u221a950 \u2248 30.82\n\nTherefore, the largest prime divisor we need to test is the largest prime less than or equal to 30, which is 29.",
