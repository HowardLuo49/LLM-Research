If she buys $5$ more, she will have a multiple of $8$. If she loses $8$, she will have a multiple of $5$. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by the congruences \\begin{align*}n+5\\equiv 0\\pmod 8 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 8,\\\\n-8\\equiv 0\\pmod 5 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.\\end{align*}Since $\\gcd(5,8)=1$, the above congruences imply $n\\equiv 3\\pmod{40}$. This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$. The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$. Thus $\\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits.",

Alicia has $n$ candies.\n2. If she buys $5$ more, she will have $n + 5$ candies, which is a multiple of $8$. This means $n + 5$ is divisible by $8$.\n3.

This means $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nFrom condition 3, we have $n - 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.
