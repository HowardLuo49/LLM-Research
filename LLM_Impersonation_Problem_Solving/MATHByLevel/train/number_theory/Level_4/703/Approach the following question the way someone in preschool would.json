    "solution": "To solve this question we need to think about what the units digit of a prime number could be. A two-digit prime could end in 1, 3, 7 or 9; thus, we need to examine primes only in the 10s, 30s, 70s and 90s because when the digits are switched the tens digit will become the units digit. The primes greater than 12 but less than 99 that are still prime when their two digits are interchanged are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79 and 97. Their sum is $\\boxed{418}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find the two-digit prime numbers that are greater than 12 but less than 99 first. Do you know how to count in two-digit numbers? Good job! Let's start with 13 and go all the way up to 97. \n\nNow, let's find which of these numbers are still prime when we switch their two digits. Do you know what switching means? It's like if we have the number 23, switching would make it 32. Let's see which numbers stay prime when we switch their digits.\n\nWe found that there are three numbers that are still prime when their digits are switched: 13, 17, and 79. \n\nNow, do you remember what we need to do next to find the sum of these three numbers? That's right, we need to add them together! Can you tell me what the sum of 13, 17, and 79 is?",
