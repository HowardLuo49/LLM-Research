    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the sum of all of the two-digit primes that are greater than 12 but less than 99 and are still prime when their two digits are interchanged?",
    "solution": "To solve this question we need to think about what the units digit of a prime number could be. A two-digit prime could end in 1, 3, 7 or 9; thus, we need to examine primes only in the 10s, 30s, 70s and 90s because when the digits are switched the tens digit will become the units digit. The primes greater than 12 but less than 99 that are still prime when their two digits are interchanged are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79 and 97. Their sum is $\\boxed{418}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, this one is a little tricky but let's break it down! First, we need to find all the two-digit prime numbers between 12 and 99. That means we're looking for prime numbers like 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and so on.\n\nNext, we need to check if these numbers are still prime when we swap their two digits. For example, if we swap the digits in 13, we get 31, and that's also a prime number. But if we swap the digits in 29, we get 92, and that's not a prime number.\n\nSo, we need to find all the two-digit prime numbers that stay prime when we swap their digits. Once we have that list, we can add them all up to find the sum of all these special prime numbers.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you find the answer.",
