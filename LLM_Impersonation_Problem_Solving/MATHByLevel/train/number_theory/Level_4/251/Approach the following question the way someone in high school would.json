    "solution": "If $3x+7\\equiv 2\\pmod{16}$, then $$6\\cdot (3x+7) \\equiv 6\\cdot 2\\pmod{16}.$$Expanding out the right side, we have $$18x + 42 \\equiv 12\\pmod{16}.$$Reducing coefficients modulo $16$, we have $$2x + 10 \\equiv 12\\pmod{16}.$$Finally, adding $1$ to both sides, we get $$2x + 11 \\equiv \\boxed{13}\\pmod{16}.$$(It's good to notice a couple of things about this solution. For one thing, why did we multiply by $6$ at the beginning? The idea is to get a $2x$ term on the left, since our goal is to compute the residue of $2x+11$. Another thing to notice is that one step in this process is not reversible. If the goal in this problem had been to solve for $x$, then it would appear from our final result that $x=1$ is a solution, yet $x=1$ doesn't actually satisfy $3x+7\\equiv 2\\pmod{16}$. Why not? At what step did we introduce this bogus solution?)",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's simplify the congruence $3x+7\\equiv 2\\pmod{16}$. We can solve this by subtracting $7$ from both sides to get $3x\\equiv -5\\pmod{16}$. \n\nNext, we need to find the modular inverse of $3$ modulo $16$. The modular inverse of $a$ modulo $m$ is the number $b$ such that $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$. In this case, the modular inverse of $3$ modulo $16$ is $11$ since $3\\cdot 11\\equiv 1\\pmod{16}$.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $3x\\equiv -5\\pmod{16}$ by $11$ to get $x\\equiv -5\\cdot 11\\pmod{16}$ which simplifies to $x\\equiv 9\\pmod{16}$.\n\nFinally, we can substitute $x\\equiv 9\\pmod{16}$ into the expression $2x+11$ to find the value of the expression modulo $16$.
