    "solution": "We notice that $450=221+229,$ so that must be the connection.  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us  \\[60^2+221^2=229^2\\] so \\[229^2-221^2=60^2.\\] The difference of squares factorization tells us  \\[(229-221)(229+221)=3600\\] and taken modulo 3599 we get  \\[8\\cdot450\\equiv1\\pmod{3599}.\\] The answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
