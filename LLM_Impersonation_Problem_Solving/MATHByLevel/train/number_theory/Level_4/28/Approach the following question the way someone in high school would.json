    "solution": "We notice that $450=221+229,$ so that must be the connection.  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us  \\[60^2+221^2=229^2\\] so \\[229^2-221^2=60^2.\\] The difference of squares factorization tells us  \\[(229-221)(229+221)=3600\\] and taken modulo 3599 we get  \\[8\\cdot450\\equiv1\\pmod{3599}.\\] The answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the multiplicative inverse to 450 modulo 3599, we need to solve the equation $450n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3599}$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding $n$ such that $450n = 1 + 3599k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite this as $450n - 3599k = 1$.\n\nThis looks like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which we learned in math class.
