    "solution": "We can ignore the $0$ digit for now, and find the product of $24_7 \\times 3_7$. First, we need to multiply the units digit: $4_7 \\times 3_7 = 12_{10} = 15_7$. Hence, we write down a $5$ and carry-over the $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $2_7 \\times 3_7 + 1_7 = 7_{10} = 10_{7}$. Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and $1$ is carried over. Writing this out:  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & & \\stackrel{1}{2} & \\stackrel{}{4}_7 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 3_7 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & & 1 & 0 & 5_7 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$ We can ignore the $0$ in $30_7$, since it does not contribute to the sum. Thus, the answer is $1+0+5 = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nNotice that the base seven sum of the digits of a number leaves the same remainder upon division by $6$ as the number itself.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of $24_7$ and $30_7$, we can first change them to base ten. \n\n$24_7$ in base ten is $2*7^1 + 4*7^0 = 14 + 4 = 18$. \n\n$30_7$ in base ten is $3*7^1 + 0*7^0 = 21 + 0 = 21$. \n\nNow we can multiply these two numbers in base ten: $18 * 21 = 378$. \n\nNext, we need to convert 378 back to base seven. \n\n$378 \\div 7 = 54 R0$. \n$54 \\div 7 = 7 R5$. \n$7 \\div 7 = 1 R0$. \n$1 \\div 7 = 0 R1$. \n\nSo, 378 in base seven is $1050_7$. \n\nNow we need to find the sum of the digits: $1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6$. \n\nTherefore, the base seven sum of the digits of the product of $24_7$ and $30_7$ is $6$.",
