    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The prime numbers are added in order starting with $2$: $2$, $2 + 3$, $2 + 3 + 5$, and so on. How many of the first 12 such sums are also prime?",
    "solution": "Approach this problem systematically: 2 is prime, 2+3=5 is prime, 5+5=10 is composite, 10+7=17 is prime, 17+11=28 is composite, 28+13=41 is prime, 41+17=58 is composite, 58+19=77 is composite, 77+23=100 is composite, 100+29=129 is composite, 129+31=160 is composite, and finally 160+37=197 is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{5}$ of the first 12 such sums are prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see how many of the sums are prime by counting them one by one. \n\nFirst, we start with $2$ which is a prime number. So, our first sum is prime. \n\nNext, we add $3$ to $2$ to get $5$, which is also a prime number. So, our second sum is prime too. \n\nNow, we add $5$ to $5$ to get $10$, which is not a prime number. So, our third sum is not prime. \n\nWe continue adding prime numbers in order to get the next sums, checking if they are prime or not. \n\nBy counting like this, we can figure out how many of the first 12 sums are also prime.",
