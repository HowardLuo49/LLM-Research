    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The prime numbers are added in order starting with $2$: $2$, $2 + 3$, $2 + 3 + 5$, and so on. How many of the first 12 such sums are also prime?",
    "solution": "Approach this problem systematically: 2 is prime, 2+3=5 is prime, 5+5=10 is composite, 10+7=17 is prime, 17+11=28 is composite, 28+13=41 is prime, 41+17=58 is composite, 58+19=77 is composite, 77+23=100 is composite, 100+29=129 is composite, 129+31=160 is composite, and finally 160+37=197 is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{5}$ of the first 12 such sums are prime.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many of these sums are prime, let's first calculate the sums. \n\nThe first sum is just $2$, which is prime. \nThe second sum is $2+3=5$, which is also prime. \nThe third sum is $2+3+5=10$, which is not prime. \nThe fourth sum is $2+3+5+7=17$, which is prime. \nThe fifth sum is $2+3+5+7+11=28$, which is not prime. \nThe sixth sum is $2+3+5+7+11+13=41$, which is prime. \nThe seventh sum is $2+3+5+7+11+13+17=58$, which is not prime. \nThe eighth sum is $2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19=77$, which is not prime. \nThe ninth sum is $2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23=100$, which is not prime. \nThe tenth sum is $2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29=151$, which is prime. \nThe eleventh sum is $2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29+31=182$, which is not prime. \nThe twelfth sum is $2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+29+31+37=219$, which is not prime. \n\nSo out of the first 12 sums of prime numbers added in order, 5 of them are also prime.",
