    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The prime numbers are added in order starting with $2$: $2$, $2 + 3$, $2 + 3 + 5$, and so on. How many of the first 12 such sums are also prime?",
    "solution": "Approach this problem systematically: 2 is prime, 2+3=5 is prime, 5+5=10 is composite, 10+7=17 is prime, 17+11=28 is composite, 28+13=41 is prime, 41+17=58 is composite, 58+19=77 is composite, 77+23=100 is composite, 100+29=129 is composite, 129+31=160 is composite, and finally 160+37=197 is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{5}$ of the first 12 such sums are prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find out how many of the sums of prime numbers in order are also prime. Let's go step by step:\n\n1. The first sum is $2$, which is a prime number.\n2. The second sum is $2 + 3 = 5$, which is also a prime number.\n3. The third sum is $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$, which is not a prime number.\n4. The fourth sum is $2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17$, which is a prime number.\n\nSo out of the first 4 sums, 3 of them are prime numbers.
