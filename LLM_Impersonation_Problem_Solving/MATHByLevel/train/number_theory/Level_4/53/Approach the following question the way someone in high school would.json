    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Jenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so Jenny used to have 8 stamp books with 42 pages each, and each page had 6 stamps. That means she had a total of 8 x 42 x 6 = 2016 stamps in all her books before reorganizing them.\n\nNow she wants to have each page contain 10 stamps instead of 6. So, in 4 of her books, with 42 pages each, she would have 4 x 42 x 10 = 1680 stamps.\n\nThat means she would have 2016 - 1680 = 336 stamps remaining to fill up.\n\nHer fifth book has 33 pages filled with 10 stamps each, which is 33 x 10 = 330 stamps.\n\nSo, the last page with the remaining stamps would have 336 - 330 = 6 stamps on it. \n\nTherefore, there are 6 stamps on that last page.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 6?: Ok, so Jenny used to have 8 stamp books with 42 pages each, and each page had 6 stamps.
