    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Jenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Jenny has 8 stamp books with 42 pages each. That means she has a total of 8 x 42 = 336 pages in her books.\n\nOn each page, there are 6 stamps. So, Jenny has a total of 336 x 6 = 2016 stamps in her books.\n\nWhen Jenny reorganizes her books to have 10 stamps per page, she will have a total of 336 x 10 = 3360 stamps in her books.\n\nJenny fills up 4 complete books with 42 pages each, which gives her 4 x 42 = 168 pages filled with 10 stamps each.\n\nThis means Jenny still has 3360 - 1680 = 1680 stamps left to put in her fifth book.\n\nHer fifth book has 33 pages that are filled with 10 stamps each, for a total of 33 x 10 = 330 stamps.\n\nThis leaves Jenny with 1680 - 330 = 1350 stamps left to put on the last page of her fifth book.\n\nSo, there are 1350 stamps on the last page of Jenny's fifth stamp book.",
