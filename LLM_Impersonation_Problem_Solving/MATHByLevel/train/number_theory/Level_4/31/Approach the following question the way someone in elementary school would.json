    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A school has between 150 and 200 students enrolled. Every afternoon, all the students come together to participate in gym class. The students are separated into six distinct sections of students. If one student is absent from school, the sections can all have the same number of students. What is the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school?",
    "solution": "If there are $s$ students, then $s-1$ must be divisible by 6. In other words, we want to find the sum of all values of $s$ for which $s-1\\equiv 0\\pmod{6}$. The multiples of 6 in the given range are 150, 156, ..., 198, so the possible values of $s$ are 151, 157, ..., 199. Recalling that the sum of an arithmetic series is  \\[\n\\frac{(\\text{first term}+\\text{last term})(\\text{number of terms})}{2},\n\\]we find that these integers sum to $(151+199)(9)/2=\\boxed{1575}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's think about this problem. We know that the number of students at the school is between 150 and 200. And we also know that the students are separated into six sections and if one student is absent, then the sections can all have the same number of students.\n\nSo, let's start by finding a number that is divisible by 6 (since there are 6 sections) and is between 150 and 200. The closest number to the middle of 150 and 200 that is divisible by 6 is 180 (6 x 30 = 180).\n\nNow, if one student is absent, the number of students per section would be 29 (180 divided by 6 equals 30, but if one student is absent, it would be 29).\n\nSo, the possible numbers of students enrolled at the school could be 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189 or 190.\n\nTo find the sum of all those numbers, we just add them all up: \n177 + 178 + 179 + 180 + 181 + 182 + 183 + 184 + 185 + 186 + 187 + 188 + 189 + 190 = 2559\n\nSo, the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school is 2559.",
