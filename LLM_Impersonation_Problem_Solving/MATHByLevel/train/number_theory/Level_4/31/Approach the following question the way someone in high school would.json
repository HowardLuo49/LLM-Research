    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A school has between 150 and 200 students enrolled. Every afternoon, all the students come together to participate in gym class. The students are separated into six distinct sections of students. If one student is absent from school, the sections can all have the same number of students. What is the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school?",
    "solution": "If there are $s$ students, then $s-1$ must be divisible by 6. In other words, we want to find the sum of all values of $s$ for which $s-1\\equiv 0\\pmod{6}$. The multiples of 6 in the given range are 150, 156, ..., 198, so the possible values of $s$ are 151, 157, ..., 199. Recalling that the sum of an arithmetic series is  \\[\n\\frac{(\\text{first term}+\\text{last term})(\\text{number of terms})}{2},\n\\]we find that these integers sum to $(151+199)(9)/2=\\boxed{1575}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. We know that there are between 150 and 200 students in the school. We also know that they are separated into six sections. \n\nIf one student is absent, then each section will have the same number of students. So that means, when all the students are present, they are evenly divided among the sections.\n\nTo find the sum of all possible numbers of students, we need to determine the factors of the number of students in the school. Since the number of students is between 150 and 200, we can consider the factors of these numbers to figure out the possible numbers of students.\n\nHere are the factors of the numbers between 150 and 200:\n- For 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150\n- For 151: 1, 151\n- For 152: 1, 2, 4, 8, 19, 38, 76, 152\n- For 153: 1, 3, 9, 17, 51, 153\n- For 154: 1, 2, 7, 11, 14, 22, 77, 154\n- ...\n- For 199: 1 and 199\n- For 200: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200\n\nWe are looking for the numbers that can be evenly divided by 6 (the number of sections). So we need to find the numbers that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 6.\n\nFrom the list of factors, the numbers that can be divided by 6 are: 150, 156, 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192, 198, and 200.\n\nTo find the sum of these numbers, we add them up:\n150 + 156 + 162 + 168 + 174 + 180 + 186 + 192 + 198 + 200 = 1676\n\nSo, the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school is 1676.",
