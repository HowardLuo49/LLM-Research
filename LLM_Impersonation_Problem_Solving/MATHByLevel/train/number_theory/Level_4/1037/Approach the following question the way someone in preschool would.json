    "solution": "We have that $22_b = 2b + 2$ and $514_b = 5b^2 + b + 4$.  Hence, $(2b + 2)^2 = 5b^2 + b + 4$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 7b = 0$.  This equation factors as $b(b - 7) = 0$, so $b = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We know that in base $b$, $22_b$ means 2 times $b$ plus 2. And we also know that in base $b$, $514_b$ means 5 times $b^2$ plus 1 times $b$ plus 4.\n\nSo, if we square $22_b$, we get:\n\n$(2b + 2)(2b + 2) = 514_b$\n\nExpanding this out gives us:\n\n$4b^2 + 4b + 4b + 4 = 514_b$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$4b^2 + 8b + 4 = 5b^2 + b + 4$\n\nSo, in order to find the base $b$, we need to solve the equation:\n\n$4b^2 + 8b + 4 = 5b^2 + b + 4$\n\nSubtracting $4b^2$ from both sides gives:\n\n$8b + 4 = b^2 + b + 4$\n\nAnd rewriting the equation gives:\n\n$b^2 - 7b = 0$\n\nThis factors into:\n\n$b(b - 7) = 0$\n\nSo either $b = 0$ or $b = 7$. But since we're working in base $b$, we can't have $b = 0$. Therefore, the base $b$ must be $7$. Yay, we did it!",
