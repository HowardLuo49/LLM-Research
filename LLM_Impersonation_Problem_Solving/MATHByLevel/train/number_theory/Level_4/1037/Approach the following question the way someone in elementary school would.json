    "solution": "We have that $22_b = 2b + 2$ and $514_b = 5b^2 + b + 4$.  Hence, $(2b + 2)^2 = 5b^2 + b + 4$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 7b = 0$.  This equation factors as $b(b - 7) = 0$, so $b = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that $22_b$ means 2 times $b$ plus 2. And we want to find what $b$ is when we square $22_b$ and get $514_b$. \n\nSo first, let's convert $22_b$ into a normal base 10 number. If we do the math, we find that $22_b$ is equal to $2b+2$. To find its value, we need to plug in a few values of $b$. If $b=3$, then $22_3$ would equal $2(3)+2 = 8$. But since that's not equal to $22_b$, let's try $b=5$. In that case, $22_5$ would equal $2(5)+2 = 12$. And when we square that, we get 144, which is not equal to $514_b$. \n\nLet's keep trying different values for $b$. If $b=6$, then $22_6$ equals $2(6)+2 = 14$. And when we square that, we get 196, which is still not equal to $514_b$. So maybe we should try a bigger number for $b$. If $b=7$, then $22_7$ equals $2(7)+2 = 16$. And when we square that, we get 256, which is still not equal to $514_b$.\n\nLet's try one more value for $b$. If $b=8$, then $22_8$ equals $2(8)+2 = 18$. And when we square that, we get 324, which is not quite $514_b$. So $b$ must be bigger than 8. \n\nAfter trying a few more values, we eventually find that if $b=9$, then $22_9$ equals $2(9)+2 = 20$. And when we square that, we get 400, which is pretty close to $514_b$. \n\nSo it looks like $b$ is 9!",
