    "solution": "The given congruence has a solution if and only if $a$ is invertible modulo $12$ since the congruence implies that $a,x$ are inverses of each other modulo $12$. In other words, $\\gcd(12,a)=1$. The only such positive $a$ less than $12$ are $1,5,7,11$. So the number of possible values of $a$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count how many numbers less than 12 make $ax$ be equal to 1 when you divide by 12. We need to find how many numbers make $ax$ be 1 more than a multiple of 12. Let's try different numbers for $a$ and see if we can find a number $x$ that works. Let's start with 1. If we let $a=1$, then we need to find a number $x$ that makes $1x$ be equal to 1 when you divide by 12. Since 1 times any number is just that number, we can try $x=1$, and it works because $1\\times 1=1$, which is 1 more than a multiple of 12. So, there is 1 number less than 12 that works for $a=1$. Now let's try $a=2$. We need to find a number $x$ such that $2x\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}$. If we try $x=7$, then $2\\times 7=14$, which is 2 more than a multiple of 12. But if we try $x=5$, then $2\\times 5=10$, which is 2 less than a multiple of 12. So, $a=2$ doesn't work. Let's keep trying different numbers for $a$ less than 12 and see how many work.",
