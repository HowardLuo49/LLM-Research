    "solution": "Since $2 \\cdot 93 \\equiv 186 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$, $2^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{93} \\pmod{185}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$, we need to find a number $x$ such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$. This means that $2x = 1 + 185k$ for some integer $k$. \n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $2x - 185k = 1$, which is a linear Diophantine equation. This equation has a solution if and only if $\\gcd(2, 185)$ divides the right-hand side, which is 1. \n\nSince $\\gcd(2, 185) = 1$ (2 and 185 are coprime), the equation has a solution.
