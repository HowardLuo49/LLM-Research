    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \\gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 4).\n\\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $3n + 4$ and $n$ as $n$ ranges over the positive integers, we need to first understand the relationship between $3n + 4$ and $n$.\n\nAssume $d$ is the gcd of $3n + 4$ and $n$. This means that $d$ divides both $3n + 4$ and $n$. So, we have $n = dq$ and $3n + 4 = dp$ for some integers $p$ and $q$. Substituting $n = dq$ into $3n + 4 = dp$, we get $3(dq) + 4 = dp$, which simplifies to $d(3q - p) = 4$. Since $d$ divides $3n + 4$ and $n$, it must also divide 4.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $d$ are the divisors of 4. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. So, the sum of all possible values of $d$ is $1 + 2 + 4 = 7$.\n\nIn conclusion, the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor of $3n + 4$ and $n$ as $n$ ranges over the positive integers is 7.",
