    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \\gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 4).\n\\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So basically, we have to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, one being $3n+4$ and the other being $n$. We need to find all possible values of this greatest common divisor and then add them up.\n\nLet's try some numbers for $n$ and see what we get:\nWhen $n=1$, we have $3(1)+4=7$ and $1$. The greatest common divisor of $7$ and $1$ is $1$.\nWhen $n=2$, we have $3(2)+4=10$ and $2$. The greatest common divisor of $10$ and $2$ is $2$.\nAnd so on...\n\nBy trying more numbers, we see that the greatest common divisor can be $1$ or $2$.\n\nSo the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor is $1+2=3$.\n\nSo, the answer is $3$. Yay!",
