    "solution": "First of all, we see that every term has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6.$ Now, we just need to find how many terms there are. The nth term can be given by the expression $6n - 5.$ Therefore, we set $259 = 6n - 5$ to find $n = 44,$ thus there are $44$ terms in our sum. Thus, the remainder of the sum is the same as the remainder of $44$ when divided by $6,$ which is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum $1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + \\cdots + 253 + 259$ is divided by $6$, we first need to determine the pattern of the sequence.\n\nThe sequence starts at $1$ and increases by $6$ each time. In other words, the sequence can be represented as an arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ and common difference $6$. The last term in the sequence is $259$, which is $1$ less than the next term in the sequence. \n\nNow, we can find the number of terms in the sequence by using the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$$\n$$259 = 1 + (n - 1)6$$\n$$259 = 1 + 6n - 6$$\n$$259 = 6n - 5$$\n$$6n = 264$$\n$$n = 44$$\n\nThere are $44$ terms in the sequence.
