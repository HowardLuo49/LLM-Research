    "solution": "First of all, we see that every term has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6.$ Now, we just need to find how many terms there are. The nth term can be given by the expression $6n - 5.$ Therefore, we set $259 = 6n - 5$ to find $n = 44,$ thus there are $44$ terms in our sum. Thus, the remainder of the sum is the same as the remainder of $44$ when divided by $6,$ which is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the sum of the numbers given:\n\n$1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + \\cdots + 253 + 259 = 1 + 7 + (7 + 6) + (7 + 2 \\cdot 6) + \\cdots + (7 + 42 \\cdot 6) + (7 + 43 \\cdot 6) = 43 \\cdot 7 + 6(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 42 + 43)$\n\nNow, we need to find the sum $1 + 2 + \\cdots + 43$. We know that the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is $\\frac{n(a + l)}{2}$ where $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term. In this case, $n = 43$, $a = 1$, and $l = 43$. So, the sum $1 + 2 + \\cdots + 43$ is $\\frac{43(1 + 43)}{2} = 946$.\n\nFinally, substituting this back into our original sum, we get $43 \\cdot 7 + 6 \\cdot 946 = 2980$.  To find the remainder when this sum is divided by $6$, we divide $2980$ by $6$ to get a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$.",
