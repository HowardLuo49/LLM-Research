    "solution": "First of all, we see that every term has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6.$ Now, we just need to find how many terms there are. The nth term can be given by the expression $6n - 5.$ Therefore, we set $259 = 6n - 5$ to find $n = 44,$ thus there are $44$ terms in our sum. Thus, the remainder of the sum is the same as the remainder of $44$ when divided by $6,$ which is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the remainder when you add all those numbers and divide by 6, we can start by adding the first and last numbers in the sequence, which are 1 and 259. \n\n1 + 259 = 260\n\nNow, we can keep adding the second and second to last numbers, which are 7 and 253. \n\n7 + 253 = 260\n\nSince we keep getting 260, we can see that the sum of all those numbers will be 260 repeated many times, since they are all the same difference apart.\n\nNow, to find the remainder when you divide 260 by 6, we can do some preschool math. \n\n260 divided by 6 is 43 with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo the remainder when you add all those numbers and divide by 6 is 2!
