    "solution": "Note that  $13^{51}$ is $(10 + 3)^{51}$. Any term in the expansion that involves the 10 will be 0 modulo 5, so it suffices to consider $3^{51} \\pmod{5}$. We look for a pattern in powers of 3. \\begin{align*}\n3^1 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^3 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^4 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*}Since $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5},$ we see that $3^{51} \\equiv 3^3 \\cdot (3^4)^{12} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when we divide $13^{51}$ by 5, let's first try to find a pattern. \n\nWhen we divide powers of 13 by 5, we see that the remainders repeat in cycles of 4. For example, $13^1$ divided by 5 has a remainder of 3, $13^2$ divided by 5 has a remainder of 4, $13^3$ divided by 5 has a remainder of 2, and $13^4$ divided by 5 has a remainder of 1. \n\nSince the remainders repeat in cycles of 4, we can divide 51 by 4 to find where in the cycle we are. 51 divided by 4 equals 12 with a remainder of 3. \n\nSo, when we divide $13^{51}$ by 5, we are at the third number in the cycle, which is 2. Therefore, the remainder when $13^{51}$ is divided by 5 is 2.",
