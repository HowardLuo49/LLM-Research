    "solution": "Note that  $13^{51}$ is $(10 + 3)^{51}$. Any term in the expansion that involves the 10 will be 0 modulo 5, so it suffices to consider $3^{51} \\pmod{5}$. We look for a pattern in powers of 3. \\begin{align*}\n3^1 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^3 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^4 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*}Since $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5},$ we see that $3^{51} \\equiv 3^3 \\cdot (3^4)^{12} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $13^{51}$ is divided by 5, we can use the property that the remainder when a number is divided by 5 is equal to the remainder when the number is divided by the remainder when the number is divided by 5.\n\nWe can rewrite $13^{51}$ as $(12 + 1)^{51}$ using the fact that $13 = 12 + 1$. By expanding this using the binomial theorem, we get:\n$$(12 + 1)^{51} = 12^{51} + {51 \\choose 1}12^{50} + {51 \\choose 2}12^{49} + \\cdots + {51 \\choose 48}12^3 + {51 \\choose 49}12^2 + {51 \\choose 50}12 + 1$$\n\nClearly, all terms except the last term will be divisible by 5 when divided by 5. This is because each term has a factor of 12 which is divisible by 5. Thus, we just need to find the remainder when $1^{51}$ is divided by 5, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $13^{51}$ is divided by 5 is 1.",
