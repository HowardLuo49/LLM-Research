    "solution": "Note that  $13^{51}$ is $(10 + 3)^{51}$. Any term in the expansion that involves the 10 will be 0 modulo 5, so it suffices to consider $3^{51} \\pmod{5}$. We look for a pattern in powers of 3. \\begin{align*}\n3^1 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^3 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^4 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*}Since $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5},$ we see that $3^{51} \\equiv 3^3 \\cdot (3^4)^{12} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{2}.$",
