    "solution": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45, we need to consider the divisibility rules for 45. \n\nFirst, a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Since we are looking for numbers of the form $\\_\\_45$, the last two digits are fixed as 45. This means that the last digit is 5, which is good because 5 is a factor of 45.\n\nNext, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since we know that the last digit is 5, the sum of the remaining two digits must be a multiple of 4 in order to make the entire number divisible by 9. \n\nThe two-digit numbers that satisfy this condition are 04, 13, 22, 31, 40, 58, 67, 76, 85, and 94. Therefore, there are 10 possible choices for the remaining two digits. \n\nTherefore, the total number of positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45 is $\\boxed{10}$.",
