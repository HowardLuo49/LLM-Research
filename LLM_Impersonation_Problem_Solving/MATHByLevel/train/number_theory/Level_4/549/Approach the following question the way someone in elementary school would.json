    "solution": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many four-digit numbers of the form __45 are divisible by 45, we first need to know what two-digit number goes in the blank. \n\nSince a number is divisible by 45 if it is divisible by both 5 and 9, the two-digit number in the blank must be a multiple of 9 and end in 5. \n\nThe only two-digit number that fits this criteria is 45. \n\nSo the four-digit integers of the form 4545 are divisible by 45. \n\nTherefore, there is only 1 four-digit integer of the form __45 that is divisible by 45.",
