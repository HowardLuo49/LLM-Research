    "solution": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45, we first note that a number is divisible by 45 if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since the hundreds digit cannot be zero, we can let the hundreds digit be $a$, the tens digit be $b$, and the units digit be 5. \n\nThus, the sum of the digits in the number is $a + b + 4 + 5 = a + b + 9$. In order for the number to be divisible by 9, $a + b + 9$ must be divisible by 9. This can occur when $a + b = 0, 9, 18,$ or $27$. \n\nIf $a + b = 0$, then $a = 0$ and $b = 0$. This is not possible since the hundreds digit cannot be zero. Similarly, $a + b = 27$ cannot occur because the maximum value a digit can have is 9. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $a$ and $b$ when $a + b = 9$  and when $a + b = 18$. \n\nWhen $a + b = 9$, the possible pairs are $(1, 8)$, $(2, 7)$, $(3, 6)$, and $(4, 5)$. Each pair corresponds to a unique four-digit number since the hundreds digit cannot be zero. \n\nSimilarly, when $a + b = 18$, the pairs are $(9, 0)$, $(8, 1)$, $(7, 2)$, $(6, 3)$, and $(5, 4)$. \n\nTherefore, there are $4 + 5 = 9$ positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45.",
