    "solution": "The least positive integer which is congruent to 6 (mod 11) is 6. The other positive integers which are congruent to 6 (mod 11) are $6+11$, $6+22$, $6+33$, and so on. We seek the maximum positive integer $k$ for which $6+11k<1000$. This maximal $k$ is the greatest integer less than $\\frac{1000-6}{11}$, which is 90. So the set of positive integers less than 1000 which are congruent to 6 (mod 11) is  $$\n\\{11(0)+6, 11(1)+6, 11(2)+6, \\ldots, 11(90)+6\\},\n$$and there are $\\boxed{91}$ elements in this set (since there are 91 elements in the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,90\\}$).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers less than 1000 that are congruent to 6 modulo 11, we must first determine the form of an integer that is congruent to 6 modulo 11. Let n be the positive integer we are looking for. Then we can express n as:\n\nn = 11k + 6, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, we want to find how many values of k satisfy this equation when n is less than 1000. We can rearrange the equation to solve for k:\n\nk = (n - 6) / 11\n\nSince n is a positive integer less than 1000, we can substitute all possible values for n that satisfy these conditions into the equation and find the corresponding values for k. Then, we count the number of values of k that are integers.\n\nLet's calculate this using a Python script:\n\n```python\ncount = 0\nfor n in range(1, 1000):\n    k = (n - 6) / 11\n    if k.is_integer():\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\nRunning this script will give us the number of positive integers less than 1000 that are congruent to 6 modulo 11.",
