    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the largest integer that must divide the product of any $4$ consecutive integers?",
    "solution": "Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=\\boxed{24}.$\n\nWe can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest integer that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive integers, we should consider the prime factorization of these integers.\n\nLet the 4 consecutive integers be $n, n+1, n+2,$ and $n+3$. In general, any integer can be expressed as a product of its prime factors. Therefore, we can express these 4 consecutive integers as:\n\n$n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$\n\n$n+1 = q_1^{b_1} \\cdot q_2^{b_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot q_m^{a_m}$\n\n$n+2 = r_1^{c_1} \\cdot r_2^{c_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot r_n^{c_n}$\n\n$n+3 = s_1^{d_1} \\cdot s_2^{d_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot s_o^{d_o}$\n\nwhere $p_i, q_i, r_i,$ and $s_i$ are prime factors and $a_i, b_i, c_i,$ and $d_i$ are their respective powers.\n\nIt is clear that each of the 4 consecutive integers contains at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3, as they have the sequence $n=2(3k), n+1=2(3k+1), n+2=2(3k+1), n+3=2(3k+1).$\n\nGiven any 4 consecutive integers, the product will contain at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3. Therefore, the largest integer that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive integers is 6, as 6 is the smallest integer containing the prime factors 2 and 3.",
