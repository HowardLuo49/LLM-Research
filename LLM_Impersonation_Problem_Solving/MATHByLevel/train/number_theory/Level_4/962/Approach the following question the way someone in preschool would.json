    "solution": "Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=\\boxed{24}.$\n\nWe can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see... when we have 4 consecutive numbers, it's like counting on your fingers! Let's say we start with 1, 2, 3, 4. The product of these numbers is 24. But if I try with different numbers like 5, 6, 7, 8, the product is 168. So the biggest number that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive numbers is 24! Yay!",
