    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, we can first group the numbers in pairs like this: $(1-2) + (3-4) + \\cdots + (2009-2010)$. Each pair of numbers adds up to -1, so when we add all the pairs together, we get $-1 + -1 + \\cdots + -1$ 1005 times, which is -1005. \n\nSince we are looking for the residue of $S$ modulo 2010, we can simply take the remainder of -1005 when divided by 2010. So the residue of $S$ is 1005.",
