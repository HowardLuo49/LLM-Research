    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue of $S$ modulo 2010, we can rearrange the terms of the sum in pairs:\n$S = (1-2) + (3-4) + \\cdots + (2009-2010)$\n$S = -1 - 1 - 1 - \\cdots - 1$\n\nSince there are 1005 pairs of terms in $S$, the sum simplifies to:\n$S = -1005$\n\nTherefore, the residue of $S$ modulo 2010 is $2010 - 1005 = \\boxed{1005}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 1005?: To find the residue of $S$ modulo 2010, we can rearrange the terms of the sum in pairs:\n$S = (1-2) + (3-4) + \\cdots + (2009-2010)$\n$S = -1 - 1 - 1 - \\cdots - 1$\n\nSince there are 1005 pairs of terms in $S$, the sum simplifies to:\n$S = -1005$\n\nTherefore, the residue of $S$ modulo 2010 is $2010 - 1005 = \\boxed{1005}$.",
