    "solution": "Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place. Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place. The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\\times7$ to $15\\times 66$. So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15. Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15. There are $\\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place are divisible by $15$, we first need to determine what makes a number divisible by $15$. A number is divisible by $15$ if it is divisible by both $3$ and $5$.\n\nSince we know the number has a $5$ in the units place, we only need to focus on the hundreds and tens digits. For a number to be divisible by $3$, the sum of all its digits must be divisible by $3$. Therefore, if the units digit is $5$, the hundredths digit must also be $5$ in order for the number to be divisible by $3$. \n\nTherefore, the only possible number that meets all the conditions is $555$. \n\nSo, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ positive three-digit integer with a $5$ in the units place that is divisible by $15$.",
