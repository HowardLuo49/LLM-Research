    "solution": "We know that at least one of our three consecutive positive integers must be a multiple of $2$ since every other integer in a list of consecutive integers is divisible by $2$. Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$. Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers, let's start by picking three consecutive numbers, like 1, 2, and 3. \n\nWhen we multiply these numbers together, we get 1 x 2 x 3 = 6. \n\nNow let's try with the next three consecutive numbers, 2, 3, and 4. When we multiply them together, we get 2 x 3 x 4 = 24. \n\nFrom these examples, we can see that the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is 6. \n\nSo the answer is 6.",
