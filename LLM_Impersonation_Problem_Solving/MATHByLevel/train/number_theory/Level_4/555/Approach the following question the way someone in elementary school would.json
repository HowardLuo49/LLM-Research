    "solution": "If an integer is congruent to 1 mod 3, then it can be written in the form $3k+1$. Therefore, we have two inequalities: $3k+1 \\ge 10$, and $3k+1 \\le 99$. The inequality $3k+1 \\ge 10$ has solution $k\\ge3$, and the inequality $3k+1 \\le 99$ has solution $k \\le 32 \\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, $k$ must be an integer between $3$ and $32$. There are $\\boxed{30}$ such integers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many two-digit numbers are congruent to 1 (mod 3), we can think about all the numbers that are equal to 1 when divided by 3. \n\nStarting with 10 (which is the smallest two-digit number), we can see that 10 is congruent to 1 (mod 3) because 10 divided by 3 equals 3 with a remainder of 1. \n\nThe next number after 10 that is congruent to 1 (mod 3) is 13, because 13 divided by 3 equals 4 with a remainder of 1.\n\nWe can keep going and find all the numbers that are congruent to 1 (mod 3) until we reach the largest two-digit number, 99.\n\nSo, the numbers that are two-digit and congruent to 1 (mod 3) are: 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 73, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 97.\n\nThere are 30 two-digit numbers that are congruent to 1 (mod 3).",
