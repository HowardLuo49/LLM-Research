    "solution": "If an integer is congruent to 1 mod 3, then it can be written in the form $3k+1$. Therefore, we have two inequalities: $3k+1 \\ge 10$, and $3k+1 \\le 99$. The inequality $3k+1 \\ge 10$ has solution $k\\ge3$, and the inequality $3k+1 \\le 99$ has solution $k \\le 32 \\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, $k$ must be an integer between $3$ and $32$. There are $\\boxed{30}$ such integers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find positive two-digit integers congruent to 1 mod 3, we need to find all integers of the form 3k + 1 where k is an integer such that 10 <= 3k + 1 < 100. \n\nTo determine the bounds of k, we can solve the inequalities:\n10 <= 3k + 1 < 100\n9 <= 3k < 99\n3 <= k < 33\n\nTherefore, k can take on integer values from 3 to 32, inclusive. There are 32 - 3 + 1 = 30 possible values for k. \n\nHence, there are 30 positive two-digit integers that are congruent to 1 mod 3.",
