    "solution": "The two-digit primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. For each prime on this list whose tens digit is odd, check whether or not the number formed when the digits are reversed is also prime. (Note that if the tens digit is even, then the ``reversed'' number is even and hence not prime.) The palindromic primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 31, and 37, whose sum is $\\boxed{109}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. First, we need to find all the two-digit prime numbers less than 50. Then, we need to see if the number formed by reversing the digits is also prime. Let's list them out:\n\n11 (because 11 backwards is also 11, and 11 is prime)\n13 (because 31 is also prime)\n17 (because 71 is also prime)\n31 (because 13 is also prime)\n37 (because 73 is also prime)\n41 (because 14 is not a prime number)\n43 (because 34 is not a prime number)\n47 (because 74 is not a prime number)\n\nSo, the palindromic primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 31, and 37. Let's add them all up: 11 + 13 + 17 + 31 + 37 = 109. So, the sum of all palindromic primes less than 50 is 109! Yay!",
