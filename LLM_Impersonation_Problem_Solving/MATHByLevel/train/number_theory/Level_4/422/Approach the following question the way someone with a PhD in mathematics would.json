    "solution": "The two-digit primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. For each prime on this list whose tens digit is odd, check whether or not the number formed when the digits are reversed is also prime. (Note that if the tens digit is even, then the ``reversed'' number is even and hence not prime.) The palindromic primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 31, and 37, whose sum is $\\boxed{109}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all palindromic primes less than 50, we first need to identify all the palindromic primes in that range. The two-digit prime numbers less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. \n\nNext, we need to check if the reverse of these numbers is also a prime number. For example, the reverse of 11 is 11, which is a prime number. The same is true for 13, 17, 31, and 37. However, the reverse of 19 is 91, which is not a prime number. \n\nTherefore, the palindromic primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 31, and 37. The sum of these numbers is 11 + 13 + 17 + 31 + 37 = 109.\n\nSo, the sum of all palindromic primes less than 50 is 109.",
