    "solution": "Each member in the set is of the form $(x-1)+x+(x+1)=3x$. Since $x$ can be any positive integer, the greatest common divisor of all these members is $\\boxed{3}$.",

We want to find all the numbers that can be made by adding up three numbers in a row, like 1+2+3=6 or 2+3+4=9. \n\nIf we think about it, every number in $A$ can be represented as $3n$ where $n$ is a positive integer. This is because if we add up three consecutive numbers starting from $n$, we get $3n$. \n\nSo the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$ is actually 3! Hope that helps!",
