    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $A$ be the set of all numbers which can be represented as the sum of three consecutive positive integers. What is the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$?",
    "solution": "Each member in the set is of the form $(x-1)+x+(x+1)=3x$. Since $x$ can be any positive integer, the greatest common divisor of all these members is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us first express the sum of three consecutive positive integers as a formula. Let $n$ be the first positive integer in the sequence, then the next two integers are $n+1$ and $n+2$. The sum of these three consecutive integers is given by $n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n+1)$.\n\nTherefore, any number that can be represented as the sum of three consecutive positive integers is of the form $3(n+1)$ for some positive integer $n$. \n\nNext, let us consider the prime factorization of $3(n+1)$. Since $3$ is a prime number, the prime factorization of any multiple of $3$ will contain at least one factor of $3$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$ will be $3$. \n\nThus, the greatest common divisor of all numbers that can be represented as the sum of three consecutive positive integers is $\\boxed{3}$.",
