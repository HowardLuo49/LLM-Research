    "solution": "We can tell that the integer is a multiple of $9$ if the sum of its digits is a multiple of $9$. For the largest integer with even digits that is less than $10,\\!000$, it must have the largest even digit, $8$, in the thousands place. So we have $8\\_\\_\\_$. Notice that the maximum integer with even digits is $8888$. However, the digits must add up to a multiple of $9$, and more specifically, an even multiple of $9$ since all of the digits are even. The closest even multiples of $9$ are $18$ and $36$, but the sum of the maximum integer $8888$ is only $32$. So the sum of the digits must be $18$. We maximize the integer with $88\\_\\_$, with a sum of $16$, which leaves a sum of $2$ for the remaining digits. For the digits to be even and to maximize the integer, the tens digit must be $2$ and the units digit must be $0$. The largest integer is $\\boxed{8820}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest positive integer with only even digits that is less than $10,000$ and is a multiple of $9, we first need to figure out what the largest even digit is (which is $8$). Then, we need to make the number as big as possible while still being less than $10,000$ and a multiple of $9$. \n\nSince the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $9$ if and only if the number itself is divisible by $9$, we can start by figuring out what the sum of the digits in our number can be. The largest possible sum of the digits in a four-digit number with only even digits is $8+8+8+8 = 32$. Since $32$ is divisible by $9$, we can make sure our number is also divisible by $9$ by taking a smaller number like $8+8+8+4 = 28$.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer less than $10,000$ with only even digits that is a multiple of $9$ is $\\boxed{8884}$.",
