    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count the blocks! Start with the top number, 10101, and then draw three lines underneath for each block in the bottom number, 101. Now let's multiply each block in the top number by the blocks in the bottom number.\n\nFirst, we multiply 1 by each block in 101. That gives us 10101, so we write that down. Next, we move down a row and multiply 0 by each block in 101. Since anything times 0 is 0, we write down 00000. Lastly, we move down another row and multiply 1 by each block in 101. That gives us 10101 again, so we write that down.\n\nNow, let's add up all the numbers we wrote down: 10101, 00000, and 10101. That gives us 20202. So, the product of $10101_2$ and $101_2$ is $20202_2$.",
