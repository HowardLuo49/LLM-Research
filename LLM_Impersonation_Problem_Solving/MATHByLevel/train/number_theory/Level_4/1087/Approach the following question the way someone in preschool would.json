    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see... to find the decimal of $\\frac{3}{26}$ we just need to do the division. Since $26$ doesn't go into $3$ evenly, we'll have a decimal.
