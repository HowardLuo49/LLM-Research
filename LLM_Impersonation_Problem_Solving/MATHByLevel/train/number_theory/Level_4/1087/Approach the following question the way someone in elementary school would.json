    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th digit after the decimal point in $\\frac{3}{26}$, first we need to do the division. \n\nWhen we divide $3$ by $26$, we get $0.11538461538461538461538461538461\\ldots$\n\nSo, the 100th digit after the decimal point is $5$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: To find the 100th digit after the decimal point in $\\frac{3}{26}$, first we need to do the division. \n\nWhen we divide $3$ by $26$, we get $0.11538461538461538461538461538461\\ldots$\n\nSo, the 100th digit after the decimal point is $5$.",
