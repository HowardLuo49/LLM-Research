    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we can divide $3$ by $26$ using long division. \n\nWhen we do this, we find that $\\frac{3}{26} = 0.115384615384615384615...$\n\nThe pattern after the decimal repeats every six digits: $115384$. Since we are looking for the $100$th digit after the decimal point, we need to find which digit in the repeating pattern corresponds to the $100$th digit.\n\n$100 \\div 6 = 16$ with a remainder of $4$, so the $100$th digit is the $4$th digit in the repeating pattern.\n\nTherefore, the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$, we can divide $3$ by $26$ using long division. \n\nWhen we do this, we find that $\\frac{3}{26} = 0.115384615384615384615...$\n\nThe pattern after the decimal repeats every six digits: $115384$.
