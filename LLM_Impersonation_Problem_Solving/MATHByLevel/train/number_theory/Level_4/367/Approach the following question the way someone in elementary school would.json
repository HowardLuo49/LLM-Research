    "solution": "By inspection, we find that  \\begin{align*}\n1\\cdot 1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{9} \\\\\n2\\cdot 5 &\\equiv1\\pmod{9} \\\\\n4\\cdot 7 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \\\\\n8\\cdot 8 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}.\n\\end{align*}So 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have modular inverses (mod 9). Since no multiple of 0, 3, and 6 can be one more than a multiple of 9, we find that $\\boxed{6}$ of the modulo-9 residues have inverses.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integers between 0 and 8 have an inverse modulo 9, we can look at each number and see if we can multiply it by another number to get a remainder of 1 when divided by 9.\n\nLet's start with 0. Since 0 times any number will always be 0, it does not have an inverse modulo 9.\n\nNext is 1. 1 times 1 equals 1 which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, 1 has an inverse modulo 9.\n\nLet's continue with 2. 2 times 5 equals 10 which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, 2 also has an inverse modulo 9.\n\nNow, let's check 3. 3 times 6 equals 18 which leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 9. So, 3 does not have an inverse modulo 9.\n\nWe move on to 4. 4 times 7 equals 28 which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, 4 has an inverse modulo 9.\n\nNext is 5. We already know that 5 multiplied by 2 equals 10 which has a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, 5 has an inverse modulo 9.\n\nNow we check 6. We know that 6 times 3 equals 18 which leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 9. So, 6 does not have an inverse modulo 9.\n\nFinally, we look at 7. We know that 7 times 4 equals 28 which has a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So, 7 has an inverse modulo 9.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 5 integers between 0 and 8 inclusive that have an inverse modulo 9.",
