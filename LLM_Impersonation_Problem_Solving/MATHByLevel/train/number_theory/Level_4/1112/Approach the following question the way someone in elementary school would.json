If the digit represented by $\\triangle$ satisfies the following addition problem $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & \\triangle_6\\\\ & & & \\triangle & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & \\triangle & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & \\triangle & 1_6\\\\ \\end{array} $$what is the value of $\\triangle$?",
    "solution": "We notice that in the units column, it's impossible for $\\triangle+2=1_6$. So, it must be the case that $\\triangle+2=11_6=7$. That would mean $\\triangle=7-2=\\boxed{5}$. We can check that our answer works by plugging our value for triangle into the original problem: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 3 & 2 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ & & & 5 & 4 & 0_6\\\\ &+ & & & 5 & 2_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 4 & 2 & 5 & 1_6.\\\\ \\end{array} $$The addition problem still works, so our answer is correct.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to add up all the numbers in this math problem. Let's start by adding the ones column, which is the last column on the right. \n\nIn the ones column, we have $\\triangle + 0_6 + 0_6 = 1_6$. This means that $\\triangle$ plus zero plus zero equals one. Since we are adding in base 6, $\\triangle$ must be equal to 5.\n\nNow, we can move on to the next column, the sixes column. \n\nIn the sixes column, we have $1 + \\triangle + \\triangle = 2 + \\triangle$. We already know that $\\triangle$ is 5, so $2 + 5 = 1_6$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $\\triangle$ is 5. Yay, we solved the problem!",
