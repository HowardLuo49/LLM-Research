    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Two positive integers $m$ and $n$ are chosen such that $m$ is the smallest positive integer with only two positive divisors and $n$ is the largest integer less than $100$ with exactly three positive divisors. What is $m+n$?",
    "solution": "For an integer to have only two positive divisors, it must be prime (the only positive divisors of a prime number are $1$ and itself). Since $2$ is the smallest positive prime, $m=2$. For a positive integer to have exactly three positive divisors, it must be in the form $p^2$ where $p$ is prime (its only factors would be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$). The largest $p^2$ less than $100$ is $7^2=49$. Thus, $n=49$ and $m+n=2+49=\\boxed{51}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's figure out what the smallest positive integer with only two positive divisors is. An integer with only two positive divisors is a prime number because a prime number only has 1 and itself as divisors. The smallest prime number is 2. \n\nNow let's find the largest integer less than 100 with exactly three positive divisors. An integer with exactly three positive divisors is a square of a prime number. So let's list out some squares of prime numbers less than 100: $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$.\n\nThe largest integer less than 100 with exactly three positive divisors is 49.\n\nSo, $m=2$ and $n=49$. \n\nTherefore, $m+n=2+49 = 51$. \n\nSo, our final answer is $\\boxed{51}$.",
