    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two positive integers $m$ and $n$ are chosen such that $m$ is the smallest positive integer with only two positive divisors and $n$ is the largest integer less than $100$ with exactly three positive divisors. What is $m+n$?",
    "solution": "For an integer to have only two positive divisors, it must be prime (the only positive divisors of a prime number are $1$ and itself). Since $2$ is the smallest positive prime, $m=2$. For a positive integer to have exactly three positive divisors, it must be in the form $p^2$ where $p$ is prime (its only factors would be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$). The largest $p^2$ less than $100$ is $7^2=49$. Thus, $n=49$ and $m+n=2+49=\\boxed{51}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's analyze the properties of positive integers with only two positive divisors. Any positive integer with only two positive divisors is a prime number, since a prime number has only two divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, $m$ is the smallest prime number.\n\nNext, let's consider positive integers with exactly three positive divisors. A positive integer $n$ with exactly three positive divisors can be expressed as $n = p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. This is because a number with three divisors must be in the form of $p^2$, where the divisors are $1, p,$ and $p^2$.\n\nWe are looking for the largest integer less than $100$ that can be expressed as $n = p^2$. The largest prime number less than $10$ is $7$, so the largest integer less than $100$ that can be expressed as $n = p^2$ with $p = 7$ is $49$.\n\nTherefore, $m = 2$ (smallest prime number) and $n = 49$. Thus, $2+49 = \\boxed{51}$.",
