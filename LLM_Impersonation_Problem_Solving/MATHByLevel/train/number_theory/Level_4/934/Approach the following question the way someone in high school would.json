    "solution": "Since $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, both $m$ and $n$ are divisible by 12.  Then $10m$ is divisible by $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$, and $15n$ is divisible by $12 \\cdot 15 = 180$.  Since 60 divides both 120 and 180, $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ must be at least 60.\n\nIf we set $m = n = 12$, then $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(12,12) = 12$, and $\\gcd(10m,15n) = \\gcd(120,180) = 60$, which shows that the value of 60 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$. That means that the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is 12. Now we want to find the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$. \n\nTo do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor of $10m$ and $15n$. Since 10 and 15 have a common factor of 5, we can factor that out to get $5 \\gcd(2m,3n)$. \n\nSince 2 and 3 are relatively prime, the greatest common divisor of $2m$ and $3n$ must be a multiple of 12, because the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is 12. So, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $5 \\times 12 = 60$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is 60.",
