    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If $m$ and $n$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, then what is the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$?",
    "solution": "Since $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, both $m$ and $n$ are divisible by 12.  Then $10m$ is divisible by $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$, and $15n$ is divisible by $12 \\cdot 15 = 180$.  Since 60 divides both 120 and 180, $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ must be at least 60.\n\nIf we set $m = n = 12$, then $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(12,12) = 12$, and $\\gcd(10m,15n) = \\gcd(120,180) = 60$, which shows that the value of 60 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$, one must first consider the prime factorization of the numbers involved. Since $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, we can express $m$ as $12a$ and $n$ as $12b$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$. \n\nThus, $10m = 10 \\times 12a = 120a$ and $15n = 15 \\times 12b = 180b$. \n\nTo find the greatest common divisor of $10m$ and $15n$, we must determine the common factors of $120a$ and $180b$. The prime factorization of 120 and 180 are $2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5$ and $2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$, respectively. \n\nSince $10m = 120a$ and $15n = 180b$, the common factors of $10m$ and $15n$ will be the factors that they share. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $2^2 \\times 3 = 12$.",
