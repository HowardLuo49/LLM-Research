    "solution": "Since $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, both $m$ and $n$ are divisible by 12.  Then $10m$ is divisible by $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$, and $15n$ is divisible by $12 \\cdot 15 = 180$.  Since 60 divides both 120 and 180, $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ must be at least 60.\n\nIf we set $m = n = 12$, then $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(12,12) = 12$, and $\\gcd(10m,15n) = \\gcd(120,180) = 60$, which shows that the value of 60 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about this question like we are in preschool! If we have two numbers, let's call them m and n, and their greatest common divisor is 12, what does that mean? It means that 12 is the biggest number that can divide both m and n evenly.\n\nNow, let's look at the next part of the question. We need to find the smallest possible value of the greatest common divisor of 10m and 15n. Hmm...what can we do to figure this out?\n\nWell, we know that if we multiply a number by 10, it will have all the same factors as the original number, just multiplied by 10. And if we multiply a number by 15, it will have all the same factors as the original number, just multiplied by 15.\n\nSo, if we want to find the greatest common divisor of 10m and 15n, we can think about what factors they have in common. Since m and n have a greatest common divisor of 12, we know that 10m and 15n will have factors of 10 and 15 in common. \n\nIf we think about the factors of 12, 10, and 15, what is the smallest number they have in common? It's 60! So, the smallest possible value of the greatest common divisor of 10m and 15n is 60! Great job, preschool friends!",
