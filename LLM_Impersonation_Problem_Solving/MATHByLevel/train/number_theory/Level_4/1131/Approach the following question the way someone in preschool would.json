    "solution": "We begin by computing the remainder of some small powers of $7$. As $7^0 = 1, 7^1 = 7,$ and $7^2 = 49$, then $7^3 = 49 \\cdot 7 = 343$ leaves a remainder of $43$ after division by $100$, and $7^4$ leaves the remainder that $43 \\cdot 7 = 301$ does after division by $100$, namely $1$. The sequence of powers thus repeat modulo $100$ again. In particular, the remainder that the powers of $7$ leave after division by $100$ is periodic with period $4$. Then, $7^{2010} = 7^{4 \\cdot 502 + 2}$ leaves the same remainder as $7^2$ does after division by $100$, which is $\\boxed{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count and see. $7^1 = 7$, $7^2 = 49$, $7^3 = 343$, $7^4 = 2401$. Let's keep going until we find a pattern. $7^5 = 16807$, $7^6 = 117649$, $7^7 = 823543$, $7^8 = 5764801$, $7^9 = 40353607$, $7^{10} = 282475249$. \n\nHmm, it looks like the ones digit of the powers of 7 repeat in a pattern: 7, 9, 3, 1. So, to find the ones digit of $7^{2010}$, we just need to find out what the remainder is when 2010 is divided by 4. \n\nLet's do some counting! 2010 divided by 4 is 502 with a remainder of 2. So, the remainder is when 7^2010 is divided by 4 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $7^{2010}$ is 9. \n\nNow, let's find the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by 100. Here, we have to focus on the last two digits. When we divide $7^1$ by 100, we get 07. Carrying on this pattern, we see that $7^{2}$ has a remainder of 49, $7^{3}$ has a remainder of 43, and so on.\n\nSince we have seen that the ones digit of the powers of 7 repeats every 4 numbers, we know that $7^{2010}$ has the same remainder as $7^2$, which is 49 when divided by 100. \n\nSo, the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by 100 is 49. \n\nYay, we did it!",
