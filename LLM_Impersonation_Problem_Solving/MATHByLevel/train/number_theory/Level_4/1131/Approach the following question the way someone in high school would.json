    "solution": "We begin by computing the remainder of some small powers of $7$. As $7^0 = 1, 7^1 = 7,$ and $7^2 = 49$, then $7^3 = 49 \\cdot 7 = 343$ leaves a remainder of $43$ after division by $100$, and $7^4$ leaves the remainder that $43 \\cdot 7 = 301$ does after division by $100$, namely $1$. The sequence of powers thus repeat modulo $100$ again. In particular, the remainder that the powers of $7$ leave after division by $100$ is periodic with period $4$. Then, $7^{2010} = 7^{4 \\cdot 502 + 2}$ leaves the same remainder as $7^2$ does after division by $100$, which is $\\boxed{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by $100$, we can look for a pattern in the remainders when powers of $7$ are divided by $100$. \n\nWhen we calculate the remainders for the first few powers of $7$ divided by $100$, we get: \n$7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{100}$\n$7^2 \\equiv 49 \\pmod{100}$\n$7^3 \\equiv 43 \\pmod{100}$\n$7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$\n$7^5 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{100}$\n\nWe see that the remainders cycle in groups of $4$ starting from $7$. Therefore, we need to find the remainder when $2010$ is divided by $4$ to determine which power of $7$ our remainder corresponds to. \n\nSince $2010 = 4 \\times 502 + 2$, the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by $100$ is the same as the remainder when $7^2$ is divided by $100$, which is $49$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by $100$ is $\\boxed{49}$.",
