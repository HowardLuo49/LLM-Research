    "solution": "We begin by computing the remainder of some small powers of $7$. As $7^0 = 1, 7^1 = 7,$ and $7^2 = 49$, then $7^3 = 49 \\cdot 7 = 343$ leaves a remainder of $43$ after division by $100$, and $7^4$ leaves the remainder that $43 \\cdot 7 = 301$ does after division by $100$, namely $1$. The sequence of powers thus repeat modulo $100$ again. In particular, the remainder that the powers of $7$ leave after division by $100$ is periodic with period $4$. Then, $7^{2010} = 7^{4 \\cdot 502 + 2}$ leaves the same remainder as $7^2$ does after division by $100$, which is $\\boxed{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so when we divide $7^{2010}$ by $100$, we want to find the remainder. \n\nTo find the remainder, we can first think about the last two digits of $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$, and so on until we find a pattern. \n\nThe last two digits of $7^1$ is $07$, $7^2$ is $49$, $7^3$ is $43$, $7^4$ is $01$, and then it repeats from there on out, with $7^5$ having the same last two digits as $7^1$, $7^6$ having the same last two digits as $7^2$, and so on. \n\nSince we are looking for the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by $100$, we can look at the pattern we found earlier and see that $2010$ is divisible by $4$. Therefore, $7^{2010}$ will have the same last two digits as $7^4$, which is $01$. \n\nThat means the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by $100$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
