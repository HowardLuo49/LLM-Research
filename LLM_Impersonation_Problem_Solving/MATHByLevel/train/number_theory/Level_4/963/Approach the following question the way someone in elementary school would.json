    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values. What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's look at the first few numbers in each sequence. The first sequence starts with 2 and goes up by 3 every time, so the second number is 5, then 8, then 11, and so on. The second sequence starts with 3 and goes up by 7 every time, so the second number is 10, then 17, then 24, and so on.\n\nTo find the common values, we need to see when the numbers in each sequence are the same. We can start by setting the two sequences equal to each other:\n\n$2 + 3n = 3 + 7m$\n\nwhere n is the position in the first sequence and m is the position in the second sequence. Solving this equation, we get:\n\n$3n = 7m + 1$\n\nThe first few positive solutions to this equation are (n,m) = (1,1), (4,3), (7,5), (10,7),...\n\nSo the common values are 5, 17, 29, 41, ...\n\nSo, the largest value less than 500 that the two sequences have in common is 485.",
