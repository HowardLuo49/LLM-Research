    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, how many even positive factors does $n$ have?",
    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $n$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  An integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we have 3 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and $2$ choices for $c$, for a total of $(3)(3)(2)=\\boxed{18}$ ways to form an even positive factor of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of even positive factors of $n$, we need to consider the prime factorization of $n$. Since $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, any factor of $n$ must have the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 3$, $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$, and $0 \\leq c \\leq 1$. \n\nAn even positive factor must have at least one factor of $2$. Therefore, $a$ must be at least $1$. This gives us $3$ possibilities for $a$ (namely $1, 2,$ and $3$), $3$ possibilities for $b$ (namely $0, 1,$ and $2$), and $2$ possibilities for $c$ (namely $0$ and $1$).\n\nThus, the total number of even positive factors of $n$ is $3 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 18$ factors. \n\nTherefore, $n$ has $18$ even positive factors.",
