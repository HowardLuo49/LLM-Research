    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. If $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, how many even positive factors does $n$ have?",
    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $n$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  An integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we have 3 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and $2$ choices for $c$, for a total of $(3)(3)(2)=\\boxed{18}$ ways to form an even positive factor of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find all the factors of $n$. Since $n = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, we can find the total number of factors by adding 1 to each of the exponents and then multiplying them together. So, for $n$, we have (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 factors.\n\nNext, we need to find how many of these factors are even. Since an even number always has a factor of 2, we can count the number of factors that have at least one factor of 2. This means we can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 factors of 2.\n\nSo, the number of even positive factors of $n$ is 4 * 2 * 1 = 8. \n\nTherefore, $n$ has 8 even positive factors.",
