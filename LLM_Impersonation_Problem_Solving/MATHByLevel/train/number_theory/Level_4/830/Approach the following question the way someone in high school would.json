    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. If $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, how many even positive factors does $n$ have?",
    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $n$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  An integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we have 3 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and $2$ choices for $c$, for a total of $(3)(3)(2)=\\boxed{18}$ ways to form an even positive factor of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down the prime factorization of $n$. We know that $n = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. \n\nTo find the total number of factors, we add 1 to each of the exponents and multiply them together. So the total number of factors of $n$ would be $(3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$.\n\nNext, let's find the total number of odd factors. Odd factors would not contain any powers of 2. So we would need to find the total number of factors possible from the prime factors $3^2 \\cdot 5$. That would be $(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$. \n\nSince the total number of factors is 24 and the total number of odd factors is 6, the number of even factors would be the difference between the two, which is $24-6=18$. Therefore, $n$ has 18 even positive factors.",
