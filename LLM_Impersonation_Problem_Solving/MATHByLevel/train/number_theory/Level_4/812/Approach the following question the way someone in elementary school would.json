    "solution": "When summing these three numbers, we notice that $5 + 4 + 1$ leaves a residue of $1$ when divided by $9$, so it follows that the sum has a rightmost digit of $1$ and that carry-over must occur. After carrying over to the next digit, we must find the sum of $1 + 7 + 1 + 6 = 16_9$, which leaves a residue of $6$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we write down $6$ as the next digit and carry-over another $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we must find the sum of $1+1+7 = 10_9$, which leaves a residue of $0$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we must carry-over one more time, yielding that: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{1} & \\stackrel{1}{7} & \\stackrel{}{5}_{9} \\\\ & & & 7 & 1 & 4_{9} \\\\ &+ & & & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} && 1 & 0 & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\end{array} $$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{1061_{9}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can notice that $175_9 + 714_9 = 1000_9$, so $1000_9 + 61_9 = 1061_9$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, we need to add up the numbers in base 9! \n\nFirst, let's add up the rightmost column. So, that's $5 + 4 + 1 = 10$. Since 10 is more than 9, we need to carry over to the next column. \n\nThat means we now have a 0 in the right column, and we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nNext, let's add up the second column from the right. So, that's $7 + 1 + 6 = 14$. Again, since 14 is more than 9, we carry over a 1 to the next column. \n\nThat means we now have a 4 in the second column from the right, and a 1 in the third column from the right. \n\nThen, let's add up the third column from the right. So, that's $1 + 1 = 2$. This time, 2 is less than 9, so we don't need to carry over anything. \n\nFinally, our answer is $2019_9$. So, $175_{9} + 714_{9} + 61_9 = 2019_9$.",
