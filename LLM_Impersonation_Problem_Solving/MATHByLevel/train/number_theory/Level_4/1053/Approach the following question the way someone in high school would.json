    "gpt_response": "To find the difference between $1000_7$ and $666_7$, we can subtract the two numbers just like we would subtract in base 10. \n\nFirst, let's line up the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{}\n&1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-& & 6 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNow let's do the subtraction column by column, starting from the right:\n\n$0 - 6 = -6$. Since we're working in base 7, we'll need to borrow from the next column. So, the 0 becomes $0+7 = 7$ and the 1 becomes $1-1 = 0$.\n\nMoving to the next column, we have $0 - 6 = -6$ again. We'll borrow from the next column, making the 0 a 7 and the 0 in the next column a 6.\n\nFinally, in the next column, we have $7 - 6 = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the difference between $1000_7$ and $666_7$ in base 7 is $134_7$.",
