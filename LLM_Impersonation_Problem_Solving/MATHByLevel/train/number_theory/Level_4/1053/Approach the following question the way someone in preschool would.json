    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's count on our fingers to find the difference between $1000_7$ and $666_7$. \n\nSo first, let's look at the units place. We have 0 in the units place for both numbers. So we don't need to do anything there. \n\nNext, let's look at the $7$'s place. We have $0$ in the $7$'s place for $1000_7$ and $6$ in the $7$'s place for $666_7$. Since we can't subtract $6$ from $0$, let's borrow $1$ from the next place value. \n\nIn the $49$'s place, we have $1$ in $1000_7$ and $6$ in $666_7$. So if we borrow $1$ from the $343$'s place, then we have $11$ in the $49$'s place.\n\nSo now we have $11$ in the $49$'s place and $0$ in the $7$'s place for $1000_7$. \n\nNow we can subtract $6$ from $11$ in the $49$'s place. This leaves us with $5$ in the $49$'s place.\n\nSo, the difference between $1000_7$ and $666_7$ is $530_7$. Yay, we did it!",
