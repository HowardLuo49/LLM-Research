    "solution": "Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8.  Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We need to look for numbers that end in 2, 3, or 4 and are perfect squares. Can you help me find them? Let's start with 2! The only perfect square less than 1000 that ends in 2 is 2. Now let's find the ones that end in 3! The perfect squares less than 1000 that end in 3 are 3 and 33. Lastly, let's look for ones that end in 4. The perfect squares less than 1000 that end in 4 are 4, 24, and 44. Now let's count how many we found! We have a total of 6 perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4. Great job, we did it!",
