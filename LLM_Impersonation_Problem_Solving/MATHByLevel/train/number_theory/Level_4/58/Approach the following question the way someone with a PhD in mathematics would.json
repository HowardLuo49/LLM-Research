    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many perfect squares less than 1000 have a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4?",
    "solution": "Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8.  Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4, we can first consider the possible ones digits of perfect squares. \n\nLet's denote a perfect square as n^2, where n is an integer. The possible ones digits of n^2 can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. This is because the ones digit of the square of a number is determined by the ones digit of the number itself. For example, if the ones digit of n is 2, then the ones digit of n^2 will be 4. \n\nIn this case, we are looking for perfect squares with ones digits of 2, 3, or 4. The only possible ones digits that can result in a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4 are 3 and 8. This is because the only numbers with ones digits of 2, 3, or 4 (excluding 0 and 5) are 2, 3, and 4, and the only perfect square numbers that end in 3 or 8 are 3 and 7.\n\nTherefore, there are 0 perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4.",
