    "solution": "An integer that is equivalent to 6 mod 7 can be written in the form $7k+6$.\n\n$1000$ is the smallest four-digit integer, so we want to solve the inequality $7k+6 \\ge 1000$. This inequality has solution $k \\ge 142$, so since $k$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $k$ is $142$. As a result, the smallest four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is $7(142) + 6 = \\boxed{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7, we need to find the smallest integer n such that n \u2261 6 (mod 7) and n is four digits long.\n\nWe can rewrite the congruence n \u2261 6 (mod 7) as n = 7k + 6, where k is an integer.\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of n that is a four-digit integer, we can start by setting k = 142, which results in n = 7(142) + 6 = 1000. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is 1000.",
