A magic square is an array of numbers in which the sum of the numbers in each row, in each column, and along the two main diagonals are equal. The numbers in the magic square shown are not written in base 10. For what base will this be a magic square?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.75cm);\nfor (int i=0; i<4; ++i) {\ndraw((0,i)--(3,i),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((i,0)--(i,3),linewidth(0.7));\n}\nlabel(\"1\",(1.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(2.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(0.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"4\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"10\",(1.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"11\",(2.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"12\",(2.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"13\",(0.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"14\",(1.5,0),N);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "Let $b$ be the base in which the numbers in the square are expressed. The first row and the first column must have the same sum, which implies that $1+11_b = 4+3$. Writing $11_b$ as $b+1$, we find that $1+b+1 = 7$, which implies $b=\\boxed{5}$.",

We want the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal to be the same.\n\nLet's first add up the numbers in each row:\n- Row 1: 1 + 10 + 14 = 25\n- Row 2: 2 + 11 + 12 = 25\n- Row 3: 3 + 13 + ? = 25 (So we need to find what number goes in this spot)\n\nSince all the rows should add up to the same number in a magic square, we can figure out what the question mark number should be by subtracting the sum of the rows we know from the total sum. In base 10, the missing number would be 25 - (3 + 13) = 9.\n\nSo for this magic square to work in the base we are using, all rows, columns, and diagonals should add up to 25.",
