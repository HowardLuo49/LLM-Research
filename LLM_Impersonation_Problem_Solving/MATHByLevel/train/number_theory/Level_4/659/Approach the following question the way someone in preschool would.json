    "solution": "Setting up the terms in a descending order, the first column gives you a residue of $3$ and you carry over $2$. In the second column there is no residue but you carry over $2$. Finally, in the third column, the sum of $7$ gives you a residue of $1$ and you carry over $1$. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}&_{1}&_{2}&_{2}&\\\\&&5&5&5_6\\\\&&&5&5_6\\\\&+&&&5_6\\\\ \\cline{2-5} &1&1&0&3_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{1103_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, first we have to add the numbers in the ones column. So, 5 + 5 + 5 equals 15. But in base 6, 15 is too big! So, we have to regroup. We can split 15 into 6 and 3. So, we write down 3 in the ones place and carry over a 1 to the sixes place. Next, we add up the numbers in the sixes place. The total is 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 equals 12 in base 10. But in base 6, this is too big too! So, we have to regroup again. We can split 12 into 2 sixes and 0. So, we write down 0 in the sixes place and carry over a 1 to the 36s place. Lastly, we add up the numbers in the 36s place. The total is 1 + 5 equals 6. So, the sum of $555_6$, $55_6$ and $5_6$ in base 6 is $1000_6$.",
