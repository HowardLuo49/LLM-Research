    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$.  Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$.  Since $1000 = 8\\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples.  Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit.  Altogether, $9 \\cdot 125 = \\boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive four-digit integers that are divisible by 8, we need to consider the possible values of the last three digits of the number. Since 8 is a multiple of 2, any number divisible by 8 must also be divisible by 2. This means that the last digit of the number must be even, so we have 5 choices for the last digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).\n\nNext, we need to consider the last two digits of the number. Since 8 is also a multiple of 4, any number divisible by 8 must also be divisible by 4. This means that the last two digits of the number must form a multiple of 4. We can calculate the possible combinations by listing out the multiples of 4 between 0 and 99:\n\n04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96\n\nCounting up the multiples, there are a total of 24 possible combinations for the last two digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive four-digit integers divisible by 8 is $5 \\times 24 = 120$.",
