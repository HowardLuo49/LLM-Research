    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$.  Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$.  Since $1000 = 8\\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples.  Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit.  Altogether, $9 \\cdot 125 = \\boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm...to figure out how big the number is, it has to be a four-digit number. That means it has to be between 1000 and 9999. But we also want the number to be divisible by 8. That means it has to end in 00, 08, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, or 8. I think there are 1250 different numbers we can make that work, but I might need some help counting them all.",
