    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$.  Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$.  Since $1000 = 8\\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples.  Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit.  Altogether, $9 \\cdot 125 = \\boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive four-digit integers that are divisible by 8, we need to consider the possible values for the last three digits of the integer. \n\nSince the integer is divisible by 8, the last three digits must form a number that is divisible by 8. This means that the last three digits must be in the set {000, 008, 016, 024, ..., 992}. \n\nThere are a total of 10 choices for each of the hundreds, tens, and units digit, giving us $10^3 = 1000$ possible combinations of the last three digits.\n\nTherefore, there are 1000 positive four-digit integers that are divisible by 8.",
