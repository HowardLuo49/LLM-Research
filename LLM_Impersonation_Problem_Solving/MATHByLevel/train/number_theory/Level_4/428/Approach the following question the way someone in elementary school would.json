    "solution": "$M=1$, $5$, or $6$ since no other digits have the property that the units digit of $M\\times M$ is $M$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $MM\\times M=NPM$ is $66\\times6=\\boxed{396}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's figure out what the two-digit integer is. Since it has equal digits, we know it must be a number like 11, 22, 33, etc. Let's try the biggest one first, which is 99. \n\nSo $99 \\times 9 = 891$, which is our three-digit integer $NPM$. \n\nSo the greatest possible value of $NPM$ is $\\boxed{891}$.",
