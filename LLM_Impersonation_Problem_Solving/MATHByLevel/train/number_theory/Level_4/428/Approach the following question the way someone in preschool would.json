    "solution": "$M=1$, $5$, or $6$ since no other digits have the property that the units digit of $M\\times M$ is $M$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $MM\\times M=NPM$ is $66\\times6=\\boxed{396}$.",

How about 22?\n\nWhen we multiply 22 by 2, we get 44, which is also not a three-digit number. Let's keep trying with bigger numbers.\n\nWhat about 33? When we multiply 33 by 3, we get 99, which is still not a three-digit number. Let's try one last number - 99.\n\nWhen we multiply 99 by 9, we get 891, which is a three-digit number!
