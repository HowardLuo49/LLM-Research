    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$?",
    "solution": "We find the prime factorization of $4125$. $4125= 11 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3$. Thus, we want $n!$ to have a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and $3$ factors of $5$. The largest prime in the factorization is $11$, so $n \\ge 11$. The exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 11! is only 2, since only the factors 5 and 10 are divisible by 5. Similarly, 12!, 13!, and 14! only have 2 fives in their prime factorizations. Since $15!$ contains a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and three factors of $5$, the least positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the minimum value of $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$, we need to consider the prime factorization of $4125$. \n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of $4125$:\n$4125 = 3 \\times 5^3 \\times 11$\n\nNext, we need to find the prime factorization of $n!$. Since $4125$ contains factors of $3, 5^3, 11$, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ that can accommodate these factors.\n\nThere are plenty of factors of $2$ in $n!$, so we only need to consider the exponent of $5$ and $11$.\n\nIn $n!$, the highest power of $5$ that would be a factor of $n!$ is $5^3$, and the highest power of $11$ that is a factor is $11^1$. \n\nThus, the minimum value of $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$ is when $n = 11$. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$ is $n = 11$.",
