    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. An abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$. What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. To find a number that is abundant but not a multiple of 6, we can start by listing out some abundant numbers and see if any of them are not multiples of 6. \n\nSo, we know that 12 is an abundant number, but it is a multiple of 6. What about 18? Let's calculate the sum of its proper divisors.\n\nThe proper divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. When we add them up, we get 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 18, we can say that 18 is also an abundant number.\n\nBut wait, 18 is a multiple of 6! Let's keep looking. \n\nNext, let's try 20. The proper divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10. Adding them up, we get 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22. Since 22 is greater than 20, we can say that 20 is also an abundant number.\n\nAnd hooray! 20 is not a multiple of 6. So, the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6 is 20. Yay, we did it! \ud83c\udf89",
