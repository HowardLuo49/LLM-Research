    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. An abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$. What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6, we can start by listing out the proper divisors of a few small numbers. Let's start with the number 1: the proper divisors of 1 are 1. Since the sum is not greater than 1, it is not an abundant number. Next, let's try the number 2: the proper divisors of 2 are 1. Since the sum is not greater than 2, it is also not an abundant number. We can continue this process for a few more numbers until we find the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6.",
