    "solution": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7$, we need to determine the values of $A$ and $B in their respective bases.\n\nIn base-5, the number $AA_5$ can be represented as $A*5^1 + A*5^0 = 5A + A = 6A$.\nIn base-7, the number $BB_7$ can be represented as $B*7^1 + B*7^0 = 7B + B = 8B$.\n\nTo find the smallest possible integer that satisfies both equations, we can set $6A = 8B$ and find the smallest values of A and B that satisfy this equation.\n\nThe smallest A and B that satisfy this equation are A = 4 and B = 3.\n\nThus, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ is $44_5 = 4*5^1 + 4*5^0 = 20 + 4 = 24$, and $33_7 = 3*7^1 + 3*7^0 = 21 + 3 = 24$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest base-10 integer that satisfies both representations is 24.",
