    "solution": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7, we need to figure out what the digits A and B can be in their respective bases. The largest digit in base-5 is 4 (since we count from 0 to 4), so A must be less than or equal to 4. Likewise, the largest digit in base-7 is 6 (since we count from 0 to 6), so B must be less than or equal to 6.\n\nTo find the smallest integer for $AA_5$, we can try the smallest possible digits for A, which is 0. So, we have $00_5$. Converting this to base-10 gives us 0.\n\nFor $BB_7$, we can try the smallest possible digits for B, which is 0. So, we have $00_7$. Converting this to base-10 gives us 0.\n\nSo, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7 is 0.",
