    "solution": "The greatest common divisor of the three terms is $5^3$. Factoring $5^3$ out of each term and using the distributive property gives: \\begin{align*}\n15^3+10^4-5^5 &= 5^3\\cdot3^3 + 5^3\\cdot5\\cdot2^4-5^3\\cdot5^2 \\\\\n&= 5^3(3^3+5\\cdot2^4-5^2)\\\\\n& = 5^3(27+80-25) \\\\\n&= 5^3(82)=2\\cdot5^3\\cdot41.\n\\end{align*}So the largest prime factor is $\\boxed{41}$.",

We have to find the largest prime factor of the number $15^3 + 10^4 - 5^5$. \n\nTo do this, we first need to find the value of $15^3$ (which means $15$ multiplied by itself three times), $10^4$ (which means $10$ multiplied by itself four times), and $5^5$ (which means $5$ multiplied by itself five times).\n\n$15^3 = 15 \\times 15 \\times 15 = 3375$\n\n$10^4 = 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10000$\n\n$5^5 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 3125$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into our original expression:\n\n$3375 + 10000 - 3125 = 10250$\n\nNow that we have found the value of the expression, we need to find the largest prime factor of $10250$.\n\nTo do this, we can start by dividing $10250$ by the smallest prime number, which is $2$. \n\n$10250 \u00f7 2 = 5125$\n\nSince $5125$ is not a prime number, we can continue breaking it down by dividing it by the next smallest prime number, which is $5$.\n\n$5125 \u00f7 5 = 1025$\n\n$1025 \u00f7 5 = 205$\n\n$205 \u00f7 5 = 41$\n\nSince $41$ is a prime number and there are no other factors, the largest prime factor of $10250$ is $41$.\n\nTherefore, the largest prime factor of $15^3 + 10^4 - 5^5$ is $\\boxed{41}$.",
