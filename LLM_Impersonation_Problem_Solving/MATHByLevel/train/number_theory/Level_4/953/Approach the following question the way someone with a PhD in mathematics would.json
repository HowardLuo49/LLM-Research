    "solution": "From the Euclidean Algorithm,\n\\[\n\\gcd(a_{n}, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1} - 10a_n).\n\\]We compute $a_{n+1} - 10a_n = \\frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9} - \\frac{10^{n+1}-10}{9} = 1$. Therefore, $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$ share no common factors and $d_n$ is always $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, notice that $a_n = \\frac{10^n-1}{9}$ can be expressed as $a_n = 111...1$, where there are $n$ ones. \n\nTo find $d_n$, we need to calculate $a_{n+1} = \\frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9} = 111...1$, where there are $n+1$ ones. \n\nNow, the greatest common divisor of two numbers will be the largest common factor that divides both numbers. In this case, it is clear that the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ will be 1 for all $n \\geq 1$. This is because $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ are consecutive numbers made up entirely of ones, and the only common factor they share is 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value that $d_n$ can take on is 1.",
