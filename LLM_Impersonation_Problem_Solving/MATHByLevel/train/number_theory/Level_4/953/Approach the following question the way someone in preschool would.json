    "solution": "From the Euclidean Algorithm,\n\\[\n\\gcd(a_{n}, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1} - 10a_n).\n\\]We compute $a_{n+1} - 10a_n = \\frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9} - \\frac{10^{n+1}-10}{9} = 1$. Therefore, $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$ share no common factors and $d_n$ is always $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding the first few terms of $a_n$. We have $a_1 = \\frac{10-1}{9} = 1$, $a_2 = \\frac{100-1}{9} = 11$, $a_3 = \\frac{1000-1}{9} = 111$, and so on. \n\nNow let's look at $d_n$, the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$. Since $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ are consecutive terms in the sequence $1, 11, 111, \\ldots$, their greatest common divisor will always be 1. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value that $d_n$ can take on is $\\boxed{1}$.",
