    "solution": "From the Euclidean Algorithm,\n\\[\n\\gcd(a_{n}, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1} - 10a_n).\n\\]We compute $a_{n+1} - 10a_n = \\frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9} - \\frac{10^{n+1}-10}{9} = 1$. Therefore, $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$ share no common factors and $d_n$ is always $\\boxed{1}$.",

To find the maximum possible value that $d_n$ can take on, we need to look for a pattern in the sequence.\n\nLet's first calculate the first few terms of the sequence:\n$a_1 = \\frac{10^1-1}{9} = 1$\n$a_2 = \\frac{10^2-1}{9} = 11$\n$a_3 = \\frac{10^3-1}{9} = 111$\n$a_4 = \\frac{10^4-1}{9} = 1111$\n\nFrom the calculations above, we can see that $d_n$ is always 1 for consecutive terms in the sequence because the terms themselves are always 1 unit apart.
