    "solution": "Adding $-13$ to both sides of $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ gives $x \\equiv 55-13 \\pmod{34}$. We find $55-13 = 42 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{34}$, so $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{34}$. Thus the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruence is $x = 8$, and all the other solutions can be obtained by a multiple of 34 to 8. The next three such integers are 42, 76, and 110. Since 110 is greater than 100, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers less than 100 that satisfy the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of solutions, I first need to simplify the congruence equation. \n\n$x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ can be rewritten as $x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{34}$ because $55 - 13 = 42$.\n\nNow I need to find all positive integers less than 100 that satisfy the congruence $x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{34}$.\n\nTo find these numbers, I will start with 42 and keep adding 34 until I reach a number greater than 100. \n\n42, 76 (42 + 34), 110 (76 + 34)\n\nSo, the solution to the congruence is $x = 42$.\n\nTherefore, the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ has only one solution when $x = 42$.",
