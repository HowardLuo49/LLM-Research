    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Given that $x$ is a positive integer less than 100, how many solutions does the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ have?",
    "solution": "Adding $-13$ to both sides of $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ gives $x \\equiv 55-13 \\pmod{34}$. We find $55-13 = 42 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{34}$, so $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{34}$. Thus the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruence is $x = 8$, and all the other solutions can be obtained by a multiple of 34 to 8. The next three such integers are 42, 76, and 110. Since 110 is greater than 100, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers less than 100 that satisfy the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes the equation $x + 13$ congruent to 55 when taken modulo 34. This means we want to find a number that, when added to 13, gives us 55 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 34.\n\nLet's try some numbers less than 100 and see if they satisfy the congruence:\n\nFor x = 1, we have 1 + 13 = 14, which is not congruent to 55 modulo 34.\nFor x = 2, we have 2 + 13 = 15, which is not congruent to 55 modulo 34.\nFor x = 3, we have 3 + 13 = 16, which is not congruent to 55 modulo 34.\n...\nFor x = 42, we have 42 + 13 = 55, which is congruent to 55 modulo 34.\n\nSo, the number 42 is the only solution that makes the congruence true. Therefore, there is only 1 solution for the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ with $x$ being a positive integer less than 100.",
