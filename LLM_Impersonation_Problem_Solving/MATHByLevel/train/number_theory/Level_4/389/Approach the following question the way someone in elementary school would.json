    "solution": "$285_{10}$ is only four digits for bases 5 and 6, since only these two bases satisfy $b^{4}>285_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. Testing each of our two cases, we find that $285_{10}= 2120_{5} = 1153_{6}$, so only base $\\boxed{6}$ yields a four-digit representation with an odd units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "So, first we need to figure out what \"base\" means. Base is how many different digits we can use in a number system. In our regular number system (base 10), we have 10 digits (0-9).\n\nNow, we want to find a base where the number 285 has four digits and the final digit is odd. Let's try out different bases and see which one works!\n\nIn base 2 (binary), we only have two digits (0 and 1). So we can't use base 2 because we need at least 4 different digits.\n\nIn base 3, we have three digits (0, 1, and 2). Let's convert 285 to base 3: \n285 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 0 (0), then 95 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2 (2), then 31 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 (1), and finally 10 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 (1). So in base 3, 285 is represented as 10102.\n\n10102 in base 3 has four digits and the final digit is odd (2 is even). So the answer is base 3!",
