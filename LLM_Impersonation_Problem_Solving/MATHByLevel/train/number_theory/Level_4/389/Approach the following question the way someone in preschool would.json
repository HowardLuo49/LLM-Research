    "solution": "$285_{10}$ is only four digits for bases 5 and 6, since only these two bases satisfy $b^{4}>285_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. Testing each of our two cases, we find that $285_{10}= 2120_{5} = 1153_{6}$, so only base $\\boxed{6}$ yields a four-digit representation with an odd units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "Um, let's see... well, I know that the base is 10, because that's what the little subscript number means. And for the number to have four digits and end with an odd number, that means the base would have to be something like 16, because that's the next base after 10 that uses letters and numbers. So, the representation of $285_{10}$ in base 16 would be something like 11D. Yay, we figured it out!",
