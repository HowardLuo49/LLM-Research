    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.  Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first let's figure out how many hot dogs Phil had in total. Since he has 4 left over, it means he must have had 4 more than a multiple of 10 (since each pack has 10 hot dogs). \n\nThis means he must have had 14, 24, 34, 44, or so on hot dogs. But let's keep in mind that he also bought hot dog buns. Since each pack of hot dog buns has 8 buns, he must have bought an even number of packs of hot dog buns so that all the buns would be used up.\n\nLet's test the possibilities for the total number of hot dogs:\n\n- If he had 14 hot dogs, he would have bought 2 packs. But then he would have 16 buns which does not work.\n- If he had 24 hot dogs, he would have bought 3 packs. This means he would have bought 3 packs of hot dogs as well, totaling 30 hot dogs. This is the answer! \n\nSo, the second smallest number of packs of hot dogs Phil could have bought is 3.",
