    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.  Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out how many hot dogs Phil bought. Since each pack has 10 hot dogs and he has 4 left over, we know he bought a total of 10x + 4 hot dogs, where x is the number of packs he bought.\n\nNow let's figure out how many buns he bought. Since each pack of buns has 8 buns, we know he bought a total of 8x buns.\n\nIn order for Phil to have a matching number of hot dogs and buns, the difference between the number of hot dogs and the number of buns must be a multiple of 10 (since each pack of hot dogs has 10 hot dogs). \n\nThe SECOND smallest number of packs he could have bought will have the smallest difference that is a multiple of 10, other than 0. In this case, the smallest difference is 6 (10 hot dogs - 8 buns = 2, and since he has 4 extra hot dogs, the difference is 6).\n\nTherefore, Phil could have bought 6 packs of hot dogs in order to have 4 hot dogs left over.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 6?: First, let's figure out how many hot dogs Phil bought.
