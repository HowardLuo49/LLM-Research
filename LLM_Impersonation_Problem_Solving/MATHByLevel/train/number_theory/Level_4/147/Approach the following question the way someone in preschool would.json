    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.  Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count together! Phil had 4 hot dogs left over, so that means he didn't use all the hot dogs he bought. We know each pack has 10 hot dogs in it. So, let's start counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30... But wait, Phil had 4 hot dogs left over, so that means he must have bought one more pack of hot dogs. So, the second smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought is 4 packs! Great job counting, friends!",

Phil had 4 hot dogs left over, so that means he didn't use all the hot dogs he bought. We know each pack has 10 hot dogs in it. So, let's start counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30...
