    "solution": "We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\\leq b \\leq 5.$ So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.",

Since it's a $4$-digit number, we know that $b^3 \\leq 197 < b^4$. \n\nLet's try out some numbers! If $b = 2$, $2^3 = 8$ which is too small. If $b = 3$, $3^3 = 27$ which is also too small.
