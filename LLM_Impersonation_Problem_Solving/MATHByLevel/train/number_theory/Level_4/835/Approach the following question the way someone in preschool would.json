    "solution": "We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\\leq b \\leq 5.$ So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So we have the number $197$ and we need to write it in a different way using the number $b$. And we know that the new way has $4$ digits. So $b$ has to be greater than or equal to $2$. Let's see how many choices we have for $b$ so that we can write $197$ with $4$ digits in that base. Umm, let me think... I think the answer is... umm... I need to count... umm... oh! I got it! The number of possible values for $b$ is $\\boxed{5}$! Yay!",
