Suppose that $b$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to $2.$ When $197$ is converted to base $b$, the resulting representation has $4$ digits. What is the number of possible values for $b$?",
    "solution": "We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\\leq b \\leq 5.$ So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of possible values for $b$, we first need to determine the range of values that $b$ can take. \n\nSince the conversion of $197$ to base $b$ results in a $4$-digit number, we can write:\n\n$197 = d_3 b^3 + d_2 b^2 + d_1 b + d_0$\n\nwhere $d_3, d_2, d_1, d_0$ are the digits when $197$ is expressed in base $b$.\n\nWe are given that $b\\geq 2$, so the largest possible digit in base $b$ would be $b-1$. This means that $d_3 < b$, $d_2 < b$, $d_1 < b$, and $d_0 < b$.\n\nThe smallest possible $d_3$ digit would be $1$ in order for the $4$-digit number to begin with $1$, so $d_3 \\geq 1$. \n\nThe largest value of $d_3$ can be is $b-1$, since it is the largest digit of base $b$. From this, we can see that $b-1 < 197$ or $b < 198$.\n\nTherefore, the range of possible values for $b$ is $2 \\leq b < 198$.\n\nSince $b$ is a positive integer, we need to count the number of integers in this range. There are $197-2+1 = 196$ possible values for $b$. \n\nThus, the number of possible values for $b$ is $\\boxed{196}$.",
