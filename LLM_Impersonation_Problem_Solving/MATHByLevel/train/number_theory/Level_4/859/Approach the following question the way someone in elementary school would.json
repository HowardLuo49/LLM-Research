    "solution": "If the prime factorization of an integer is given as $p_1^{a_1}\\cdot p_2^{a_2}\\cdot p_3^{a_3}\\cdot...$ the number of divisors will be: $$(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)...$$ So, we need to factor 14 in a similar manner to the expression above.  We can write: $$14=(13+1)=(1+1)(6+1)$$ The smallest integer in the first case will be $2^{13}$, and the smallest in the second case will be $2^6\\cdot 3^1=192$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{192}$ is clearly the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors, we need to think about the factors of numbers. First, we need to figure out what types of numbers have exactly 14 divisors. The number 14 can be written as 2 x 7. This means that the number needs to have 2 prime factors and one of those prime factors needs to be raised to the power of 6, while the other prime factor needs to be raised to the power of 1.\n\nSo, we need a number that can be written as a^6 * b^1, where a and b are prime numbers. The smallest prime numbers we can use are 2 and 3. So, let's try 2^6 * 3^1. This gives us 64 * 3 = 192. So, the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 divisors is 192.",
