    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",

Oh, and 2 and 1002 are also factors. Let's keep going!\n\nAfter some thinking and maybe some help from my teacher, I found the factors 4, 501 and 2004! Cool!\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum possible value of the sum of these numbers. So, we add them up: 4 + 501 + 2004 = 2509!\n\nYay! The minimum possible sum of these numbers is 2509!",
