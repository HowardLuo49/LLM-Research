    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The product of positive integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ equals 2004. What is the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$?",
    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In this problem, we are asked to find the minimum possible value of the sum $x+y+z$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers that satisfy the equation $xyz=2004$.\n\nTo minimize the sum $x+y+z$, we can start by considering the prime factorization of 2004. We have $2004=2^2 \\times 3 \\times 167$. \n\nTo minimize the sum $x+y+z$, we want to distribute the prime factors of 2004 as evenly as possible among $x$, $y$, and $z$. This suggests that we should aim for $x$, $y$, and $z$ to be as close to each other as possible in order to minimize their sum.\n\nTo achieve this, we should divide 2004 among $x$, $y$, and $z$ as evenly as possible. One way to do this is to let $x=2$, $y=2$, and $z=501$, as $2\\times2\\times501=2004$. \n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of the sum $x+y+z$ is $2+2+501=505$.",
