    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The product of positive integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ equals 2004. What is the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$?",
    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all positive integers and their product is 2004. To find the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$, we need to think about how to break down 2004 into three numbers. \n\nWe can start by finding the prime factorization of 2004: $2004 = 2^2 * 3 * 167$. Now we need to find a way to divide these prime factors into three numbers to minimize the sum.\n\nTo get the minimum sum, we want the numbers to be as close as possible in size. So, we can divide the prime factors as follows: $x = 2^2 = 4$, $y = 3$, and $z = 167$. This gives us a sum of $4 + 3 + 167 = 174$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$ is 174.",
