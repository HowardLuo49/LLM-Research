    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Vinny wrote down all the single-digit base-$b$ numbers and added them in base $b$, getting $34_b$.\n\nWhat is $b$?",
    "solution": "The single-digit base-$b$ numbers are $$0,1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1.$$We can ignore the $0$. If we pair off the rest of the numbers from either end ($1$ with $b-1$, $2$ with $b-2$, and so on), we get a bunch of pairs that add up to $b$. If $b$ is even, we also get one leftover number in the middle, which must be $\\frac b2$.\n\nThus, the sum of all the single-digit base-$b$ numbers is a multiple of $b$ when $b$ is odd; when $b$ is even, it's a multiple of $b$ plus $\\frac b2$. In the first case ($b$ odd), the units digit of the sum (when written in base $b$) is $0$. In the second case ($b$ even), the units digit is $\\frac b2$.\n\nGiven that Vinny's sum has a units digit of $4$ when written in base $b$, we conclude that $\\frac b2=4$, which yields $b=\\boxed{8}$.\n\nWe can check this answer by summing the single-digit base-$8$ numbers, which are $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7$. Their sum is $28$, which is $34_8$ in base $8$.",
    "gpt_response": "In base $b$, the single-digit numbers are $0, 1, 2, ..., b-1$. To find the sum of all these numbers in base $b$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$, where $S$ is the sum of the series, $n$ is the number of terms in the series, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, there are $b$ single-digit numbers, $a_1 = 0$, and $a_n = b-1$. Therefore, the sum of all the single-digit base-$b$ numbers is:\n\n$S = \\frac{b(0 + b-1)}{2} = \\frac{b(b-1)}{2} = 34_b$\n\nSolving for $b$ in the equation $\\frac{b(b-1)}{2} = 34_b$:\n\n$b(b-1) = 68$\n\n$b^2 - b - 68 = 0$\n\nNow we can factor this quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to find the roots of $b$. The solutions will be the values of $b$ that satisfy the original equation.",
