The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 50, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 5) \\cdot x(x + 5)}{50} = \\frac{x(x + 5)^2}{50}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nWe are told that the greatest common divisor is $x + 5$, so $x + 5$ divides 50.  The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5.  When $x = 5$, the other number is $5 \\cdot 10^2/50 = 10$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 10 and 50 is 10, and $x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10$.  The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first remember what the greatest common divisor and least common multiple mean. The greatest common divisor is the largest number that can divide both numbers evenly. The least common multiple is the smallest number that both numbers can divided into evenly.\n\nIf one of the numbers is 50 and the greatest common divisor is $(x+5)$, this means that 50 can be divided by $(x+5)$. Therefore, $(x+5)$ must be a factor of 50.\n\nLet's find the factors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest possible value, we can start by trying the smallest factor, which is 1. However, if we set $(x+5)=1$, we get $x=-4$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nNext, let's try $(x+5)=2$. This gives us $x=-3$, which is also not a positive integer.\n\nContinuing in this way, we discover that $(x+5)=5$ gives us $x=0$, which is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other number is 0.",
