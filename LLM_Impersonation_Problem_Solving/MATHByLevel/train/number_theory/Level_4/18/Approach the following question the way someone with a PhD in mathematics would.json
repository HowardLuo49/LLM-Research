The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 50, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 5) \\cdot x(x + 5)}{50} = \\frac{x(x + 5)^2}{50}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nWe are told that the greatest common divisor is $x + 5$, so $x + 5$ divides 50.  The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5.  When $x = 5$, the other number is $5 \\cdot 10^2/50 = 10$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 10 and 50 is 10, and $x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10$.  The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two integers. \n\nLet the two positive integers be $a$ and $b$, with GCD $(a,b) = x+5$ and LCM $(a,b) = x(x+5)$. We know that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves, i.e. $(a,b) \\times [a,b] = ab$. \n\nGiven that one of the numbers is 50, we can assume without loss of generality that $a = 50$ and rewrite the equation as $(50,b) \\times 50b = 50b^2 = 50 \\times 50 \\times (x)(x+5)$. Simplifying, we get $b^2 = 50(x)(x+5)$. \n\nSince $b$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for $b$ must be obtained by finding the smallest possible value for $x$. In order to do this, we prime factorize 50 as $2 \\times 5^2$. \n\nConsidering that $(a,b) = 55$, we can equate $x+5 = 55$, which implies that $x = 50$.
