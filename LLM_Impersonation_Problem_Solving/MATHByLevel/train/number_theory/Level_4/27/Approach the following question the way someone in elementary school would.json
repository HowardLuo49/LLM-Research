    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24,a+4) \\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24-(a+5)(a+4),a+4)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24-(a^2+9a+20),a+4)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(4,a+4).\n\\end{align*} Since $4$ is a factor of $a$ and thus $a+4$, the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of $a^2+9a+24$ and $a+4$, we first need to find a number that can divide both of them without leaving a remainder. \n\nSince $a$ is a multiple of $1428$, we can let $a=1428n$, where $n$ is a whole number.
