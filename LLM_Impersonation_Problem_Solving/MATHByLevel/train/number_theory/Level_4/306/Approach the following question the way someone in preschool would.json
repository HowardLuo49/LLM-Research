    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$. The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find the product of the list PQRS first. P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19. 16 x 17 x 18 x 19 = 104652. Now, we need to find the only other four-letter list with a product equal to 104652. \n\nLet's think of numbers that multiply to 104652. Maybe we can start with big numbers and try dividing by smaller numbers. \n\nHmm... I know that 104652 is even, so it's divisible by 2. Let's try that. 104652 \u00f7 2 = 52326. Now, let's try dividing by 2 again. 52326 \u00f7 2 = 26163. That's still a big number, so let's try dividing by 3. 26163 \u00f7 3 = 8721. Let's keep going. 8721 \u00f7 3 = 2907. That's kind of a big number too. Let's try dividing by 3 again. 2907 \u00f7 3 = 969. Hmm... I like that number. \n\n969 = 9 x 9 x 9 x 11. However, we need to find letters that correspond to these numbers. 9 is not assigned a number yet, but we can substitute it with 'I' since 'I' is the 9th letter of the alphabet. 11 corresponds to 'K'.\n\nTherefore, the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list PQRS is IIKK.",
