    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$. The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$, we need to first calculate the product of the list $PQRS$. \n\n$P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19$ \n\nThus, the product of $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19) = 232848$. \n\nNext, we need to find all the possible ways to factor 232848 into four distinct factors. \n\n$232848 = 2^4 * 3 * 7 * 29 * 31$\n\nNow, we need to find the four distinct letters whose values multiply to 232848. We can do this by finding all the possible combinations of four distinct factors of 232848 and then finding the corresponding letters for these factors. \n\nAfter some computation and substitution, the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$ is $CGJZ$. \n\nTherefore, the four-letter list in alphabetical order is $CGJZ$.",
