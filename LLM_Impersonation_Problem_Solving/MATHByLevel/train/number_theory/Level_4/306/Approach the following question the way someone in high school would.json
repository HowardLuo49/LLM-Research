    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$. The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the other four-letter list with a product equal to $252$, we need to think about the factors of $252$. The prime factorization of $252$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. \n\nNow, we need to find a way to create a four-letter list with prime factors that will multiply to $252$. \n\nLooking at our options, we see that $252 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. \n\nThe closest option we have in our list of letters is $7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19 = 2722327$. \n\nSo, the only other four-letter list with a product equal to $252$ is $QSVY$ since $(17)(19)(22)(25) = 2722327$.",
