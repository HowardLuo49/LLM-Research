    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$. The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find the product of the list PQRS. P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19. The product of PQRS is $(16)(17)(18)(19)= 243024$.\n\nNow, we need to find another four-letter list with the same product. We can try to find the factors of 243024 to see which ones can be expressed as the values of the letters.\n\nLet's see that 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are factors of 243024. If we try to find a combination of these numbers that equals 243024, we can see that 243024=1 x 6 x 8 x 5076. Thus, if we translate these factors into letters and then arrange them in alphabetical order, we have AFHU. \n\nTherefore, the other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list PQRS is AFHU.",
