We know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.  $Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.  $Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $K$ so that $Z$ is a perfect square, we need to remember that a perfect square is when you can multiply a number by itself to get the answer. \n\nIn this case, we know that $Z = K \\times K^2$. \n\nWe can rewrite this as $Z = K^3$. \n\nThis means that for $Z$ to be a perfect square, $K$ must be a number that can be multiplied by itself twice to get the answer. \n\nSo $K$ must be a cube root of $Z$. \n\nSince $Z$ is a number between 500 and 1000, we can guess and check different values of $K$ to see which one makes $Z$ a perfect square. \n\nWe can start by trying $K = 8$ because $8^3 = 512$, which is close to 500. \n\nLet's substitute $K = 8$ into the equation: \n\n$Z = 8 \\times 8^2 = 8 \\times 64 = 512$\n\nSince $Z = 512$ is not a perfect square, we can try a different value of $K$. \n\nLet's try $K = 9$ because $9^3 = 729$, which is closer to 500. \n\nSubstitute $K = 9$ into the equation: \n\n$Z = 9 \\times 9^2 = 9 \\times 81 = 729$\n\nSince $729$ is a perfect square (the square of 27), $K = 9$ is the value we're looking for.",
