We know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.  $Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.  $Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square, we need to look at the factors of $Z$ in the equation $Z = K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhen we multiply two numbers together, we get the product. In this case, $Z$ is the product of $K$ and $K^2.$ To make $Z$ a perfect square, we need at least one factor to be squared.\n\nIn this equation, $Z$ is already written as $K$ multiplied by $K^2.$ This means that $Z$ has at least two factors of $K.$ Since $Z$ is a perfect square, it means $K$ raised to some power should equal the square root of $Z.$ \n\nIn other words, we need to find a value of $K$ so that when $K$ is multiplied by $K^2$, we get a full square number. We can notice that $K = 5$ works because $5 \\times 5^2 = 5 \\times 25 = 125 = 5^3$ which is a perfect cube.\n\nSo, the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square is $K = 5.$",
