    "solution": "We begin by finding the fractional forms of the decimals, $0.\\overline{789}$, $0.\\overline{456}$, and $0.\\overline{123}$. Let $x=0.\\overline{789}$, then $1000x=789.\\overline{789}$ and $1000x-x=789.\\overline{789}-0.789 \\implies 999x - 789$. Therefore, $0.\\overline{789}=\\frac{789}{999}$. We use the same method to find that $0.\\overline{456}=\\frac{456}{999}$ and $0.\\overline{123}=\\frac{123}{999}$.  Next, we perform the indicated operations, knowing that $0.\\overline{789}-0.\\overline{456}-0.\\overline{123}=\\frac{789}{999}-\\frac{456}{999}-\\frac{123}{999}$. This equals $\\frac{210}{999}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{70}{333}}$, when both the numerator and the denominator are divided by $3$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to understand what the symbol over the numbers mean. The line over the numbers means that the numbers repeat indefinitely. So $0.\\overline{789}$ means $0.789789789...$, $0.\\overline{456}$ means $0.456456456...$, and $0.\\overline{123}$ means $0.123123123...$\n\nTo solve the problem, let's call $x = 0.\\overline{789}$, $y = 0.\\overline{456}$, and $z = 0.\\overline{123}$. \n\nWe can then rewrite the given expression as:\n\n$x - y - z = (0.\\overline{789} - 0.\\overline{456} - 0.\\overline{123})$\n$= (x) - (y) - (z)$\n$= (0.789789789...) - (0.456456456...) - (0.123123123...)$\n$= 0.666...(remove 123 from each number)$\n\nTherefore, the value of $0.\\overline{789}-0.\\overline{456}-0.\\overline{123}$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
