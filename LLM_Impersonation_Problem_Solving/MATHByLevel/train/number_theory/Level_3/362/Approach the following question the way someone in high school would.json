    "solution": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integer values of $x$ will make $10 \\star x$ a positive integer, we need to evaluate $10 \\star x$ and see for which $x$ the result is an integer.\n\nLet's plug in $10$ for $a$ and $x$ for $b$ in the given operation: $a \\star b = a^2 \\div b$.\nThis gives us $10 \\star x = 10^2 \\div x = 100 \\div x$.\n\nFor $100 \\div x$ to be a positive integer, $x$ must divide $100$ evenly. We can find all the factors of $100$ and check which ones make $100 \\div x$ a positive integer.\n\nThe factors of $100$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50,$ and $100$.\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{9}$ integer values of $x$ that will make $10 \\star x$ a positive integer.",
