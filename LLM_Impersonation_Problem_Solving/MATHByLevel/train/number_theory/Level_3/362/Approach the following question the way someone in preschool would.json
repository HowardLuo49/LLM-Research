    "solution": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to remember what $\\star$ means. It's like a special way of combining numbers. So when we see $10 \\star x$, it means we're going to do $10$ squared divided by $x$. \n\nWe want the answer to be a positive integer, which means it should be a whole number greater than zero. So let's think about when $10 \\star x$ will be a positive integer.\n\nWhen $10 \\star x$ is a positive integer, that means $10$ squared should be divisible by $x$. So we need to find out how many factors $100$ has.\n\nThe factors of $100$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100$. So there are $9$ integer values of $x$ that will make $10 \\star x$ a positive integer. \n\nI hope that makes sense! Math can be fun :)",
