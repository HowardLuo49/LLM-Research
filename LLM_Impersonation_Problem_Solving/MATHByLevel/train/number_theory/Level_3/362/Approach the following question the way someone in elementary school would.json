    "solution": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "In this problem, we need to find how many values of $x$ will make $10 \\star x$ a positive integer. To do this, we first need to understand what the operation $\\star$ does. The operation $\\star$ means we square the first number and then divide by the second number.\n\nSo, $10 \\star x$ means we need to square 10 and then divide by $x$. In other words, we need to find when $10^2 \\div x$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo find how many integer values of $x$ will make this expression a positive integer, we can start by listing out the factors of 100 (10 squared).\n\nThe factors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100. If we divide 100 by any of these factors, we will get a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $\\boxed{9}$ integer values of $x$ that will make $10\\star x$ a positive integer.",
