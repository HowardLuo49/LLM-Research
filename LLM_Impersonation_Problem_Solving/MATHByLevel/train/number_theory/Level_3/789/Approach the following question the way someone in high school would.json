    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{33}{555}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.0\\overline{594}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a three-digit repeating block. We want to find the $110$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $110$ is divided by $3$ is $2$. Therefore, the $111$th digit is the second digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $111$th digit after the decimal point of $\\frac{33}{555}$, we can first simplify the fraction.  Since both $33$ and $555$ are divisible by $33$, we can simplify the fraction to $\\frac{1}{15}$.\n\nWhen we divide $1$ by $15$, we get $0.06666666...$ as the decimal representation. \n\nSince the pattern $0.0666...$ repeats every $3$ digits, and $111$ is a multiple of $3$, the $111$th digit after the decimal point will be the same as the first digit after the decimal point, which is $0$. \n\nTherefore, the $111$th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{33}{555}$ is $0$.",
