    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{33}{555}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.0\\overline{594}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a three-digit repeating block. We want to find the $110$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $110$ is divided by $3$ is $2$. Therefore, the $111$th digit is the second digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 111th digit after the decimal point in the decimal form of $\\frac{33}{555}$, first we need to divide $33$ by $555$ using long division. \n\nWhen we divide $33$ by $555$, we get $0.0594594594594594...$. \n\nSo, the decimal form of $\\frac{33}{555}$ is $0.0594594594594594...$. \n\nTo find the 111th digit after the decimal point, we count the decimals after $0.0594594594594594...$. \n\nSo the 111th digit after the decimal point is $9$.",
