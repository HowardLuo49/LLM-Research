    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{33}{555}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.0\\overline{594}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a three-digit repeating block. We want to find the $110$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $110$ is divided by $3$ is $2$. Therefore, the $111$th digit is the second digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's play a game! We have to find the $111$th digit after the decimal point in the decimal form of $\\frac{33}{555}$. First, we need to divide $33$ by $555$ to get the decimal form. I know that $33$ divided by $555$ is $0.059459459...$ Oh, I see a pattern! The digit $5$ repeats every three digits. So, if we keep counting by threes, we can find the $111$th digit. Let's see...$111$ divided by $3$ is $37$, with a remainder of $0$. That means the $111$th digit after the decimal point is $5$. Yay, we did it!",
