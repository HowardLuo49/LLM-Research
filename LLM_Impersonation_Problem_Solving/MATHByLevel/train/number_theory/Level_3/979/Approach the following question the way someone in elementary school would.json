    "solution": "Prime factorize $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The sum of the the positive factors of 48 is $1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4+3+2\\cdot3+2^2\\cdot3+2^3\\cdot3+2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{124}$. Note that this also could be obtained from multiplying $(2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4)(3^0+3^1)=(31)(4)$, since expanding the left-hand side of this equation yields the left-hand side of the previous equation.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the positive factors of 48, we need to add up all the numbers that can divide evenly into 48. These numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48. \n\nSo, we just add up all these numbers to find the sum of the positive factors of 48:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 24 + 48 = 124\n\nTherefore, the sum of the positive factors of 48 is 124.",
