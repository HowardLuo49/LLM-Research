    "solution": "Prime factorize $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The sum of the the positive factors of 48 is $1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4+3+2\\cdot3+2^2\\cdot3+2^3\\cdot3+2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{124}$. Note that this also could be obtained from multiplying $(2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4)(3^0+3^1)=(31)(4)$, since expanding the left-hand side of this equation yields the left-hand side of the previous equation.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the positive factors of 48, we first need to determine all the factors of 48. \n\nThe factors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48. \n\nTo find the sum of these factors, we simply add them all together:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 24 + 48 = 124\n\nTherefore, the sum of the positive factors of 48 is 124.",
