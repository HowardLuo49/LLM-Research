    "solution": "Prime factorize $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The sum of the the positive factors of 48 is $1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4+3+2\\cdot3+2^2\\cdot3+2^3\\cdot3+2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{124}$. Note that this also could be obtained from multiplying $(2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4)(3^0+3^1)=(31)(4)$, since expanding the left-hand side of this equation yields the left-hand side of the previous equation.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the positive factors of 48, we need to first list out all the factors of 48. The factors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48.\n\nNow, we can add all these factors together to find the sum. \n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 24 + 48 = 124\n\nSo, the sum of the positive factors of 48 is 124.",
