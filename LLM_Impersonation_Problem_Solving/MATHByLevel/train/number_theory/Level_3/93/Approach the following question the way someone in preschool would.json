    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. When the base-12 integer $1531_{12}$ is divided by $8$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We have $$1531_{12} = 12^3 + 5\\cdot 12^2 + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Note that $12^2$ is divisible by $8$, so $$1531_{12} = (\\text{a multiple of 8}) + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Therefore, the remainder upon dividing $1531_{12}$ by $8$ is the same as the remainder upon dividing $3\\cdot 12+1$ by $8$. This remainder is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the remainder when $1531_{12}$ is divided by $8, we can count using our fingers!\n\nFirst, let's convert $1531_{12}$ into base-10. We know that $1 \\times 12^3 + 5 \\times 12^2 + 3 \\times 12^1 + 1 \\times 12^0 = 1729_{10}$.\n\nNow, we can divide 1729 by 8 using our fingers. When we do this, we find that 1729 divided by 8 is 216 with a remainder of 1!\n\nSo, the remainder when $1531_{12}$ is divided by 8 is 1. Yay!",
