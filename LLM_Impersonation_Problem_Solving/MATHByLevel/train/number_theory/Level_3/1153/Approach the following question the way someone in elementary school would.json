    "solution": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what numbers are divisible by 18. To be divisible by 18, a number has to be divisible by both 9 and 2. 9 is divisible by 3, so if a number is divisible by 9 and 2, it must also be divisible by 3 and 2. Now let's think about what numbers between 8 and 8.1 have a cube root: 8 has a cube root of 2, and 8.1 has a cube root of 2.01007. So we need to find a number that is divisible by 18, has a cube root between 2 and 2.01007, and is a positive integer. One way we can do this is to find the cube root of each number between 8 and 8.1 and see if any of them are close to whole numbers. When we do this, we find that the cube root of 8.64 is 2.08, which is close to a whole number. So 8.64 is our answer!",
