    "solution": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the positive integer we are looking for be x. Since x is divisible by 18, we have x = 18k for some integer k.\n\nWe are also given that the cube root of x is a number between 8 and 8.1. Thus, we have 8 < (18k)^(1/3) < 8.1.\n\nCubing both sides of the inequality, we get 512 < 18k < 531.441.\n\nDividing through by 18, we have 28.44 recurring < k < 29.52 recurring.\n\nSince k must be an integer, the only possible value for k is 29.\n\nTherefore, x = 18*29 = 522. \n\nThus, the positive integer we are looking for is 522.",
