    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Find a positive integer that is divisible by 18 and whose cube root is a number between 8 and 8.1.",
    "solution": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find a positive integer that is divisible by 18, we need to first think of the factors of 18. 18 can be broken down into 2 x 3 x 3.\n\nNext, since we want to find a number whose cube root is between 8 and 8.1, we will look for a number that, when cubed, falls between 512 (8 cubed) and 531.441 (8.1 cubed).\n\nOne possible number to try is 18 x 9 = 162. The cube root of 162 is approximately 5.67, which is not in the range we are looking for.\n\nAnother possible number to try is 18 x 27 = 486. The cube root of 486 is approximately 7.73, which is also not in the desired range.\n\nFinally, we try 18 x 27 x 3 = 13122. The cube root of 13122 is approximately 22.03, which falls within the range of 8 and 8.1.\n\nTherefore, the positive integer that is divisible by 18 and has a cube root between 8 and 8.1 is 13122.",
