    "solution": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer.",

The cube root of 8 is 2, and the cube root of 8.1 is a bit more than 2. So, we want to find a number whose cube root is between 2 and a bit more than 2!\n\nAfter trying out a few of the numbers, we find that 54 is our special number!
