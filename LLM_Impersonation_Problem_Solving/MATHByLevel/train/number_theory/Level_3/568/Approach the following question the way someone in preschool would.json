    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $4a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 21. One approach is to check integers of the form $21k+1$, where $k\\geq 0$ is an integer, for divisibility by 4. We find that 22 and 43 are not divisible by 4, but $21(3)+1=64$ is equal to $4\\times 16$. Thus $\\boxed{16}$ times 4 is congruent to 1 modulo 21.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular inverse of 4, we need to find a number that when multiplied by 4 gives us a remainder of 1 when divided by 21.\n\nLet's start by counting by 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 0, 4...\n\nWe see that when we multiply 5 by 4, we get 20, which is one less than a multiple of 21.
