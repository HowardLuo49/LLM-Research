    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $4a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 21. One approach is to check integers of the form $21k+1$, where $k\\geq 0$ is an integer, for divisibility by 4. We find that 22 and 43 are not divisible by 4, but $21(3)+1=64$ is equal to $4\\times 16$. Thus $\\boxed{16}$ times 4 is congruent to 1 modulo 21.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ as someone in high school, we can use trial and error. We need to find a number $x$ such that $4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$.\n\nLet's start by trying $x = 1$: $4 \\cdot 1 = 4 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$.\n\nNext, let's try $x = 2$: $4 \\cdot 2 = 8 \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$.\n\nContinuing in this manner, we eventually find that $4 \\cdot 13 = 52 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$. Therefore, the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ is $13$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",
