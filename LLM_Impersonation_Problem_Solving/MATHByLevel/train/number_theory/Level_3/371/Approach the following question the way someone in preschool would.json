    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, that sounds like a tricky question! Let's break it down into smaller parts to make it easier.\n\nFirst, let's think about what three consecutive numbers might look like. Hmm, maybe we can start with the number 1. Then the next two numbers would be 2 and 3. So, the sum of those three numbers would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nNow, let's try another set of three consecutive numbers. Let's start with 2 this time. The next two numbers would be 3 and 4. So, the sum of those numbers would be 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\n\nHmm, it seems like the sum of three consecutive numbers could be different each time. But there must be a prime number that can divide into every sum of three consecutive numbers.\n\nLet's see...maybe we can try some more sets of three consecutive numbers and see if we notice a pattern. I think if we keep trying different sets, we might find the prime number that is a factor of every sum.\n\nLet's keep exploring and see what we find!",
