    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the three consecutive integers be n, n+1, and n+2. The sum of these integers is 3n+3, which can be factored as 3(n+1). \n\nSince 3 is a prime number, it is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers. Therefore, the number in question is 3.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: Let the three consecutive integers be n, n+1, and n+2. The sum of these integers is 3n+3, which can be factored as 3(n+1). \n\nSince 3 is a prime number, it is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers. Therefore, the number in question is 3.",
