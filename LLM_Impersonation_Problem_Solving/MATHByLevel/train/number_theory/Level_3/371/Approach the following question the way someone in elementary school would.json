    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Hi! To find the prime number, we first need to think about what it means to have consecutive integers. Consecutive integers are numbers that come one after the other, like 1, 2, 3 or 5, 6, 7.\n\nNow, let's add three consecutive integers together to see what we get. For example, if we add 1 + 2 + 3, we get 6. If we add 2 + 3 + 4, we get 9. And if we add 3 + 4 + 5, we get 12.\n\nDo you notice anything about these sums? They all have something in common - a prime number is a factor of each one! That's pretty cool, right?\n\nThe prime number that is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers is 3. So, 3 is the number we were looking for. Yay, we did it!",
