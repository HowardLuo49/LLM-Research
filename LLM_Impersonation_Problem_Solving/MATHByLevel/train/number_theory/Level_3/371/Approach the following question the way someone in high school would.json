    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's think about this problem. We are looking for a prime number that is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers. \n\nFirst, let's generate some sum of three consecutive integers:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n2 + 3 + 4 = 9\n3 + 4 + 5 = 12\n4 + 5 + 6 = 15\n...\n\nNow, let's find the factors of each sum:\n\n6 has factors 1, 2, 3, 6\n9 has factors 1, 3, 9\n12 has factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n15 has factors 1, 3, 5, 15\n\nFrom this, we can see that the only prime number that is a factor of every sum is 3. This is because each sum can be written as 3n for some integer n. \n\nTherefore, the prime number that is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers is 3.",
