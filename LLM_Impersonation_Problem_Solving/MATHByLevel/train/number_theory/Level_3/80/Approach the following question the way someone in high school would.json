    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A $\\textit{composite number}$ is a number that has two or more prime factors. The number 87 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers in many ways. What is the minimum positive difference between two such numbers?",
    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so a composite number is a number that has at least two prime factors. So we need to find two composite numbers that add up to 87. Let's start by listing out some composite numbers: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, and 87.\n\nNow, let's try to find two composite numbers that add up to 87. We can start with 27 and 60. The difference between 60 and 27 is 33, which is quite large. Let's try another set of numbers. How about 24 and 63? The difference is 39, which is also pretty big. Let's keep trying different combinations until we find the smallest difference.\n\nAfter trying a few more combinations, we find that 39 and 48 add up to 87, with a difference of 9. So the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that add up to 87 is 9.",
