    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A $\\textit{composite number}$ is a number that has two or more prime factors. The number 87 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers in many ways. What is the minimum positive difference between two such numbers?",
    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find two composite numbers that add up to 87, we can try different combinations until we find two that work. Let's start by finding a composite number that is close to half of 87. \n\nHalf of 87 is 43.5, so let's try 42 and 45. Both 42 and 45 are composite numbers because they have more than one prime factor. \n\nThe difference between 42 and 45 is 45 - 42 = 3. \n\nTherefore, the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that add up to 87 is 3.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: To find two composite numbers that add up to 87, we can try different combinations until we find two that work.
