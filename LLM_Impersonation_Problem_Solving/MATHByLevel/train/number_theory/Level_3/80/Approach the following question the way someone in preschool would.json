The number 87 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers in many ways. What is the minimum positive difference between two such numbers?",
    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",

Some examples are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and so on.\n\nNow, let's try to find two composite numbers that add up to 87. After trying some combinations, we see that 39 and 48 are two composite numbers that add up to 87.\n\nTo find the minimum positive difference between two such numbers, we subtract the smallest composite number from the largest composite number. \n\n48 - 39 = 9\n\nSo, the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that add up to 87 is 9!
