    "solution": "The base 5 number $34x1_5$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 5^3 + 4 \\cdot 5^2 + x \\cdot 5 + 1 = 5x + 476$.  The base-5 digit $x$ must be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Among these values, only $x = \\boxed{4}$ makes $5x + 476$ divisible by 31.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, this is a fun number problem! Let's see if we can figure it out. If $34x1_5$ is divisible by 31, that means when we divide $34x1_5$ by 31, we'll get a whole number answer. Let's try it out! Let's write out $34x1_5$ in base 10 to make it easier to understand: \n\n$3 * 5^3 + 4 * 5^2 + x * 5^1 + 1 * 5^0$\n\nIf we convert $34x1_5$ to base 10, we get: \n\n$3 * 125 + 4 * 25 + x * 5 + 1 * 1 = 375 + 100 + 5x + 1 = 476 + 5x$\n\nNow, let's divide $476 + 5x$ by 31. When we do that, we want to get a whole number answer. So, we can set up the division problem like this: \n\n$476 + 5x$ \u00f7 31 = N\n\nNow, let's try some numbers for $x$ and see which one works so that we get a whole number answer for $N$. I'm going to start with $x = 1$ and see what happens. \n\n$476 + 5(1) = 481$\n\nWhen we divide 481 by 31, we get a remainder, so that doesn't work. Let's try $x = 2$.\n\n$476 + 5(2) = 486$\n\nWhen we divide 486 by 31, it goes in evenly with no remainder! Yay! So, $x = 2$ is the digit we're looking for. Great job, little learner!",
