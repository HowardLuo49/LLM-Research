    "solution": "We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s. Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1. We can only vary the tens digit. Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime, we can start by listing out all the three-digit numbers that are palindromes. The first one after $101$ is $111$, but that is not a prime number since it is divisible by $3$. The next palindrome after $111$ is $121$, but that is not a prime because it is divisible by $11$.\n\nThe next palindrome is $131$, which is a prime number. So, the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime after $101$ is $131$.",
