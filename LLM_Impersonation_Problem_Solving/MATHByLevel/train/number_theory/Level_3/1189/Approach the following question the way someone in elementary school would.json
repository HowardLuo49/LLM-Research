    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The number $101$ is the smallest three-digit palindromic prime. What is the second-smallest one?",
    "solution": "We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s. Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1. We can only vary the tens digit. Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime number, we need to look for a number that is greater than 101 and also a palindrome. Remember, a palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nLet's list out all the three-digit numbers greater than 101 and see which ones are palindromes. The next number after 101 is 111, but that is not a prime number because it can be divided by 3. The next number after that is 121, but that is also not a prime number because it can be divided by 11. The next number after that is 131, and that is a prime number!\n\nSo, the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime number is 131.",
