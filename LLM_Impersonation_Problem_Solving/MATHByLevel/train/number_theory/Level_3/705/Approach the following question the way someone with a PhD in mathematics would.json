    "solution": "If $k$ is a positive even integer, then $$9^{k} = 81^{k/2}=\\overbrace{(81)(81)\\cdots (81)}^{k/2\\text{ times}},$$so $9^k$ has a units digit of 1. Since 8 is even, $8^7$ is even.  Therefore, $9^{8^7}$ has a units digit of $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $9^{8^7}$, we start by analyzing the powers of 9. The units digit of the powers of 9 follow a cyclical pattern: 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1, ... This is because the units digit of a number is determined by its remainder when divided by 10.\n\nNow, consider the exponent $8^7$. Since we are only interested in the units digit, we can compute $8^7$ modulo 4, as the units digit of a number is not affected by powers of 10. We find that $8^7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n\nTherefore, $9^{8^7} = 9^{4\\cdot k} = (9^4)^k$. Using the cyclical pattern of the units digit of powers of 9, we see that $9^4$ has a units digit of 1.\n\nThus, the units digit of $9^{8^7}$ is 1.",
