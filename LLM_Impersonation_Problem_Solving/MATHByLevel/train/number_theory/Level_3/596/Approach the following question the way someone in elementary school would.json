    "solution": "We are looking at powers of 2, so we notice that $2^3=8=7+1$.  Therefore  \\[2^3\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] In particular \\[2^{87}\\equiv2^{3\\cdot29}\\equiv 8^{29}\\equiv 1^{29}\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] Therefore \\[2^{87}+3\\equiv1+3\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] The remainder upon division by 7 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{87} +3$ is divided by $7, first we need to find $2^{87}$ and then add $3$. When we find $2^{87}$, keep track of the remainder when dividing by $7 as we go along.\n\nLet's start by finding the remainders when we keep multiplying by $2$:\n\n$2^1 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7$\n\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7$\n\n$2^3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$ (because $2^3 = 8 = 1+7$)\n\n$2^4 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7$\n\n$2^5 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7$\n\n$2^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$\n\nWe see a pattern where the remainders repeat every $3$ powers of $2$.
