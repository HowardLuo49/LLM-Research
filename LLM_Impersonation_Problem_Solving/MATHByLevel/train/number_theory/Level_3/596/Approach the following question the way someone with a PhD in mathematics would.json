    "solution": "We are looking at powers of 2, so we notice that $2^3=8=7+1$.  Therefore  \\[2^3\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] In particular \\[2^{87}\\equiv2^{3\\cdot29}\\equiv 8^{29}\\equiv 1^{29}\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] Therefore \\[2^{87}+3\\equiv1+3\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] The remainder upon division by 7 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by $7$, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, we can rewrite the expression as $2^{87} \\equiv -3 \\pmod{7}$. This means that $2^{87}$ is congruent to $-3$ modulo $7$. \n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any prime number $p$ and any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nIn this case, $7$ is a prime number, so we have $2^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $2^{87}$ as $2^{6\\cdot14+3} \\equiv (2^6)^{14} \\cdot 2^3 \\equiv 1^{14} \\cdot 2^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nThus, $2^{87} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nNow, when we add $3$, we get $2^{87} + 3 \\equiv 1 + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by $7$ is $4$.",
