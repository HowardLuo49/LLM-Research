    "solution": "We are looking at powers of 2, so we notice that $2^3=8=7+1$.  Therefore  \\[2^3\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] In particular \\[2^{87}\\equiv2^{3\\cdot29}\\equiv 8^{29}\\equiv 1^{29}\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] Therefore \\[2^{87}+3\\equiv1+3\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] The remainder upon division by 7 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by $7,\" let's start by finding the remainder when $2^{87}$ is divided by 7. \n\nWe can use the pattern of remainders when powers of 2 are divided by 7. \nWhen we divide $2^1$ by 7, the remainder is 2. \nWhen we divide $2^2$ by 7, the remainder is 4.\nWhen we divide $2^3$ by 7, the remainder is 1.\nWhen we divide $2^4$ by 7, the remainder is 2.\nWhen we divide $2^5$ by 7, the remainder is 4.\n\nSince this pattern repeats every 3 powers, we can find the remainder when dividing $2^{87}$ by 7 by finding the remainder of 87 when divided by 3. \n\n87 \u00f7 3 = 29 with a remainder of 0.
