    "solution": "We are looking at powers of 2, so we notice that $2^3=8=7+1$.  Therefore  \\[2^3\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] In particular \\[2^{87}\\equiv2^{3\\cdot29}\\equiv 8^{29}\\equiv 1^{29}\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] Therefore \\[2^{87}+3\\equiv1+3\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] The remainder upon division by 7 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we have a big number $2^{87}$ plus 3. We want to know what happens when we divide it by 7. Hmm...let's see. \n\nWell, let's start by finding a pattern. We know that $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 8$, $2^4 = 16$, and $2^5 = 32$. So it looks like when we divide $2^n$ by 7, the remainder is the same as $2^{(n \\mod 3)}$.\n\nSo, since $87 \\mod 3 = 0$, that means $2^{87}$ divided by 7 will have a remainder of 1.\n\nThen, when we add 3 to that, we get a total of 4. So the remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by 7 is 4! Yay!",
