    "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 4x - 3x \\\\\n&\\equiv 8-16 \\\\\n&\\equiv -8\\quad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $$x^2\\equiv (-8)^2 = 64\\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{20}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use our colorful blocks to help us with this problem! First, we see that $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$ which means that $4x$ leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 20. So let's write $4x=20k+8$ for some whole number $k$. \n\nNext, we have $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$ which means that $3x$ leaves a remainder of 16 when divided by 20. So let's write $3x=20m+16$ for some whole number $m$.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20. Let's square our first equation $4x=20k+8$, which gives us $(20k+8)^2 = 400k^2 + 160k + 64$. \n\nThen, we can substitute $3x=20m+16$ into the formula we found for $x$ in terms of $k$. This gives us $3(20k+8)=20m+16$. Expanding the left side gives us $60k + 24 = 20m + 16$ or $60k = 20m - 8$.\n\nNow we can solve for $k$ in terms of $m$. $k = \\frac{20m-8}{60} = \\frac{20(m-1)}{60} = \\frac{1}{3}(m-1)$.\n\nSo, $x^2 = 400k^2 + 160k + 64 = 400(\\frac{1}{3}(m-1))^2 + 160(\\frac{1}{3}(m-1)) + 64 = \\frac{400}{9}(m-1)^2 + \\frac{160}{3}(m-1) + 64$. \n\nNow we need to find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20.
