    "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 4x - 3x \\\\\n&\\equiv 8-16 \\\\\n&\\equiv -8\\quad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $$x^2\\equiv (-8)^2 = 64\\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{20}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to figure out what $x$ is. Let's solve each equation one by one.\n\nFor the first equation, we have $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$. To find $x$, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by $4$, gives a remainder of $8$ when divided by $20$. We can see that $4$ multiplied by $2$ equals $8$, so $x$ is $2$.\n\nNext, we solve the second equation: $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$. To find $x$, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by $3$, gives a remainder of $16$ when divided by $20$. We can see that $3$ multiplied by $3$ equals $9$, and $3$ multiplied by $6$ equals $18$, so $x$ is $6$.\n\nNow that we know $x$ is $2$, we can find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$. We have $2^2=4$, and the remainder when $4$ is divided by $20$ is $4$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $20$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
