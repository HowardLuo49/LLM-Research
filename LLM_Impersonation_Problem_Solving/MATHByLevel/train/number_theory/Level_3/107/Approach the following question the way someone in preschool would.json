    "solution": "Recall that the number of whole number divisors of a positive integer can be determined by prime factorizing the integer, adding 1 to each of the exponents, and multiplying the results.  If a positive integer has 10 factors, then the set of exponents in the prime factorization is $\\{1,4\\}$ or $\\{9\\}$.  For each set of exponents, the smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has the given set of exponents is achieved by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes 2, 3, 5, etc.  The smallest positive integer with an exponent of 9 in the prime factorization is $2^9=512$.  The smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 1 and 4 is $2^4\\cdot 3^1=48$.  Since $48<512$, $\\boxed{48}$ is the smallest positive integer with 10 positive integer divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count the divisors for some small numbers. \nLet's start with 1, which has only 1 divisor: 1 itself. \nThen let's try 2, which has 2 divisors: 1 and 2. \nNext, let's try 3, which also has 2 divisors: 1 and 3. \nNow let's try 4, which has 3 divisors: 1, 2, and 4. \nHmm, it looks like the number of divisors is increasing for each number we try. \nLet's keep trying until we find a number with exactly 10 divisors. \n\nAfter trying a few more numbers, we find that 36 has exactly 10 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. \nSo, the smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive integer divisors is 36.
