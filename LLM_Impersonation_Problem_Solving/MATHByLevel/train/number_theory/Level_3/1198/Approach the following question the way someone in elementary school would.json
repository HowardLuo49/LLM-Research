    "solution": "Note that $656_7=6\\cdot7^2+5\\cdot7^1+6\\cdot7^0=335_{10}$. Therefore, $a=3$, $b=5$, and $\\frac{a\\cdot b}{15}=\\frac{3\\cdot5}{15}=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we need to find the base-10 number that is equivalent to $656_7$. If we convert $656_7$ to base-10, we get $6\\cdot7^2+5\\cdot7^1+6\\cdot7^0=6\\cdot49+5\\cdot7+6\\cdot1=294+35+6=335$. So $656_7=335_{10}$. \n\nThat means $3ab_{10}=335$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits. From this, we can see that $a=3$ and $b=5$. \n\nFinally, we need to find $\\frac{a\\cdot b}{15}=\\frac{3\\cdot5}{15}=\\frac{15}{15}=1$. So the answer is $1$. Yay, we did it!",
