    "solution": "The second condition tells us that the integer must be between $25^2 = 625$ and $(25.3)^2 \\approx 640$. The only multiple of 14 in this range is $\\boxed{630}.$  (One easy way to find a multiple of 14 is to find a number that is both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 7.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find a positive integer that is divisible by 14 and has a square root between 25 and 25.3, we can first consider the square roots of numbers that are multiples of 14. The square root of a number n is between a and b if a < sqrt(n) < b.\n\nWe know that 25 < sqrt(n) < 25.3, so squaring both sides of this inequality gives 625 < n < 640.09. The closest multiple of 14 within this range is 630, which is divisible by 14.\n\nTherefore, the positive integer that is divisible by 14 and has a square root between 25 and 25.3 is 630.",
