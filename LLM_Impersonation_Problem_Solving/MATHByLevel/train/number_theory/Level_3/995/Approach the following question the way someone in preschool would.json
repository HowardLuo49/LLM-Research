    "solution": "The second condition tells us that the integer must be between $25^2 = 625$ and $(25.3)^2 \\approx 640$. The only multiple of 14 in this range is $\\boxed{630}.$  (One easy way to find a multiple of 14 is to find a number that is both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 7.)",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's try to find a number that is both divisible by 14 and has a square root between 25 and 25.3. \n\nFirst, we know that 14 x 2 = 28, so 28 is divisible by 14. \n\nNext, let's find the square root of 28. The square root of 28 is about 5.29, which is between 5 (25) and 5.3 (25.3). \n\nSo, the positive integer that meets both of these conditions is 28! Yay, we did it!",
