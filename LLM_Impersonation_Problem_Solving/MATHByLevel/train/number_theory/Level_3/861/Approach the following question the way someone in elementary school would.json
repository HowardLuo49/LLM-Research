    "solution": "For every divisor $d$ of $50$, then $50/d$ is also a divisor of $50$. Their product is $d \\cdot (50/d) = 50$. It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $50$ such that their product is $50 = 2 \\cdot 5^2$. There are $(1+1)(2+1) = 6$ divisors of $50$: $1,2,5,10,25,50$. Thus, the answer is $50^{6/2} = 50^3 = \\boxed{125,\\!000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of the divisors of $50$, first let's list out all the divisors of $50. \n\nThe divisors of $50$ are $1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50$. \n\nNow, to find the product of these divisors, we just need to multiply them all together like this: $1 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 10 \\times 25 \\times 50$. \n\nSo, the product of the divisors of $50$ is $1250000$.",
