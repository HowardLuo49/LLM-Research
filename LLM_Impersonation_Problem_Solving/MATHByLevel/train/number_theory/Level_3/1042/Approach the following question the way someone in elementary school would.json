The positive integer divisors of 175, except 1, are arranged around a circle so that every pair of adjacent integers has a common factor greater than 1. What is the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7?",
    "solution": "$175=5^2\\cdot7^1$. To arrange the divisors of 175, we can (conveniently) start with the divisor 7. Since $\\gcd(5,7)=1$, the two divisors that are adjacent to 7 must be multiples of 7, which means they have to be $5^1\\cdot7=35$ and $5^2\\cdot7=175$. Thus, the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7 is $35+175=\\boxed{210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integer divisors of 175, we need to see what numbers can divide evenly into it. The positive divisors of 175 are 5, 7, 25, and 35.\n\nNow we need to arrange these numbers around a circle so that every pair of adjacent numbers has a common factor greater than 1.\n\nSince the number 7 is between 5 and 25, we need to find the sum of 5 and 25. \n\n5 + 25 = 30\n\nSo the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7 is 30.",
