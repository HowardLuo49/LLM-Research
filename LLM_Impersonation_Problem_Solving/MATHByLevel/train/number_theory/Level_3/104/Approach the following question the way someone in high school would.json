    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $x$ be a positive integer such that $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$.\n\nWhat is the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$?",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by writing $x\\equiv 9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$. Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$.\n\nModulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\\cdot (9\\cdot 9^{-1}) \\equiv (11\\cdot 9)\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1}$. Thus \\begin{align*}\n11 + 9^{-1} &\\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\pmod{25},\n\\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNotice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.",
    "gpt_response": "In other words, we need to find the value of $11+x$ modulo $25$.\n\nWe know that $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$. This means that $9x = 25n + 1$ for some integer $n$.\n\nWe want to find the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$. \nSubstitute $x = \\frac{25n + 1}{9}$ into $11+x$ to get \n$11 + \\frac{25n + 1}{9} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 11 + 25n + 1}{9} = \\frac{99 + 25n + 1}{9}$. \nSimplify to get $\\frac{100 + 25n}{9}$. \nThis simplifies to $\\frac{25(4+n)}{9}$. \nTherefore, $11+x$ is congruent to $25(4+n)$ modulo $25$. The remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is therefore $\\boxed{0}$ because $25(4+n)$ is a multiple of $25$, and a multiple of 25 always leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 25.",
