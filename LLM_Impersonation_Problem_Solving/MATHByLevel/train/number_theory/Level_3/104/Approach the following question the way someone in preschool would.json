    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $x$ be a positive integer such that $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$.\n\nWhat is the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$?",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by writing $x\\equiv 9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$. Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$.\n\nModulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\\cdot (9\\cdot 9^{-1}) \\equiv (11\\cdot 9)\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1}$. Thus \\begin{align*}\n11 + 9^{-1} &\\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\pmod{25},\n\\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNotice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find a number that, when multiplied by $9$, gives a remainder of $1$ when divided by $25$. That number is $14$ because $9\\cdot 14 = 126$ and $126\\div 25 = 5$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\nSo, $x = 14$.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $11 + x$ is divided by $25$. $11 + 14 = 25$, which is divisible by $25$. That means the remainder is $0$.",
