    "solution": "The largest power of $6$ that is less than or equal to $314$ is $6^3$, which equals $216$. Because $(1\\cdot 6^3)=216<314<(2\\cdot 6^3)=432$, the digit in the $6^3$ place is $1$. Since $314-216=98$, we know that the digit in the $6^2$ place is $2$ because $72=2\\cdot 6^2<98<3\\cdot 6^2=108$. We then note that $98-72=26$, which can be expressed as $(4\\cdot6^1)+ (2\\cdot 6^0)$. Therefore the digit in the $6^1$ places is $4$, and the digit in the $6^0$ place is $2$.\n\nWe now see that $314_{10}=\\boxed{1242_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down the number 314. In base 6, there are 6 different digits we can use: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n\nTo convert 314 to base 6, let's find the largest power of 6 that is less than 314. In this case, $6^3 = 216$, which is less than 314. So, we can have at most 1 in the 6^3 place.\n\nNext, we need to see how much is left after we take out the 6^3 part. We subtract 216 from 314, which gives us 98. \n\nNow, we need to find the largest power of 6 that is less than 98. In this case, $6^2 = 36$, which is less than 98. So, we can have at most 2 in the 6^2 place.\n\nNext, we need to see how much is left after we take out the 6^2 part. We subtract 36 from 98, which leaves us with 62.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest power of 6 that is less than 62. In this case, $6^1 = 6$, which is less than 62. So, we can have at most 10 in the 6^1 place.\n\nFinally, we see that there is 2 left over after taking out the 6^1 part. This is our digit in the 6^0 place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have 314 in base 6 as $1202_6$.",
