    "solution": "The largest power of $6$ that is less than or equal to $314$ is $6^3$, which equals $216$. Because $(1\\cdot 6^3)=216<314<(2\\cdot 6^3)=432$, the digit in the $6^3$ place is $1$. Since $314-216=98$, we know that the digit in the $6^2$ place is $2$ because $72=2\\cdot 6^2<98<3\\cdot 6^2=108$. We then note that $98-72=26$, which can be expressed as $(4\\cdot6^1)+ (2\\cdot 6^0)$. Therefore the digit in the $6^1$ places is $4$, and the digit in the $6^0$ place is $2$.\n\nWe now see that $314_{10}=\\boxed{1242_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $314_{10}$ to base 6, we need to find the largest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 314. \n\nAfter some calculations, we find that $6^3 = 216$ is the largest power of 6 that is less than 314. Therefore, we have 1 in the 6^3 place, with a remainder of 98.\n\nNext, we find the largest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 98, which is $6^2 = 36$. Therefore, we have 2 in the 6^2 place, with a remainder of 26.\n\nFinally, the largest power of 6 less than or equal to 26 is $6^1 = 6$. Therefore, we have 4 in the 6^1 place, with a remainder of 2.\n\nSince 2 is less than 6, we have 2 in the 6^0 (or ones) place.\n\nPutting it all together, we have $314_{10} = 1242_6$.",
