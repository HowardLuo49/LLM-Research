    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $13^{2003$, we need to look at the pattern of the units digits of $13$ raised to different powers.\n\nWhen we multiply $13$ by itself, we get: \n$13^1 = 13$, \n$13^2 = 169$, \n$13^3 = 2197$.\n\nFrom looking at the pattern, we can see that the units digit of $13$ raised to any power that is a multiple of $4$ is always $1$. Since $2003$ is not a multiple of $4$, we can use the rule that states when we divide the exponent by $4$, the remainder will give us the same units digit. \n\nSo, when we divide $2003$ by $4$, we get a remainder of $3$. This means that the units digit of $13^{2003}$ will be the same as the units digit of $13^3$. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is $7$.",
