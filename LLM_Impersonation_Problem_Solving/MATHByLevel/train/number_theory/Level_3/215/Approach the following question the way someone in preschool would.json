    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie, so let's see if we can figure this out! When we see the number 13, let's first look for patterns we know. The units digit of powers of 3 repeat every 4th power, which means we don't have to actually calculate 13 to the 2003rd power. We can find the remainder when 2003 is divided by 4 which is 3. So we will look for the units digit of 13 cubed! \n\n13 x 13 x 13 = 2197. \n\nSo, the unit digit of 13 to the 2003rd power is 7! Yay, we figured it out!",
