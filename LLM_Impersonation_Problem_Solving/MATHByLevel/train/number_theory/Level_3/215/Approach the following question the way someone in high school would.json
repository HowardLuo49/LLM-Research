    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, let's first look at the pattern of units digits for powers of 13. \n\nWhen 13 is raised to the power of 1, the units digit is 3.\nWhen 13 is raised to the power of 2, the units digit is 9.\nWhen 13 is raised to the power of 3, the units digit is 7.\nWhen 13 is raised to the power of 4, the units digit is 1.\n\nSo we see that the units digit of $13^{1}$ is 3, $13^{2}$ is 9, $13^{3}$ is 7, and $13^{4}$ is 1. \n\nThis pattern repeats every 4 powers. Since $2003$ is one less than a multiple of $4$, we need to find the units digit of $13^{3}$, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 7.",
