    "solution": "Since $247, 39,$ and $143$ are all divisible by $13$, the residues for $247+ 5 \\cdot 39 + 7 \\cdot 143$ is just $0$.\n\nTherefore, $247+5 \\cdot 39 + 7 \\cdot 143 +4 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 4 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 60 \\equiv \\boxed{8} \\pmod{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modulo $13$ residue of the given expression, we first simplify the expression:\n\n$247 + 5 \\cdot 39 + 7 \\cdot 143 + 4 \\cdot 15$\n\n$= 247 + 195 + 1001 + 60$\n\n$= 1503$\n\nNow, we can find the modulo $13$ residue of $1503$ by dividing $1503$ by $13$:\n\n$1503 \\div 13 = 115$ with a remainder of $8$\n\nTherefore, the modulo $13$ residue of the expression $247+5 \\cdot 39 + 7 \\cdot 143 +4 \\cdot 15$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
