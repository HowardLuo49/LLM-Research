    "solution": "Noticing that $99=100-1$ we see that \\[99\\equiv-1\\pmod{100}.\\] Therefore  \\[99^{36}\\equiv(-1)^{36}\\equiv1\\pmod{100}.\\] The remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100, we can simplify by looking at the last two digits of the number. \n\nFirst, we need to find the remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100. \n\nTo find the last two digits of $99^{36}$, we can look for a pattern. The last two digits of 99^1 is 99, 99^2 is 01, 99^3 is 99, and so on. \n\nSince the pattern repeats every two powers, we can see that the last two digits of $99^{36}$ is 01. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100 is 01.",
