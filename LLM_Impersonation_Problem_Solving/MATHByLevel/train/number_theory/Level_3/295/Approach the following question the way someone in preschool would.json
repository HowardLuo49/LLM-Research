But wait, we can try to find a pattern!\n\nLet's start by multiplying 99 by itself once. That equals 99, right? And when we divide 99 by 100, we get a remainder of 99. \n\nNow let's multiply 99 by itself again. That equals 99 times 99, which is 9801. If we divide 9801 by 100, we get a remainder of 1.\n\nDo you see a pattern here? Each time we multiply 99 by itself, we get a remainder of either 99 or 1 when we divide by 100. \n\nSo, since we have to multiply 99 by itself 36 times, we will have a remainder of 1 when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100.\n\nIsn't math fun?
