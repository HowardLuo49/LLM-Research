    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100, we can apply the concept of modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, we notice that $99 \\equiv -1 \\mod 100$. Therefore, we can rewrite $99^{36}$ as $(-1)^{36}$.\n\nSince $(-1)^{36}$ is equal to 1 (because any even power of -1 is equal to 1), the remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100 is 1. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 1.",
