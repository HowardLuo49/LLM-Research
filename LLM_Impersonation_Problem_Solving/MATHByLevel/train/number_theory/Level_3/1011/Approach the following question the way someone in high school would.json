    "gpt_response": "First, let's review what it means for $a$ and $b$ to be invertible integers modulo $n$.\n\nIn high school terms, an integer $a$ is invertible modulo $n$ if there exists another integer $a^{-1}$ such that $aa^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. In other words, $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$. \n\nSo, given that $a \\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod n$, we know that $a$ and $b$ are inverses of each other modulo $n.\n\nNow, if we want to find the remainder when $ab$ is divided by $n$, we can rewrite $ab$ as $ab \\equiv a(b) \\pmod n$. \n\nSince $a \\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod n$, we can substitute $b^{-1}$ for $a$ in the expression $a(b)$ to get $ab \\equiv b^{-1}(b) \\pmod n$. \n\nNotice that $b^{-1}(b)$ is equivalent to $1$ modulo $n$, because $b$ and $b^{-1}$ are inverses of each other modulo $n$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $ab$ is divided by $n$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
