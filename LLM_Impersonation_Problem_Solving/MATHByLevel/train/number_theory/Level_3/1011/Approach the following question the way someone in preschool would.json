So when we multiply $a$ and $b$ together, we get this super cool number.\n\nNow, we want to figure out what happens when we divide this cool number by $n$. Hmmm, let's think. Since $a$ and $b$ are special friends, maybe the remainder when we divide $ab$ by $n$ is like... zero? Or maybe it's a super tiny number, like $1$ or something. I'm not sure, but maybe we can color a picture or use some blocks to figure it out!",
