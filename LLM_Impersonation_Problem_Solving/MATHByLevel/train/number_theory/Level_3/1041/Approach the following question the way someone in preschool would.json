    "solution": "We know that $4^{4}>123_{10}>4^{3}$. So, we can tell that $123_{10}$ in base four will have four digits. $4^{3}=64$, which can go into 123 only one time at most, leaving $123-1\\cdot64 = 59$ for the next three digits. $4^{2}=16$ goes into 59 three times at most, leaving us with $59-3\\cdot16 = 11$. Then, $4^{1}=4$ goes into 11 two times at most, leaving $11-2\\cdot4 = 3$ for the ones digit. All together, the base four equivalent of $123_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1323_{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In base four, we don't use the numbers 8, 9, or 10. We just use the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. So the base four equivalent of $123_{10}$ is $1113_4$. Yay! Now we can count in base 4!",
