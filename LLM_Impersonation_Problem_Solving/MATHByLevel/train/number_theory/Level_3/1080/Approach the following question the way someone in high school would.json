    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For what value of $n$ is the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ divisible by 33? (Note: the underlining is meant to indicate that the number should be interpreted as a five-digit number whose ten thousands digit is 7, whose thousands digit is $n$, and so on).",
    "solution": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out if the number $\\underline{7n933}$ is divisible by 33, we need to check if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 and if the alternating sum of the digits is divisible by 11.\n\nThe sum of the digits is $7 + n + 9 + 3 + 3 = 22 + n$. For this to be divisible by 3, $n$ must be 1, 4, or 7 (since $22$ is already divisible by 3). \n\nNow, the alternating sum of the digits is $7 - n + 9 - 3 + 3 = 16 - n$. For this to be divisible by 11, $n$ must be 5 (since 16 - 5 = 11).\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ that makes $\\underline{7n933}$ divisible by 33 is $\\boxed{5}$.",
