    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. For what value of $n$ is the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ divisible by 33? (Note: the underlining is meant to indicate that the number should be interpreted as a five-digit number whose ten thousands digit is 7, whose thousands digit is $n$, and so on).",
    "solution": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out if a number is divisible by 33, we need to check if it is divisible by both 3 and 11. \n\nTo check if it is divisible by 3, we add up all the digits of the number. In this case, the sum is $7 + n + 9 + 3 + 3 = 22 + n$. For the sum to be divisible by 3, $n$ must be equal to 1, 4, or 7.\n\nNext, to check if it is divisible by 11, we need to subtract every second digit from the sum of the others. In this case, $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 19 - n$. For the number to be divisible by 11, $n$ must be equal to 1.\n\nSo, the value of $n$ that makes the number divisible by 33 is $n=1$.",
