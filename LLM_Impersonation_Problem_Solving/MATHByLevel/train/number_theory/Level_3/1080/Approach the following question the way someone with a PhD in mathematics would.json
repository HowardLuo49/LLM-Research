    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For what value of $n$ is the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ divisible by 33? (Note: the underlining is meant to indicate that the number should be interpreted as a five-digit number whose ten thousands digit is 7, whose thousands digit is $n$, and so on).",
    "solution": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ is divisible by 33, we must first represent the number as a mathematical expression. Given that the number is in the form $7n933$, we can write it as $70000 + 1000n + 300 + 30 + 3$.\n\nWe can simplify this expression to $1001n + 70333$. To find the value of $n$ for which this expression is divisible by 33, we must use the fact that a number is divisible by 33 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.\n\nIn this case, the alternating sum of the digits is $1 - 0 + 1 - 7 + 0 - 3 + 3 = -5$. Since -5 is not divisible by 11, $1001n + 70333$ is not divisible by 33 for any value of $n$. \n\nTherefore, there does not exist a value of $n$ for which the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ is divisible by 33.",
