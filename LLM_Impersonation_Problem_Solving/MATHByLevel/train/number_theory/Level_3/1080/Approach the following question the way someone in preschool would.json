    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For what value of $n$ is the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ divisible by 33? (Note: the underlining is meant to indicate that the number should be interpreted as a five-digit number whose ten thousands digit is 7, whose thousands digit is $n$, and so on).",
    "solution": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, the number should be divisible by 33. Hmm, what does that mean? Oh, I remember! It means that the number can be split into groups of 33 without any leftovers.\n\nSo, let's look at the number $\\underline{7n933}$. We know that 33 is made up of 3 and 11. So, if a number is divisible by 33, it must also be divisible by 3 and 11.\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 3, we add up all the digits. In this case, we have $7+n+9+3+3=22+n$. So, the number has to be divisible by 3, which means that $22+n$ has to be divisible by 3. That means $n$ can be 1.\n\nNow, to check if a number is divisible by 11, we subtract the sum of the odd-positioned digits from the sum of the even-positioned digits. In this case, we get $(7+9+3) - (n+3) = 19 - n$. For the number to be divisible by 11, $19-n$ has to be divisible by 11. We already know that $n=1$, so $19-1$ is 18. Since 18 is not divisible by 11, the number $\\underline{71933}$ is not divisible by 33.\n\nSo, the value of $n$ for the number to be divisible by 33 is not 1. \nHmm, that's a little tricky for me. Can you help me find the right number, please?",

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "Yes. Let's go through the process again to find the correct value of $n$ that will make the number divisible by 33.\n\nWe have the number $\\underline{7n933}$. \n\n1. To check if the number is divisible by 3, we add up all the digits: $7+n+9+3+3=22+n$. For the number to be divisible by 3, $22+n$ must be divisible by 3. This means $n$ can be 1, 4, or 7.\n\n2.
