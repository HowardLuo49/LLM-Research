    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $n$, we need to find an integer $n$ such that when $10389$ is divided by $12$, the remainder is $n$. \n\nLet's first divide $10389$ by $12$. Doing so, we find that $10389 = 12 \\cdot 865 + 9$. This means that $n = 9$ since 9 is the remainder when $10389$ is divided by $12$. \n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ we are looking for is $\\boxed{9}$.",
