    "solution": "Since 38 and 57 are both divisible by 19, so is $38000+570$.  Therefore we can say  \\[38574=19(2030)+4.\\]This tells us that  \\[38574\\equiv 4\\pmod{19}\\]The answer is $n=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together to find the correct number! We know that $38574$ leaves a remainder of $n$ when divided by $19$. So let's try dividing $38574$ by $19$.\n\n$38574 \\div 19 = 2030$ with a remainder of $4$. \n\nYay! We found the answer!
