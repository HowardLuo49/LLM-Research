    "solution": "After converting everything to base 10, we are able to solve for $\\triangle$. We get \\begin{align*}\n3\\triangle_4&=\\triangle2_{11}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3\\cdot4^1+\\triangle\\cdot4^0&=\\triangle\\cdot11^1+2\\cdot11^0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12+\\triangle&=11\\cdot\\triangle+2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n10&=10\\cdot\\triangle\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\boxed{1}&=\\triangle.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, I will look at the numbers as if they were written in a different base. The first number $3\\triangle_4$ means 3 times the base (which is 4) plus the missing digit. So it\u2019s $3\\times4 + \\triangle = 12 + \\triangle$. The second number $\\triangle2_{11}$ means the missing digit times the base (which is 11) plus 2. So it\u2019s $\\triangle\\times11 + 2$. Since these two numbers are equal, we can set them equal to each other: $12 + \\triangle = \\triangle\\times11 + 2$. \n\nNow let\u2019s solve for the missing digit. Subtract $\\triangle$ from both sides of the equation to get $12 = 11\\triangle - \\triangle$. This simplifies to $12 = 10\\triangle$. Divide by 10 on both sides to get $\\triangle = 1$. So the missing digit is 1.",
