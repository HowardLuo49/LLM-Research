    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n$ is a perfect square and $2n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "Since $3n$ is a perfect square, that means that $n$ has to be a multiple of $3$. Since $2n$ is a perfect cube, then $n$ has to be divisible by $2^2=4$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $n$ also has to be divisible by $3^3=27$. Therefore, the smallest value for $n$ is $4 \\cdot 27 =\\boxed{108}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We need to find a number that when we multiply it by 3, we get a perfect square, and when we multiply it by 2, we get a perfect cube. \n\nFirst, let's think about perfect squares. The first few perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, and so on. \n\nNext, let's think about perfect cubes. The first few perfect cubes are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, and so on.\n\nLet's start with the smallest number, 1. If we multiply 1 by 3, we get 3, which is not a perfect square. And if we multiply 1 by 2, we get 2, which is not a perfect cube.\n\nLet's try the next number, 2. If we multiply 2 by 3, we get 6, which is not a perfect square. And if we multiply 2 by 2, we get 4, which is a perfect square.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer $n$ that works is 2. When we multiply 2 by 3, we get 6, which is a perfect square (2*3=6, and 6 is 2*3). And when we multiply 2 by 2, we get 4, which is a perfect cube (2*2=4, and 4 is 2^3).\n\nSo, the answer is 2!",
