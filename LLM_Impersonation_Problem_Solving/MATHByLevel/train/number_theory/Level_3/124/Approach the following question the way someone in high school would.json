    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n$ is a perfect square and $2n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "Since $3n$ is a perfect square, that means that $n$ has to be a multiple of $3$. Since $2n$ is a perfect cube, then $n$ has to be divisible by $2^2=4$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $n$ also has to be divisible by $3^3=27$. Therefore, the smallest value for $n$ is $4 \\cdot 27 =\\boxed{108}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find the smallest positive integer that makes both $3n$ a perfect square and $2n$ a perfect cube. Let's start by looking at some small numbers and see if we can find one that works.\n\nIf $n=1$, then $3n=3$ which is not a perfect square, and $2n=2$ which is also not a perfect cube.\n\nIf $n=2$, then $3n=6$ which is not a perfect square, and $2n=4$ which is not a perfect cube.\n\nIf $n=3$, then $3n=9$ which is a perfect square, and $2n=6$ which is not a perfect cube. \n\nSo the smallest positive integer $n$ that works is $3$.",
