    "solution": "Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.\n\nEach group of $5$ numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+0=10$. Since $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, we can ignore every group of $5$.\n\nThis leaves the numbers $121,122,$ and $123$. The sum of the residues is $1+2+3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modulo $5$ remainder of the sum $1+2+3+4+5+ \\ldots + 120+121+122+123$, we need to add up all these numbers first. \n\nWe add them up by pairing numbers that add up to $5$. \n$1+4 = 5$\n$2+3 = 5$\n...\n$119+122 = 5$\n$120+121 = 5$\n$123$ goes by itself.\n\nNow we have $24$ pairs of numbers that add up to $5$, which gives us $24 \\times 5 = 120$. Plus $123$.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is $120 + 123 = 243$.\n\nThe modulo $5$ remainder of $243$ is $3$. \n\nSo, the modulo $5$ remainder of the sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
