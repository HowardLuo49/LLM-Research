    "solution": "Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.\n\nEach group of $5$ numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+0=10$. Since $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, we can ignore every group of $5$.\n\nThis leaves the numbers $121,122,$ and $123$. The sum of the residues is $1+2+3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modulo 5 remainder of a sum, we simply need to add up all the numbers and then find the remainder when that sum is divided by 5. \n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the sequence $1+2+3+4+\\ldots+123$. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, $n = 123$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_{123} = 123$. \n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$S = \\frac{123}{2}(1 + 123) = \\frac{123}{2}(124) = 123 \\cdot 62 = 7626.$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 7626 is divided by 5. \nDividing 7626 by 5 gives us a quotient of 1525 with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the modulo 5 remainder of the sum $1+2+3+4+5+ \\ldots + 120+121+122+123$ is 1.",
