    "solution": "Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.\n\nEach group of $5$ numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+0=10$. Since $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, we can ignore every group of $5$.\n\nThis leaves the numbers $121,122,$ and $123$. The sum of the residues is $1+2+3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modulo $5$ remainder of the given sum, we first notice that the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is given by $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. \n\nSo in our case, we need to calculate the sum $1+2+3+\\ldots+123$, which is the sum of the first $123$ positive integers. This sum can be calculated as $\\frac{123(124)}{2} = 7626$.\n\nNext, we need to find the modulo $5$ remainder of $7626$. We can find this by dividing $7626$ by $5$ and considering the remainder. \n\nDividing $7626$ by $5$, we get $7626 = 5 \\cdot 1521 + 1$. \n\nTherefore, the modulo $5$ remainder of the sum $1+2+3+\\ldots+123$ is $1$.",
