    "solution": "We have that \\begin{align*} 213_{8} &= 2(8^2)+ 1(8^1) +3(8^0) \\\\\n&= 2(64)+1(8)+3(1)\\\\\n&= 128 + 8 + 3\\\\\n&= 139\\\\\n142_{7} &= 1(7^2)+ 4(7^1) +2(7^0) \\\\\n&= 1(49)+4(7)+2(1)\\\\\n&= 49 + 28 + 2\\\\\n&= 79\n\\end{align*}So, $213_{8}-142_{7}=139-79=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we have to subtract 142 in base 7 from 213 in base 8. Let's start by converting both numbers to base 10.\n\nTo convert 213 in base 8 to base 10, we can use the formula:\n(2 * 8^2) + (1 * 8^1) + (3 * 8^0) = (2 * 64) + (1 * 8) + (3 * 1) = 128 + 8 + 3 = 139\n\nSo, 213 in base 8 is equal to 139 in base 10.\n\nTo convert 142 in base 7 to base 10, we can use the formula:\n(1 * 7^2) + (4 * 7^1) + (2 * 7^0) = (1 * 49) + (4 * 7) + (2 * 1) = 49 + 28 + 2 = 79\n\nSo, 142 in base 7 is equal to 79 in base 10.\n\nNow we can subtract 79 from 139:\n139 - 79 = 60\n\nTherefore, $213_{8} - 142_{7} = 60$ in base 10.",
