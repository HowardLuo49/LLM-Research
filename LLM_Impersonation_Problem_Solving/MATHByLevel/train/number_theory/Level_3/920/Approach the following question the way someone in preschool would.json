    "solution": "We have that \\begin{align*} 213_{8} &= 2(8^2)+ 1(8^1) +3(8^0) \\\\\n&= 2(64)+1(8)+3(1)\\\\\n&= 128 + 8 + 3\\\\\n&= 139\\\\\n142_{7} &= 1(7^2)+ 4(7^1) +2(7^0) \\\\\n&= 1(49)+4(7)+2(1)\\\\\n&= 49 + 28 + 2\\\\\n&= 79\n\\end{align*}So, $213_{8}-142_{7}=139-79=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count our fingers and toes to help us figure this out! \nFirst, let's change the numbers to base 10. \n$213_{8}$ is 2 hundreds, 1 ten, and 3 ones in base 10. So it is $2*8^{2} + 1*8^{1} + 3*8^{0} = 128+8+3 = 139$ in base 10. \n$142_{7}$ is 1 hundred, 4 sevens, and 2 ones in base 10. So it is $1*7^{2} + 4*7^{1} + 2*7^{0} = 49+28+2 = 79$ in base 10. \nNow we can subtract 79 from 139 to get our answer. \n139 - 79 = 60. \nSo, the answer is 60 in base 10! Yay, we did it!",
