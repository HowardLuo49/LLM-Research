Only tiles which are marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ are blue. One tile is chosen randomly from the box. What is the probability that the tile is blue?",
    "solution": "Positive integers which are congruent to $2\\pmod{5}$ belong to the set $$\\{2+5(0), 2+5(1), 2+5(2), ..., \\}.$$To find the largest element of this set which is less than or equal to 50, we look for the largest possible integer $n$ such that $$2+5(n-1) \\le 50.$$Solving this inequality, we find $n \\le 53/5$, so the maximum integer solution is $n=\\lfloor 53/5 \\rfloor = 10$. Since there are 50 total tiles, the probability that the tile is marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ is $\\dfrac{10 \\; \\text{blue tiles} }{50 \\; \\text{total tiles}} = \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{5} } .$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see. I see that the numbers that are congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ are 2, 7, 12, 17, and so on. So that means the blue tiles are the ones with numbers 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, and 47. \n\nNow let's count how many blue tiles there are. There are 10 blue tiles out of a total of 50 tiles. So the probability of picking a blue tile is 10 out of 50, which simplifies to 1 out of 5.\n\nSo the probability of picking a blue tile is 1/5! Is that right?",
