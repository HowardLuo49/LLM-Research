Only tiles which are marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ are blue. One tile is chosen randomly from the box. What is the probability that the tile is blue?",
    "solution": "Positive integers which are congruent to $2\\pmod{5}$ belong to the set $$\\{2+5(0), 2+5(1), 2+5(2), ..., \\}.$$To find the largest element of this set which is less than or equal to 50, we look for the largest possible integer $n$ such that $$2+5(n-1) \\le 50.$$Solving this inequality, we find $n \\le 53/5$, so the maximum integer solution is $n=\\lfloor 53/5 \\rfloor = 10$. Since there are 50 total tiles, the probability that the tile is marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ is $\\dfrac{10 \\; \\text{blue tiles} }{50 \\; \\text{total tiles}} = \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{5} } .$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's figure out which numbers are congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$. That means the number leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. So, looking at the numbers 1 through 50, we can see that the numbers 2, 7, 12, 17, etc. are blue.\n\nThere are a total of 10 blue tiles (2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47) out of 50 tiles total.\n\nSo, the probability of choosing a blue tile is $\\frac{10}{50}$ or $\\frac{1}{5}$.",
