    "solution": "We can rewrite $0.865$ as $\\frac{865}{10^3}$, set it equal to the fraction, and solve for $a$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a}{a+27}&=\\frac{865}{10^3}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\\\\n10^3a&=865a+865\\cdot27\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(10^3-865)a&=865\\cdot27\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n135a&=865\\cdot27\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\na&=\\frac{865\\cdot27}{135} \\\\\n&=\\frac{865\\cdot27}{5\\cdot27}=\\frac{865}{5}=\\boxed{173}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to write the decimal $0.865$ as a fraction. To do this, we move the decimal point two places to the right and put it over 100.
