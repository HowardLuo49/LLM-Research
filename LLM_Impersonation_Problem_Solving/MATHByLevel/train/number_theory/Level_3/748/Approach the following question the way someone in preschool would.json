So, can we find a number that, when added to $a$, gives a number that when divided by $a$, gives us $0.865? Let's try some numbers. Maybe we can start with 1, then 2, then 3, and so on until we find the right number that makes the fraction equal to $0.865$. Let's keep trying until we find the answer!",
