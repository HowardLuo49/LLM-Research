    "solution": "First, we use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince all numbers with units digit $3$ have a remainder of $3$ when divided by $5$ and there are $20$ numbers,  $$3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times 33 \\times \\ldots \\times 183 \\times 193 \\equiv 3^{20} \\pmod{5}.$$Next, we also use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince $3^4 \\equiv 81 \\equiv 1 \\pmod5$, and $3^{20} = (3^4)^5$, then $3^{20} \\equiv 1^5 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count by 10s, starting at 3 and ending at 193. We can skip count by 10, like this: 3, 13, 23, 33, and so on until we reach 193. When we multiply all these numbers together and divide by 5, the remainder is 0 because we have so many numbers that are multiples of 5. So, the remainder when $3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times 33 \\times \\ldots \\times 183 \\times 193$ is divided by 5 is 0.",
