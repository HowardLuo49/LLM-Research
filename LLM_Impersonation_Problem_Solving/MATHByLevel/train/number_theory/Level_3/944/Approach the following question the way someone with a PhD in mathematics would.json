    "solution": "First, we use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince all numbers with units digit $3$ have a remainder of $3$ when divided by $5$ and there are $20$ numbers,  $$3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times 33 \\times \\ldots \\times 183 \\times 193 \\equiv 3^{20} \\pmod{5}.$$Next, we also use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince $3^4 \\equiv 81 \\equiv 1 \\pmod5$, and $3^{20} = (3^4)^5$, then $3^{20} \\equiv 1^5 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times 33 \\times \\ldots \\times 183 \\times 193$ is divided by $5$, we can apply the principles of modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, notice that $3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times 33 \\times \\ldots \\times 183 \\times 193$ can be expressed as $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} (10i+3)$. \n\nNext, we can rewrite this expression modulo $5$ as $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} (2i+3)$. \n\nUsing modular arithmetic properties, we can simplify this even further by noting that when $i$ is even, $2i \\equiv 0 \\mod 5$, and when $i$ is odd, $2i \\equiv 1 \\mod 5$. \n\nTherefore, our expression can be further simplified to $3^{10} \\cdot 3^{10} \\equiv 3^{20} \\equiv 3^{4} \\equiv 1 \\mod 5$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $3 \\times 13 \\times 23 \\times 33 \\times \\ldots \\times 183 \\times 193$ is divided by $5$ is $1$.",
