    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Which digit will appear in the 534th place after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$?",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{384615}$, which repeats every 6 digits. Since 534 is a multiple of 6, the 534th digit is the same as the last digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the digit in the 534th place after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$, we need to do long division. We know that $\\frac{5}{13}$ is a decimal that goes on and on forever without repeating, because 13 doesn't go evenly into 5. \n\nLet's start by doing long division to find the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$ up to a certain point. \n\n5 divided by 13 is 0 with a remainder of 5. So we put a decimal point after the 0 and add a 0 to our dividend, making it 50. \n\n50 divided by 13 is 3 with a remainder of 11. So we add a 3 after the decimal point. Our new dividend is 110. \n\n110 divided by 13 is 8 with a remainder of 6. So we add an 8 after the 3. Our new dividend is 60. \n\n60 divided by 13 is 4 with a remainder of 8. So we add a 4 after the 8. Our new dividend is 80. \n\nWe can continue this process to find more digits after the decimal point. But to find the 534th digit, we would need to do many more steps of long division.\n\nSince it is a complex process to find the 534th digit after the decimal point, one way is to use a calculator to quickly calculate up to the 534th place.",
