    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Which digit will appear in the 534th place after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$?",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{384615}$, which repeats every 6 digits. Since 534 is a multiple of 6, the 534th digit is the same as the last digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find which digit will appear in the 534th place after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$, we can start by calculating the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$. \n\nWhen we divide 5 by 13 using long division, we get:\n$$\\begin{array}{r|ll}\n0. & 3 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n13 & 5 & .000~~ \\\\\n- &  &  0\\\\\n\\hline\n & 5 & 0 \\\\\n- & 3 9 & \\\\\n\\hline\n & & 11 \\quad 0 \\\\\n & & - 7 8  \\\\\n\\hline\n & &  3 2 0 \\\\\n & & - 2 6 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n\nSo, $\\frac{5}{13} = 0.\\overline{384}$, which means that the digits 3, 8, and 4 repeat infinitely. \n\nTo find the digit in the 534th place after the decimal point, we need to determine where in the repeating pattern the 534th digit falls. \n\nSince 534 is not a multiple of 3, we know that the 534th digit will be the 534th digit in the repeating pattern of 3, 8, 4. Since there are 3 digits in the pattern and $534 \\div 3 = 178$, we can see that the 534th digit is the 178th digit in the repeating pattern of 3, 8, 4. \n\nSo, the 178th digit in the repeating pattern of 3, 8, 4 is 4. Therefore, the digit that will appear in the 534th place after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
