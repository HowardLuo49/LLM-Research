    "solution": "Since a terminating decimal can be written in the form of $\\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, we want to rewrite our fraction with a denominator of $10^b=2^b\\cdot5^b$. \\[ \\frac{31}{2\\cdot5^6}\\cdot\\frac{2^{5}}{2^{5}}=\\frac{31\\cdot2^{5}}{10^{6}}=\\frac{992}{10^{6}}. \\]Because the denominator consists only of a $10^6$ term, there are a total of 6 digits to the right of the decimal point, the last three of which are $992$. Therefore, the decimal representation of $\\frac{31}{2\\cdot5^6}$ is $\\boxed{0.000992}$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the fraction 31 over 2 times 5 to the power of 6. We see that the denominator is a power of 5, so we can simplify this fraction as follows:\n\n2 times 5 to the power of 6 is the same as 2 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5 times 5. Multiplying these numbers gives us 2 times 15625, which equals 31250.\n\nSo, our fraction is now 31 over 31250. To turn this fraction into a decimal, we perform the division:\n\n31 \u00f7 31250 = 0.000992\n\nTherefore, the decimal form of $\\frac{31}{2\\cdot5^6}$ is 0.000992.",
