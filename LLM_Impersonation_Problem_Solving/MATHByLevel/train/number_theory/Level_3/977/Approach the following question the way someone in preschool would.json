    "solution": "Let $n$ be the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.  In order for a number to be a perfect cube and a perfect square, it must be a perfect sixth power. Now we choose the smallest $a$ such that $n$ is four-digit: $2^6=64$, $3^6=729$, $4^6=4096$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{4096}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... Let me think about this. A square number is when you multiply a number by itself, like 1x1 = 1 or 2x2 = 4. And a cube number is when you multiply a number by itself twice, like 1x1x1 = 1 or 2x2x2 = 8. So, I need to find a number that is both a square and a cube. Let's start with the smallest four-digit number, which is 1000. But 1000 is not a perfect square or a perfect cube. Let's try the next number, 1001. Nope, that's not it either. Hmm... Oh, I know! The number 1728 is both a perfect square (because 12x12 = 144) and a perfect cube (because 12x12x12 = 1728)! Yay, I found it!",
