    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.  In order for a number to be a perfect cube and a perfect square, it must be a perfect sixth power. Now we choose the smallest $a$ such that $n$ is four-digit: $2^6=64$, $3^6=729$, $4^6=4096$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{4096}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can start by considering the smallest four-digit perfect square. The smallest four-digit perfect square is 100^2 = 10,000. Next, we can find the smallest four-digit perfect cube. The smallest four-digit perfect cube is 21^3 = 9,261.\n\nTherefore, the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 10,000.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4096?: To find the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can start by considering the smallest four-digit perfect square. The smallest four-digit perfect square is 100^2 = 10,000. Next, we can find the smallest four-digit perfect cube. The smallest four-digit perfect cube is 21^3 = 9,261.\n\nTherefore, the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 10,000.",
