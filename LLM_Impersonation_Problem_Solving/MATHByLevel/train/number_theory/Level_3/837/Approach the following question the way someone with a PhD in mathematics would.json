    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The time right now is exactly midnight. What time will it be in 1234 minutes?",
    "solution": "There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When $1234$ is divided by $60$, you get $20$ with a remainder of $34$. Therefore, the time in $1234$ minutes will be $\\boxed{20\\!:\\!34}$ or $\\boxed{8\\!:\\!34 \\text{ p.m.}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the time in 1234 minutes from now, we need to convert this duration into hours and minutes. \n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide 1234 minutes by 60 to find the number of hours. \n\n1234 \u00f7 60 = 20 hours and 34 minutes\n\nSince it is currently midnight, adding 20 hours will bring us to 8:00 PM on the same day. Adding the remaining 34 minutes will bring us to 8:34 PM. \n\nTherefore, the time in 1234 minutes from now will be 8:34 PM.",
