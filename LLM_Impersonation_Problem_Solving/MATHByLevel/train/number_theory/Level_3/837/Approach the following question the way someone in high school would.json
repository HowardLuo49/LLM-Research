    "solution": "There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When $1234$ is divided by $60$, you get $20$ with a remainder of $34$. Therefore, the time in $1234$ minutes will be $\\boxed{20\\!:\\!34}$ or $\\boxed{8\\!:\\!34 \\text{ p.m.}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so if it's midnight right now, that means it's 12:00 AM. To find out what time it will be in 1234 minutes, we need to add that amount of time to the current time. \n\n1234 minutes is equal to 20 hours and 34 minutes (since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour). So, if we add that to midnight, we get 8:34 PM. \n\nSo, in 1234 minutes, it will be 8:34 PM.",
