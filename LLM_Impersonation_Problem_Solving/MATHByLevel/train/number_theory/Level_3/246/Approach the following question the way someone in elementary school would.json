    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. For how many integers $n$ between 1 and 11 (inclusive) is $\\frac{n}{12}$ a repeating decimal?",
    "solution": "Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.\n\nThe prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. Therefore, $n/12$ terminates if and only if the numerator has a factor of $3$ in it to cancel out the $3$ in the denominator. Since $3$ integers from $1$ to $11$ are divisible by $3$, there are $11-3=\\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ for which the fraction is a repeating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to look at the fractions when we divide the numbers 1 through 11 by 12.\n\nWhen we divide 1 by 12, we get 0.08333333.... This is a repeating decimal because the 3s go on forever.\n\nWhen we divide 2 by 12, we get 0.16666666.... This is also a repeating decimal because the 6s go on forever.\n\nWhen we divide 3 by 12, we get 0.25. This is not a repeating decimal because it stops.\n\nWhen we divide 4 by 12, we get 0.3333333.... This is a repeating decimal.\n\nWhen we divide 5 by 12, we get 0.41666666.... This is a repeating decimal.\n\nWhen we divide 6 by 12, we get 0.5. This is not a repeating decimal.\n\nWhen we divide 7 by 12, we get 0.58333333.... This is a repeating decimal.\n\nWhen we divide 8 by 12, we get 0.66666666.... This is a repeating decimal.\n\nWhen we divide 9 by 12, we get 0.75. This is not a repeating decimal.\n\nWhen we divide 10 by 12, we get 0.83333333.... This is a repeating decimal.\n\nWhen we divide 11 by 12, we get 0.91666666....
