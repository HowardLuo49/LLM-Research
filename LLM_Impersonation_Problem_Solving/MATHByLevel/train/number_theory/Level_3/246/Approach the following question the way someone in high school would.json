    "solution": "Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.\n\nThe prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. Therefore, $n/12$ terminates if and only if the numerator has a factor of $3$ in it to cancel out the $3$ in the denominator. Since $3$ integers from $1$ to $11$ are divisible by $3$, there are $11-3=\\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ for which the fraction is a repeating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about this problem in a high school-friendly way. \n\nFirst, we need to understand what a repeating decimal is. A repeating decimal is a decimal that has a repeating pattern of digits after the decimal point. For example, 0.33333... is a repeating decimal because the digit 3 repeats infinitely.\n\nTo determine if $\\frac{n}{12}$ is a repeating decimal, we need to consider the denominator 12. In order for a fraction to have a repeating decimal when simplified, the denominator needs to have factors other than 2 and 5. \n\nThe prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 * 3$. So, any integer $n$ between 1 and 11 that has factors of 2 or 5 will not result in a repeating decimal when divided by 12. \n\nLet's analyze the numbers between 1 and 11:\n1 has no factors of 2 or 5\n2 has a factor of 2\n3 has a factor of 3\n4 has a factor of 2\n5 has a factor of 5\n6 has factors of 2 and 3\n7 has no factors of 2 or 5\n8 has a factor of 2\n9 has a factor of 3\n10 has factors of 2 and 5\n11 has no factors of 2 or 5\n\nTherefore, out of the integers between 1 and 11, 4, 6, and 9 do not have factors of 2 or 5, so $\\frac{4}{12}$, $\\frac{6}{12}$, and $\\frac{9}{12}$ are the only fractions that will result in a repeating decimal. \n\nIn conclusion, there are 3 integers between 1 and 11 for which $\\frac{n}{12}$ is a repeating decimal. Great job working through this problem!",
