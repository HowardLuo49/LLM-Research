    "solution": "Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.\n\nThe prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. Therefore, $n/12$ terminates if and only if the numerator has a factor of $3$ in it to cancel out the $3$ in the denominator. Since $3$ integers from $1$ to $11$ are divisible by $3$, there are $11-3=\\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ for which the fraction is a repeating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many integers between 1 and 11 (inclusive) result in a repeating decimal when divided by 12, we can observe that the decimal representation of a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ will repeat if and only if the denominator $b$ is not divisible by any prime factors other than 2 and 5. In this case, the denominator is 12, which can be factored as $2^2 \\times 3$.\n\nSince 2 and 3 are both prime factors of 12, any integer $n$ between 1 and 11 that is divisible by 3 will not result in a repeating decimal when divided by 12, as 3 is a prime factor that is not 2 or 5.\n\nTherefore, we can exclude the integers 3, 6, 9 from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} as they are multiples of 3 and their division by 12 will not result in a repeating decimal. This leaves us with the integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11. \n\nThus, there are 8 integers between 1 and 11 (inclusive) for which $\\frac{n}{12}$ results in a repeating decimal.",
