    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the base-10 integer 515 when expressed in base 6?",
    "solution": "The largest power of 6 less than 515 is $6^3=216$, and the largest multiple of 216 less than 515 is $2\\cdot216=432$. That means there is a 2 in the $6^3$ place. We have $515-432=83$ left. The largest multiple of a power of 6 that is less than 83 is $2\\cdot6^2=72$. There is a 2 in the $6^2$ place. Now we're left with $83-72=11$, which can be represented as $1\\cdot6^1+5\\cdot6^0$. So, we get $515=2\\cdot6^3+2\\cdot6^2+1\\cdot6^1+5\\cdot6^0=\\boxed{2215_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the base-6 number of 515, we need to divide it by 6. \n\n5 divided by 6 is 0 with a remainder of 5. So, the first digit is 5.\n\nNext, we take the remainder of 5 and add it to the next digit, which is 1. So we have 5 + 1 = 6.\n\n6 divided by 6 is 1 with no remainder. So, the next digit is 1.\n\nTherefore, the base-6 representation of the base-10 integer 515 is 151.",
