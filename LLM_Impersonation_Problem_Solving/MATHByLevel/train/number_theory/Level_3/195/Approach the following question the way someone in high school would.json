    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When the base-10 integers 200 and 1200 are expressed in base 2, how many more digits does 1200 have than 200 (after being converted)?",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is $2^{10}=1024$, and the largest power of 2 less than 200 is $2^7=128$. So, we know that 1200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^{10}$ place followed by other digits, and 200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^7$ place followed by other digits. Since $2^{10}$ is 3 places away from $2^7$, 1200 will have $\\boxed{3}$ more digits than 200 in their base-2 representations.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert 200 to base 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than 200. The largest power of 2 less than 200 is 2^7, which is equal to 128. So, we have a 1 in the 2^7 place. Since 200 - 128 = 72, the largest power of 2 less than 72 is 2^6, which is equal to 64. So, we have a 1 in the 2^6 place. Since 72 - 64 = 8, the largest power of 2 less than 8 is 2^3, which is equal to 8. So, we have a 1 in the 2^3 place. The rest of the digits will be 0, so 200 in base 2 is 11001000.\n\nTo convert 1200 to base 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than 1200. The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is 2^10, which is equal to 1024. So, we have a 1 in the 2^10 place. Since 1200 - 1024 = 176, the largest power of 2 less than 176 is 2^7, which is equal to 128. So, we have a 1 in the 2^7 place. Since 176 - 128 = 48, the largest power of 2 less than 48 is 2^5, which is equal to 32. So, we have a 1 in the 2^5 place. Since 48 - 32 = 16, the largest power of 2 less than 16 is 2^4, which is equal to 16. So, we have a 1 in the 2^4 place. The rest of the digits will be 0, so 1200 in base 2 is 10010110000.\n\nTo find out how many more digits 1200 has than 200, we subtract the number of digits in the base 2 representation of 200 from the number of digits in the base 2 representation of 1200. 200 in base 2 has 8 digits and 1200 in base 2 has 12 digits. So, 1200 has 4 more digits than 200.",
