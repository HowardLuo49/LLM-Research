    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When the base-10 integers 200 and 1200 are expressed in base 2, how many more digits does 1200 have than 200 (after being converted)?",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is $2^{10}=1024$, and the largest power of 2 less than 200 is $2^7=128$. So, we know that 1200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^{10}$ place followed by other digits, and 200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^7$ place followed by other digits. Since $2^{10}$ is 3 places away from $2^7$, 1200 will have $\\boxed{3}$ more digits than 200 in their base-2 representations.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many more digits the base-2 representation of 1200 has compared to that of 200, we first need to convert both numbers from base-10 to base-2.\n\n200 in base-10 is equal to 11001000 in base-2.\n1200 in base-10 is equal to 10010110000 in base-2.\n\nTo assess the difference in the number of digits between the two base-2 representations, we calculate the difference in the number of bits in their binary representations.
