It is one less than a multiple of 8, and it is three less than a multiple of 7. What is the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of. We know $n<100$ and $n=8k-1=7l-3$ for some positive integers $k$ and $l$. From this we see that $7l=8k+2=2(4k+1)$, so $7l$ is a multiple of 14. List some multiples of 14, in decreasing order: 112, 98, 84, 70, .... Since $n<100$, 112 is too large, but 98 works: $7k=98\\Rightarrow n=98-3=95=8(12)-1$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{95}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let N be the positive integer less than 100 that Jo is thinking of. We know that N is one less than a multiple of 8, so N = 8k - 1 for some positive integer k. We also know that N is three less than a multiple of 7, so N = 7m - 3 for some positive integer m.\n\nSetting these two expressions for N equal to each other, we get:\n\n8k - 1 = 7m - 3\n8k = 7m - 2\n\nThis equation suggests that 8k is two less than a multiple of 7. We can test different values of m until we find a multiple of 7 that is two more than a multiple of 8. Since we are looking for the greatest possible integer, we start with the largest possible multiple of 7 less than 100, which is 98 (14 x 7).\n\nIf m = 14, then 7m = 98 and 8k = 96. Solving for k, we get k = 12. Therefore, the greatest possible integer less than 100 that Jo could be thinking of is:\n\nN = 8k - 1 = 8(12) - 1 = 95.\n\nSo, the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of is 95.",
