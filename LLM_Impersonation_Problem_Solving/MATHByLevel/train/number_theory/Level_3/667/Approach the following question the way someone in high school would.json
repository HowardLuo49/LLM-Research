    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors, we should start by listing out the factors of some small numbers to see how many factors they have. Let's start with 1, which only has one factor (1). Next, let's look at 2, which has two factors (1 and 2). Then, we have 3, which also has two factors (1 and 3). \n\nNow, let's try 4 - it has three factors (1, 2, and 4). Next up is 5, which also has two factors (1 and 5). Moving on to 6, it has four factors (1, 2, 3, and 6). So far, the smallest number we've found with exactly five distinct positive factors is 16, which has the factors 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors is 16.",
