    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors?",
    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors, we need to consider the prime factorization of the integer. A positive integer with five distinct factors must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. This is because if we have a prime factorization of the form p^a*q^b*r^c, where a, b, and c are all greater than or equal to 1, then the number of factors will be (a+1)(b+1)(c+1), which is greater than 5 unless a=4 and b=c=0.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors is 2^4 = 16.",
