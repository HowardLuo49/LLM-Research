    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count the factors of some small numbers to find the answer.\n\nLet's start with the number 1. It has only 1 factor, which is 1 itself. So, it's not the number we're looking for.\n\nNext, let's try the number 2. It has 2 factors, 1 and 2. Still not what we're looking for.\n\nNow, let's try the number 3. It has 2 factors, 1 and 3. Not it either.\n\nLet's try the number 4. It has 3 factors, 1, 2, and 4. Getting closer.\n\nFinally, let's try the number 6. It has 4 factors, 1, 2, 3, and 6. Almost there.\n\nOh, I know the answer! The least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors is 16! The factors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Yay, we found it!",
