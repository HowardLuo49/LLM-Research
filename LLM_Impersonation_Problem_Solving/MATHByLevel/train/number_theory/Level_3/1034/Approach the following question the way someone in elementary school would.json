    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many different positive values of $x$ will make this statement true: there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$.",
    "solution": "If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$.  Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$ (or else there would be $3$, not $2$ multiples in the two-digit range).\n\nIt may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nThe largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.  Every value of $x$ from $34$ to $49$ works.\n\nNow, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.  This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!  Suppose we subtract $33$ from each number.  Then we are counting the numbers from $1$ to $16,$ and so there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to think about what a two-digit number means. A two-digit number is a number between 10 and 99. So we need to find a number that has exactly 2 multiples (numbers you can multiply together to get the number).\n\nLet's start by looking at the number 10. The multiples of 10 are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. That's more than 2 multiples, so 10 doesn't work.\n\nNext, let's try 12. The multiples of 12 are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96. That's also more than 2 multiples, so 12 doesn't work.\n\nLet's try 15 now. The multiples of 15 are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90. That's exactly 2 multiples of 15, so the answer is $\\boxed{1}$ positive value of $x$ that will make the statement true.",
