    "solution": "The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$.  An integer is a divisor of $180$ if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of 180.  An integer is a perfect square if and only if every exponent in its prime factorization is even.  Therefore, to form the prime factorization of a perfect square divisor of 180, we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 2 and we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 3.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ perfect square divisors of 180: $2^0\\cdot3^0$, $2^0\\cdot3^2$, $2^2\\cdot3^0$, and $2^2\\cdot3^2$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many perfect squares are factors of 180, we need to list the prime factors of 180 first. \n\n180 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5\n\nNow, we look at the prime factors and see which ones can be paired up to make perfect squares. In this case, we have 2 squared (2 x 2 = 4), 3 squared (3 x 3 = 9), and 5 squared (5 x 5 = 25).\n\nSo the perfect squares that are factors of 180 are 4, 9, and 25. That means we have 3 perfect squares that are factors of 180.",
