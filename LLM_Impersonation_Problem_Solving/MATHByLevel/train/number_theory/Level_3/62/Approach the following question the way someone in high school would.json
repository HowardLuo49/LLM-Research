    "solution": "The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$.  An integer is a divisor of $180$ if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of 180.  An integer is a perfect square if and only if every exponent in its prime factorization is even.  Therefore, to form the prime factorization of a perfect square divisor of 180, we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 2 and we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 3.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ perfect square divisors of 180: $2^0\\cdot3^0$, $2^0\\cdot3^2$, $2^2\\cdot3^0$, and $2^2\\cdot3^2$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the perfect squares that are factors of 180, we need to find the prime factorization of 180. \n\nThe prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5. \n\nTo find the perfect squares that are factors of 180, we need to determine how many ways we can pair up the prime factors. Since perfect squares have an even number of each prime factor, the perfect squares that are factors of 180 will be 2^0, 2^2, 2^4, 3^0, 3^2, and 5^0. \n\nTherefore, there are 6 perfect squares that are factors of 180.",
