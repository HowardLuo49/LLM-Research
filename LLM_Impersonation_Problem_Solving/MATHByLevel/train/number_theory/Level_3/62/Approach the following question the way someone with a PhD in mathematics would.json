    "solution": "The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$.  An integer is a divisor of $180$ if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of 180.  An integer is a perfect square if and only if every exponent in its prime factorization is even.  Therefore, to form the prime factorization of a perfect square divisor of 180, we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 2 and we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 3.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ perfect square divisors of 180: $2^0\\cdot3^0$, $2^0\\cdot3^2$, $2^2\\cdot3^0$, and $2^2\\cdot3^2$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of perfect squares that are factors of 180, we first need to find the prime factorization of 180. \n\nThe prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5. \n\nFor a number to be a perfect square factor of 180, each of its prime factors must have an even exponent in the prime factorization of 180. This is because a perfect square is a number that can be formed by multiplying an integer by itself, so each prime factor must appear in pairs in the factorization.\n\nIn the prime factorization of 180, the exponents of 2 and 3 are even, while the exponent of 5 is odd. This means that the factors of 180 that are perfect squares are of the form 2^m * 3^n, where m and n are even non-negative integers.\n\nSince 2 has 2 possible even exponents (0 and 2), and 3 also has 2 possible even exponents (0 and 2), there are a total of 2 * 2 = 4 perfect square factors of 180. \n\nTherefore, there are 4 perfect square factors of 180.",
