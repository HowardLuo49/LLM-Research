    "solution": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds. Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\\boxed{4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.}}$",
    "gpt_response": "Let $t$ represent the time in seconds that has elapsed since $3:00:00 \\text{ p.m.}$, so $t = 6666 \\text{ sec}$. We want to find the time that corresponds to $t$ seconds after $3:00:00 \\text{ p.m.}$.\n\nTo convert $t$ seconds into hours, we divide $t$ by $3600 \\text{ sec}$ since $3600 \\text{ sec}$ is equivalent to $1$ hour. This gives us $t = 6666 \\text{ sec} / 3600 \\text{ sec} = 1.8516... \\approx 1.85$ hours.\n\nTherefore, $6666$ seconds after $3:00:00 \\text{ p.m.}$ will be $3:00:00 \\text{ p.m.}$ + $1.85$ hours, which is $4:51:06 \\text{ p.m.}$",
