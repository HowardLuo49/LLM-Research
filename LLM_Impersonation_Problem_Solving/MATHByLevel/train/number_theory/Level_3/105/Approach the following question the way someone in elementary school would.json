    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. It is currently $3\\!:\\!00\\!:\\!00 \\text{ p.m.}$ What time will it be in $6666$ seconds?  (Enter the time in the format \"HH:MM:SS\", without including \"am\" or \"pm\".)",
    "solution": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds. Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\\boxed{4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.}}$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's convert $6666$ seconds into minutes. \n\nSince there are $60$ seconds in a minute, we divide $6666$ by $60$ to get $111$ minutes with $6$ seconds remaining.\n\nNext, let's convert $111$ minutes into hours.\n\nSince there are $60$ minutes in an hour, we divide $111$ by $60$ to get $1$ hour with $51$ minutes remaining. \n\nSo, the time will be $3+1 = 4$ hours and $51$ minutes after $3\\!:\\!00\\!:\\!00$. \n\nTherefore, the time will be $\\boxed{04:51:06}$ after $6666$ seconds.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.?: First, let's convert $6666$ seconds into minutes. \n\nSince there are $60$ seconds in a minute, we divide $6666$ by $60$ to get $111$ minutes with $6$ seconds remaining.\n\nNext, let's convert $111$ minutes into hours.\n\nSince there are $60$ minutes in an hour, we divide $111$ by $60$ to get $1$ hour with $51$ minutes remaining. \n\nSo, the time will be $3+1 = 4$ hours and $51$ minutes after $3\\!:\\!00\\!:\\!00$. \n\nTherefore, the time will be $\\boxed{04:51:06}$ after $6666$ seconds.",
