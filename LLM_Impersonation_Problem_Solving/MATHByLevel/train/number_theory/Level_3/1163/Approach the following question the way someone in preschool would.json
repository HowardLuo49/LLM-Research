    "solution": "First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$. Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the ones digit of $11^{11}$. Let's count it out together - 11 times itself is 11, then 11 times 11 is 121, then 121 times 11 is 1331, and so on. After counting a few more times, we see that the ones digit of $11^{11}$ is 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the ones digit of $22^{22 \\times 1}$. Since anything raised to the power of 1 is just itself, we know that $22^{22 \\times 1}$ is the same as $22^{22}$. \n\nTo find the ones digit of $22^{22}$, we can start by breaking it down. The ones digit of $22^1$ is 2, the ones digit of $22^2$ is 4, the ones digit of $22^3$ is 8, and so on. We keep counting to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFinally, we notice that the ones digit of $22^{22}$ is 4.\n\nSo, the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is the same as the ones digit of $22^{22}$, which is 4. Yay, we did it!",
