    "solution": "First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$. Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$, we can first consider the ones digit of powers of 2. The ones digit of powers of 2 follows a pattern: \n$2^1$ has a ones digit of 2, \n$2^2$ has a ones digit of 4,\n$2^3$ has a ones digit of 8,\n$2^4$ has a ones digit of 6,\n$2^5$ has a ones digit of 2, and so on.\n\nSince the ones digit of 2 repeats a cycle of 4 (2, 4, 8, 6), we need to find the remainder of $22(11^{11})$ when divided by 4. \n\nCalculating $22(11^{11}) \\mod 4$, we first need to find the remainder of $11^{11}$ when divided by 4. We can use the cyclicity of the powers of 1 (1, 1, 1, 1) to see that $11^1 = 1$ when divided by 4. Therefore, $11^{11} \\equiv 1 \\mod 4$. \n\nNow, since $22(11^{11}) = 22 \\times 1$, we know that $22(11^{11})$ has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.\n\nFinally, we can use this information to determine the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$. Since $22^{22(11^{11})} \\equiv 2^{2} \\equiv 4 \\mod 10$, the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is 4.",
