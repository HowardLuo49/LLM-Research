    "solution": "First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$. Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})$, first let's find the ones digit of $11^{11}$. To do this, we can simply calculate $11^{11}$.\n$11^{11} = 285311670611$. The ones digit of this number is 1.\n\nNow, we need to find the last digit of $22^{22*1}$ since the ones digit of $11^{11}$ is 1.\n$22^{22} = 515377520732011331036461129765621272702107522001$.
