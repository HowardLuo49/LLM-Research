    "solution": "We can re-write the problem as the following three equations: $$k = 17a+1\\\\k = 6b+1 \\\\ k = 2c + 1$$Therefore, $k-1$ is divisible by $17,$ $6,$ and $2.$ The smallest positive value of $k-1$ is thus $$\\text{lcm}[17,6,2] = \\text{lcm}[17,6] = 17\\cdot 6 = 102,$$and so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 102+1 = \\boxed{103}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest integer $k$ that fits these conditions, we can start by looking at integers that satisfy the remainder condition when divided by $2$. Since $k$ must be greater than $1$ and have a remainder of $1$ when divided by $2$, the smallest possible integer is $3$.\n\nNext, we need to check if $k=3$ satisfies the remainder condition when divided by $17$ and $6$. We find that $3$ also has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6$.\n\nFinally, we check if $k=3$ satisfies the remainder condition when divided by $17$. We see that $3$ has a remainder of $3$ when divided by $17$.\n\nSince $3$ does not satisfy the remainder condition when divided by $17$, we move on to the next possible integer that satisfies the remainder condition when divided by $2$ and $6$. The next integer that satisfies the remainder condition when divided by $2$ and $6$ is $9$.\n\nWe check if $k=9$ satisfies the remainder condition when divided by $17$. We see that $9$ has a remainder of $9$ when divided by $17$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the conditions specified is $9$.",
