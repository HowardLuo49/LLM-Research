    "solution": "We can re-write the problem as the following three equations: $$k = 17a+1\\\\k = 6b+1 \\\\ k = 2c + 1$$Therefore, $k-1$ is divisible by $17,$ $6,$ and $2.$ The smallest positive value of $k-1$ is thus $$\\text{lcm}[17,6,2] = \\text{lcm}[17,6] = 17\\cdot 6 = 102,$$and so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 102+1 = \\boxed{103}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... So if we divide $k$ by $17,$ $6,$ and $2,$ and in each case we get a remainder of $1, then that means $k$ is one more than a multiple of each of those numbers. That means $k$ has to be one more than a multiple of the least common multiple of $17,$ $6,$ and $2,$ which is $2\\cdot3\\cdot17=102.$ So the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies all those conditions is $102+1=\\boxed{103}.$",
