    "solution": "We can re-write the problem as the following three equations: $$k = 17a+1\\\\k = 6b+1 \\\\ k = 2c + 1$$Therefore, $k-1$ is divisible by $17,$ $6,$ and $2.$ The smallest positive value of $k-1$ is thus $$\\text{lcm}[17,6,2] = \\text{lcm}[17,6] = 17\\cdot 6 = 102,$$and so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 102+1 = \\boxed{103}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the given conditions, we can first consider the remainders obtained by dividing integers greater than $1$ by $17,$ $6,$ and $2$.\n\nWhen we divide integers by $17$, the possible remainders are $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 16.$\nWhen we divide integers by $6$, the possible remainders are $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 5.$\nWhen we divide integers by $2$, the possible remainders are $0$ and $1$.\n\nThe smallest integer $k$ greater than $1$ that has remainder $1$ when divided by $17$ is $18$.
