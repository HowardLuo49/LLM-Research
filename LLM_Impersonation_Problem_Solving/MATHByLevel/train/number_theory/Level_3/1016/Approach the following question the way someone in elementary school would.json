    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $15 \\pmod{22}$ is of the form $22n+15$.\n\nTherefore, we make the equation $22n+15<10000$, and find the largest possible $n$. \\begin{align*}\n22n+15&<10000 \\\\\n22n&<9985 \\\\\nn&<\\frac{9985}{22} \\approx 453.85\n\\end{align*}The largest possible integer $n$ is $453$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $22 \\cdot 453 +15 =\\boxed{9981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest 4-digit number that has a remainder of 15 when divided by 22, we can start by finding the largest multiple of 22 less than 1000 (the largest 4-digit number). \n\nThe largest multiple of 22 less than 1000 is $22 \\times 45 = 990$. \n\nSince the number we are looking for has a remainder of 15 when divided by 22, we can add 15 to 990 to find the largest 4-digit number that satisfies this condition. \n\nTherefore, the largest 4-digit number congruent to 15 (mod 22) is $990 + 15 = 1005$.",
