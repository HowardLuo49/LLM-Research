    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $15 \\pmod{22}$ is of the form $22n+15$.\n\nTherefore, we make the equation $22n+15<10000$, and find the largest possible $n$. \\begin{align*}\n22n+15&<10000 \\\\\n22n&<9985 \\\\\nn&<\\frac{9985}{22} \\approx 453.85\n\\end{align*}The largest possible integer $n$ is $453$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $22 \\cdot 453 +15 =\\boxed{9981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest 4-digit integer congruent to 15 modulo 22, we need to find the largest integer of the form 22n + 15 that is less than 10000. \n\nLet's start by finding the largest possible value of n that keeps 22n + 15 less than 10000. \nSolving 22n + 15 < 10000, we get:\n22n < 9985\nn < 453.409\n\nTherefore, the largest integer n that satisfies the condition is 453. So, the largest 4-digit integer congruent to 15 modulo 22 is:\n22 * 453 + 15 = 9971\n\nHence, the largest 4-digit integer congruent to 15 modulo 22 is 9971.",
