    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of ones digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of ones digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 7, 9, 3, 1. Thus, to find the ones digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the ones digit 7, $R=2$ corresponds to the ones digit 9, etc.) Since $35\\div4=8R3$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $7^{35$, we need to look at the pattern of the ones digit of powers of 7. \n\nWhen we multiply 7 by itself, the ones digit cycles in the pattern: 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1, and so on.\n\nSince 35 is a multiple of 4 (35 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3), the ones digit of $7^{35$ will be the same as the ones digit of $7^{3$.\n\nWhen we raise 7 to the power of 3, we get 7 x 7 x 7 = 343.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $7^{35$ is 3.",
