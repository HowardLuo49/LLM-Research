    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of ones digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of ones digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 7, 9, 3, 1. Thus, to find the ones digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the ones digit 7, $R=2$ corresponds to the ones digit 9, etc.) Since $35\\div4=8R3$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the ones digit of $7^{35}$, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. Since we are only interested in the ones digit, we can take the expression $7^{35}$ modulo 10, which means finding the remainder when dividing $7^{35}$ by 10.\n\nWe know that the ones digits of powers of 7 repeat in cycles of 4: 7, 9, 3, 1. Therefore, to find the ones digit of $7^{35}$, we need to find the remainder when 35 is divided by 4. \n\n35 divided by 4 gives a quotient of 8 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, $7^{35}$ has the same ones digit as $7^3$, which is 3.\n\nThus, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is 3 when written as an integer.",
