    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of ones digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of ones digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 7, 9, 3, 1. Thus, to find the ones digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the ones digit 7, $R=2$ corresponds to the ones digit 9, etc.) Since $35\\div4=8R3$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $7^{35$, we need to look at the pattern of ones digits as we raise $7$ to different powers. \n\nWhen we raise $7$ to the first few powers, we get:\n$7^1 = 7$\n$7^2 = 49$\n$7^3 = 343$\n$7^4 = 2401$\n$7^5 = 16807$\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that the ones digit of the powers of $7$ repeats every 4 powers: 7, 9, 3, 1.\n\nSince $35$ is a multiple of $4$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ will be the same as the ones digit of $7^4$, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is 1.",
