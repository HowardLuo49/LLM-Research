    "solution": "The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$. Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\\boxed{4}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of digits in the base-7 representation of a number, we must first convert the number from base-10 to base-7. \n\nTo convert $956$ to base-7, we divide $956$ by $7$ and write down the remainder. Continuing this process until we reach a quotient of $0$, we get the following:\n\n$956 = 136\\times 7 + 4$\n$136 = 19\\times 7 + 3$\n$19 = 2\\times 7 + 5$\n$2 = 0\\times 7 + 2$\n\nReading the remainders in reverse order, we get $2364$, which is the base-7 representation of $956$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ digits in the base-7 representation of $956$.",
