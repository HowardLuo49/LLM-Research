    "solution": "The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$. Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\\boxed{4}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of digits in the base-7 representation of $956$, we need to figure out how many times 7 goes into 956. \n\n7 goes into 95 about 13 times with a remainder of 4. So we have a 1 in the hundreds place and a 3 in the tens place. \n\nThen we have 7 goes into 54 about 7 times with a remainder of 5. So we have a 7 in the ones place.\n\nSo the base-7 representation of $956$ is $1374$. \n\nThere are 4 digits in the base-7 representation of $956$.",
