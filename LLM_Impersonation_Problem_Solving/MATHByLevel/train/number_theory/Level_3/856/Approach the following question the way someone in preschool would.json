    "solution": "The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$. Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\\boxed{4}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the digits in $956$ when we write it in base-7! Let's start by dividing $956$ by $7$ to see how many groups of $7$ we can make. We can make $136$ groups of $7$ because $7 \\times 136 = 952$. That means we have $4$ left over. So, in base-7, $956$ is represented as $1364$. There are $4$ digits in the base-7 representation of $956!",
