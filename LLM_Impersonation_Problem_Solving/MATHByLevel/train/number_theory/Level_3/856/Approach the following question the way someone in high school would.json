    "solution": "The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$. Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\\boxed{4}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of digits in the base-7 representation of $956$, we need to convert $956$ into base-7. \n\nTo do this, we can divide $956$ by $7$ and keep track of the remainders. \n\n956 \u00f7 7 = 136 remainder 4\n136 \u00f7 7 = 19 remainder 3\n19 \u00f7 7 = 2 remainder 5\n2 \u00f7 7 = 0 remainder 2\n\nTherefore, in base-7, $956$ is represented as $2534$. \n\nSince there are four digits in the base-7 representation of $956$, the answer is 4.",
