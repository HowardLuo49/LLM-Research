    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count on our fingers! First, we can solve $182\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$. We know that $182\\pmod{14}=0$, so we can ignore that part. Then we have to find $12\\pmod{14}$ which equals 12. So $182\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$ is just $0\\cdot 12\\pmod{14}$, which is $0\\pmod{14}$.\n\nNext, let's solve $15\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$. First, $15\\pmod{14}=1$, and $7\\pmod{14}=7$, so $15\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$ is $1\\cdot 7\\pmod{14}$, which equals $7\\pmod{14}$.\n\nFinally, let's find $3\\pmod{14}$. We already know that 3 divided by 14 leaves a remainder of 3, so $3\\pmod{14}=3$.\n\nNow we can put it all together: $0 - 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$. When we do the math, we get $-4\\pmod{14}$.\n\nSo the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$ is $-4\\pmod{14}$.",
