    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue, we first need to do the multiplication and subtraction. So let's start by multiplying 182 by 12, which is 2184. Then we subtract 15 times 7, which is 105, and then add 3. \n\nSo our expression now looks like this:\n2184 - 105 + 3 \n\nNext, we need to find the total and see what the remainder is when we divide by 14. \n2184 - 105 + 3 is equal to 2082. \n\nNow we divide 2082 by 14 to find the residue. Doing the math, we find that $2082\\div14= 148$ remainder $10$.\n\nSo the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3$ $\\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{10}$.",
