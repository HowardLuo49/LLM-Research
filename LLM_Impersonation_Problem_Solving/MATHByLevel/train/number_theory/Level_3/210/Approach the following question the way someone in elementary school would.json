    "solution": "We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors. $10=5\\cdot2=10\\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:\n\n$\\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3=48.$\n\n$\\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$\n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\\boxed{48}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors, we need to think about what numbers can have exactly $10$ factors. One way to approach this is by thinking about prime factorization.\n\nFirst, we need to figure out how to get $10$ factors. One way to do this is to have $2$ prime factors raised to certain powers. For example, if we have two different prime factors, say $p$ and $q$, we can have a number of the form $p^2 \\cdot q^3$ which has $(2+1)(3+1) = 12$ factors. So, we need to find the smallest number that can be represented as $p^4 \\cdot q^1$ in order to have exactly $10$ factors.\n\nThe smallest prime number is $2$, so let's assign $p=2$ and $q$ can be two. The smallest number that can be represented as $2^4 \\cdot 3^1 = 48$. This number has exactly $10$ factors: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors is $48$.",
