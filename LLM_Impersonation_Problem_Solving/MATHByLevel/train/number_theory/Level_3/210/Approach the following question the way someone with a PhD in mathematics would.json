    "solution": "We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors. $10=5\\cdot2=10\\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:\n\n$\\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3=48.$\n\n$\\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$\n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\\boxed{48}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors, we need to consider its prime factorization. Since the number of factors of a number depends on the exponents of its prime factors, our goal is to find a number with prime factorization in the form $p^4q^1$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes.\n\nLet's denote the number we are looking for as $N = p^4q$. The total number of factors of $N$ is given by the formula $(4+1)(1+1) = 10$, where the first factor comes from adding $1$ to the exponent of each prime factor and the second factor is based on multiplying the incremented exponents.\n\nSince we aim to find the least such number, we should take the smallest prime numbers for $p$ and $q$, which are $2$ and $3$ respectively. Therefore, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors is $2^4 \\cdot 3 = 48$.",
