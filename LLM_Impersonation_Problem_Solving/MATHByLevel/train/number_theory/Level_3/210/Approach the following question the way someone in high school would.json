    "solution": "We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors. $10=5\\cdot2=10\\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:\n\n$\\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3=48.$\n\n$\\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$\n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\\boxed{48}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so to find the least positive integer with exactly 10 positive factors, we need to think about how we can have 10 factors. \n\nOne way to think about this is to remember that factors come in pairs when a number is not a perfect square. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. That's 6 factors, because each factor pairs up with another. \n\nSo, for a number to have exactly 10 factors, it must be a square number times a prime number. The smallest square number is 2 squared (4), and the smallest prime number is 2. So the least positive integer with exactly 10 positive factors is $2^3 \\cdot 3 = 24$. I hope that helps!",
