    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ by $5^{10}$ to see that $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is equal to $\\frac{5^{10}}{10^{10}}$. This shows that the decimal representation of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is obtained by moving the decimal point ten places to the left in the decimal representation of $5^{10}$. Since $5^{10}$ has a units digit of 5 (as does every positive integer power of 5), we find that the last digit in the decimal expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$, we need to simplify the fraction first. We know that $2^{10}$ is equal to 1024. So, $\\frac{1}{2^{10}} = \\frac{1}{1024}$. \n\nNow, to find the last digit of the decimal expansion, we need to divide 1 by 1024. When we do that, we get $0.0009765625$. \n\nThe last digit of this decimal is $5$. So, the last digit of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$ is $5$.",
