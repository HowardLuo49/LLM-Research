    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ by $5^{10}$ to see that $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is equal to $\\frac{5^{10}}{10^{10}}$. This shows that the decimal representation of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is obtained by moving the decimal point ten places to the left in the decimal representation of $5^{10}$. Since $5^{10}$ has a units digit of 5 (as does every positive integer power of 5), we find that the last digit in the decimal expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we know that $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$ means we are dividing 1 into 1024 equal parts because $2^{10}$ is 1024. So, if we have to find the last digit, we need to see what the remainder is when we divide 1 into 1024 equal parts. Let's count together and see what the last digit is!",

So, if we have to find the last digit, we need to see what the remainder is when we divide 1 into 1024 equal parts. Let's count together and see what the last digit is!",
