    "solution": "$12345_{6} = 5\\cdot6^{0}+4\\cdot6^{1}+3\\cdot6^{2}+2\\cdot6^{3}+1\\cdot6^{4} = 5+24+108+432+1296 = \\boxed{1865}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the base ten equivalent of $12345_{6}$, we must first acknowledge that the subscript \"6\" indicates that the given number is in base 6. This means that each digit in the number is multiplied by a power of 6 according to its position in the number.\n\nTherefore, we can compute the base ten equivalent as follows:\n$1*6^4 + 2*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 5*6^0$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$1296 + 432 + 108 + 24 + 5$\nand further simplifies to:\n$1865$\n\nTherefore, the base ten equivalent of $12345_{6}$ is $1865$.",
