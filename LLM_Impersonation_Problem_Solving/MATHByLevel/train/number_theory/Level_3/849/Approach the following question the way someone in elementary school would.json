    "solution": "$12345_{6} = 5\\cdot6^{0}+4\\cdot6^{1}+3\\cdot6^{2}+2\\cdot6^{3}+1\\cdot6^{4} = 5+24+108+432+1296 = \\boxed{1865}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the base ten equivalent of $12345_{6}$, we need to remember that each digit in base 6 represents a different power of 6. \n\nSo, let's break it down:\n- The digit in the rightmost place is 5. This represents 5 units.\n- The digit in the second place from the right is 4. This represents 4 sixes (6 x 4 = 24).\n- The digit in the third place from the right is 3. This represents 3 sixes squared (6 x 6 x 3 = 108).\n- The digit in the fourth place from the right is 2. This represents 2 sixes cubed (6 x 6 x 6 x 2 = 432).\n- The digit in the fifth place from the right is 1. This represents 1 six to the fourth power (6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 1 = 1296).\n\nNow, if we add up all these values, we get:\n5 + 24 + 108 + 432 + 1296 = $1865_{10}$\n\nSo, the base ten equivalent of $12345_{6}$ is $1865_{10}$.",
