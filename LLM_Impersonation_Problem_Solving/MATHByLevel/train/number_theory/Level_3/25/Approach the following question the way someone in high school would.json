    "solution": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest whole number less than $100$ that has an odd number of positive factors, we need to look for a perfect square number. A perfect square number has an odd number of positive factors because it has an odd number of divisors.\n\nThe greatest perfect square less than $100$ is $81$, which is equal to $9^2$. $81$ has $5$ positive factors: $1, 3, 9, 27, 81$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest whole number less than $100$ that has an odd number of positive factors is $81$.",
