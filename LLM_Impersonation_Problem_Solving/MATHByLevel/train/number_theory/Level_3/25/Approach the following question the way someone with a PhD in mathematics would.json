    "solution": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a positive integer with prime factorization $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_k$ are positive integers. The number of positive factors of $n$ is given by $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\cdots(a_k+1)$.\n\nFor $n$ to have an odd number of positive factors, each factor in the expression above must be odd. This implies that each $a_i$ must be even for $i=1,2,\\ldots,k$. Therefore, $n$ itself must be a perfect square.\n\nAmong integers less than $100$, the greatest perfect square is $81=9^2$. Therefore, the greatest whole number less than $100$ that has an odd number of positive factors is $\\boxed{81}$.",
