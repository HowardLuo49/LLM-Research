    "solution": "First we convert to base 10, obtaining $427_8 = 4 \\cdot 8^2 + 2 \\cdot 8^1 + 7 \\cdot 8^0 = 279.$ Then we convert 279 to base 5 to get  \\begin{align*}\n279 &= 2 \\cdot 5^3 + 29 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 5^3 + 1 \\cdot 5^2 + 4 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 5^3 + 1 \\cdot 5^2 + 4 \\cdot 5^0 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2104_5}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to convert the number $427_8$ to base 10. To do this, we multiply each digit by $8$ raised to the power of its position, starting from the right. \n\nSo, we have:\n$4 \\times 8^2 = 256$\n$2 \\times 8^1 = 16$\n$7 \\times 8^0 = 7$\n\nAdding all these together, we get $256 + 16 + 7 = 279$ in base 10. \n\nNow, we need to convert $279$ from base 10 to base 5. To do this, we divide $279$ by $5$ and keep track of the remainders. \n\n$279 \\div 5 = 55$ with a remainder of $4$\n$55 \\div 5 = 11$ with a remainder of $0$\n$11 \\div 5 = 2$ with a remainder of $1$\n$2 \\div 5 = 0$ with a remainder of $2$\n\nSo, reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get $2104$ in base 5. Therefore, $427_8$ is equal to $2104_5$.",
