    "solution": "Since $a$ is its own inverse modulo $n$, $a\\equiv a^{-1}\\pmod n$. Then \\[a^2\\equiv a\\cdot a\\equiv a\\cdot a^{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{1}\\pmod n.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by defining what it means for $a$ to be its own inverse modulo $n$. This means that $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. In other words, the square of $a$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by $n$. \n\nNow we want to find the remainder when $a^2$ is divided by $n$. We know that $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, so $a^2 - 1$ is divisible by $n$. \n\nThus, $a^2 - 1 = kn$ for some integer $k$. This can be rewritten as $(a-1)(a+1) = kn$. \n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $a$ must be in the form of $n \\pm 1$. This means $a$ and $n$ are relatively prime.\n\nNow we take the remainder when $a^2$ is divided by $n$. Since $n$ is relatively prime to $a$, the remainder when $a^2$ is divided by $n$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
