    "solution": "Since $a$ is its own inverse modulo $n$, $a\\equiv a^{-1}\\pmod n$. Then \\[a^2\\equiv a\\cdot a\\equiv a\\cdot a^{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{1}\\pmod n.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If we have a number $a$ where $a$ is the same as its inverse, that means $a \\times a$ should be equal to $1$ when we divide by $n$. So, the remainder when $a^2$ is divided by $n$ is... $1$! Yay!",
