    "solution": "We have $n = 50a-1$ for some integer $a$, so $n\\equiv -1\\pmod{50}$. Therefore, \\begin{align*}\nn^2+2n+3 &\\equiv (-1)^2+2(-1)+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1-2+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 2\\quad\\pmod{50}.\n\\end{align*}The remainder when $n^2+2n+3$ is divided by $50$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to express $n$ in terms of $50$.\n\nLet $n=50k-1$, where $k$ is an integer. \n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $n$ into the given expression $n^2+2n+3$:\n\n$(50k-1)^2 + 2(50k-1) + 3$\n\nExpanding this expression gives:\n\n$2500k^2 - 100k + 1 + 100k - 2 + 3$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$2500k^2 + 2$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $2500k^2 + 2$ is divided by $50$.\n\nSince $2500k^2$ is a multiple of $50$, the remainder when the whole expression is divided by $50$ is just the remainder when $2$ is divided by $50$, which is $2$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $n^2+2n+3$ is divided by $50$ is $2$.",
