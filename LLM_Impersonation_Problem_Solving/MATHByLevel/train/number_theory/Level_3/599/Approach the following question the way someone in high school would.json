    "solution": "We have $n = 50a-1$ for some integer $a$, so $n\\equiv -1\\pmod{50}$. Therefore, \\begin{align*}\nn^2+2n+3 &\\equiv (-1)^2+2(-1)+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1-2+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 2\\quad\\pmod{50}.\n\\end{align*}The remainder when $n^2+2n+3$ is divided by $50$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so if $n$ is $1$ less than a multiple of $50$, that means $n = 50k - 1$, where $k$ is some integer. We want to find the remainder when $n^2 + 2n + 3$ is divided by $50$. \n\nLet's substitute $n = 50k - 1$ into the expression: \n\n$n^2 + 2n + 3 = (50k - 1)^2 + 2(50k - 1) + 3$\n$= 2500k^2 - 100k + 1 + 100k - 2 + 3$\n$= 2500k^2 + 2$.\n\nNow we want to find the remainder when $2500k^2 + 2$ is divided by $50$. Since $2500k^2$ is a multiple of $50$, the remainder will just be the remainder when $2$ is divided by $50$, which is $2$. \n\nSo, the remainder when $n^2 + 2n + 3$ is divided by $50$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
