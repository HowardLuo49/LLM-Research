    "solution": "We have $n = 50a-1$ for some integer $a$, so $n\\equiv -1\\pmod{50}$. Therefore, \\begin{align*}\nn^2+2n+3 &\\equiv (-1)^2+2(-1)+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1-2+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 2\\quad\\pmod{50}.\n\\end{align*}The remainder when $n^2+2n+3$ is divided by $50$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "I like numbers! Let's start by finding a number that is one less than a multiple of 50. Let's count by fives and see what we find: 49, 99, 149... Oh, I know! 49 is one less than 50! So that's our number $n$.\n\nNow let's find the remainder when we square $n$, add 2 times $n$, and then add 3, and then divide by 50. Let's see... $49^2$ is 2401. Then add 2 times 49 which is 98. And finally add 3 to get 2502. \n\nNow we divide 2502 by 50 to find the remainder... let's see, 50 goes into 2502... umm... well, I think 50 times 50 is 2500, so we have $2502 = 50 \\times 50 + 2$. \n\nSo the remainder is 2! Yay, we got it! Numbers are fun!",
