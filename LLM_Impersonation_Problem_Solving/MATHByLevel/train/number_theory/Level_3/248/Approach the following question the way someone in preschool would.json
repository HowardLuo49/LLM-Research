    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Donna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts. Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.\n\nAfter eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
    "solution": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the doughnuts in each bag. First we have $13$ doughnuts in each box. After eating one, there are $12$ left.\n\nIf we rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags of $9$ each, we can divide $12$ by $9$ to see how many full bags we can make. $12 \\div 9 = 1$ with a remainder of $3$.\n\nThis means that Donna can make $1$ full bag of $9$ doughnuts and have $3$ doughnuts left over. But she needs to have zero left over, so she must eat $3$ more doughnuts. This leaves her with $9$ doughnuts in one bag.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $1$. It only takes one box of doughnuts for Donna to rearrange them into bags of $9$ each.",
