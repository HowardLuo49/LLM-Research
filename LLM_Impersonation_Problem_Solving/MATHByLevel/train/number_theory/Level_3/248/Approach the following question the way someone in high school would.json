    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Donna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts. Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.\n\nAfter eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
    "solution": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break this question down step by step! \n\nFirst, Donna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts, each containing $13$ doughnuts. After eating one doughnut, she is left with $13(n) - 1$ doughnuts.\n\nNext, Donna rearranges the remaining doughnuts into bags of $9$ doughnuts each, with none left over. This means that the total number of doughnuts she has left must be divisible by $9$. \n\nSince $13n - 1$ must be divisible by $9$, we can start by checking the values of $n$ to find the smallest possible value. \n\nIf we plug in $n=1$, we get $13(1) - 1 = 12$, which is not divisible by $9$. \n\nIf we try $n=2$, we get $13(2) - 1 = 25$, which is also not divisible by $9$. \n\nTrying $n=3$, we get $13(3) - 1 = 38$, which is not divisible by $9$ either. \n\nHowever, if we try $n=4$, we get $13(4) - 1 = 51$, which is divisible by $9$ since $51 = 9 \\times 6$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{4}$. \n\nAnd that's how a high schooler would approach solving this problem!",
