    "solution": "Note that 43 is a close to a multiple of 11, namely 44.  Multiplying both sides of the given congruence by 4, we get $44n \\equiv 28 \\pmod{43}$, which reduces to $n \\equiv \\boxed{28} \\pmod{43}$.",

The multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 43 is 4, because $11 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$.
