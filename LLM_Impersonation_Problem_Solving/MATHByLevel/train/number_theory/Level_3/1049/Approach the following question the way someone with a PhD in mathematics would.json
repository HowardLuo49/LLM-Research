    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The $24^\\text{th}$ day of a particular month is a Saturday. On what day of the week was the first day of that month?",
    "solution": "If the $24$th is a Saturday, the $17$th was also a Saturday, as were the $10$th and the $3$rd.  So the $2$nd was a Friday and the $1$st was a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week for the first day of the month in question given that the 24th day is a Saturday, we need to utilize the concept of modular arithmetic and the cycle of days in a week. \n\nLet us denote the day of the week for the first day of the month as $x$, where $x$ represents an integer between 0 and 6, with 0 being Sunday, 1 being Monday, 2 being Tuesday, and so on until 6 being Saturday. \n\nSince we know that the 24th day of the month is a Saturday, we can calculate the remainder when dividing 24 by 7:\n\n$24 \\mod 7 = 3$\n\nTherefore, if the 24th day is a Saturday, then the first day of the month is three days prior, which means that the first day of the month falls on a Wednesday.\n\nSo, the answer is that the first day of the month in question is a Wednesday.",
