    "solution": "First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. $5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first let's figure out the rule for finding multiples of 22. We know that a number is a multiple of 22 if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. Since our numbers are 6 digits long, the last digit has to be 5, and the second to last digit has to be 2. \n\nSo let's write out the pattern for a 6-digit multiple of 22: _ _ _ _ 2 5. \n\nTo find out what the missing numbers are, we can use divisibility rules. We know that a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even, and a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its odd-positioned digits and the sum of its even-positioned digits is 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nSince our number has to be divisible by 11, we can set up the following equation: $5+d+e-2-5=0$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $d+e-2=2$. So, the value of $d$ and $e$ must be numbers that add up to 4. The digits that work for this are $d=1$ and $e=3$. \n\nTherefore, the maximum value that $d$ can have is 1.",
