    "solution": "First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. $5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all 6-digit multiples of 22 in the form $5d5,\\!22e$, we must first express this number in terms of its digits. Let the number be $abcd,efg$, where $a,b,c,d,e,f$ and $g$ are digits. Then, we have the number $100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + f = 5d5,\\!22e$. \n\nSince $5d5,\\!22e$ is a multiple of 22, it follows that $100d + 10e + f = 22k$, where $k$ is some integer. This implies that $f = 22k - 100d - 10e$. \n\nPlugging this into the original number, we have: $100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 2200k - 1000d - 100e + 100d = 5d5,\\!22e$.
