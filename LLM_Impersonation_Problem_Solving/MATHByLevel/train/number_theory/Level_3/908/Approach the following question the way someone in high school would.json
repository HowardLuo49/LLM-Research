    "solution": "First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. $5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all 6-digit multiples of 22 in the form $5d5,\\!22e$, we need to look for numbers where the last three digits are divisible by 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 5, we know that $d$ must be even in order for the entire number to be divisible by 5.\n\nLet's first list out all the 3-digit multiples of 22:\n22, 44, 66, 88, 110, 132, 154, 176, 198\n\nNow let's look for numbers in the form $5d5$ where $d$ is even and the last three digits form a multiple of 22.
