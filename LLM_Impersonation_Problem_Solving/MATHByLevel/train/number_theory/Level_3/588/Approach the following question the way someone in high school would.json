    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many numbers from $1$ to $150$ are not perfect squares or perfect cubes, we first need to figure out how many are perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n\nThere are $12$ perfect squares from $1$ to $150$ (including $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, $49$, $64$, $81$, $100$, $121$, $144$).\n\nThere are $5$ perfect cubes from $1$ to $150$ (including $1$, $8$, $27$, $64$, $125$).\n\nHowever, we have counted $3$ numbers (1, 64, 125) that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes, so we need to subtract $3$ from our total.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are perfect squares or perfect cubes is $12+5-3=14$.\n\nTo find the number of numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes, we subtract $14$ from $150$:\n\n$150 - 14 = 136$\n\nSo, there are $136$ numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes.",
