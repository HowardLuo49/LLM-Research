    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the numbers that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes in the range $1$ to $150$, we first need to determine the numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n\nThere are $12$ perfect squares in the range $1$ to $150$ ($1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144$). Additionally, there are $5$ perfect cubes in the same range ($1, 8, 27, 64, 125$), but we need to be careful not to double-count the number $64$ which is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes by adding the perfect squares and perfect cubes while subtracting the overlap ($1$ common number - $64$). This gives us a total of $12 + 5 - 1 = 16$ numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes in the range $1$ to $150$.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes is $150 - 16 = 134$.",
