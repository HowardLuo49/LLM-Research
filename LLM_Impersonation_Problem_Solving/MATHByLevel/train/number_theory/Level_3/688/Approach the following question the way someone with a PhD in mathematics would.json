    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A box contains gold coins. If the coins are equally divided among six people, four coins are left over. If the coins are equally divided among five people, three coins are left over. If the box holds the smallest number of coins that meets these two conditions, how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people?",
    "solution": "The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \\[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \\ldots.\\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \\[3, 8, 13,\n18, 23, 28, 33, \\ldots.\\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions. Because $4 \\times 7 = 28$, there are $\\boxed{0}$ coins left when they are divided among seven people. \\[ \\text{OR} \\] If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible by both 6 and 5. The smallest number that is divisible by 6 and 5 is 30, so the smallest possible number of coins in the box is 28, and our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of modular congruences. Let x be the total number of gold coins in the box. \n\nWe are given that when the coins are divided equally among six people, there are four coins left over. This can be represented as:\n\nx \u2261 4 (mod 6)\n\nSimilarly, when the coins are divided among five people, three coins are left over:\n\nx \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n\nTo find the smallest number satisfying both conditions, we need to find the smallest x that satisfies both congruences. This can be done by finding the least common multiple of 6 and 5.\n\nThe least common multiple of 6 and 5 is 30. Therefore, the smallest number of coins that meets these two conditions is x = 30.\n\nNow, we need to find how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people. This can be represented as:\n\nx \u2261 ? (mod 7)\n\nTo find this, we can simply divide 30 by 7:\n\n30 = 4 (mod 7)\n\nTherefore, when the coins are equally divided among seven people, there are four coins left over.",
