    "solution": "Let $n$ be any integer that has its square between 4000 and 7000. Then $63 < n < 84$, because $63^2 < 4000<64^2$ and $83^2< 7000<84^2$. Between 63 and 84, the only primes are 67, 71, 73, 79, and 83. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself. So we need to find prime numbers that have squares between 4000 and 7000. Let's count and see how many we can find! Um...1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...um...I think there are 5 prime numbers with squares between 4000 and 7000! Yay for math!",
