    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 199. \n\nStarting with $2^7=128$, we can subtract 128 from 199 to get 71. \n\nNext, let's see what power of 2 goes into 71. \n\n$2^6=64$ goes into 71 once, leaving us with 7. \n\n$2^2=4$ goes into 7 once, leaving us with 3. \n\n$2^1=2$ goes into 3 once, leaving us with 1. \n\n$2^0=1$ goes into 1 once, leaving us with 0. \n\nPutting this all together, we have $199_{10}=11000111_2$. \n\nIn base 2, we have 4 zeros and 4 ones. \n\nTherefore, $y-x=4-4=0$.",
