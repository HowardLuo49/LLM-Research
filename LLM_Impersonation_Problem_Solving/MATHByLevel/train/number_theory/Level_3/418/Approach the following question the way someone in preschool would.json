    "solution": "We see that the largest power of 9 that is less than 2014 is $9^3=729$, and the largest multiple of 729 less than 2014 is 1458, or $2\\cdot729$. From here, we find that the largest power of nine less than $2014-1458=556$ is $9^2=81$, and the largest multiple of 81 less than 556 is 486, or $6\\cdot81$. Next, the largest power of nine that is less than $556-486=70$ is $9^1=9$, giving us 63 or $7\\cdot 9$ as the largest multiple of 9. Finally, this leaves us with $70-63=7$, or $7\\cdot1=7\\cdot9^0$. Therefore, we can express 2014 as $2\\cdot9^3+6\\cdot9^2+7\\cdot9^1+7\\cdot9^0$, which gives us $\\boxed{2677_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so to change the number 2014 to base 9, we need to see how many groups of 9 can fit into 2014. Let's try to count together! \n\n1 group of 9 fits into 2014, with some left over. So we write down 1 as our first digit. \n\nNow we need to see how many groups of 81 can fit into the remaining number. Let's count again! \n\n2 groups of 81 fit into the remaining number, with some left over. So we write down 2 as our next digit. \n\nNow we move on to see how many groups of 729 can fit into the remaining number. Let's count one more time! \n\n2 groups of 729 fit into the remaining number, with some left over.
