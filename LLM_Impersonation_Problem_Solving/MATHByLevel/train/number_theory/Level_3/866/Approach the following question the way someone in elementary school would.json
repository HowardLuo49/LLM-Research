When she divides $b$ by 105 she gets a remainder of 99.  What remainder does she get when she divides $a+b$ by 35?",
    "solution": "Marsha has two equations: \\[a=70n+64\\]and \\[b=105m+99.\\]When she adds these she gets \\begin{align*}\na+b&=70n+105m+64+99 \\\\\n&=35(2n+3m)+163=35(2n+3m+4)+23.\n\\end{align*}The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 35 is $\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so Marsha has two numbers, a and b. She divides a by 70 and gets a remainder of 64, and she divides b by 105 and gets a remainder of 99. So now we need to find out what remainder she gets when she divides a + b by 35. \n\nHmm, let's think about this. Since she divides a by 70 and gets a remainder of 64, that means a is  64 more than a multiple of 70. And since she divides b by 105 and gets a remainder of 99, that means b is 99 more than a multiple of 105.\n\nSo when she adds a + b, she's adding a number that is 64 more than a multiple of 70 and a number that is 99 more than a multiple of 105. \n\nI think if we find a common multiple of 70 and 105, that might help us find the remainder when she divides a + b by 35. Let's see, the least common multiple of 70 and 105 is 210. So when she divides a + b by 210, the remainder will be the same as when she divides it by 35.\n\nHmm, so we know a is 64 more than a multiple of 70 and b is 99 more than a multiple of 105. If we add those together, we get 64 + 99 = 163. And 163 is 53 more than a multiple of 210. \n\nSo, the remainder when Marsha divides a + b by 35 would be 53. \n\nI think that's the answer!",
