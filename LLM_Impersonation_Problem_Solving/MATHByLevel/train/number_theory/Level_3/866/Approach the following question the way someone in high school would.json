When she divides $b$ by 105 she gets a remainder of 99.  What remainder does she get when she divides $a+b$ by 35?",
    "solution": "Marsha has two equations: \\[a=70n+64\\]and \\[b=105m+99.\\]When she adds these she gets \\begin{align*}\na+b&=70n+105m+64+99 \\\\\n&=35(2n+3m)+163=35(2n+3m+4)+23.\n\\end{align*}The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 35 is $\\boxed{23}$.",

This means that $a = 70n + 64$ for some integer $n$.\n\nSimilarly, we know that when she divides $b$ by 105 she gets a remainder of 99. This means that $b = 105m + 99$ for some integer $m$.\n\nNow we need to find $a+b$ and then divide by 35 to find the remainder.\n\n$a+b = (70n + 64) + (105m + 99) = 70n + 105m + 163$\n\nWhen we divide $a+b$ by 35, we get a remainder of $163 \\div 35 = 23$.\n\nSo the remainder when Marsha divides $a+b$ by 35 is 23.",
