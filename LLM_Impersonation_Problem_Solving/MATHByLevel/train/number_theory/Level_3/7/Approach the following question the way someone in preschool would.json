    "solution": "The binary number $b_k b_{k - 1} \\dots b_2 b_1 b_0$ is equal to $2^k b_k + 2^{k - 1} b_{k - 1} + \\dots + 4b_2 + 2b_1 + b_0$, so when this number is divided by 4, the remainder is $2b_1 + b_0$.  Hence, when the number $100101110010_2$ is divided by 4, the remainder is $2 \\cdot 1 + 0 = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when we divide by 4, we can just look at the last two digits of the binary number. In this case, the last two digits are 10 in base 2, which is equal to 2 in base 10. So, the remainder when we divide $100101110010_2$ by 4 is 2 in base 10. Yay!",
