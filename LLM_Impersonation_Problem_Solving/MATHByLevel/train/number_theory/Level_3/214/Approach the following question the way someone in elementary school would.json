    "solution": "To find the decimal expression, we try to get a denominator of the form $2^a\\cdot5^a=10^a$, where $a$ is an integer.  $$\\frac{3^6}{6^4\\cdot625}=\\frac{3^6}{2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot5^4}=\\frac{3^2}{10^4}=9\\cdot10^{-4}=0.0009$$So there are $\\boxed{4}$ digits to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many digits are to the right of the decimal point, first we need to simplify the fraction. \n\n$3^6 = 729$ and $6^4 = 1296$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{729}{1296\\cdot625}$.\n\nTo simplify further, we can multiply $1296\\cdot625 = 810000$.\n\nSo the fraction becomes $\\frac{729}{810000}$.\n\nNow, let's divide 729 by 810000. The result is approximately 0.0009.\n\nSo there are 4 digits to the right of the decimal point.",
