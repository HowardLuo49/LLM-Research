    "solution": "To find the decimal expression, we try to get a denominator of the form $2^a\\cdot5^a=10^a$, where $a$ is an integer.  $$\\frac{3^6}{6^4\\cdot625}=\\frac{3^6}{2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot5^4}=\\frac{3^2}{10^4}=9\\cdot10^{-4}=0.0009$$So there are $\\boxed{4}$ digits to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first solve the part on the top! We have 3 to the power of 6, which is equal to 729. Now, let's solve the bottom! 6 to the power of 4 is 1296 and 625. Let's multiply these together. 1296 times 625 is 810,000. So, our answer is 729 divided by 810,000. Let's divide them and see how many digits are to the right of the decimal point! \n\nAfter dividing, we get 0.0009. There are 4 digits to the right of the decimal point. Yay!",
