    "solution": "The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$. Therefore, we only need to consider these squares. Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$. Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$. No square begins and ends with $5$. One square begins and ends with $6: 676$. No square begins and ends with $9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many $3$-digit squares are palindromes, we first need to find the $3$-digit squares. A $3$-digit number is in the range from $100$ to $999$, so the squares of $3$-digit numbers are in the range from $100^2$ to $999^2$. \n\nThe smallest $3$-digit square is $100^2=10000$ and the largest $3$-digit square is $999^2=998001$. \n\nNext, we need to check which of these squares are palindromes. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. In this case, we are looking for a number that is the same when read both from left to right and right to left. \n\nThe first and last digits of a palindromic square of a $3$-digit number must be the same, as must the second and second-to-last digits. Therefore, the palindromic squares must have the form $aabbaa$. \n\nLet's now consider all possible values for $a$ and $b$:\n- For $a=1$, we have only $b=0$ as a valid option: $100001$.\n- For $a=2$, we have $b=0$ as a valid option: $121121$. ($11^2=121$)\n- For $a=3$, we have $b=0$ as a valid option: $144441$. ($12^2=144$)\n- For $a=4$, we have no valid options.\n- For $a=5$, we have $b=2$ as a valid option: $252252$. ($18^2=324$)\n- For $a=6$, we have no valid options.\n- For $a=7$, we have no valid options.\n- For $a=8$, we have no valid options.\n- For $a=9$, we have no valid options.\n\nTherefore, the only $3$-digit square that is a palindrome is $121$. \n\nIn conclusion, there is only $1$ $3$-digit square that is a palindrome.",
