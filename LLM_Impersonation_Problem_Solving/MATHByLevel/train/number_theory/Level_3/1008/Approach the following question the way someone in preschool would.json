    "solution": "The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$. Therefore, we only need to consider these squares. Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$. Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$. No square begins and ends with $5$. One square begins and ends with $6: 676$. No square begins and ends with $9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The smallest $3$-digit square is $100$ since $10^2 = 100$. The largest $3$-digit square is $316$ since $18^2 = 324$. Let's find all the palindromes between $100$ and $316$. \n\nThe palindromes are $111$, $121$, $131$, $141$, $151$, $161$, $171$, $181$, $191$, $202$, $212$, $222$, $232$, $242$, $252$, $262$, $272$, $282$, $292$. \n\nThere are $19$ three-digit squares that are palindromes!
