    "solution": "The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$. Therefore, we only need to consider these squares. Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$. Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$. No square begins and ends with $5$. One square begins and ends with $6: 676$. No square begins and ends with $9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing down all the $3$-digit squares. The smallest $3$-digit square is $100^2=10000$ and the largest $3$-digit square is $31^2=961$. Now we need to find out which of these squares are palindromes. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So we need to look for numbers like $101$, $111$, $121$, $131$, and so on. After checking each of the $3$-digit squares, we find that the palindromes are $121$ and $484$, so there are $2$ $3$-digit squares that are palindromes.",
