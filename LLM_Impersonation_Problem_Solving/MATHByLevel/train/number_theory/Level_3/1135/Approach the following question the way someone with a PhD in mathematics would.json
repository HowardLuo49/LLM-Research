    "solution": "We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it. The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678.  The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678.  Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome, we must first understand the concept of palindromes in mathematics. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. \n\nIn this case, we are looking for a number $x$ such that when added to 5678, the result is a palindrome. Let's denote the sum as $n$:\n\n$n = x + 5678$\n\nTo find the smallest positive value of $x$, we need to iterate through values of $x$ starting from 1 and check if the sum $n$ is a palindrome. \n\nHowever, we can also make use of the properties of palindromes to simplify the problem. Since we are looking for the smallest positive value of $x$, we can start by checking smaller values of $x$ to see if we can find a palindrome. \n\nLet's consider $x = 1$:\n\n$n = 1 + 5678 = 5679$\n\n5679 is not a palindrome, so we move to the next value of $x$:\n\n$x = 2$\n\n$n = 2 + 5678 = 5680$\n\n5680 is not a palindrome either. Continuing this process, we find that the smallest positive value of $x$ that results in a palindrome when added to 5678 is $x = 118$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome is $x = 118$.",
