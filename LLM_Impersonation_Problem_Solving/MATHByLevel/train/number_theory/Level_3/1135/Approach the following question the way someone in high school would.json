    "solution": "We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it. The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678.  The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678.  Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so a palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, like 12321. So we need to figure out the smallest positive number we can add to 5678 in order to make a palindrome. Let's start by adding 1 to 5678, which gives us 5679. That's not a palindrome because it doesn't read the same forwards and backwards. So let's try adding another digit. If we add 10 to 5678, we get 5688, which is also not a palindrome. Let's keep trying different numbers until we get a palindrome. Keep going until you find the smallest positive value of x that results in a palindrome when added to 5678.",
