    "solution": "$\\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\\frac{18}{n}$. Thus, $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$. The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6. Their sum is $\\boxed{39}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ that satisfy the given condition, we first express the fraction $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ as $\\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n} = 1 + \\frac{18}{n}$. We are looking for values of $n$ that make this expression an integer.\n\nFor the expression $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$ to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must also be an integer. This means that $n$ must be a factor of 18. The positive integer factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nTherefore, the positive integer values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The sum of these values is $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$. Hence, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ that satisfy the given condition is 39.",
