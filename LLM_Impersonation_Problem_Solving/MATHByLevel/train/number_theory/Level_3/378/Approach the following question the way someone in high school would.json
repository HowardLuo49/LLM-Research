    "solution": "$\\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\\frac{18}{n}$. Thus, $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$. The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6. Their sum is $\\boxed{39}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer, we start by simplifying the fraction. \n\n$\\frac{n+18}{n} = \\frac{n}{n} + \\frac{18}{n} = 1 + \\frac{18}{n}$\n\nFor the expression to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must also be an integer. This means that $n$ must be a factor of 18.\n\nThe positive factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
