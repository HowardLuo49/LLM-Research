    "solution": "$\\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\\frac{18}{n}$. Thus, $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$. The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6. Their sum is $\\boxed{39}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find the numbers that make $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ a whole number! We can start by trying out some numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. When we try $n = 1$, we get $\\frac{1+18}{1} = 19$, which is a whole number. Yay! When we try $n = 2$, we get $\\frac{2+18}{2} = 10$, another whole number. Cool! We can keep trying more numbers until we find all the ones that work. Let's see... $n = 3$ makes $\\frac{3+18}{3} = 7$, which isn't a whole number. Oh no! We have to keep searching for the ones that do work until we find them all. It's like a treasure hunt for numbers that make a whole number when added to 18 and divided by themselves! Let's go find them all!",
