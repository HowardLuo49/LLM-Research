Subtracting the product of 7716 and 128 from $987,\\!670$ gives $\\boxed{22}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the whole number remainder when 987,670 is divided by 128, we need to find out how many times 128 goes into 987,670. This is a big number, so let's count together! 128, 256, 384, 512, 640, 768, 896. So, 128 goes into 987,670 about 7,709 times. Now, let's subtract 128 times 7,709 from 987,670 to find the remainder. 987,670 - (128 x 7,709) = 102. So the whole number remainder is 102. Thank you for counting with me!",
