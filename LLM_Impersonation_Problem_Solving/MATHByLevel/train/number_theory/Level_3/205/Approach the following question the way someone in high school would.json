    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. If the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $120$, and the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, then what is their greatest common divisor?",
    "solution": "Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=4k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 4 are relatively prime. Recalling the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[A,B]\\cdot\\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $120k=(3k)(4k),$ which implies $k=120/12=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to find the prime factorization of 120, which is 2^3 * 3 * 5. Since the least common multiple is the product of all the factors raised to their highest powers, we know that either A or B has all the factors raised to their highest powers.\n\nNext, we need to find the prime factorization of A and B. We know that the ratio of A to B is 3:4, which means A = 3x and B = 4x for some integer x. Since the least common multiple is the product of the prime factors raised to their highest powers, A and B must have all the prime factors raised to their highest powers. Therefore, A = 2^3 * 3 * 5 and B = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5.\n\nNow, to find the greatest common divisor, we simply take the product of the common prime factors raised to their lowest powers. In this case, the common prime factors are 2^3, 3, and 5, so the greatest common divisor is 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 120.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of A and B is 120.",
