    "solution": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 200th term of the sequence formed by omitting perfect squares, we need to first list out the first few terms of the sequence and look for a pattern.\n\nThe first few terms of the sequence are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60\n\nFrom this list, we can see that the terms are skipping the perfect squares. So the sequence is basically all the positive integers except for the squares of integers.\n\nTo find the 200th term, we can simply list out the terms until we reach the 200th term. However, since this can be time-consuming, we can use the formula for the nth term of the sequence, which is n + [sqrt(n)], where [sqrt(n)] represents the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of n.\n\nPlugging in n = 200 into the formula, we get:\n\n200 + [sqrt(200)] = 200 + [14.142] = 200 + 14 = 214\n\nTherefore, the 200th term of the sequence is 214.",
