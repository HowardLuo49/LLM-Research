    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the 200th term of the increasing sequence of positive integers formed by omitting only the perfect squares?",
    "solution": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 200th term of the sequence, we first need to determine how many perfect squares are in the first 200 positive integers. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 200 is 14^2 = 196. Thus, there are 14 perfect squares in the first 200 positive integers (1^2, 2^2, ..., 14^2).\n\nTherefore, out of the first 200 positive integers, 14 are perfect squares, leaving us with 186 integers that are not perfect squares. To find the 200th term of this sequence, we need to find the 186th term of the original sequence of positive integers.\n\nSince the sequence of positive integers is increasing and we have omitted the perfect squares, we can determine the 186th term by adding 186 to 186 (since the difference between consecutive terms is always 1). Therefore, the 200th term of the sequence is 186 + 186 = 372.\n\nTherefore, the 200th term of the increasing sequence of positive integers formed by omitting only the perfect squares is 372.",
