    "solution": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 200th term of the sequence, we first need to figure out which numbers are not included because they are perfect squares. \n\nThe perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, and so on. \n\nThe 200th term is 199! Because we're omitting all the square numbers, we are not using a lot of numbers so we have to keep going past 200 in the original sequence before we reach the 200th number that we will actually use. \n\nSo, the 200th term in the sequence is 199.",
