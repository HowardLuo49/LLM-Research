    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$. Using this fact, we find that the greatest multiple of $9$ that is less than $-1111$ is $-1116$.\n\nWe have $-1111 = -1116+5$. That is, $-1111$ is equal to a multiple of $9$ plus $5$. Therefore, $$-1111\\equiv \\boxed{5}\\pmod 9.$$To verify this answer, we can check that $9$ divides $(-1111)-5 = -1116$; it does, so our answer is correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find an integer $n$ that satisfies the given congruence $-1111\\equiv n\\pmod 9$. \n\nFirst, we want to simplify the left side of the congruence. The number $-1111$ can be written as $-1111 = -999 - 112$. Since $-999$ is divisible by 9, it doesn't affect the remainder when divided by 9. So, we only need to consider the remainder when $-112$ is divided by 9.\n\nTo find the remainder when $-112$ is divided by 9, we can express $-112$ as $-112 = -108 - 4 = -9 \\times 12 - 4$. This shows that $-112$ has the same remainder as $-4$ when divided by 9. Since $-4\\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$, we have $$-1111\\equiv -112\\equiv -4\\equiv 5\\pmod 9.$$\n\nNow, we need to find an integer $n$ between 0 and 8 that is congruent to 5 mod 9. Since $$5\\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$$, the integer $n$ that satisfies the given congruence is $n = 5$. \n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies the given conditions is $n=5$.",
