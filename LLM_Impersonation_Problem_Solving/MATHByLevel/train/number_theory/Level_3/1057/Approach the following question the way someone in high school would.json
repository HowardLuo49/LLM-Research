    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing out what we know. We want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube. \n\nA perfect square is a number that is the square of an integer, so $2n = m^2$ for some integer $m$. \nA perfect cube is a number that is the cube of an integer, so $3n = k^3$ for some integer $k$. \n\nWe can rewrite these equations as $n = \\frac{m^2}{2}$ and $n = \\frac{k^3}{3}$. \n\nSince we want $n$ to be the smallest positive integer, we can start by trying small values for $m$ and $k$ until we find a common value that works for both equations. \n\nLet's start by finding possible values for $m$. If $m = 1$, then $2n = 1^2 = 1$. This means $n = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is not a positive integer. \nIf $m = 2$, then $2n = 2^2 = 4$, which means $n = 2$. \n\nNow let's find possible values for $k$. If $k = 1$, then $3n = 1^3 = 1$. This means $n = \\frac{1}{3}$, which is not a positive integer. \nIf $k = 2$, then $3n = 2^3 = 8$, which means $n = \\frac{8}{3}$, which is also not a positive integer. \nIf $k = 3$, then $3n = 3^3 = 27$, which means $n = 9$. \n\nSo the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies both conditions is $n = 2$.",
