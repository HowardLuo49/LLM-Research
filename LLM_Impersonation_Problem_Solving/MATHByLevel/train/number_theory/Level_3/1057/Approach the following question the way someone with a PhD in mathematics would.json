    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $m$ be the square root of $2n$ and $k$ be the cube root of $3n$. Then we have:\n\n$2n = m^2$\n$3n = k^3$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $n = \\frac{m^2}{2}$.
