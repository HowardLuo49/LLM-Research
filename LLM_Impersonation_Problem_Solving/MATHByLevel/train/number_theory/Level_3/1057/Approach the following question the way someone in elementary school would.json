    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest number, we should start by listing out perfect squares and perfect cubes and see if any numbers match for both! Let's start with the perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100... Now let's do the perfect cubes: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000... \n\nLooking at the lists, we see that 64 is the only number that appears in both lists. So, the smallest positive integer n is 64. Yay!",
