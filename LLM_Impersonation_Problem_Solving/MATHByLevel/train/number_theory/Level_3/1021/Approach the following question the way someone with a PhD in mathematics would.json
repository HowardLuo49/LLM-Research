    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number?",
    "solution": "An even number has a units digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, so the smallest digit not in that list of possible units digits is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number, we must consider the possible digits that can appear in the units place of an even number. \n\nAn even number is defined as a number that is divisible by 2. Therefore, the units place of an even number can be any digit from 0 to 9, as long as it is even.\n\nHowever, the digit 0 is not considered a valid digit for the units place of a number, as it does not add any value to the number. Therefore, the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number is 0.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 1?: In order to find the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number, we must consider the possible digits that can appear in the units place of an even number. \n\nAn even number is defined as a number that is divisible by 2.
