    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, let's first think about all the digits we can have in the units place of an even number. Even numbers always end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. \n\nThe smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number is 7. Because even numbers can end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, but they never end in 7.\n\nSo, the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number is 7.",
