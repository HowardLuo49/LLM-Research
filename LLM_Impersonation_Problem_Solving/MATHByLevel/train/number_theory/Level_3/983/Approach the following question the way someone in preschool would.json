    "solution": "Note that $20m = \\underbrace{444444440}_{\\text{9 digits}}$, so $n = 20m+4$.\n\nIf $d$ is any common divisor of $m$ and $n$, then $d$ must also be a divisor of $n-20m = 4$. Therefore, $\\gcd(m,n)$ is either $1$, $2$, or $4$. We can see that $m$ is not divisible by $4$ (since its last two digits form $22$, which is not a multiple of $4$). However, both $m$ and $n$ are clearly divisible by $2$, so $\\gcd(m,n)=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together. For $m=22222222$, we can see that all the digits are the same - they are all 2's! For $n=444444444$, all the digits are the same too - they are all 4's! \n\nWhen we look at both numbers, we can see that they have different digits - one has 2's, the other has 4's. So, the greatest common factor (GCF) of 2 and 4 is 2. The GCF of $m$ and $n$ is 2. \n\nSo, the $\\gcd(m,n)$ is 2! Great job counting with me!",
