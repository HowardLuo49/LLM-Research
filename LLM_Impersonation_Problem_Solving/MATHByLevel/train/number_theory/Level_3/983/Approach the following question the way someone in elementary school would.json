    "solution": "Note that $20m = \\underbrace{444444440}_{\\text{9 digits}}$, so $n = 20m+4$.\n\nIf $d$ is any common divisor of $m$ and $n$, then $d$ must also be a divisor of $n-20m = 4$. Therefore, $\\gcd(m,n)$ is either $1$, $2$, or $4$. We can see that $m$ is not divisible by $4$ (since its last two digits form $22$, which is not a multiple of $4$). However, both $m$ and $n$ are clearly divisible by $2$, so $\\gcd(m,n)=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common factor of $m$ and $n, we need to find the biggest number that can divide both $m$ and $n evenly. \n\nIn this case, we can see that both $m$ and $n$ are made up of only the digits 2 and 4. This means that both numbers have a factor of 2. \n\nBut $n$ also has a factor of 4, because all the digits in $n$ are 4. \n\nSo, the greatest common factor of $m$ and $n$ is 2, because it can divide both $m$ and $n$ evenly. \n\nTherefore, $\\gcd(m,n) = 2$.",
