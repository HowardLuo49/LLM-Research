    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $115_{10}$ to base 11, we can divide $115$ by 11 repeatedly to find the remainders.\n\n$115$ divided by $11$ gives a quotient of $10$ and a remainder of $5$. So, the least significant digit is $5$.\n\nNext, we divide $10$ (the quotient from the previous step) by $11$. This gives a quotient of $0$ and a remainder of $10$. Since $10$ is represented as $A$ in base 11, the next digit is $A$.\n\nTherefore, $115_{10}$ is equal to $A5_{11}$.",
