    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $115_{10}$ to base 11, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 115. \n\n$11^2 = 121$ is larger than 115, so we use $11^1 = 11$. \n\nDividing 115 by 11, we get a quotient of 10 and a remainder of 5. \n\nSo, $115_{10}$ is equivalent to $A5_{11}$ in base 11, where $A$ represents 10.",
