    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count to 11 together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A!\n\nSo in base 11, we write the numbers in this way: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A.\n\nNow let's convert $115_{10}$ to base 11. \n\nFirst, we divide 115 by 11 to see how many times 11 goes into 115. It goes in 10 times, with a remainder of 5. So in base 11, $115_{10}$ is equivalent to $A5_{11}$.",
