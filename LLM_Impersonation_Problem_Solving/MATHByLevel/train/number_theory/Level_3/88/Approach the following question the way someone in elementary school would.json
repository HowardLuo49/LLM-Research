    "solution": "When adding the numbers in base $12$, we start by adding the rightmost digits as we do in normal addition. Since $4 + 9$ yields a residue of $1$ upon division by $12$, we write down a $1$ as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry-over a $1$. The remaining two digits do not yield and carry-overs, so we can add them as normal. Carrying out this addition, we find that:$$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{}{7} & \\stackrel{1}{0} & \\stackrel{}{4}_{12} \\\\ &+ & & 1 & 5 & 9_{12} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} && & 8 & 6 & 1_{12} \\\\ \\end{array} .$$Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{861_{12}}$.",
