    "solution": "Since $77=7\\cdot11$, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77. Their sum is $1+7+11+7\\cdot11=\\boxed{96}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all the numbers that can be divided evenly into 77, we need to start by looking at the different divisors of 77. These are the numbers that you can multiply together to get 77.\n\nFirst, we have 1 and 77, because 1 times 77 equals 77. That's already a start!\n\nLet's see if there are any other numbers that can divide into 77 evenly. Well, 7 can divide into 77 because 7 times 11 equals 77.\n\nSo, the sum of all the positive integer divisors of 77 is 1 + 7 + 11 + 77 = 96.\n\nSo, when we add up all the numbers that can be divided evenly into 77, we get 96. Yay!",
