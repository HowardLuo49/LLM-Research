    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77?",
    "solution": "Since $77=7\\cdot11$, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77. Their sum is $1+7+11+7\\cdot11=\\boxed{96}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77, we first list the prime factorization of 77. This can be done by dividing 77 by the smallest prime number, 2, which does not divide evenly. We then try the next prime number, 3, which also does not divide evenly. Continuing in this manner, we find that the prime factorization of 77 is 7 * 11.\n\nNext, we consider that the divisors of 77 can be obtained by multiplying together different combinations of its prime factors. In this case, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77.\n\nFinally, we calculate the sum of these divisors:\n\n1 + 7 + 11 + 77 = 96.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77 is 96.",
