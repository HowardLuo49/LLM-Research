    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The sum of all the positive factors of integer $x$ is 24. If one of the factors is 3, what is the value of $x$?",
    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let's see, if we add up all the numbers that can multiply together to make $x$, it equals 24. And we know that one of those numbers is 3. So, let's think about it. 3 times what number equals 24? Oh, I know! 3 times 8 equals 24! So, our number $x$ is 8. Yay, we did it!",
