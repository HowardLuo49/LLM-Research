    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The sum of all the positive factors of integer $x$ is 24. If one of the factors is 3, what is the value of $x$?",
    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find all the positive factors of $x$ that add up to 24. Since 3 is a factor of $x$, we know that $x$ must be divisible by 3. \n\nLet's list out the possible factors of $x$ that are greater than 3:\n3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12\n\nWhen we add these up, we get:\n3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36\n\nUh oh, that adds up to more than 24. \n\nLet's try again, but this time, we will only consider the factors that are less than 3:\n1\n\nWhen we add this to 3, we get:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nHooray!
