    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The bagel shop has enough benches to sit $204_6$ people. If $2$ people are supposed to sit on one bench, how many benches does the shop have?",
    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches",
    "gpt_response": "In high school, we learn about bases in math class. In this problem, the number of benches is given in base 6. \n\nTo figure out how many benches there are, we need to convert $204_6$ to base 10 so that we can understand the quantity in a way we're more familiar with. \n\nTo convert $204_6$ to base 10, we multiply each digit by $6$ raised to the appropriate power. Starting from the right, we have $4 \\cdot 6^0 + 0 \\cdot 6^1 + 2 \\cdot 6^2 = 4 + 0 + 72 = 76$. \n\nTherefore, the bagel shop has $76$ benches. \n\nBut wait, we know that $2$ people are supposed to sit on one bench. So we need to divide the number of benches by 2 to find how many people can actually sit. \n\n$76$ benches divided by $2$ people per bench equals $38$ benches. \n\nSo, the bagel shop has $38$ benches in which $2$ people can sit each.",
