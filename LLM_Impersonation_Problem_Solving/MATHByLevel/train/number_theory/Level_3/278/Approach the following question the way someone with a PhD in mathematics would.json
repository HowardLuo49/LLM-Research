    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of two numbers such as $40304$ and $30203$, we typically use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nFirst, we divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder. In this case, $40304$ divided by $30203$ equals $1$ with a remainder of $10101$.\n\nNext, we replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder. We then repeat the process of dividing the new larger number by the new smaller number and finding the remainder.\n\nFor the second step, we have $30203$ divided by $10101$ equals $2$ with a remainder of $999$.\n\nProceeding to the next step, we have $10101$ divided by $999$ equals $10$ with a remainder of $101$.\n\nContinuing with the algorithm, we divide $999$ by $101$ to get a quotient of $9$ with a remainder of $90$.\n\nNext, we divide $101$ by $90$ to find that the quotient is $1$ with a remainder of $11$.\n\nFinally, dividing $90$ by $11$, we have a quotient of $8$ and a remainder of $2$.\n\nSince the remainder at this step is not $0$, we continue the Euclidean algorithm. We divide $11$ by $2$ to get a quotient of $5$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\nAt this point, we have reached a remainder of $1$, which means that the greatest common divisor of $40304$ and $30203$ is $1$.",
