    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Alex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we know that Alex wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. So let's write that down. \n\nWe also know that he wants to have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. This means that we can set up an equation to represent this situation.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of jellybeans Alex buys. We know that $x$ should be greater than or equal to 100, so $x \\geq 100$.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation for the leftover jellybeans. If Alex divides the jellybeans evenly among 13 people, then each person would get $\\frac{x}{13}$ jellybeans. Since Alex wants to have $11$ leftover, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13}$\n\nThis equation represents that when Alex divides the jellybeans evenly among 13 people, he has $11$ leftover. \n\nNow, we can test values of $x$ starting from 100 until we find a value that satisfies this equation. \n\nBy testing values, we find that the smallest value that satisfies this congruence relation is 117. Therefore, Alex should buy 117 jellybeans.",
