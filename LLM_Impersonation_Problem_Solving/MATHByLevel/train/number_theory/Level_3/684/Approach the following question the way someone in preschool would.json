    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Alex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! If Alex buys 100 jellybeans, he can divide them by 13 people and have 7 left over. That's not enough, right? Let's try a bigger number. If Alex buys 200 jellybeans, he can divide them by 13 people and have 11 left over. Yay! That's the right amount! So Alex should buy 200 jellybeans. Great job counting with me!",

If Alex buys 100 jellybeans, he can divide them by 13 people and have 7 left over. That's not enough, right? Let's try a bigger number. If Alex buys 200 jellybeans, he can divide them by 13 people and have 11 left over. Yay! That's the right amount! So Alex should buy 200 jellybeans. Great job counting with me!",
