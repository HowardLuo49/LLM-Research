    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Alex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",

We are given the following conditions:\n1. $x \\geq 100$\n2. $x$ divided by 13 leaves a remainder of 11\n\nMathematically, we can express the second condition as:\n$x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13}$\n\nThis can also be written as $x = 13n + 11$ where $n$ is an integer.\n\nSince Alex wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans, we can write this condition as:\n$13n + 11 \\geq 100$\n\nSolving for $n$ gives us $n \\geq \\frac{89}{13} \\approx 6.846$. Since $n$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $n$ that satisfies this inequality is 7.\n\nSubstitute $n = 7$ into $x = 13n + 11$ gives:\n$x = 13(7) + 11 = 91 + 11 = 102$\n\nTherefore, Alex should buy 102 jellybeans.",
