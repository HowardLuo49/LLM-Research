    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by thinking about prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. So if $A, B, A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers, then they cannot be even numbers (since even numbers are divisible by 2), and they cannot be divisible by 3, 5, or 7.\n\nTherefore, the sum of $A, B, A-B,$ and $A+B$ would not be divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
