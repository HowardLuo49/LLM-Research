    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The positive integers $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers. The sum of these four primes is\n\n$\\bullet$ A. even\n\n$\\bullet$ B. divisible by $3$\n\n$\\bullet$ C. divisible by $5$\n\n$\\bullet$ D. divisible by $7$\n\n$\\bullet$ E. prime\n\nExpress your answer using a letter, as A, B, C, D, or E.",
    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! We know that prime numbers are special numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. So, if $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers, that means they can't be divided by any other numbers except for 1 and themselves.\n\nNow, let's add up these four prime numbers. Since prime numbers are already a bit tricky, I think it's best to group them together. Let's group $A$ with $A-B$ and $B$ with $A+B$.\n\nSo, we have:\n$(A + (A-B)) + (B + (A+B)) = 2A + B - 2B + A + B = 3A - B$\n\nHmm, now we see that the sum of these four primes is not necessarily even, divisible by 3, divisible by 5, or divisible by 7. It could be a prime number, but it depends on the specific values of $A$ and $B$. So, I think our answer is E!",
