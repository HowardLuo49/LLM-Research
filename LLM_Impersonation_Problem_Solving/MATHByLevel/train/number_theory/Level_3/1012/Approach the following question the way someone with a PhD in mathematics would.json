    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The positive integers $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers. The sum of these four primes is\n\n$\\bullet$ A. even\n\n$\\bullet$ B. divisible by $3$\n\n$\\bullet$ C. divisible by $5$\n\n$\\bullet$ D. divisible by $7$\n\n$\\bullet$ E. prime\n\nExpress your answer using a letter, as A, B, C, D, or E.",
    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to consider the properties of the given primes $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$. Since all four integers are prime numbers, we know that they are greater than $1$ and they are divisible only by $1 and themselves.\n\nGiven that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime, this implies that $2A$ is prime (as $A-B + A+B = 2A$). Since $2A$ is a prime greater than $2$, we must have $A = 2$, as $2$ is the only prime that is even. \n\nNow, we have $B = A - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$, which is not a prime number. Therefore, this is a contradiction and the assumption that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime cannot hold simultaneously.\n\nHence, we conclude that it is not possible for the positive integers $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ to all be prime numbers. Therefore, there is no sum to calculate. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E) prime}}$.",
