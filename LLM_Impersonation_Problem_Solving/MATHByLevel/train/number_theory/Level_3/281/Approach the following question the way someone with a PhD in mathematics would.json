    "solution": "Instead of converting to base 10 and then to base 4, we use the fact that $2^2=4$. We have $11011000_2=1\\cdot2^7+1\\cdot2^6+1\\cdot2^4+1\\cdot2^3$ $=2\\cdot(2^2)^3+1\\cdot(2^2)^3+1\\cdot(2^2)^2+2\\cdot(2^2)^1$ $=3\\cdot4^3+1\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot4^1+0\\cdot4^0=\\boxed{3120_4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert the base 2 number $11011000_2$ to base 4, we need to first group the binary digits into sets of 2 from the right. \n\nStarting from the right, we have $00_2=0_4$, $10_2=2_4$, $11_2=3_4$, and $11_2=3_4$. Thus, the base 4 representation of the base 2 number $11011000_2$ is $3320_4$.",
