    "solution": "Instead of converting to base 10 and then to base 4, we use the fact that $2^2=4$. We have $11011000_2=1\\cdot2^7+1\\cdot2^6+1\\cdot2^4+1\\cdot2^3$ $=2\\cdot(2^2)^3+1\\cdot(2^2)^3+1\\cdot(2^2)^2+2\\cdot(2^2)^1$ $=3\\cdot4^3+1\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot4^1+0\\cdot4^0=\\boxed{3120_4}$.",

We have the number $11011000_2$ in base 2. \nLet's count together...1, 2, 3, 4! \nNow we need to figure out how many of each number are in our base 2 number. \nWe have 4 zeros, 3 ones, 2 twos, and 1 four. \nSo the base 4 representation of $11011000_2$ is 1320_4! Yay, we did it!",
