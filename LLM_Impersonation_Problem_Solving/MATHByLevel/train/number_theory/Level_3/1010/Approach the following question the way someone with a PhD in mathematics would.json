    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$.  Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$.  Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible value of $a^b$ that is less than 399. We can start by examining different values of $b$ starting from the smallest to determine the maximum value of $a$. \n\nLet's start by considering $b = 2$. The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2 = 361$, which means $a = 19$ and $b = 2$.\n\nNext, we can consider $b = 3$. The largest cube less than 399 is $7^3 = 343$, which means $a = 7$ and $b = 3$.\n\nFinally, let's consider $b = 4$. The largest fourth power less than 399 is $5^4 = 625$, which exceeds 399.\n\nTherefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ for the greatest possible value less than 399 is $19 + 2 = 21$.",
