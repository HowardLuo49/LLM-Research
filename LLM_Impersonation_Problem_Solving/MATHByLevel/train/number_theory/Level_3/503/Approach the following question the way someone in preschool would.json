    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The integer $x$ has 12 positive factors. The numbers 12 and 15 are factors of $x$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number with 12 positive factors that includes 12 and 15, we can count with our fingers and find the number together. Let's start with the number 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and finally 12 which is also a factor of $x$. We see that there are no numbers between 12 and 15 that are also factors of $x$, so 15 is the highest factor we need to consider. \n\nNow, let's try to find the number that has all these factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, and 15. \n\nLooking at these numbers, we can see that the number we are looking for is 60 because it has all these factors. So, the number $x$ is 60. Great job counting, we found the answer together!",
