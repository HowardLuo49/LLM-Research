    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The integer $x$ has 12 positive factors. The numbers 12 and 15 are factors of $x$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's list out all the factors of 12 and 15. \n\nThe factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\nThe factors of 15 are: 1, 3, 5, 15. \n\nNow, let's find the common factors of 12 and 15, which are 1 and 3.\n\nSince we know that 12 and 15 are factors of $x$ and $x$ has a total of 12 factors, we can see that 12 and 15 are both the 1st and 2nd factors of $x$.\n\nSo, $x$ is $3*5$, which is equal to 15. \n\nTherefore, $x = 15$.",
