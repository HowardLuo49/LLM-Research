    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many prime numbers are divisible by $39$ ?",
    "solution": "A prime number is a number whose only divisors are $1$ and itself. If a prime were divisible by $39$, it would have to be divisible by $3$ and $13$ as well since $3$ and $13$ are factors of $39$. Thus the \"prime\" would have too many factors and wouldn't be a prime! Thus there are $\\boxed{0}$ primes which are divisible by $39$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that a prime number is a natural number greater than $1$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ and itself. \n\nSince $39 = 3 \\times 13$, any prime number that is divisible by $39$ must be divisible by both $3$ and $13$. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the set of prime numbers that are divisible by both $3$ and $13$. \n\nThe only prime number that satisfies this condition is $39$ itself, as $39$ is not a prime number. \n\nThus, there are $0$ prime numbers that are divisible by $39$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 0?: We know that a prime number is a natural number greater than $1$ that has no positive divisors other than $1$ and itself. \n\nSince $39 = 3 \\times 13$, any prime number that is divisible by $39$ must be divisible by both $3$ and $13$. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the set of prime numbers that are divisible by both $3$ and $13$. \n\nThe only prime number that satisfies this condition is $39$ itself, as $39$ is not a prime number. \n\nThus, there are $0$ prime numbers that are divisible by $39$.",
