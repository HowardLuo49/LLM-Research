    "solution": "A prime number is a number whose only divisors are $1$ and itself. If a prime were divisible by $39$, it would have to be divisible by $3$ and $13$ as well since $3$ and $13$ are factors of $39$. Thus the \"prime\" would have too many factors and wouldn't be a prime! Thus there are $\\boxed{0}$ primes which are divisible by $39$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many prime numbers are divisible by $39, we first need to find the prime factorization of 39. \n\n39 = 3 * 13\n\nSince 39 is divisible by both 3 and 13, it cannot be a prime number. Therefore, there are 0 prime numbers that are divisible by 39.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 0?: To determine how many prime numbers are divisible by $39, we first need to find the prime factorization of 39. \n\n39 = 3 * 13\n\nSince 39 is divisible by both 3 and 13, it cannot be a prime number. Therefore, there are 0 prime numbers that are divisible by 39.",
