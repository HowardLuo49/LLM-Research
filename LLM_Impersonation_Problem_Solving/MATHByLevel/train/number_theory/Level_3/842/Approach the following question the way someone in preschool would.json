To find the base ten equivalent, we need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of six and then add them all together. \n\nLet's start by breaking down the number $54321$ in base six:\n\n$5 * 6^4 = 5 * 1296 = 6480$\n$4 * 6^3 = 4 * 216 = 864$\n$3 * 6^2 = 3 * 36 = 108$\n$2 * 6^1 = 2 * 6 = 12$\n$1 * 6^0 = 1 * 1 = 1$\n\nNow, let's add all these values together:\n\n$6480 + 864 + 108 + 12 + 1 = 7455$\n\nSo the base ten equivalent of $54321_6$ is $7455$.
