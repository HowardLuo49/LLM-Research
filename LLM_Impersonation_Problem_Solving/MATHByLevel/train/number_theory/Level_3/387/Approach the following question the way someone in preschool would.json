    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. On a $12$-hour clock, an elapsed time of four hours looks the same as an elapsed time of $16$ hours. Because of this, we can say that four hours is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours. What is the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours?",
    "solution": "For two times to be clock equivalent, their difference must be a multiple of $12.$ We list the hours greater than $4,$ their squares, and the differences between them:  \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n5 & 25 & 20\\\\\n6 & 36 & 30\\\\\n7 & 49 & 42\\\\\n8 & 64 & 56\\\\\n9 & 81 & 72\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} We can stop at $\\boxed{9},$ since it is the smallest hour greater than $4$ that is clock equivalent to $81,$ its square.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's look at the clock! When we count 4 hours on the clock, we end up at the same place as if we counted 16 hours. So that means 4 hours is the same as 16 hours in a way! Now let's think about the square numbers - 4 squared is 16! So we want to find another number that is greater than 4 and is like its own square number on the clock. Well, the next square number after 4 is 9, and 9 hours on the clock is the same as 21 hours! So the least whole number greater than 4 that is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours is... 9 hours! Yay, we did it!",
