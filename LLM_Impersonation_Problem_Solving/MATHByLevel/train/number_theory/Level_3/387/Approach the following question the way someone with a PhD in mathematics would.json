On a $12$-hour clock, an elapsed time of four hours looks the same as an elapsed time of $16$ hours. Because of this, we can say that four hours is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours. What is the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours?",
    "solution": "For two times to be clock equivalent, their difference must be a multiple of $12.$ We list the hours greater than $4,$ their squares, and the differences between them:  \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n5 & 25 & 20\\\\\n6 & 36 & 30\\\\\n7 & 49 & 42\\\\\n8 & 64 & 56\\\\\n9 & 81 & 72\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} We can stop at $\\boxed{9},$ since it is the smallest hour greater than $4$ that is clock equivalent to $81,$ its square.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first understand the concept of \"clock equivalent\" hours. The statement given implies that the hours on a $12$-hour clock have a periodicity of $12$ hours. In other words, any time after $12$ hours will result in the clock pointing to the same position as it did at the start of the cycle. This is why an elapsed time of $4$ hours is equivalent to $16$ hours.\n\nLet's denote the number of hours as $h$. We are looking for the smallest whole number $h$ greater than $4$ such that $h$ is \"clock equivalent\" to $h^2$ hours.\n\nThis means that $h$ and $h^2$ must be congruent modulo $12$. In other words, $h \\equiv h^2 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nNow, we can test each number greater than $4$ to find the smallest whole number $h$ that satisfies the congruence relation:\n\nFor $h = 5$, we have $h^2 = 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$.
