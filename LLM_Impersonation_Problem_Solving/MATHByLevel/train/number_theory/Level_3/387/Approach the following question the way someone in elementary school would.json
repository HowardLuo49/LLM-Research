    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. On a $12$-hour clock, an elapsed time of four hours looks the same as an elapsed time of $16$ hours. Because of this, we can say that four hours is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours. What is the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours?",
    "solution": "For two times to be clock equivalent, their difference must be a multiple of $12.$ We list the hours greater than $4,$ their squares, and the differences between them:  \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n5 & 25 & 20\\\\\n6 & 36 & 30\\\\\n7 & 49 & 42\\\\\n8 & 64 & 56\\\\\n9 & 81 & 72\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} We can stop at $\\boxed{9},$ since it is the smallest hour greater than $4$ that is clock equivalent to $81,$ its square.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least whole number of hours that is \"clock equivalent\" to its square number of hours, we need to think about what number is equal to its square when we look at a clock. \n\nFirst, let's find the square number that is closest to $4$ hours. The square of $2$ is $4$, so we know that $2$ hours is \"clock equivalent\" to its square number of hours.\n\nNext, let's find the square number that is closest to $4$ hours. The square of $6$ is $36$, which is the closest square number to $16$ hours.\n\nSince $2$ hours is equal to its square number and the next square number that is \"clock equivalent\" to its square number of hours is $6$ hours, the least whole number of hours greater than $4$ hours that is \"clock equivalent\" to its square number of hours is $6$ hours.",
