    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Divide the product of the first five positive composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers. Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The first ten positive composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18. The desired quotient is $\\frac{4\\cdot6\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{12\\cdot14\\cdot15\\cdot16\\cdot18}$. After cancellation, we get $\\frac{1}{14\\cdot3}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{42}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to find the first five positive composite integers, which are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The product of these numbers is 4 x 6 x 8 x 9 x 10 = 17280.\n\nNext, we need to find the next five composite integers, which are 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. The product of these numbers is 12 x 14 x 15 x 16 x 18 = 725760.\n\nNow, we divide the product of the first five composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers: 17280 / 725760 = 1 / 42.\n\nSo, the answer is 1/42.",
