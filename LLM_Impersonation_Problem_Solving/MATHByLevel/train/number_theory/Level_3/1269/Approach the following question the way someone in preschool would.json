    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Divide the product of the first five positive composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers. Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The first ten positive composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18. The desired quotient is $\\frac{4\\cdot6\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{12\\cdot14\\cdot15\\cdot16\\cdot18}$. After cancellation, we get $\\frac{1}{14\\cdot3}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{42}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, the first five positive composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The product of these numbers is 4 x 6 x 8 x 9 x 10 = 17280. \n\nNow let's find the next five composite numbers. They are 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. The product of these numbers is 12 x 14 x 15 x 16 x 18 = 725760. \n\nTo find the answer, we need to divide the product of the first five composite numbers by the product of the next five composite numbers. So, 17280 \u00f7 725760 = 1/42. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/42.",
