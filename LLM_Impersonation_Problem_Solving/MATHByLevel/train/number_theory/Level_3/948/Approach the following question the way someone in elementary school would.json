    "solution": "We can line up the numbers and add just as we do in base 10.  For example, in the second column we get $1+6=7$, which we carry just as in base 10 by placing the digit 0 in the sum and carrying 1 to the next column. We get $$\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & 1 & 0_7 \\\\\n+ & 1 & 6 & 3_7 \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 2 & 0 & 3_7, \\\\\n\\end{array}$$so the sum is $\\boxed{203_7}$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we line up the numbers and add the columns. \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & \\textcolor{red}{1} & 0 \\\\\n& & 1 & 6 3 \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 2 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSince we are working in base 7, we know that when we get to 7, we have to regroup and carry over a 1 to the next column. So, our answer is $213_7$.",
