    "solution": "We can line up the numbers and add just as we do in base 10.  For example, in the second column we get $1+6=7$, which we carry just as in base 10 by placing the digit 0 in the sum and carrying 1 to the next column. We get $$\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & 1 & 0_7 \\\\\n+ & 1 & 6 & 3_7 \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 2 & 0 & 3_7, \\\\\n\\end{array}$$so the sum is $\\boxed{203_7}$",
    "gpt_response": "To add $10_7$ and $163_7$, we use the base 7 addition algorithm. \n\nStarting from the rightmost digit, we add 0 + 3 = 3, with no carry-over. \n\nMoving to the next digit from the right, we add 1 + 6 = 7. Since 7 is equivalent to 10 in base 7, we write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n\nFor the leftmost digit (which has no digit to its left), we add the carried-over 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the result of $10_7 + 163_7 = 203_7$.",
