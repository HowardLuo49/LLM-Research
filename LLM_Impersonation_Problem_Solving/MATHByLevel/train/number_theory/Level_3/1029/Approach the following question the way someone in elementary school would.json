    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A band has 72 members who will all be marching during halftime. They need to march in rows with the same number of students per row. If there must be between 5 and 20 students per row, in how many possible row-lengths can the band be arranged?",
    "solution": "If $x$ members march in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=72=2^3\\cdot3^2$. Given that $5\\le x\\le20$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^3=8$, $2^2\\cdot3=12$, $2\\cdot3=6$, $2\\cdot3^2=18$ and $3^2=9$, for a total of $ \\boxed{5}$ row-lengths.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out all the different numbers of students that can go in each row. We know that the number of students in each row can be between 5 and 20.\n\nLet's start by figuring out all the factors of 72. Factors are numbers that can divide into another number evenly without leaving a remainder. This will help us figure out how many students can be in each row.\n\nSo we need to find the factors of 72:\n1 x 72 = 72\n2 x 36 = 72\n3 x 24 = 72\n4 x 18 = 72\n6 x 12 = 72\n8 x 9 = 72\n\nSo the factors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\nNow we need to see which of these factors fall between 5 and 20.\n\nThe factors that fit our criteria are: 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18.\n\nTherefore, the band can be arranged in rows of 6, 8, 9, 12, or 18 students. That's 5 possible row-lengths!",
