They need to march in rows with the same number of students per row. If there must be between 5 and 20 students per row, in how many possible row-lengths can the band be arranged?",
    "solution": "If $x$ members march in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=72=2^3\\cdot3^2$. Given that $5\\le x\\le20$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^3=8$, $2^2\\cdot3=12$, $2\\cdot3=6$, $2\\cdot3^2=18$ and $3^2=9$, for a total of $ \\boxed{5}$ row-lengths.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have 72 band members and they need to march in rows with the same number of students per row. The number of students per rows can be between 5 and 20. \n\nTo find all possible row lengths, we need to find factors of 72 between 5 and 20. Factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. \n\nNext, we have to eliminate factors that are less than 5 and greater than 20. So, the possible row lengths are 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18. \n\nTherefore, the band can be arranged in 5 possible row lengths: 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 5?: Okay, so we have 72 band members and they need to march in rows with the same number of students per row. The number of students per rows can be between 5 and 20. \n\nTo find all possible row lengths, we need to find factors of 72 between 5 and 20.
