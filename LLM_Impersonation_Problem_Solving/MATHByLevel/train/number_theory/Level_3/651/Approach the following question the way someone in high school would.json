    "solution": "Since $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$ and $ad \\equiv bd \\pmod{m}$, $$2^{19}= (2^3)^6 \\cdot 2^1 \\equiv 1^6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{7}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7, we can start by figuring out what $2^1, 2^2, 2^3$, and so on up to $2^6$ are when divided by $7$:\n\n$2^1 \\mod 7 = 2$\n$2^2 \\mod 7 = 4$\n$2^3 \\mod 7 = 1$\n$2^4 \\mod 7 = 2$\n$2^5 \\mod 7 = 4$\n$2^6 \\mod 7 = 1$\n\nWe notice a pattern here: $2^3 = 8$, $2^6 = 64$, $2^9 = 512$, and so on, which means the remainders will alternate between $1, 2, 4$. Since $19$ can be written as $18 + 1$, we know that $2^{18}$ is a multiple of $7$ since $2^3$ is $1$ when divided by $7$. Therefore, $2^{19}$ will have the same remainder as $2$ when divided by $7$.\n\nHence, the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$ is $2$.",
