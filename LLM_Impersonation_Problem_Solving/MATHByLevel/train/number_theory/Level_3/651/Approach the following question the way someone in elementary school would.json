    "solution": "Since $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$ and $ad \\equiv bd \\pmod{m}$, $$2^{19}= (2^3)^6 \\cdot 2^1 \\equiv 1^6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{7}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7, we can start by finding the powers of $2$ when divided by $7$. \n\n$2^1$ divided by $7$ leaves a remainder of $2$.\n$2^2$ divided by $7$ leaves a remainder of $4$.\n$2^3$ divided by $7$ leaves a remainder of $1$.\n$2^4$ divided by $7$ leaves a remainder of $2$.\n$2^5$ divided by $7$ leaves a remainder of $4$.\n\nSince the remainders repeat in a pattern of $2, 4, 1,$ and $2$, we can use this pattern to find the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$. \n\n$19 \\div 3$ is $6$ remainder $1$, so we know that $2^{18}$ divided by $7$ leaves a remainder of $1$. \n\nTherefore, $2^{19}$ divided by $7$ will also leave a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$.",
