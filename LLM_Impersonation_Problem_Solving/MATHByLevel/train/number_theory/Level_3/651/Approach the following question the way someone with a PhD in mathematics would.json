    "solution": "Since $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$ and $ad \\equiv bd \\pmod{m}$, $$2^{19}= (2^3)^6 \\cdot 2^1 \\equiv 1^6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{7}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$, we can use modular arithmetic. \n\nWe know that $2^3 \\equiv 1$ (mod 7) because $2^3 = 8$ which is congruent to 1 modulo 7. \n\nFrom this, we can rewrite $2^{19}$ as $(2^3)^6 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\equiv 2$ (mod 7).\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by 7 is 2.",
