    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the last three digits of $3^{12000}$, we first note that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$. This tells us that $3^{400}$ is congruent to $1$ when divided by $1000$.\n\nWe can rewrite $3^{12000}$ as $3^{400 \\times 30}$. Using the property of modular arithmetic that $(a^b)^c \\equiv a^{bc} \\pmod{n}$, we can then rewrite $3^{12000}$ as $(3^{400})^{30}$.\n\nSince $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we have that $(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}\\pmod{1000}$. Simplifying further, we see that $1^{30}$ is still equal to $1$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ is $\\boxed{001}$.",
