    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we can write $3^{12000}$ as $(3^{400})^{30}$. Since $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we have that $(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are $\\boxed{001}$.",

Since $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we have that $(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are $\\boxed{001}$.",
