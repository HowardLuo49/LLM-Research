    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh cool! So we know that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$. This means that $3^{400}$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000. \n\nNow, we want to find the last three digits of $3^{12000}$. We can write $3^{12000}$ as $3^{400} \\cdot 3^{400} \\cdot 3^{400} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 3^{400}$ (30 times in total) because $12000$ is divisible by $400$. \n\nSince $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, each grouping of $3^{400}$ will leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000. So, $3^{12000}$ will also leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 001?: Oh cool! So we know that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$. This means that $3^{400}$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000. \n\nNow, we want to find the last three digits of $3^{12000}$.
