    "solution": "The prime factorization of 50 is $2\\cdot5^2$ and the prime factorization of 5005 is $5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13$. The greatest common divisor is 5 and the least common multiple is $2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13=2\\cdot5\\cdot5005=50050$. The sum of the GCD and LCM is $\\boxed{50055}$.",

To do this, we can list the factors of each number:\n\nFactors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\nFactors of 5005: 1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385, 715, 1001, 5005\n\nThen we can see that the greatest common divisor of 50 and 5005 is 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the least common multiple of 50 and 5005. To do this, we can list the multiples of each number:\n\nMultiples of 50: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, ...\nMultiples of 5005: 5005, 10010, 15015, 20020, 25025, 30030, 35035, 40040, 45045, 50050, ...\n\nThen we can see that the least common multiple of 50 and 5005 is 50050.\n\nFinally, we add the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple together to get the sum:\n5 + 50050 = 50055\n\nSo, the sum of the greatest common divisor of 50 and 5005 and the least common multiple of 50 and 5005 is 50055.",
