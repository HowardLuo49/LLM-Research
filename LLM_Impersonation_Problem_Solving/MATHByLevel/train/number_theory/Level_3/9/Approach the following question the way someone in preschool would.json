    "solution": "The prime factorization of 50 is $2\\cdot5^2$ and the prime factorization of 5005 is $5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13$. The greatest common divisor is 5 and the least common multiple is $2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13=2\\cdot5\\cdot5005=50050$. The sum of the GCD and LCM is $\\boxed{50055}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of $50$ and $5005$, we need to find the biggest number that can divide evenly into both numbers. The greatest common divisor of $50$ and $5005$ is $5$ because $5$ is the biggest number that can go into both $50$ and $5005$ without leaving a remainder.\n\nTo find the least common multiple of $50$ and $5005$, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both $50$ and $5005$. The least common multiple of $50$ and $5005$ is $5005$ because it is the smallest number that is a multiple of both $50$ and $5005$.\n\nNow, to find the sum of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of $50$ and $5005$, we add $5$ and $5005$ together. \n\n$5 + 5005 = 5010$\n\nSo, the sum of the greatest common divisor of $50$ and $5005$ and the least common multiple of $50$ and $5005$ is $5010$.",
