    "solution": "The prime factorization of 50 is $2\\cdot5^2$ and the prime factorization of 5005 is $5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13$. The greatest common divisor is 5 and the least common multiple is $2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13=2\\cdot5\\cdot5005=50050$. The sum of the GCD and LCM is $\\boxed{50055}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nThe Euclidean algorithm states that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b) for any integers a and b. \n\nWe have:\ngcd(50, 5005) = gcd(5005, 50)\n              = gcd(50, 5)\n              = 5.\n\nNext, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The LCM of two numbers a and b can be calculated using the relationship lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b).\n\nWe use the GCD that we found earlier:\nlcm(50, 5005) = (50 * 5005) / gcd(50, 5005)\n               = (50 * 5005) / 5\n               = 50050.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the GCD of 50 and 5005 (which is 5) and the LCM of 50 and 5005 (which is 50050) is:\n5 + 50050 = 50055. \n\nHence, the sum is 50055.",
