    "solution": "We begin by listing all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8... 8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4. We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36. $\\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ and $y$ be distinct positive integers such that $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36, but $x\\cdot y$ is not a factor of 36. Since $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36, we have that $36 = x\\cdot y \\cdot k$ for some positive integer $k$. Therefore, $k = \\frac{36}{x\\cdot y}$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36, the possible values for $x$ and $y$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. We can see that the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$ occurs when $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ (or vice versa). In this case, $x\\cdot y = 2\\cdot 3 = 6$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: Let $x$ and $y$ be distinct positive integers such that $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36, but $x\\cdot y$ is not a factor of 36.
