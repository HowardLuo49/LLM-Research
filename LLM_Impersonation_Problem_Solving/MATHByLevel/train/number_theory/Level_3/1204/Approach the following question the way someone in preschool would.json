    "solution": "We begin by listing all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8... 8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4. We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36. $\\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, the factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. We need to find two numbers, x and y, that are factors of 36 but when we multiply them together, the result is not a factor of 36. Hmmm, if we think about it, the smallest possible value for x and y could be 2 and 3 because when we multiply them we get 6, which is also a factor of 36. So, let's try a different combination. How about 2 and 4? Oh no, that doesn't work either because when we multiply them, we get 8, which is still a factor of 36. Let's keep trying... Oh, I know! How about 3 and 4? Yes, that works! When we multiply 3 and 4 together, we get 12, which is not a factor of 36. So, the smallest possible value of x*y that is not a factor of 36 is 12. Yay, we figured it out!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: Let's see, the factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.
