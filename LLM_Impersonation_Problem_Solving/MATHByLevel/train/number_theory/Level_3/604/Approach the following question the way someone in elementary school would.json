    "solution": "We begin by converting all the numbers to base 10: \\begin{align*} 165_7&=1(7^2)+6(7^1)+5(7^0)=49+42+5=96\\\\\n11_2&=1(2^1)+1(2^0)=2+1=3\\\\\n121_6&=1(6^2)+2(6^1)+1(6^0)=36+12+1=49\\\\\n21_3&=2(3^1)+1(3^0)=6+1=7\n\\end{align*}Thus, the original expression becomes $\\frac{96}{3}+\\frac{49}{7}=32+7=\\boxed{39}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to convert the fractions into base 10. \n\nTo convert $\\frac{165_7}{11_2}$ into base 10, we need to first convert the numerator and denominator into base 10. \n\nThe numerator, $165_7$, can be written as $1*7^2 + 6*7^1 + 5*7^0$. This simplifies to $1*49 + 6*7 + 5*1 = 49 + 42 + 5 = 96$.\n\nThe denominator, $11_2$, can be written as $1*2^1 + 1*2^0$. This simplifies to $1*2 + 1*1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{165_7}{11_2}$ in base 10 is $\\frac{96}{3} = 32$.\n\nNow, let's convert $\\frac{121_6}{21_3}$ into base 10. \n\nThe numerator, $121_6$, can be written as $1*6^2 + 2*6^1 + 1*6^0$. This simplifies to $1*36 + 2*6 + 1*1 = 36 + 12 + 1 = 49$.\n\nThe denominator, $21_3$, can be written as $2*3^1 + 1*3^0$. This simplifies to $2*3 + 1*1 = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{121_6}{21_3}$ in base 10 is $\\frac{49}{7} = 7$.\n\nNow, adding the two fractions in base 10, we get $32 + 7 = 39$. \n\nTherefore, $\\frac{165_7}{11_2}+\\frac{121_6}{21_3}$ in base 10 is $39$.",
