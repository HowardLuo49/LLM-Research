    "solution": "We begin by converting all the numbers to base 10: \\begin{align*} 165_7&=1(7^2)+6(7^1)+5(7^0)=49+42+5=96\\\\\n11_2&=1(2^1)+1(2^0)=2+1=3\\\\\n121_6&=1(6^2)+2(6^1)+1(6^0)=36+12+1=49\\\\\n21_3&=2(3^1)+1(3^0)=6+1=7\n\\end{align*}Thus, the original expression becomes $\\frac{96}{3}+\\frac{49}{7}=32+7=\\boxed{39}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! First, let's focus on the first fraction $\\frac{165_7}{11_2}$. We need to convert 165 base 7 to base 10. \n\nLet's count on our fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10. So, 165 base 7 is equal to 6*7^2 + 5*7^1 + 1*7^0, which is 6*49 + 5*7 + 1*1 = 294 + 35 + 1 = 330 in base 10. \n\nNow, let's convert $11_2$ to base 10. We can count in binary: 1, 2, 10. So, $11_2$ is equal to 1*2^1 + 1*2^0, which is 2 + 1 = 3 in base 10. \n\nNow, let's add the fractions: $\\frac{330}{3}$. We can do this by dividing 330 by 3, which gives us 110.\n\nNext, let's focus on the second fraction $\\frac{121_6}{21_3}$. We convert 121 base 6 to base 10. Let's count on our fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. So, 121 base 6 is equal to 1*6^2 + 2*6^1 + 1*6^0, which is 1*36 + 2*6 + 1*1 = 36 + 12 + 1 = 49 in base 10. \n\nNow, let's convert $21_3$ to base 10. We can count in ternary: 1, 2, 10. So, $21_3$ is equal to 2*3^1 + 1*3^0, which is 2*3 + 1*1 = 6 + 1 = 7 in base 10. \n\nNow, let's add the fractions: $\\frac{49}{7}$. We can do this by dividing 49 by 7, which gives us 7.\n\nFinally, let's add 110 and 7 together. 110 + 7 = 117. \n\nSo, $\\frac{165_7}{11_2}+\\frac{121_6}{21_3}$ in base 10 is 117.",
