    "solution": "Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$.  Then $n^2 \\equiv d^2 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$.  Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many different digits can be the units digit of a perfect square number, we need to think about the possible options for the units digit when we square a number. \n\nWhen we square a number, the units digit of the square can only be one of these numbers: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. That's because when we multiply two numbers together, the units digit of the product is determined by the units digits of the two numbers we are multiplying. \n\nSo, there are 6 distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number.",
