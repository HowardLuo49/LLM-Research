    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "We are given that $mn = 21^6$. Since the units digit of $m$ is 7, the units digit of $n$ must be such that when multiplied by 7, the units digit of the product is 1. This implies that the units digit of $n$ must be 3, since $7 \\times 3 = 21$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: We are given that $mn = 21^6$. Since the units digit of $m$ is 7, the units digit of $n$ must be such that when multiplied by 7, the units digit of the product is 1.
