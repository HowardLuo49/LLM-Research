    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $n$, we can look at the units digit of $mn = 21^6$. Since $m$ has a units digit of 7, we know that $m$ ends in a 7. \n\nWhen we multiply a number that ends in 7 by another number, the units digit of the result will be the same as the units digit of the number that ends in 7. So the units digit of $mn$ will also be 7 since 7 multiplied by any number ending in 1 always results in a number ending in 7. \n\nSince we know that $mn = 21^6$ has a units digit of 7, we can conclude that the units digit of $n$ is also 7.",
