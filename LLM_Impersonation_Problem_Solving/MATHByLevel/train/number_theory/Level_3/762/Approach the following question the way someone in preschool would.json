    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by looking at the number 21. It ends in 1, so when we multiply it by itself 6 times, the units digit will always be 1. \n\nSince $mn = 21^6$, we know that the units digit of $mn$ is also 1. \n\nWe also know that the units digit of $m$ is 7, so the units digit of $n$ must be 7/1, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is 7.",
