    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the units digit of $n$. We know that $m$ has a units digit of 7 and $mn = 21^6$. Since 21 ends in a 1, the units digit of $mn$ will be the same as the units digit of $n$.\n\nNext, we need to find the units digit of $21^6$. To do this, we can look for a pattern. $21^1$ ends in 1, $21^2$ ends in 1, $21^3$ ends in 1, and so on. So the units digit of $21^6$ will be the same as the units digit of $21^1$, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $n$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
