Composite numbers are numbers that can be divided by more than just one and themselves, like 4, 6, 8, and 9.\n\nThe first three composite numbers are 4, 6, and 8. When we multiply them together, we get:\n\n4 * 6 * 8 = 192\n\nThe units digit of 192 is 2. So, the units digit of the product of the first three positive composite numbers is 2!",
