    "solution": "The first three positive composite numbers are 4, 6, and 8. The units digit of their product, $4\\cdot6\\cdot8=192$, is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the product of the first three positive composite numbers, we need to first know what composite numbers are. Composite numbers are numbers that have more than two factors, so we need to start with numbers that are not prime.\n\nLet's write down the first few composite numbers: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...\n\nNow, let's multiply the first three composite numbers together: 4 x 6 x 8 = 192\n\nTo find the units digit of the product 192, we just need to look at the last digit, which is 2. So, the units digit of the product of the first three positive composite numbers is 2.",
