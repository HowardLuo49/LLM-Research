    "solution": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out what the three positive integers are. We know that their product is 27000, so we need to find three numbers that multiply together to get 27000. One way to do this is by breaking down 27000 into its prime factors: $2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3$. \n\nNow we need to find three numbers from these prime factors that are pairwise relatively prime, meaning they don't have any common factors other than 1. One way to do this is to pick the highest power of each prime factor to maximize the sum. So, our three numbers are: $2^3 = 8$, $3^3 = 27$, and $5^3 = 125$. \n\nFinally, we just need to add up these three numbers to find their sum: $8 + 27 + 125 = 160$. So the sum of the three positive integers is 160.",
