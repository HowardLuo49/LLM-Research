    "solution": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see... we know we have three numbers that are bigger than $1$, and when we multiply them all together we get $27000$. That's a really big number!\n\nNow, what does it mean when it says the numbers are \"pairwise relatively prime\"? Hmm... well, that means that each number doesn't have any common factors with the other numbers except for $1$. So each number is kinda like a best friend with $1$ but not with the other numbers.\n\nLet's try to figure out what the three numbers are. We can break down $27000$ into its prime factors: $2 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3$. Since the numbers are bigger than $1$ and they multiply to $27000$, maybe we can start by picking out one of each prime factor to make the three numbers.\n\nSo we have $2$, $3$, and $5$. They are all relatively prime to each other because their only common factor is $1$.\n\nNow, when we add them all together, we get $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$. So the sum of the three numbers is $10$. Yay, we did it!",
