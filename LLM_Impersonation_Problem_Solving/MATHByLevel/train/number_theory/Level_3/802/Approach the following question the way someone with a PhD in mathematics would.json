    "solution": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Let the three positive integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$. We know that $abc = 27000 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^3$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are pairwise relatively prime, they do not share any common factors other than $1$. Therefore, each integer must divide one of the prime factors $2$, $3$, or $5$.\n\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are greater than $1$, we cannot have $a = b = c = 1$. Without loss of generality, we assume $a < b < c$. Then, the only possible way to distribute the prime factors among $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $(2,3,5)$. Thus, $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three positive integers is $a + b + c = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10$. Thus, their sum is $10$.",
