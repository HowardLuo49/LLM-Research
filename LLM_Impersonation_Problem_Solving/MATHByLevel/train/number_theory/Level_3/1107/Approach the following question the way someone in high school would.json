    "solution": "Since $11065,11067,11069,\\ldots,11077$ are $7$ consecutive odd integers, they include exactly one integer from each of the residue classes $1,3,5,7,9,11,13\\pmod{14}$ (not necessarily in that order). Therefore, their sum is congruent $\\pmod{14}$ to $1+3+5+7+9+11+13=49$. The remainder of this sum $\\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when adding up all those numbers and dividing by 14, we can first do the addition:\n$11065+11067+11069+11071+11073+11075+11077 = 77597$\n\nNext, we divide $77597$ by $14$ to find the remainder:\n$77597 \\div 14 \\approx 5542.64$\n\nSo, the remainder is $3$ when $77597$ is divided by $14$.",
