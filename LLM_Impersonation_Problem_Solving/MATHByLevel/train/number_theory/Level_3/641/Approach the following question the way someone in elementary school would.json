    "solution": "Since $2^2 = 4$, we can convert directly to base 4 by pairing digits together starting from the right side of our base 2 integer:  \\begin{align*} 01_2 &= 1_4\n\\\\ 01_2 &= 1_4\n\\\\ 10_2 &= 2_4\n\\\\ 01_2 &= 1_4\n\\end{align*}  Putting the base 4 digits together, we get $1011001_2 = \\boxed{1121_4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert the binary number $1011001$ to base 4, we need to group the digits into sets of two starting from the right.\n\nSo the number $1011001$ can be split into: $10 \\ 11 \\ 00 \\ 1$.\n\nNow, we convert each set of two binary digits to base 4:\n\n$10 = 2_{10} = 2_{4}$\n\n$11 = 3_{10} = 3_{4}$\n\n$00 = 0_{10} = 0_{4}$\n\n$1 = 1_{10} = 1_{4}$\n\nTherefore, $1011001_2 = 2301_4$.",
