    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The marching band has more than 100 members but fewer than 200 members. When they line up in rows of 4 there is one extra person; when they line up in rows of 5 there are two extra people; and when they line up in rows of 7 there are three extra people. How many members are in the marching band?",
    "solution": "First, we look for an integer which leaves remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.  Checking the remainders of 2, 7, 12, 17, $\\ldots$ when divided by 4, we find that 17 is the least positive integer satisfying this condition.  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the only positive integers which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot 5=20$.  Checking the remainders of 17, 37, $\\ldots$ when divided by 7, we find that $17$ leaves a remainder of 3.  Again, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers which satisfy all three conditions are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot5\\cdot7=140$.  Among the integers 17, 157, 297, $\\ldots$, only $\\boxed{157}$ is between 100 and 200.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can represent the number of members in the marching band as a variable, say N. We know that N is greater than 100 and less than 200. \n\nWe can set up the following system of congruences based on the given conditions:\n\nN \u2261 1 (mod 4) \nN \u2261 2 (mod 5)\nN \u2261 3 (mod 7)\n\nWe can solve this system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \n\nFirst, consider the congruence N \u2261 1 (mod 4). Since N leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, we can express N as N = 4a + 1, where a is an integer. \n\nNext, consider the congruence N \u2261 2 (mod 5). Using the expression for N from the first congruence, we have 4a + 1 \u2261 2 (mod 5). This implies that 4a \u2261 1 (mod 5). Solving this congruence, we find that a \u2261 4 (mod 5). Therefore, we can express a as a = 5b + 4, where b is an integer. \n\nLastly, consider the congruence N \u2261 3 (mod 7). Substituting the expression for a from the second congruence into the expression for N, we get N = 4(5b + 4) + 1 = 20b + 17. \n\nSince N is also equivalent to 3 modulo 7, we have 20b + 17 \u2261 3 (mod 7). This simplifies to b \u2261 6 (mod 7), which means b = 7c + 6, where c is an integer. \n\nSubstituting b back into the expression for N, we get N = 20(7c + 6) + 17 = 140c + 137. \n\nSince N is greater than 100 and less than 200, we find that N = 137 (when c = 0) and N = 277 (when c = 1). \n\nTherefore, the marching band has 137 members.",
