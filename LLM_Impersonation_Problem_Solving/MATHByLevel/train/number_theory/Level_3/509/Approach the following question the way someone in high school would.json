    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The marching band has more than 100 members but fewer than 200 members. When they line up in rows of 4 there is one extra person; when they line up in rows of 5 there are two extra people; and when they line up in rows of 7 there are three extra people. How many members are in the marching band?",
    "solution": "First, we look for an integer which leaves remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.  Checking the remainders of 2, 7, 12, 17, $\\ldots$ when divided by 4, we find that 17 is the least positive integer satisfying this condition.  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the only positive integers which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot 5=20$.  Checking the remainders of 17, 37, $\\ldots$ when divided by 7, we find that $17$ leaves a remainder of 3.  Again, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers which satisfy all three conditions are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot5\\cdot7=140$.  Among the integers 17, 157, 297, $\\ldots$, only $\\boxed{157}$ is between 100 and 200.",

Since the marching band has more than 100 members but fewer than 200 members, I would start by thinking of a number in that range.

When they line up in rows of 7 there are three extra people:\n140 divided by 7 equals 20 with no remainder, so this clue is not satisfied either.\n\nGiven that none of the clues are satisfied with 140 members, I would now try another number within the range of 100 to 200 members and repeat the same process until I find a number that satisfies all three clues.
