    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The marching band has more than 100 members but fewer than 200 members. When they line up in rows of 4 there is one extra person; when they line up in rows of 5 there are two extra people; and when they line up in rows of 7 there are three extra people. How many members are in the marching band?",
    "solution": "First, we look for an integer which leaves remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.  Checking the remainders of 2, 7, 12, 17, $\\ldots$ when divided by 4, we find that 17 is the least positive integer satisfying this condition.  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the only positive integers which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot 5=20$.  Checking the remainders of 17, 37, $\\ldots$ when divided by 7, we find that $17$ leaves a remainder of 3.  Again, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers which satisfy all three conditions are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot5\\cdot7=140$.  Among the integers 17, 157, 297, $\\ldots$, only $\\boxed{157}$ is between 100 and 200.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! If we start with 100 and add 4 more, we get 104. But that's not enough because when we line up in rows of 4, we have one extra person. So let's add 4 more to get 108. That's still not enough because we need one more person. So let's keep adding 4 more until we reach a number where we have one extra person when lining up in rows of 4. \n\nLet's try 112, then 116, then 120, then 124, then 128, then 132, then 136, then 140, then 144, then 148, then 152, then 156, then 160, then 164, then 168, then 172, then 176, then 180, then 184, then 188, and finally 192. When we line up in rows of 4 with 192 members, we have one extra person. \n\nNow, let's see if this works for lining up in rows of 5 and 7. When we line up in rows of 5 with 192 members, we have two extra people. Let's try 197, then 202, then 207, then 212. When we line up in rows of 5 with 212 members, we have two extra people. \n\nNow, let's check if this works for lining up in rows of 7. When we line up in rows of 7 with 212 members, we have three extra people. Let's try 215, then 222. When we line up in rows of 7 with 222 members, we have three extra people. \n\nSo, the marching band has 222 members. Yay!",
