    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's think about this together! So, first we need to remember what prime numbers are. They are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. Can you help me figure out which prime numbers are in the arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6?
