    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. There is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.  What is the sum of those five prime numbers?",
    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know that the prime numbers are numbers that are greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and themselves. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, we are looking for a set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.\n\nLet's think about how we can approach this problem. Since we're looking for an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, the numbers would have to be 6 apart from each other. So one possible set of prime numbers that could form this sequence is 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29.\n\nTo check if these numbers are prime, we can quickly go through them and see that, yes, they are all prime numbers. \n\nFinally, to find the sum of these five prime numbers, we just add them all together: \n\n5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85 \n\nSo, the sum of the five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6 is 85.",
