    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the units digit of $23^{23}$, we must first examine the pattern of units digits in powers of 23. \n\nWhen we consider the units digits of the first few powers of 23, we see that they repeat in a cycle of 4: \n$23^1 = 3$\n$23^2 = 9$\n$23^3 = 7$\n$23^4 = 1$\n\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers of 23, we can deduce that the units digit of $23^{23}$ is the same as the units digit of $23^{3}$, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is 7.",
