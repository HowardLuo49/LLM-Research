    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh boy, let's count how many times we see the units digit of 3 in the number 23. We see it two times, so let's multiply 3 times 3 which gives us 9. Now, let's see if there's a pattern when we keep multiplying by 3. After doing some drawing and singing the ABCs, we see that the units digit of 3 repeats every 4 times. So, if we divide 23 by 4, we get a remainder of 3. That means the units digit of $23^{23}$ is the same as the third unit digit of 3, which is 7. Yay, we did it!",
