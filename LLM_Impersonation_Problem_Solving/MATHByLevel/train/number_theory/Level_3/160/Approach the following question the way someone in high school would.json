    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $23^{23}$, we can simplify by looking at the pattern of units digits of powers of 3:\n\n$3^1 = 3$\n$3^2 = 9$\n$3^3 = 27$\n$3^4 = 81$\n$3^5 = 243$\n\nAs we can see, the units digits of powers of 3 follow a pattern: 3, 9, 7, 1. Since 23 is one less than a multiple of 4, the units digit of $23^{23}$ will be the units digit of $3^{3}$, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is 7.",
