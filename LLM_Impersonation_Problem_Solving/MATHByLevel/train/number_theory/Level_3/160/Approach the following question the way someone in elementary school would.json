    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $23^{23}$, we first need to see what happens to the units digit of 23 when we raise it to different powers. \n\nLet's look at the units digit of $23^1$, $23^2$, $23^3$, and so on:\n\n$23^1 = 23$ (units digit is 3)\n$23^2 = 529$ (units digit is 9)\n$23^3 = 12167$ (units digit is 7)\n$23^4 = 279841$ (units digit is 1)\n\nYou might notice that the units digit of $23^n$ repeats in a pattern - 3, 9, 7, 1. Therefore, we can find the units digit of $23^{23}$ by finding the remainder of 23 when divided by 4 (since there are 4 numbers in the pattern).\n\n23 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3. So, the units digit of $23^{23}$ will be the same as the 3rd number in the pattern, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is 7.",
