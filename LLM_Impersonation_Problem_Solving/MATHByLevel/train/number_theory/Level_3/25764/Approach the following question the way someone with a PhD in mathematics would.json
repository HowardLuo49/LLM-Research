    "solution": "First, we find $150=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2.$ The prime factorization of a divisor of 150 must take the form $2^m3^n5^p$ for nonnegative integers $m\\leq 1$, $n\\leq 1$, and $p\\leq 2$. The requirement that the divisor is not divisible by 5 means that we must have $p=0$. Therefore, there are $2$ possibilities for $m$ (namely, 0 or 1) and the same for $n$ for a total of $2\\cdot 2=\\boxed{4}$ such factors.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we note that the prime factorization of $150$ is $2\\cdot3\\cdot5^2$. \n\nTo find the total number of positive divisors of $150$, we first calculate the exponents in the prime factorization. We add $1$ to each of these exponents and then multiply them together. In this case, we have $(1+1)(1+1)(2+1)=2\\cdot2\\cdot3=12$ positive divisors of $150$.\n\nTo find the positive divisors of $150$ that are not divisible by $5$, we need to count the divisors that do not include any factors of $5$. This means we can only choose from the factors of $2$ and $3$ in the prime factorization. \n\nThe divisors not divisible by $5$ will have exponents at most $1$ for the prime factor of $5$. So, we can calculate the total number of divisors by considering $1+1=2$ choices for the exponent of $2$ and $1+1=2$ choices for the exponent of $3$. Multiplying these together gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ positive divisors of $150$ that are not divisible by $5$.",
