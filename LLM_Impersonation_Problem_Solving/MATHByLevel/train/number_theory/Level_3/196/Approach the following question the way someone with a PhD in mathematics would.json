    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",
    "gpt_response": "The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers $a$ and $b$ is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$ without leaving a remainder. In this case, we are looking for the GCD of $1729$ and $1768$.\n\nOne way to find the GCD of two numbers is to use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two numbers by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until one of the numbers becomes zero. \n\nStarting with $1768$ and $1729$, we can apply the Euclidean algorithm as follows:\n$$1768 = 1 \\cdot 1729 + 39$$\n$$1729 = 44 \\cdot 39 + 13$$\n$$39 = 3 \\cdot 13 + 0$$\n\nSince our final remainder is $0$, the GCD of $1768$ and $1729$ is $13$.
