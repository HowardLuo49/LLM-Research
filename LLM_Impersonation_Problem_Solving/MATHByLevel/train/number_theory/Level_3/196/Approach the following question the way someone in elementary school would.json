    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",
