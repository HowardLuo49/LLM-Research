    "solution": "The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \\cdot 64 = 448$. Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$, we can divide $473$ by $8$ and see how many times $8$ can fit into $473$. Let's count together: \n\n8 times 5 is 40\n8 times 6 is 48\n8 times 7 is 56\n8 times 8 is 64\n\nSo, $8$ can fit into $473$ around $59$ times. That means the first digit in the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $7$! Yay, we did it!",
