    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $a$ has $3$ factors and $b$ has $a$ factors. If $b$ is divisible by $a$, then what is the least possible value of $b?$",
    "solution": "Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime. The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors. The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4. It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's consider the number of factors a positive integer $n$ has. If $n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is the prime factorization of $n$, then the number of factors of $n$ is given by $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots(e_k+1)$.\n\nGiven that $a$ has $3$ factors, we have that $a=p_1^2$ for some prime $p_1$.\n\nSince $b$ has $a$ factors, we have that $b=p_1^{p_1^2-1}$. Since $b$ is divisible by $a=p_1^{2}$, we must have $p_1^{p_1^2-1}\\geq p_1^2$, which simplifies to $p_1^{p_1^2-3}\\geq 1$. This implies that $p_1^2-3 \\geq 0$, which gives us $p_1\\geq 2$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $b$ is when $p_1=2$, which means $b=2^{2^2-1}=2^3=8$.",
