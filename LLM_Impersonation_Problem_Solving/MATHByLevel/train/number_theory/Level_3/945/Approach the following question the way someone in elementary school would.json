    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $a$ has $3$ factors and $b$ has $a$ factors. If $b$ is divisible by $a$, then what is the least possible value of $b?$",
    "solution": "Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime. The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors. The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4. It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what it means for a number to have factors. A factor of a number is a whole number that can be multiplied by another whole number to get that number. So if a number has $3$ factors, that means it can only be divided evenly by $1$, itself, and one other number. \n\nNext, let's think about what it means for one number to be divisible by another. If a number is divisible by another number, that means you can divide the first number by the second number and get a whole number answer with no remainder. \n\nSince $b$ is divisible by $a$ and $b$ has $a$ factors, that means $b$ must have $a$ factors as well. But $b$ also has to be divisible by $a$ so that means one of the factors of $b$ must be $a$.\n\nThe least possible value for $a$ would be $2$, because $2$ only has $2$ factors, $1$ and $2$. So $a$ could be $2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the least possible value for $b$ that has $a$ factors. Since $b$ must be divisible by $a=2$, one factor of $b$ must be $2$. So $b$ must have one more factor besides $2$ in order to have $2$ factors. The smallest number that fulfills this condition would be $2 \\times 3 = 6$. So the least possible value for $b$ is $6$.\n\nSo, the least possible value for $b$ is $6$.",
