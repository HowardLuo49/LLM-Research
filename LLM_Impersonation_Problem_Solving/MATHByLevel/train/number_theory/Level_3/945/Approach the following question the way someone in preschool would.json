    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $a$ has $3$ factors and $b$ has $a$ factors. If $b$ is divisible by $a$, then what is the least possible value of $b?$",
    "solution": "Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime. The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors. The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4. It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many factors $a$ has. We know that $a$ is a positive integer, so its factors must be $1, a,$ and another factor. That means $a$ has $3$ factors!\n\nNow, let's count how many factors $b$ has. We know that $b$ has $a$ factors, and we just found out that $a$ has $3$ factors. So, $b$ must have $3$ factors too!\n\nIf $b$ has $3$ factors, then the smallest possible value for $b$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$ (since the factors of $6$ are $1, 2, 3,$ and $6$).
