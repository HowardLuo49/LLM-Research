When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about this with some cupcakes! Claire has some cupcakes and when she divides them into groups of 5, she has 3 left over. That means she has 3 more than a number that is a multiple of 5. Then, when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 left over. That means she has 4 more than a number that is a multiple of 7. So Claire has between 5 and 8 cupcakes because she has 3 more than a multiple of 5, and 4 more than a multiple of 7. The possible quantities of cupcakes Claire could have are 5, 6, or 7. The sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes she could have is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18. Yum, cupcakes!",
