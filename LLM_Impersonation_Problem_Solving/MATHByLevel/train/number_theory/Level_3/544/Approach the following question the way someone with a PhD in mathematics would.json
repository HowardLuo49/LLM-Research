When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the total number of cupcakes that Claire has. According to the given conditions, we have:\n\nx \u2261 3 (mod 5)\nx \u2261 4 (mod 7)\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, these two congruences have a unique solution mod 35. Since Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, we need to find all possible values of x less than 60 that are congruent to 3 mod 5 and 4 mod 7.\n\nThe first few solutions are x = 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53. Of these, only x = 23 and x = 48 are less than 60.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have is 23 + 48 = 71.",
