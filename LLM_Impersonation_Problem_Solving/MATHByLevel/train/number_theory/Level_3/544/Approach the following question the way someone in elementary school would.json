    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "gpt_response": "OK, so Claire has some cupcakes. When she makes groups of 5, she has 3 left over. And when she makes groups of 7, she has 4 left over. Claire must have less than 60 cupcakes. We need to find all the possible amounts of cupcakes she could have. Let's figure it out!\n\nLet's start with groups of 5. Since she has 3 cupcakes left over, we can add 3 to any multiple of 5. So, possible amounts of cupcakes she could have when dividing into groups of 5 are 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, ...\n\nNext, let's look at groups of 7. Since she has 4 cupcakes left over, we can add 4 to any multiple of 7. So, possible amounts of cupcakes she could have when dividing into groups of 7 are 4, 11, 18, 25, ...\n\nNow, let's find the common numbers in both lists. The common numbers are 18, 43, and any number that is a multiple of 35.\n\nSo, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have is 18 + 43 + any multiple of 35. Let's add them up!\n\n18 + 43 = 61\nThe multiples of 35 are:\n35 + 70 = 105\nNow, let's add them all up!\n61 + 105 = 166\n\nSo, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have is 166.",
