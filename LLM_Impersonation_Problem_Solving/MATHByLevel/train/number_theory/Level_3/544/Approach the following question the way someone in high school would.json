    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's try to figure out how many cupcakes Claire has. Let's call the total number of cupcakes she has \"x.\" \n\nWhen she divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining. This means that x divided by 5 gives us a remainder of 3. In other words, x \u2261 3 (mod 5).\n\nSimilarly, when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. This means that x divided by 7 gives us a remainder of 4. In other words, x \u2261 4 (mod 7).\n\nNow, we need to find all the possible values of x that satisfy both of these conditions and are less than 60.\n\nFirst, let's list out the multiples of 5 that are less than 60: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55.\n\nNow, let's list out the multiples of 7 that are less than 60: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56.\n\nThe common multiples of 5 and 7 that are less than 60 are 35 and 70. However, we need to subtract 1 from 35 since the remaining cupcakes should be less than 60. Therefore, Claire could have 34 cupcakes or 69 cupcakes.\n\nThe sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that Claire could have is 34 + 69 = 103.",
