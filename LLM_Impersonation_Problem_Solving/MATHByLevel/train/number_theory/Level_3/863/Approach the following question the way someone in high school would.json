    "solution": "To be divisible by both 5 and 11, an integer must be a multiple of 55.  The smallest three-digit multiple of 55 is $2 \\cdot 55 = 110,$ and the largest three-digit multiple of 55 is $18 \\cdot 55 = 990$. So we can count the number of integers by the number of multiples, $2, 3, \\ldots , 17 , 18$, of which there are $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many positive three-digit integers are divisible by both 11 and 5, we need to find the numbers that are multiples of both 11 and 5. \n\nFirst, let's find the smallest three-digit integer that is divisible by both 11 and 5. The smallest three-digit integer divisible by 11 is 110, and the smallest three-digit integer divisible by 5 is 100. The least common multiple of 11 and 5 is 55. So, the smallest three-digit integer divisible by both 11 and 5 is 110.\n\nNext, let's find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by both 11 and 5. The largest three-digit integer divisible by 11 is 990, and the largest three-digit integer divisible by 5 is 995. So, the largest three-digit integer divisible by both 11 and 5 is 990.\n\nNow, we need to find how many numbers are between 110 and 990 inclusive that are multiples of 55 (divisible by both 11 and 5).\n\nDividing 990 by 55 gives us 18, and dividing 110 by 55 gives us 2. Therefore, there are 18 - 2 + 1 = 17 positive three-digit integers that are divisible by both 11 and 5.\n\nSo, the answer is 17 positive three-digit integers are divisible by both 11 and 5.",
