    "solution": "Observing that $4 \\cdot 7 = 28 = 27 + 1,$ we multiply both sides of the given congruence by 7 to find $28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$. Since $28x\\equiv x\\pmod{27}$ and $91\\equiv10 \\pmod{27}$, we conclude that $x\\equiv 10\\pmod{27}$. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying the given congruence.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we can first simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4. This gives us $x \\equiv \\frac{13}{4} \\pmod{27}$.\n\nNext, to find the smallest positive integer solution for $x$, we need to find a number that, when divided by 27, leaves a remainder of $\\frac{13}{4}$. \n\nTo do this, we can rewrite $\\frac{13}{4}$ as $\\frac{27 + 13}{4} = \\frac{40}{4} = 10$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ is $x = 10$.",
