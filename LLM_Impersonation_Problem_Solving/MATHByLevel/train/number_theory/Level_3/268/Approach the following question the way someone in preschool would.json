    "solution": "Observing that $4 \\cdot 7 = 28 = 27 + 1,$ we multiply both sides of the given congruence by 7 to find $28x \\equiv 91 \\pmod{27}$. Since $28x\\equiv x\\pmod{27}$ and $91\\equiv10 \\pmod{27}$, we conclude that $x\\equiv 10\\pmod{27}$. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ is the smallest positive integer satisfying the given congruence.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest number that works for $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$, we can start with the number 1 and keep adding 27 until we find a number that makes the equation true. Let's count together to find the answer:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, yay we found it! The number 13 works because when we multiply 4 by 13, we get 52, which is congruent to 13 modulo 27.\n\nSo the smallest positive integer that satisfies $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ is 13! Great job counting with me!",
