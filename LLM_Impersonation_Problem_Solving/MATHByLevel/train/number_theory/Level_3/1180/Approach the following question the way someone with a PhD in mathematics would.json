    "solution": "To find the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, we ignore 1 and prime factorize the rest to obtain $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\\cdot 3, 7, 2^3$, and $3^2$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{2520}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest number that is divisible by integers 1 through 9, we must find the least common multiple (LCM) of these integers. \n\nThe prime factorization of each integer is as follows:\n1 = 1\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2 * 3\n7 = 7\n8 = 2^3\n9 = 3^2\n\nThe LCM is equal to the product of the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the factorization of these integers. \n\nTherefore, the LCM of integers 1 through 9 is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 = 2520. Therefore, the smallest number divisible by integers 1 through 9 is 2520.",
