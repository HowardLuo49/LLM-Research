    "solution": "The prime factorization of 18 is $3^2\\cdot2$, so in order for a number to be divisible by 18 it must be divisible by both 3 and 2. First, in order for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In the case of $x15x$, this means that $x+1+5+x=2x+6$ must be divisible by 3. Since the constant term (6) is already a multiple of 3, $2x$ must be divisible by 3, which means that $x$ itself must be a multiple of $3$ as well. Second, in order for a number to be divisible by 2, the units digit must be an even number. In this case, the divisibility rule for 2 implies that $x$ must be an even number. Thus, since we know that it must be an even single-digit multiple of 3, the only possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of x, we can first check if the number is divisible by 18. We know that a number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 2, the last digit must be even. So x must be even for the number $x15x$ to be divisible by 2.\n\nNext, for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. In this case, the sum of the digits is $x+1+5+x = 2x+6$. For this sum to be divisible by 9, $2x+6$ must be divisible by 9.\n\nLet's try different values of x starting from 0 and going up by 2: \n\nIf x = 0, then $2(0)+6 = 6$, which is not divisible by 9.\nIf x = 2, then $2(2)+6 = 10$, which is not divisible by 9.\nIf x = 4, then $2(4)+6 = 14$, which is not divisible by 9.\nIf x = 6, then $2(6)+6 = 18$, which is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the value of x that makes the number $\\underline{6156}$ divisible by 18 is 6.",
