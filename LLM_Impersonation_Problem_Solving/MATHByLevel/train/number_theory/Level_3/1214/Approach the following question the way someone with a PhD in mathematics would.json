    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To add two numbers in base $6$, we first add each column starting from the rightmost column and carry any excess to the next column. \n\nStarting with the rightmost column:\n$3_6 + 5_6 = 8_{10} = 2$ in base $6$, so we write down $2$ and carry $1$.\n\nMoving to the next column:\n$4_6 + 2_6 + 1 = 11_{10} = 5$ in base $6$, so we write down $5$ and carry $1$ again.\n\nMoving to the next column:\n$3_6 + 3_6 + 1 = 7_{10} = 11$ in base $6$, so we write down $1$ and carry $1$ again.\n\nMoving to the next column:\n$2_6 + 5_6 + 1 = 13_{10} = 21$ in base $6$, so we write down $3_{\\text{base} 6}$.\n\nTherefore, $2343_6 + 15325_6 = 31532_6$.",
