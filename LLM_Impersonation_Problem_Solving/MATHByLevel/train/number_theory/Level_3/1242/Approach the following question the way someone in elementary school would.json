    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. If $0.\\overline{42}$ is written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, what is $a+b$?",
    "solution": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting these two equations gives $99x = 42$, so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. Thus $a+b = 14+33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so to change $0.\\overline{42}$ to a fraction, we can call it $x$ and then multiply by 100 to get $42.\\overline{42}$, then subtract $x$ to get $42.\\overline{42} - 0.\\overline{42} = 42$. \n\nSo, $100x - x = 42$ which means $99x = 42$ so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. \n\nTherefore, $a + b = 14 + 33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 47?: Okay, so to change $0.\\overline{42}$ to a fraction, we can call it $x$ and then multiply by 100 to get $42.\\overline{42}$, then subtract $x$ to get $42.\\overline{42} - 0.\\overline{42} = 42$. \n\nSo, $100x - x = 42$ which means $99x = 42$ so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. \n\nTherefore, $a + b = 14 + 33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
