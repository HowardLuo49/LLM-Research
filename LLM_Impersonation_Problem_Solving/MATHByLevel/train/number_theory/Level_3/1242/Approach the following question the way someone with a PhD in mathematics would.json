    "solution": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting these two equations gives $99x = 42$, so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. Thus $a+b = 14+33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express $0.\\overline{42}$ as a fraction, we can let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting the two equations gives $99x = 42$. Therefore, $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$.\n\nSince 14 and 33 have a greatest common divisor of 1, the fraction $\\frac{14}{33}$ is already in its simplest form.
