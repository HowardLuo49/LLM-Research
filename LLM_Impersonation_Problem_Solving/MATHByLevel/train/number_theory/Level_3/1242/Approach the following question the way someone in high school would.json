    "solution": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting these two equations gives $99x = 42$, so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. Thus $a+b = 14+33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To start, let's call $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. This means $x = 0.424242...$\n\nNow, we can write $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$.\n\nSubtracting $x$ from $100x$ gives $99x = 42$.\n\nSo, $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$.\n\nTherefore, $a=14$ and $b=33$, so $a+b = 14+33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
