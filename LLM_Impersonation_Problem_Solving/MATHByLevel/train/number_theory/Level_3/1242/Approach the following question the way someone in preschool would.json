    "solution": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting these two equations gives $99x = 42$, so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. Thus $a+b = 14+33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... if we have 0.42424242... that means the 42 part just keeps repeating. So it's like having 42 over and over again. Let's call this fraction $\\frac{42}{99}$ because 42 repeats every two digits and 99 is just all 9s. \n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which in this case is 3. So we get $\\frac{14}{33}$.\n\nNow we just need to add the numerator and denominator together to find the answer. So, $a+b = 14 + 33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
