In this case, the largest power of 2 less than eleven is 8 (2^3). \n\nSo, we start by writing 1 in the place value corresponding to the power of 2 (i.e., 2^3) and subtracting 8 from eleven to get the remainder. We then repeat this process with the remainder until we reach zero. \n\nIn this case, we have:\n11 - 8 = 3\n3 - 2 = 1\n1 - 1 = 0\n\nTherefore, eleven in base 2 is 1011.",
