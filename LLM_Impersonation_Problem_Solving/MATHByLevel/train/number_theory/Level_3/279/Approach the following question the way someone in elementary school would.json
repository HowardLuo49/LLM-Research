    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Jenna collects stamps.  She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.  One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.  The other has 1008.  What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many stamps Jenna puts on each page, we need to figure out the greatest common factor of 840 and 1008. This means we need to find the biggest number that can divide evenly into both 840 and 1008.\n\nFirst, we can list out the factors of 840: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 35, 40, 42, 56, 60, 70, 84, 105, 120, 140, 168, 210, 280, 420, 840\n\nNext, we can list out the factors of 1008: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 28, 36, 42, 56, 63, 72, 84, 112, 126, 168, 252, 336, 504, 1008\n\nFrom the lists, we can see that the largest number that can be divided evenly into both 840 and 1008 is 168.
