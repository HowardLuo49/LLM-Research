    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jenna collects stamps.  She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.  One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.  The other has 1008.  What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of stamps that Jenna puts on each page. Since she puts the same number of stamps on each page and inserts each page into one of two stamp books, the total number of stamps in each book must be divisible by x. \n\nTherefore, we can express the total number of stamps as a multiple of x:\n840 = kx\n1008 = mx\n\nwhere k and m are some natural numbers.\n\nTo find the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page, we need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 840 and 1008. This can be done by factoring both numbers and finding the highest power of each prime factor that occurs in both factorizations.\n\nFactorizing 840:\n840 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7\n\nFactorizing 1008:\n1008 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 7\n\nThe prime factors common to both factorizations are 2, 3, and 7. The highest powers of these prime factors that occur in both factorizations are:\n2^3, 3, 7\n\nTherefore, the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page is the product of these highest powers:\n2^3 * 3 * 7 = 168\n\nTherefore, Jenna could be putting 168 stamps on each page.",
