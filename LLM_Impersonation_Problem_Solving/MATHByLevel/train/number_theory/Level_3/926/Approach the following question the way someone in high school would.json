So 7882 is of the form $5k + 2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNow we want to find an integer $n$ such that $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. We can list out some integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 5: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and so on.\n\nAmong these, the only integer in the range $4 \\leq n \\leq 8$ is $n = \\boxed{7}$.",
