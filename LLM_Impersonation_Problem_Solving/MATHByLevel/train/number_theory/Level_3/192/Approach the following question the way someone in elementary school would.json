    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{076923}$. Since the first six digits repeat, we know that after every 6th digit the pattern will restart. Since $43\\div 6 = 7 r 1$, the first 42 digits will be seven repetitions of the same pattern followed by the first digit of the pattern. Since the first digit is $\\boxed{0}$, this is our final answer.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$, we need to do long division! \n\nWhen we do long division, we find that $\\frac{1}{13}$ is equal to $0.076923076923...$. This pattern repeats after every 6 digits. Since 43 is greater than 6, we need to figure out which digit comes next in the repeating pattern.\n\nIf we divide 43 by 6, we get 7 with a remainder of 1. This means that the 43rd digit after the decimal point is the first digit in the repeating pattern, which is 0. \n\nSo, the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is 0.",
