    "solution": "$99!$, the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, includes the product $2\\times5=10$, and since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of 99! is $\\boxed{0}$.",

Now we have to find the units digit in the product of all these numbers. \n\nHmm... let's see, when we multiply numbers, we look at the last digit. So let's multiply all the last digits together! \n\n1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 = ?\n\nLet's count the units digit of each number: \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nHmm... it looks like there are a lot of numbers ending in 0, which means the units digit of the product is also 0!
