    "solution": "$99!$, the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, includes the product $2\\times5=10$, and since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of 99! is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, we need to multiply all the digits together. Since we are only interested in the units digit, we can ignore all the other digits and focus on the unit digit of each number.\n\nWhen we multiply all the unit digits of the numbers from 1 to 99, we find that the units digit of the product is 0. This is because there are multiple factors of 5 and 2 in the product which results in a units digit of 0.\n\nTherefore, the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99 is 0.",
