    "solution": "$99!$, the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, includes the product $2\\times5=10$, and since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of 99! is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, we need to multiply all the numbers together. \n\nLet's start by looking at the units digit of each number:\n\n1 x 2 x 3 x ... x 9 = 362880\n10 x 11 x ... x 99 = 0\n\nSince any number multiplied by 0 is 0, the product of all the numbers from 1 to 99 will have a units digit of 0. \n\nSo the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99 is 0!",
