    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25?",
    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive multiple of 25 where the product of its digits is also a multiple of 25, we can try different numbers.\n\nLet's start with the number 25 itself. When we multiply the digits 2 and 5, we get 10, which is not a multiple of 25.\n\nNext, let's try the number 50. When we multiply the digits 5 and 0, we get 0, which is a multiple of 25.\n\nSo, the least positive multiple of 25 where the product of its digits is also a multiple of 25 is 50.",
