    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we first note that any positive multiple of 25 must end with either 25 or 75.\n\nLet us consider the possible options for the digits of the number. If the number ends with 25, then the other digit must be 5 in order for the product of the digits to be a multiple of 25. This gives us the number 25*5 = 125, which is indeed a multiple of 25.\n\nIf the number ends with 75, then the other digit must be 3, as 7*3 = 21 is a multiple of 25. This gives us the number 75*3 = 225, which is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25.\n\nTherefore, the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25 is 225.",
