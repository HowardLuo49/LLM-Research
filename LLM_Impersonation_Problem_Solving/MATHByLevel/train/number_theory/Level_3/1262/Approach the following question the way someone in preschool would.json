    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Find the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer.",
    "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$.",

Let's start by finding some numbers that work. \n\nIf I try $n = 1$, then $\\frac{1+6}{1} = 7$ which is a whole number. Yay! \n\nIf I try $n = 2$, then $\\frac{2+6}{2} = 4$ which is also a whole number. Double yay!\n\nIf I try $n = 3$, then $\\frac{3+6}{3} = 3$ which is a whole number too. Triple yay! \n\nI think I need to keep trying more numbers until I find all the ones that work. Let's see... \n\nIf I try $n = 4$, then $\\frac{4+6}{4} = 2.5$ which is not a whole number. Oh no! \n\nIf I try $n = 5$, then $\\frac{5+6}{5} = 2.2$ which is also not a whole number. Oops! \n\nI think I need to keep going until I find all the numbers that work. I'll try $n = 6, 7, 8, 9,$ and $10$ next. \n\nAfter I try all those numbers, I find that $n = 1, 2, 3,$ and $6$ make the fraction into a whole number. So the sum of all those numbers is $12$. Yay!
