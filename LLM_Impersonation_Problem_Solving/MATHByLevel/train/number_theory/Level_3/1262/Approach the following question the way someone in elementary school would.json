    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Find the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer.",
    "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's try out some numbers for $n$ and see if we get an integer when we plug them into the expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$. \n\nIf we try $n=1$, we get $\\frac{1+6}{1} = 7$, which is an integer. \n\nIf we try $n=2$, we get $\\frac{2+6}{2} = 4$, which is also an integer. \n\nIf we try $n=3$, we get $\\frac{3+6}{3} = 3$, which is an integer. \n\nIf we try $n=4$, we get $\\frac{4+6}{4} = 2.5$, which is not an integer. \n\nSo it looks like the values of $n$ that work are 1, 2, and 3. Let's add them up: \n\n$1+2+3 = 6$\n\nSo the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer is 6.",
