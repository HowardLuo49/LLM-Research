    "solution": "If $\\frac{3}{11}=0.ababab\\ldots$, then, by multiplying both forms of this number by 100, we get $\\frac{300}{11}=ab.ababab\\ldots$. Now we can subtract:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&300/11 &=& ab&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n- &3/11 &=& 0&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&297/11 &=& ab &\n\\end{array}$$\n\nWe can simplify $\\frac{297}{11}$ to $27$, giving us the two digits we sought: $a=2$ and $b=7$. Thus, $a+b = 2+7 = \\boxed{9}$.\n\n(Alternatively, we could solve this problem by long division.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the repeating decimal for $\\frac{3}{11}$, we first divide 3 by 11. It equals 0.272727\\dots. The $a$ and $b$ are the same because it repeats. So $a$ is 2 and $b$ is 7. To find the sum of $a$ and $b$, we add them together. $2+7=9$. So the value of the sum is 9.",
