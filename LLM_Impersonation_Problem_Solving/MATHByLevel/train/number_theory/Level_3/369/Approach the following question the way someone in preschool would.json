    "solution": "If $\\frac{3}{11}=0.ababab\\ldots$, then, by multiplying both forms of this number by 100, we get $\\frac{300}{11}=ab.ababab\\ldots$. Now we can subtract:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&300/11 &=& ab&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n- &3/11 &=& 0&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&297/11 &=& ab &\n\\end{array}$$\n\nWe can simplify $\\frac{297}{11}$ to $27$, giving us the two digits we sought: $a=2$ and $b=7$. Thus, $a+b = 2+7 = \\boxed{9}$.\n\n(Alternatively, we could solve this problem by long division.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $a+b$, we first have to understand what a repeating decimal is. \n\nWhen we have the fraction $\\frac{3}{11}$, it equals $0.ababab\\dots$ where $a$ and $b$ are the repeating digits. This means that the digits $ab$ keep repeating over and over again.\n\nSo, the value of $a$ is 4 and the value of $b$ is 5. \n\nTo find $a+b$, we just add them together like this: \n\n$a + b = 4 + 5 = 9$ \n\nSo, the sum $a+b$ is 9!
