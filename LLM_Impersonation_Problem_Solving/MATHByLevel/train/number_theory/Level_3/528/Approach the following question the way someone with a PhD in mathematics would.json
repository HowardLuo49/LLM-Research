    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest base-4 number with four digits, we must consider that each digit can take values from 0 to 3 in base 4. The largest base-4 number with four digits would be 3333 in base 4, where each digit is the largest possible value of 3.\n\nConverting this number to base 10:\n3*(4^3) + 3*(4^2) + 3*(4^1) + 3*(4^0) \n= 192 + 48 + 12 + 3 \n= 255\n\nTherefore, the largest base-4 number that has four digits is 255 in base 10.",
