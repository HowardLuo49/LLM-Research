    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest base-4 number with four digits, we need to figure out what the highest digit can be in each place value. In base-4, the digits can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo, the largest number with four digits in base-4 would be:\n3333\n\nTo convert this to base 10, we can use the formula:\n(3 * 4^3) + (3 * 4^2) + (3 * 4^1) + (3 * 4^0)\n= (3 * 64) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 1)\n= 192 + 48 + 12 + 3\n= 255\n\nTherefore, the largest base-4 number with four digits is 255 in base 10.",
