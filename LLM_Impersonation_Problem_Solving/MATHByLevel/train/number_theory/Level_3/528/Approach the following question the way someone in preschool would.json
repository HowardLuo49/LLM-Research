    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count in base 4 to figure this out! The largest base 4 number with one digit is 3, the largest base 4 number with two digits is 33, and the largest base 4 number with three digits is 333. So, the largest base 4 number with four digits is 3333! Now, let's convert this to base 10. \n\nIn base 10, 3333 is:\n(3 * 4^3) + (3 * 4^2) + (3 * 4^1) + (3 * 4^0)\n= (3 * 64) + (3 * 16) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 1)\n= 192 + 48 + 12 + 3\n= 255\n\nSo, the largest base-4 number that has four digits is 255 in base 10. Yay, we did it!",
