    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest base-4 number that has four digits, we need to figure out the highest possible digit we can have in each place value. Since it's base-4, the digits can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo the largest base-4 number that has four digits is when all digits are 3, which is 3333 in base-4. \n\nTo convert 3333 from base-4 to base-10, we simply multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 4 and add them up:\n\n3 x 4^3 + 3 x 4^2 + 3 x 4^1 + 3 x 4^0 = 192 + 48 + 12 + 3 = 255\n\nTherefore, the largest base-4 number that has four digits is 255 in base-10.",
