    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$?",
    "solution": "Since $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are both odd, their sum is even and therefore divisible by 2.  There are no smaller primes than $\\boxed{2}$, so it is the smallest prime divisor of the sum.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest prime divisor of the expression $5^{23} + 7^{17}$, we can consider it modulo various small primes. Let $p$ be a prime number dividing $5^{23} + 7^{17}$. By Fermat's little theorem, we have $5^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $7^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Therefore, $5^{23} \\equiv 5^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $7^{17} \\equiv 7^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nHence, $5^{23} + 7^{17} \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{p}$. This means that if $p$ divides $5^{23} + 7^{17}$, then $p$ must be greater than 2. \n\nTo determine the smallest prime divisor, we can calculate the expression modulo small primes greater than 2. We find that $5^{23} + 7^{17} \\equiv 1 + 5 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$, $5^{23} + 7^{17} \\equiv 2 + 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{3}$, and $5^{23} + 7^{17} \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ is the prime number $3$.",
