    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The seven digits in Sam's phone number and the four digits in his house number have the same sum.  The four digits in his house number are distinct, and his phone number is 271-3147.  What is the largest possible value of Sam's house number?",
    "solution": "First, we need to add up the digits in his phone number to see what the digits in his address add up to.  $2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25$.\n\nFor his address, we want to find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to $25$.  Because we want a large number, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible, so the first digit should be $9$.  The next three digits, therefore, must add up to $25-9=16$.  Since the digits must be unique, the next digit cannot be $9$, so we will go for the next largest number, $8$.  The final two digits must add up to $16-8=8$, and since neither can be $8$, the next largest possibility for those numbers is $7$ and $1$.  Therefore, Sam's address is $\\boxed{9871}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's add up all the digits in Sam's phone number: 2 + 7 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 25.\n\nNow we know that the sum of the digits in Sam's phone number is 25. And since the sum of the digits in his house number is also 25, we need to find four distinct digits that add up to 25.\n\nTo find the largest possible value for Sam's house number, we should start by using the largest digits possible. Let's start with 9, since it's the largest single digit number. \n\nSo, if we choose 9 as one of the digits, we need to find three other digits that when added to 9, will equal 25. The next largest digit we can use is 8. \n\nSo 9 + 8 = 17, leaving us with a sum of 25 - 17 = 8 that we still need. \n\nThe next largest digit we can use is 7. So, 9 + 8 + 7 = 24, leaving us with a sum of 25 - 24 = 1 that we still need. \n\nFinally, since 1 is the only digit left, we can use it as our fourth digit. Therefore, the largest possible value for Sam's house number is 9871.",
