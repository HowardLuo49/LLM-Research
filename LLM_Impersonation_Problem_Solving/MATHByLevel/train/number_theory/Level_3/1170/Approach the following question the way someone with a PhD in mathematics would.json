    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Mohan is selling cookies at the economics fair. As he decides how to package the cookies, he finds that when he bags them in groups of 4, he has 3 left over. When he bags them in groups of 5, he has 2 left over. When he bags them in groups of 7, he has 4 left over. What is the least number of cookies that Mohan could have?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the least number of cookies Mohan could have. From the given information, we know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\\\\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\\\\na&\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that $a=3+4m$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\implies m\\equiv 1\\pmod 5.\\] So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $m=1+5n$. Substituting $a=3+4m$ into $(3)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 2\\pmod 7.\\] Substituting $m=1+5n$ into this gives \\[1+5n\\equiv 2\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7.\\] The least $n$ such that $n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7$ is $n=3$. Since \\[a=3+4m=3+4(1+5n)=7+20n,\\]we have\\[n\\ge 3\\implies a=7+20n\\ge 67.\\] Since $67$ satisfies the three congruences, $a=\\boxed{67}$.",
