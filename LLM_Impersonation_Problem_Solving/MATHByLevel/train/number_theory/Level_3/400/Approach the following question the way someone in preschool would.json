    "solution": "In order to solve this problem, we must first find the number of digits when $987_{10}$ is converted to each base. Beginning with base-3, we have that $2187>987>729$ or $3^7>987>3^6$. So, we know that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has 7 digits. Similarly with base-8, we have that $4096>987>512$ or $8^4>987>8^3$. So, the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has only 4 digits. Therefore, the base-3 equivalent has $7-4=\\boxed{3}$ more digits than the base-8 equivalent.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the answer, let's start by counting the digits in the base-3 representation of 987. First, we see that $3^6 = 729$ is the largest power of 3 that is less than 987. So, we know that 987 can be written as a sum of multiples of powers of 3: \n\n$987_{10} = 1*3^6 + 0*3^5 + 0*3^4 + 2*3^3 + 1*3^2 + 0*3^1 + 0*3^0$\n\nSo, we see that the base-3 representation of 987 has 7 digits.\n\nNext, let's count the digits in the base-8 representation of 987. The largest power of 8 that is less than 987 is $8^3 = 512$. So, we know that 987 can be written as a sum of multiples of powers of 8:\n\n$987_{10} = 1*8^3 + 2*8^2 + 6*8^1 + 3*8^0$\n\nTherefore, the base-8 representation of 987 has 4 digits.\n\nTo find out how many more digits the base-3 representation has than the base-8 representation, we subtract the number of digits in the base-8 representation from the number of digits in the base-3 representation:\n\n$7 - 4 = 3$\n\nSo, the base-3 representation of 987 has 3 more digits than the base-8 representation. Yay!",
