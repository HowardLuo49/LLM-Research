    "solution": "In order to solve this problem, we must first find the number of digits when $987_{10}$ is converted to each base. Beginning with base-3, we have that $2187>987>729$ or $3^7>987>3^6$. So, we know that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has 7 digits. Similarly with base-8, we have that $4096>987>512$ or $8^4>987>8^3$. So, the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has only 4 digits. Therefore, the base-3 equivalent has $7-4=\\boxed{3}$ more digits than the base-8 equivalent.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first I need to figure out how many digits are in the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$. To do that, I need to figure out how big each place value is in base-3. In base-3, the place values go 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, and so on. So, I need to see how many times 987 can fit into each of those numbers. I see that 987 is bigger than 729 (which is 3 to the power of 5), so that means it will have at least 6 digits in base-3.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many digits are in the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$. In base-8, the place values go 1, 8, 64, 512, and so on. If I divide 987 by 512, I see it goes into it once. But it doesn't go into the next place value, 64. So, that means $987_{10}$ will have 3 digits in base-8.\n\nNow, let's see how many more digits the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has than the base-8 representation. It has 6 digits in base-3 and 3 digits in base-8. So, that means the base-3 representation has 3 more digits than the base-8 representation.",
