    "solution": "There are 7 days in a week.  Two days of the year fall on the same day of the week if and only if they are congruent modulo 7.  Notice that  \\[284\\equiv4\\pmod7\\] and  \\[25\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] Therefore the 284th day and the 25th day fall on the same day of the week.  Therefore the 284th day of the year falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
