    "solution": "There are 7 days in a week.  Two days of the year fall on the same day of the week if and only if they are congruent modulo 7.  Notice that  \\[284\\equiv4\\pmod7\\] and  \\[25\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] Therefore the 284th day and the 25th day fall on the same day of the week.  Therefore the 284th day of the year falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to calculate how many days are between the 25th day of the year and the 284th day. \n\nThere are 284 - 25 = 259 days between these two dates. \n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we need to find the remainder when we divide 259 by 7. \n\n259 \u00f7 7 = 37 with a remainder of 0, so the 284th day of the year falls on the same day of the week as the 25th day, which is Saturday.",
