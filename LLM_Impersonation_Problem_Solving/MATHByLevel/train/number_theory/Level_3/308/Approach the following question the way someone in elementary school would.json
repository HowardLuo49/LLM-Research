    "solution": "There are 7 days in a week.  Two days of the year fall on the same day of the week if and only if they are congruent modulo 7.  Notice that  \\[284\\equiv4\\pmod7\\] and  \\[25\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] Therefore the 284th day and the 25th day fall on the same day of the week.  Therefore the 284th day of the year falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about this. If the 25th day of the year 2003 falls on a Saturday, that means the 24th day is a Friday, right? And the 26th day is a Sunday. So if we count by sevens, we can figure out what day the 284th day falls on. \n\nSo, if we add 7 days (a week) to Saturday, we get the next Saturday. And if we keep doing that, we can figure out what day the 284th day falls on. Let's count by sevens: Saturday, then Saturday again, then Saturday one more time, and so on. \n\nAfter counting by sevens, we find that the 284th day of the year 2003 falls on a Tuesday. Yay, we figured it out!",
