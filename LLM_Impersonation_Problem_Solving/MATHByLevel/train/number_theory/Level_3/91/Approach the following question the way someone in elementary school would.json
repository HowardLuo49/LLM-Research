    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. For some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. That means that $60 = q(k^2) + 6$ for some whole number $q$. We can simplify this to $q(k^2) = 54$. \n\nTo find $q$, we need to list out all the factors of 54 and see if any of them could be $k$. The factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. We can see that $k$ could be 3 since $3^2 = 9$ and $9$ divides into 60 with a remainder of 6.\n\nNow that we found that $k=3$, we can find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$. $100 \\div 3 = 33$ with a remainder of 1. So, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is 1.",
