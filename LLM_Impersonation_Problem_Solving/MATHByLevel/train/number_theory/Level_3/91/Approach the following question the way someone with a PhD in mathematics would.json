    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this problem using modular arithmetic. \n\nGiven that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6, we can express this as:\n\n$60 \\equiv 6\\ (\\text{mod}\\ k^2)$\n\nThis means that there exists an integer $m$ such that $60 = m \\cdot k^2 + 6$, or equivalently, $m \\cdot k^2 = 54$.\n\nSince both 60 and 54 are divisible by 6, we can rewrite this as $m \\cdot k^2 = 6 \\cdot 9$.
