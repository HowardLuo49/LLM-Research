    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. You recently bought more than 100 eggs. The eggs are sorted in containers that can store exactly 12 eggs. However, upon inspecting the containers, you realize that two containers each hold only 11 eggs, while all the other containers hold 12 eggs. What is the smallest number of eggs you could have right now?",
    "solution": "If the two containers that held 11 eggs each held 12 eggs, then the number of eggs that you have would have been a multiple of 12. However, two eggs were removed, so the number of eggs you can have is two less than a multiple of 12. Therefore, the number of eggs you could have can be written in the form $12c-2$, where $c$ represents the number of containers you have. As a result, we would like to solve the inequality $12c-2 > 100$, which has solution $c > 8\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, since the number of containers must be an integer, we must have $c=9$, so the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is $12(9) - 2 = \\boxed{106}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To tackle this problem, we need to set up an equation to determine the minimum number of eggs in total. Let's denote the total number of containers as C and the total number of eggs as E. Since each container holds 12 eggs, we have the equation E = 12C.\n\nNow, we know that two of the containers have only 11 eggs each while the rest have 12 eggs each. Let's denote the number of containers with 11 eggs as X and the number of containers with 12 eggs as Y. We can express this as:\n\nX + Y = C\n11X + 12Y = E\n\nSubstitute E = 12C into the second equation:\n11X + 12Y = 12C\n\nNow, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:\n11X + 12(Y - X) = 12(C - X)\n\n11X + 12Y - 12X = 12C - 12X\n11X + 12Y = 12C\nX = C\n\nSince X represents the number of containers with 11 eggs and Y represents the number of containers with 12 eggs, we can conclude that the minimum number of containers is 2 (as we have two containers with 11 eggs each).\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of eggs that you could have right now is 24 (2 containers x 12 eggs per container).",
