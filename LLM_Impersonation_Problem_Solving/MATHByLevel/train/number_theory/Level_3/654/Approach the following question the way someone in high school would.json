    "solution": "We see that $2^7=128$ is the largest power of 2 less than 222, leaving us with $222-128=94$. Since the next largest power of 2, $2^6=64$, is less than 94, we are left with the remainder $94-64=30$. Because $2^5=32$ is greater than 30, the next non-zero coefficient goes to the $2^4=16$ term, giving us a remainder of $30-16=14$. Continuing from here, we find that $222_{10}=1\\cdot2^7+1\\cdot2^6+0\\cdot2^5+1\\cdot2^4+1\\cdot2^3+1\\cdot2^2+1\\cdot2^1+0\\cdot2^0=11011110_2$. This gives us the sum $1+1+0+1+1+1+1+0=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to convert the number 222 in base-10 to base-2. To do this, we can repeatedly divide by 2 and keep track of the remainders.\n\nStarting with 222, we find the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, and the quotinent is 111. \n\nNext, we divide 111 by 2, which gives a remainder of 1 and a quotient of 55. \n\nContinuing this process, we eventually get the binary expression for 222 as 11011110.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the digits in this binary representation. Adding up all the digits - 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of the base-2 expression for $222_{10}$ is 6.",
