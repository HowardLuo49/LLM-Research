    "solution": "We see that $2^7=128$ is the largest power of 2 less than 222, leaving us with $222-128=94$. Since the next largest power of 2, $2^6=64$, is less than 94, we are left with the remainder $94-64=30$. Because $2^5=32$ is greater than 30, the next non-zero coefficient goes to the $2^4=16$ term, giving us a remainder of $30-16=14$. Continuing from here, we find that $222_{10}=1\\cdot2^7+1\\cdot2^6+0\\cdot2^5+1\\cdot2^4+1\\cdot2^3+1\\cdot2^2+1\\cdot2^1+0\\cdot2^0=11011110_2$. This gives us the sum $1+1+0+1+1+1+1+0=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to figure out the base-2 expression for 222. To do that, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than 222. The largest power of 2 that is less than 222 is $2^7=128$. \n\nSubtracting 128 from 222, we get 94. The largest power of 2 that is less than 94 is $2^6=64$. \n\nSubtracting 64 from 94, we get 30. The largest power of 2 that is less than 30 is $2^4=16$. \n\nSubtracting 16 from 30, we get 14. The largest power of 2 that is less than 14 is $2^3=8$. \n\nSubtracting 8 from 14, we get 6. The largest power of 2 that is less than 6 is $2^2=4$. \n\nSubtracting 4 from 6, we get 2. The largest power of 2 that is less than 2 is $2^1=2$. \n\nSubtracting 2 from 2, we get 0. \n\nTherefore, the base-2 expression for 222 is $11011110_2$. \n\nTo find the sum of the digits, we just add up all the digits: \n\n1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6 \n\nSo, the sum of the digits of the base-2 expression for 222 is 6.",
