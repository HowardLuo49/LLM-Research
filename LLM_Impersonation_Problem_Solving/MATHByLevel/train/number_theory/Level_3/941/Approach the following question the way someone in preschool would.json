    "solution": "$3^7+6^6 = 3^6\\cdot3+3^6\\cdot 2^6 = 3^6(3+2^6) = 3^6\\cdot 67.$ Thus the greatest prime factor is $\\boxed{67}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. $3^7$ means 3 multiplied by itself 7 times. That's a lot of threes! And $6^6$ is 6 multiplied by itself 6 times. Let's add those two big numbers together: $3^7 + 6^6$.\n\nNow, let's figure out the prime factors of that big number. The greatest prime factor is the biggest prime number that can evenly divide into our big number.\n\nLet's count together: 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, and 6, 36, 216, 1296. Hmm, this is tricky. Let's try breaking down these numbers into smaller factors. \n\nAh ha! I see that $3^7 = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ and $6^6 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$. If we combine all the factors, we see that $3^7 + 6^6$ is actually equal to $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$. \n\nAnd there we have it! The greatest prime factor of $3^7 + 6^6$ is 3. Yay! We did it!",
