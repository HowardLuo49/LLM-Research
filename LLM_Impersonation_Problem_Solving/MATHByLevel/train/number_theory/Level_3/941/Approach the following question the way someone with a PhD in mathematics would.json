    "solution": "$3^7+6^6 = 3^6\\cdot3+3^6\\cdot 2^6 = 3^6(3+2^6) = 3^6\\cdot 67.$ Thus the greatest prime factor is $\\boxed{67}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest prime factor of $3^7 + 6^6$, we can first simplify the expression. Notice that $6 = 2\\cdot3$, so we can rewrite $6^6$ as $(2\\cdot3)^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$. \n\nNow, we have $3^7 + 2^6\\cdot3^6$. Factoring out a common factor of $3^6$, we get $3^6(3 + 2^6)$. \n\nWe can clearly see that $3 + 2^6 = 67$. So, we have $3^6 \\times 67$. \n\nSince $3^6 = 729$, the product $3^6 \\times 67 = 729 \\times 67$. \n\nNow, we need to find the greatest prime factor of $729 \\times 67$. \n\n$729$ is $3^6$ or $3^2 * 3^4$. Thus, $729 = 3^2 * 3^4 = 3^6$. \n\n$67$ is a prime number. \n\nTherefore, the greatest prime factor of $3^7 + 6^6$ is $\\boxed{67}$.",
