    "solution": "$3^7+6^6 = 3^6\\cdot3+3^6\\cdot 2^6 = 3^6(3+2^6) = 3^6\\cdot 67.$ Thus the greatest prime factor is $\\boxed{67}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest prime factor of $3^7 + 6^6$, first let's simplify the expression. \n\n$3^7$ can be written as $3^3 \\cdot 3^4$, which is $27 \\cdot 81$. \n\n$6^6$ is equal to $2^6 \\cdot 3^6$, which is $64 \\cdot 729$. \n\nSo, $3^7 + 6^6$ becomes $27 \\cdot 81 + 64 \\cdot 729$. \n\nCombining like terms, we get $2187 + 4608 = 6795$. \n\nNow let's find the prime factors of 6795. \n\nDividing 6795 by 3, we get 2265. \n\nDividing 2265 by 3, we get 755. \n\nDividing 755 by 5, we get 151. \n\nDividing 151 by 151, we get 1. \n\nTherefore, the greatest prime factor of $3^7 + 6^6$ is 151.",
