    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. The given system of congruences is \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na\\equiv 1\\pmod 4\\\\\na\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=1$, $(1)$ and $(2)$ together imply that $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {12}$. So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+12n$. Substituting this into $(3)$ yields $$1+12n\\equiv 2\\pmod 5,$$ $$\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.$$ So $n$ has a lower bound of $3$. Then $$n\\ge 3,$$ $$\\implies a=1+12n\\ge 37.$$ Since $37$ satisfies all three congruences, $a=\\boxed{37}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about it like counting numbers! We want a number that leaves a remainder of 1 when we divide it by 4, 3, and 5. Well, if we start counting, we might find that 11 fits all those rules! When we divide 11 by 4, we get 2 with a remainder of 3. When we divide 11 by 3, we get 3 with a remainder of 2. And when we divide 11 by 5, we get 2 with a remainder of 1. So, the smallest whole number that fits all those rules is 11! Yay!",
