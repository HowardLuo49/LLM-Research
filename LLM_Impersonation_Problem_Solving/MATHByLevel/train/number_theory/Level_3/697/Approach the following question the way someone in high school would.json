    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the smallest whole number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. The given system of congruences is \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na\\equiv 1\\pmod 4\\\\\na\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=1$, $(1)$ and $(2)$ together imply that $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {12}$. So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+12n$. Substituting this into $(3)$ yields $$1+12n\\equiv 2\\pmod 5,$$ $$\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.$$ So $n$ has a lower bound of $3$. Then $$n\\ge 3,$$ $$\\implies a=1+12n\\ge 37.$$ Since $37$ satisfies all three congruences, $a=\\boxed{37}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest whole number that meets these conditions, we need to start by listing out multiples of each divisor and adding the remainders until we find a number that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nLet's start with the first condition: when divided by 4, the number should have a remainder of 1. The multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, etc. Adding a remainder of 1 to each multiple gives us 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, etc.\n\nNext, let's consider the second condition: when divided by 3, the number should have a remainder of 1. The multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, etc. Adding a remainder of 1 to each multiple gives us 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, etc.\n\nLastly, the third condition: when divided by 5, the number should have a remainder of 2. The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, etc. Adding a remainder of 2 to each multiple gives us 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, etc.\n\nBy comparing the lists, we can see that the first number that satisfies all three conditions is 13.
