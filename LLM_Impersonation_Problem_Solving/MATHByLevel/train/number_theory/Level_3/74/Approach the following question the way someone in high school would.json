    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $A$ be the product of the divisors of $42$. How many distinct prime factors does $A$ have?",
    "solution": "The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. They can be paired off into four pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 42:  \\begin{align*}\n\\{1&,42\\}, \\\\\n\\{2&, 21\\},\\\\\n\\{3&, 14\\}, \\text{and}\\\\\n\\{6&, 7\\}.\n\\end{align*}Thus $A=42^4=(2\\cdot3\\cdot7)^4=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4$ has $\\boxed{3}$ prime divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct prime factors of $A$, we first need to find the divisors of $42$. \n\nThe divisors of $42$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42$. We multiply all of these together to get $A = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 14 \\times 21 \\times 42 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^2$. \n\nTherefore, the product of the divisors of $42$, $A$, has distinct prime factors $2, 3,$ and $7$. So, $A$ has $3$ distinct prime factors.",
