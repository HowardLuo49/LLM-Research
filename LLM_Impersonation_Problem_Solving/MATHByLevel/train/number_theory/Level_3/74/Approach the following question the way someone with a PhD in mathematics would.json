    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $A$ be the product of the divisors of $42$. How many distinct prime factors does $A$ have?",
    "solution": "The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. They can be paired off into four pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 42:  \\begin{align*}\n\\{1&,42\\}, \\\\\n\\{2&, 21\\},\\\\\n\\{3&, 14\\}, \\text{and}\\\\\n\\{6&, 7\\}.\n\\end{align*}Thus $A=42^4=(2\\cdot3\\cdot7)^4=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4$ has $\\boxed{3}$ prime divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of the divisors of 42, we first note that 42 can be factored as $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. The divisors of 42 can be generated by taking all combinations of taking powers of the prime factors $2, 3,$ and $7$. Thus, the divisors are:\n\n$1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 14, 21, 42$\n\nNow, if we multiply all the divisors together to get $A$, we have:\n\n$A = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 42$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we find that $A = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2$.\n\nTherefore, $A$ has three distinct prime factors: 2, 3, and 7.",
