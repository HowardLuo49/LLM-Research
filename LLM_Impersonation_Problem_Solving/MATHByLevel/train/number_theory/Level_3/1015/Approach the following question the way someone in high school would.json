    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the rule that the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by 11.\n\nIn this case, the alternating sum of the digits is $8-5+4-n+5-2+6 = 16-n$. For the number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum must be a multiple of 11. Since 16 is not a multiple of 11, we need to find a value for $n$ that makes the alternating sum a multiple of 11.\n\nTo do this, we can test different values of $n$ until we find one that works. We can see that if $n=5$, the alternating sum becomes $16-5=11$, which is divisible by 11.\n\nTherefore, if the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by 11, then $n$ must be equal to 5.",
