    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To see if a number is divisible by 11, you have to add every other digit together and then subtract the sum of the remaining digits. \n\nIn this case, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $8 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 25$ and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $5 + n + 2 = 7 + n$. \n\nSo we need to find $n$ so that $25 - (7 + n)$ is divisible by 11.\n\nSimplify to get $25 - 7 - n = 18 - n$. To be divisible by 11, we want $18 - n$ to equal a multiple of 11.\n\nSince $18 - n$ could be $0, 11, 22, ...$, we see that $18 - n = 11$ and $n = 18 - 11 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, if the seven-digit number $8547526$ is divisible by $11$, then $n = 7$.",
