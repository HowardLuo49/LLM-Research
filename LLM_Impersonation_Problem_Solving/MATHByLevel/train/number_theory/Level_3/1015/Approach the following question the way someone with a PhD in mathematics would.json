    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if a number is divisible by $11, we can use the rule that the alternating sum of its digits (starting from the right) should be divisible by 11. \n\nFor the number $854n526$, the alternating sum of the digits is $6 - 2 + 5 - n + 4 - 8 = 5 - n$. For this number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum must also be divisible by 11. \n\nTherefore, we have $5 - n$ is divisible by 11. That means $5 - n$ must be 0 (since the only single-digit number between -10 and 10 that is divisible by 11 is 0). \n\nTherefore, we have $5 - n = 0$, which implies $n = 5$. \n\nHence, the value of $n$ is 5.",
