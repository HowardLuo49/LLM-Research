    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\\cdot189=2^3\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$. The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$. Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\\cdot3^2=(2\\cdot3)^2=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest perfect square factor of 1512, we need to see which perfect squares can divide into 1512. Let's start with the largest perfect square, which is 36 (6 x 6). \n\nIf we divide 1512 by 36, we get 42. So, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is 36. Yay!",
