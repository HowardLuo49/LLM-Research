    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the largest perfect square factor of 1512?",
    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\\cdot189=2^3\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$. The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$. Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\\cdot3^2=(2\\cdot3)^2=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest perfect square factor of 1512, we first need to prime factorize 1512. \n\n1512 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 7\n\nNow, we need to identify the perfect square factors from the prime factorization. The perfect square factors are those in which each prime factor appears an even number of times.\n\nIn this case, the perfect square factor of 1512 is 2^2 * 3^2 = 36.\n\nTherefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is 36.",
