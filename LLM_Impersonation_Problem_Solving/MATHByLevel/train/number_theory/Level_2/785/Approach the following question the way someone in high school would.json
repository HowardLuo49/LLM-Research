    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Jason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard. His parents have agreed to let him work off his debt by babysitting under the following conditions: his first hour of babysitting is worth $\\$1$, the second hour worth $\\$2$, the third hour $\\$3$, the fourth hour $\\$4$, the fifth hour $\\$5$, the sixth hour $\\$6$, the seventh hour $\\$1$, the eighth hour $\\$2$, etc. If he repays his debt by babysitting for 39 hours, how many dollars did he borrow?",
    "solution": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how much money Jason borrowed, we need to add up the value of each hour of babysitting that he does. \n\nIf we list out the values of the hours, it looks like this: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...$\n\nWe can see that this pattern repeats every 6 hours. So to find out how much money he borrowed for 39 hours of babysitting, we need to find out how many cycles of 6 hours he babysat for (6 goes into 39 six times with a remainder of 3).\n\nFor the first 36 hours (6 cycles of 6 hours each), the total value is $(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) \\times 6 = 3 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 126$ dollars.\n\nFor the last 3 hours, the value is $(1 + 2 + 3) = 6$ dollars.\n\nAdding these together, we get $126 + 6 = 132$ dollars. \n\nTherefore, Jason borrowed 132 dollars.",
