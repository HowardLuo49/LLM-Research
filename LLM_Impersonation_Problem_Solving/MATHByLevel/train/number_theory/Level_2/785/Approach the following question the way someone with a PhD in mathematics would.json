    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard. His parents have agreed to let him work off his debt by babysitting under the following conditions: his first hour of babysitting is worth $\\$1$, the second hour worth $\\$2$, the third hour $\\$3$, the fourth hour $\\$4$, the fifth hour $\\$5$, the sixth hour $\\$6$, the seventh hour $\\$1$, the eighth hour $\\$2$, etc. If he repays his debt by babysitting for 39 hours, how many dollars did he borrow?",
    "solution": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first recognize that the amount Jason earns for babysitting is following a repeating pattern. This pattern consists of cycles of hours that are worth $\\$1, \\$2, \\$3, \\$4, \\$5, \\$6$ in order.\n\nWe can calculate the total amount earned in each cycle by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term.\n\nFor each cycle, there are 6 terms, and we can calculate the sum for each cycle as follows:\n$S = \\frac{6}{2}(1 + 6) = 21$\n\nSince Jason babysat for 39 hours and each cycle consists of 6 hours, we can determine how many complete cycles he completed: $39 \\div 6 = 6$ cycles with 3 additional hours.\n\nTherefore, he has earned a total of $6 \\times 21 = 126$ dollars from the complete cycles. For the additional 3 hours he babysat, he earned $\\$1 + \\$2 + \\$3 = \\$6$.\n\nThus, the total amount earned by Jason is $126 + 6 = 132$ dollars, which is also the amount he borrowed from his parents.",
