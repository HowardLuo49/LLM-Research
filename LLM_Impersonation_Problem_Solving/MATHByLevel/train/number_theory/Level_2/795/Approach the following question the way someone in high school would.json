    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $12$ are $2,3,5,7,11$. Since $2$ is the only even prime out of the five primes less than $12$, the answer is $\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{20}{100}=\\boxed{20\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the percent of prime numbers less than 12 that are divisible by 2, we first need to list all the prime numbers less than 12. The prime numbers less than 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nOut of these prime numbers, only one of them (2) is divisible by 2. \n\nSo the percent of prime numbers less than 12 that are divisible by 2 is 1 out of 5, which is 20%.",
