    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $12$ are $2,3,5,7,11$. Since $2$ is the only even prime out of the five primes less than $12$, the answer is $\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{20}{100}=\\boxed{20\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the percentage of prime numbers less than 12 that are divisible by 2, we first need to identify all prime numbers less than 12. These prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. \n\nAmong these prime numbers, only 2 is divisible by 2. Therefore, the percentage of prime numbers less than 12 that are divisible by 2 is 1 out of 5, or 20%.",
