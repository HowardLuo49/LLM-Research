Assuming Carlos has more than one marble, what is the smallest possible number of marbles in Carlos's collection?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ be the number of marbles. We know that for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ $$N = 6a+1,\\\\N = 7b+1, \\\\N = 8c +1.$$In other words, $N-1$ is divisible by $6,$ $7,$ and $8.$ We have $$\\text{lcm}[6,7,8] = \\text{lcm}[3,7,8]= 3\\cdot 7\\cdot 8 = 168,$$and so $168$ divides $N-1.$ The smallest possible value of $N$ greater than $1$ is $N = 168+1 = \\boxed{169}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count with our marbles to find out the answer! Carlos has one marble left over when he divides his marbles into groups of 6, 7, or 8. That means he must have at least 2 marbles, because if he only had 1, he wouldn't have any left over. Let's try 2 marbles. If Carlos has 2 marbles, he would have 1 left over when he divides them into groups of 2, 3, or 4, so 2 marbles doesn't work. Let's try 3 marbles. If Carlos has 3 marbles, he would have 1 left over when he divides them into groups of 6, 7, or 8, so 3 marbles is the smallest possible number of marbles he could have in his collection. Yay for Carlos and his marbles!",
