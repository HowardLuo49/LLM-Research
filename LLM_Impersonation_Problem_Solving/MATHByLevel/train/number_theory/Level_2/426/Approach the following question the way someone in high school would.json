Assuming Carlos has more than one marble, what is the smallest possible number of marbles in Carlos's collection?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ be the number of marbles. We know that for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ $$N = 6a+1,\\\\N = 7b+1, \\\\N = 8c +1.$$In other words, $N-1$ is divisible by $6,$ $7,$ and $8.$ We have $$\\text{lcm}[6,7,8] = \\text{lcm}[3,7,8]= 3\\cdot 7\\cdot 8 = 168,$$and so $168$ divides $N-1.$ The smallest possible value of $N$ greater than $1$ is $N = 168+1 = \\boxed{169}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by figuring out the common multiple of 6, 7, and 8, which is 168. Since Carlos has one marble left over when dividing into groups of 6, 7, or 8, we can add 1 to the common multiple.\n\nSo, the smallest possible number of marbles in Carlos's collection is 169.",
