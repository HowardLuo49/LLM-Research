    "solution": "$4444_8=4\\cdot8^3+4\\cdot8^2+4\\cdot8^1+4\\cdot8^0=2048+256+32+4=2340_{10}$. Therefore, Kate will have $2340-1000=\\boxed{1340}$ dollars for lodging and food.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how much money Kate will have left for lodging and food, we first need to subtract the cost of the airline ticket from the total amount she saved up.\n\nIn base $8$, $4444_8$ is equivalent to $4 \\times 8^3 + 4 \\times 8^2 + 4 \\times 8^1 + 4 \\times 8^0$.\n\nThis calculation gives us $4 \\times 512 + 4 \\times 64 + 4 \\times 8 + 4 \\times 1 = 2048 + 256 + 32 + 4 = 2340$ dollars in base ten.\n\nNow, we subtract the cost of the airline ticket, $1000_{10}$ dollars, from the total amount Kate saved up: $2340 - 1000 = 1340$.\n\nTherefore, Kate will have $1340$ dollars left for lodging and food after purchasing the round-trip airline ticket.",
