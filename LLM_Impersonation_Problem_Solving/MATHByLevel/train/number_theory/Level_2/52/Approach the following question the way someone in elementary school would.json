    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers. What is the sum of those five integers?",
    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to figure out what two consecutive positive integers multiply together to get 210. I know that 14 times 15 equals 210, so those are the two integers.\n\nNext, we need to find three consecutive integers that multiply together to get 210. I know that 5 times 6 times 7 equals 210, so those are the three integers.\n\nFinally, we add up all five integers: 14 + 15 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 47.\n\nSo, the sum of those five integers is 47.",
