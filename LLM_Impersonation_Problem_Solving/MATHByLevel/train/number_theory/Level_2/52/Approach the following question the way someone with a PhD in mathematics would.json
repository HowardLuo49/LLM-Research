    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers. What is the sum of those five integers?",
    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two consecutive integers be n and n+1. Therefore, we have:\nn(n+1) = 210\nn^2 + n - 210 = 0\n(n + 15)(n - 14) = 0\nn = 14, -15\n\nSince n is a positive integer, n = 14. Therefore, the consecutive integers are 14 and 15.\n\nLet the three consecutive integers be m, m+1, and m+2. Therefore, we have:\nm(m+1)(m+2) = 210\nm^3 + 3m^2 + 2m - 210 = 0\n(m + 7)(m^2 + 3m - 30) = 0\nm = -7, 5, -8\n\nSince m is a positive integer, m = 5. Therefore, the consecutive integers are 5, 6, 7.\n\nThe sum of the five integers is 14 + 15 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 47.",
