    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers. What is the sum of those five integers?",
    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this question down. We are looking for two consecutive positive integers that multiply to give us 210. That means we need to find two numbers that multiply together to give 210. \n\nOne way to do this is to factorize 210. We can see that 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. So, the two consecutive positive integers that multiply to give us 210 are 14 and 15.\n\nNext, we need to find three consecutive integers that multiply to give us 210. If we continue our factorization, we can see that 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. So, the three consecutive integers that multiply to give us 210 are 5, 6, and 7.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all five integers: 5 + 6 + 7 + 14 + 15 = 47.\nSo, the sum of those five integers is 47.",
