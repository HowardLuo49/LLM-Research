    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count and see! The first two consecutive positive integers are 14 and 15 because 14 x 15 = 210. \nNow let's find the three consecutive positive integers: 5, 6, and 7 because 5 x 6 x 7 = 210.\nTo find the sum of all five integers we add: 14 + 15 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 47.
