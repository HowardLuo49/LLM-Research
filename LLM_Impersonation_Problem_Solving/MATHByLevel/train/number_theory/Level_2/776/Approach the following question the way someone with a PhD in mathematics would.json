    "solution": "An integer is a multiple of 15 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5.  The multiple of 5 closest to 2009 is 2010, and since $2+0+1+0$ is divisible by 3, $\\boxed{2010}$ is divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the multiple of 15 that is closest to 2009, we can first calculate the quotient of 2009 divided by 15. \n\n2009 \u00f7 15 \u2248 133.93 \n\nSo, the closest multiple of 15 to 2009 is 15 * 134 = 2010. Therefore, the multiple of 15 that is closest to 2009 is 2010.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2010?: To determine the multiple of 15 that is closest to 2009, we can first calculate the quotient of 2009 divided by 15. \n\n2009 \u00f7 15 \u2248 133.93 \n\nSo, the closest multiple of 15 to 2009 is 15 * 134 = 2010. Therefore, the multiple of 15 that is closest to 2009 is 2010.",
