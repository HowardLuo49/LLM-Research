    "solution": "An integer is a multiple of 15 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5.  The multiple of 5 closest to 2009 is 2010, and since $2+0+1+0$ is divisible by 3, $\\boxed{2010}$ is divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we want to find a multiple of 15 that is closest to the number 2009. Let's start by finding the closest multiples of 15 to 2009. \n\n15 x 133 = 1995\n\n15 x 134 = 2010\n\nSo, the multiples of 15 closest to 2009 are 1995 and 2010. Since 1995 is closer to 2009, we can say that the multiple of 15 closest to 2009 is 1995.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2010?: Okay, so we want to find a multiple of 15 that is closest to the number 2009. Let's start by finding the closest multiples of 15 to 2009. \n\n15 x 133 = 1995\n\n15 x 134 = 2010\n\nSo, the multiples of 15 closest to 2009 are 1995 and 2010.
