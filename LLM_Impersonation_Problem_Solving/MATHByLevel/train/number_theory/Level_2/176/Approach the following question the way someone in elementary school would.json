    "solution": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many integers between $500$ and $1000$ contain both the digits $3$ and $4$, we can think about all the possible numbers we could make in that range.\n\nFirst, let's see how many numbers between $500$ and $1000$ contain the digit $3$. The smallest number in the range that contains the digit $3$ is $503$ and the largest is $993$. That means there are $9$ numbers that contain the digit $3$.\n\nNext, let's see how many numbers between $500$ and $1000$ contain the digit $4$. The smallest number in the range that contains the digit $4$ is $504$ and the largest is $994$. That means there are again $9$ numbers that contain the digit $4$.\n\nNow, we need to find how many numbers contain both the digit $3$ and $4$. The numbers that contain both the digits $3$ and $4$ are $534$, $543$, $634$, $643$, $734$, $743$, $834$, $843$, $934$, and $943$. There are $10$ numbers that contain both the digits $3$ and $4$.\n\nSo, the answer is $10$ integers between $500$ and $1000$ that contain both the digits $3$ and $4$.",
