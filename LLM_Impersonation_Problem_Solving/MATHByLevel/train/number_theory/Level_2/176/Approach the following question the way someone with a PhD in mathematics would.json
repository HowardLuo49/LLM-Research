    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many integers between $500$ and $1000$ contain both the digits $3$ and $4$?",
    "solution": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can approach it systematically by considering each possible position for the digits 3 and 4 within the integer. \n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the digit 3 is in the hundreds place and the digit 4 is in the tens place. There are 5 choices for the hundreds place (5, 6, 7, 8, 9), 1 choice for the tens place (4), and 1 choice for the ones place (3). Therefore, there are 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 integers in this case.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where the digit 3 is in the hundreds place and the digit 4 is in the ones place. Similarly, there are 5 choices for the hundreds place, 1 choice for the tens place (3), and 1 choice for the ones place (4). Therefore, there are 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 integers in this case as well.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where the digit 3 is in the tens place and the digit 4 is in the ones place. There are 4 choices for the hundreds place (5, 6, 7, 8), 1 choice for the tens place (3), and 1 choice for the ones place (4). Therefore, there are 4 * 1 * 1 = 4 integers in this case.\n\nAdding up the possibilities from each case, we find that there are 5 + 5 + 4 = 14 integers between 500 and 1000 that contain both the digits 3 and 4.",
