    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. There are 54 chips in a box. Each chip is either small or large. If the number of small chips is greater than the number of large chips by a prime number of chips, what is the greatest possible number of large chips?",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips. From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $2l+p=54$. We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$. Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use a simple mathematical approach by considering the prime numbers starting from the smallest. Let's denote the number of small chips as S and the number of large chips as L. We are given that S = L + P, where P is a prime number.\n\nSince the total number of chips is 54, we have the equation S + L = 54. Substituting S = L + P into this equation, we get (L + P) + L = 54, which simplifies to 2L + P = 54.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest possible value for L under the given conditions. We know that P must be a prime number, so let's start with the smallest prime number, 2.\n\nWhen P = 2, we have 2L + 2 = 54, which simplifies to L = 26. Since there must be one more small chip than large chips, we have S = 27.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of large chips is 26 when the number of small chips is 27.",
