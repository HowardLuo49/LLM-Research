    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. There are 54 chips in a box. Each chip is either small or large. If the number of small chips is greater than the number of large chips by a prime number of chips, what is the greatest possible number of large chips?",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips. From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $2l+p=54$. We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$. Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to find a prime number that, when added to the number of large chips, will give us the number of small chips. Since we want the greatest possible number of large chips, let's start by looking for the largest prime number that is less than 54.\n\nThe largest prime number less than 54 is 53. So if we add 53 large chips to the number of large chips, we will get 54 small chips.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of large chips is 53.",
