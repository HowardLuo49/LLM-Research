    "solution": "The smallest four-digit palindromes have $1$ on each end.  $1001$ is not divisible by $3$, nor is $1111$, but $\\boxed{1221}$ is, so it is the smallest possible.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. So, the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3 must start and end with the same digits, like 1001 or 2002. Let's try to find one that is divisible by 3. Um... 1221 is a four-digit palindrome that might work. 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is divisible by 3! So, the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3 is 1221. Yay, we did it!",
