    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Palindromes are numbers that read the same backwards and forwards, like 5665. What is the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3?",
    "solution": "The smallest four-digit palindromes have $1$ on each end.  $1001$ is not divisible by $3$, nor is $1111$, but $\\boxed{1221}$ is, so it is the smallest possible.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3, we can start by listing out some four-digit palindromes and checking if they are divisible by 3.\n\nThe smallest four-digit palindrome is 1001, but that is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (1+0+0+1) is not a multiple of 3.\n\nThe next palindrome to try is 1111. The sum of its digits is 1+1+1+1 = 4, which is not divisible by 3.\n\nNext, let's try 1221. The sum of its digits is 1+2+2+1 = 6, which is divisible by 3. So, 1221 is the smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3.\n\nI hope that helped! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
