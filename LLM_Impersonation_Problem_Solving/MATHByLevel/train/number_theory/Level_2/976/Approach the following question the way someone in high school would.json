    "solution": "The decimal representation of 1/7 is $0.\\overline{142857}$.  Since 96 is a multiple of 6, the 96th digit after the decimal point is 7, the digit at the end of the repeating block.  The digit four places later is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7, we need to perform long division. \n\nWhen we divide 1 by 7, we get 0.142857142857142857... The pattern of 142857 repeats indefinitely. So the 100th digit after the decimal point would be 4.\n\nTherefore, the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7 is 4.",
