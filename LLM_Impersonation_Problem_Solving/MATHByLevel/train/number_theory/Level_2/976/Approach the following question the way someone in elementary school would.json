    "solution": "The decimal representation of 1/7 is $0.\\overline{142857}$.  Since 96 is a multiple of 6, the 96th digit after the decimal point is 7, the digit at the end of the repeating block.  The digit four places later is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th digit after the decimal point of 1/7, we need to do some math. First, let's divide 1 by 7 to get the decimal representation.\n\n1 \u00f7 7 = 0.142857142857142857...\n\nNow, we can see that the pattern 142857 repeats after the decimal point. So, if we want to find the 100th digit after the decimal point, we should look for where the pattern repeats. Since the pattern has 6 digits, we need to divide 100 by 6 to see how many times the pattern repeats.\n\n100 \u00f7 6 = 16 with a remainder of 4\n\nThis means that the 100th digit after the decimal point is the 4th digit in the repeating pattern, which is 8.\n\nSo, the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7 is 8.",
