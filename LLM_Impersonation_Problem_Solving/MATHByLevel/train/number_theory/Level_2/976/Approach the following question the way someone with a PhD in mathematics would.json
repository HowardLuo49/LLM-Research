    "solution": "The decimal representation of 1/7 is $0.\\overline{142857}$.  Since 96 is a multiple of 6, the 96th digit after the decimal point is 7, the digit at the end of the repeating block.  The digit four places later is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7, we first need to determine the decimal expansion of 1/7. \n\nThe decimal expansion of 1/7 is a repeating decimal with a pattern that repeats every 6 digits. This is because 1/7 in its simplest form is (142857)/999999, where 142857 is the repeating sequence of digits. \n\nTherefore, the 100th digit after the decimal point can be found by determining which digit appears at position 100 modulo 6 in the repeating sequence of 142857. \n\n100 mod 6 = 4. \n\nSo the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7 is the 4th digit in the repeating sequence of 142857, which is 8. \n\nTherefore, the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7 is 8.",
