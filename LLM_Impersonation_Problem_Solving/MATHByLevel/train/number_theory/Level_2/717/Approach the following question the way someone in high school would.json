    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A bag of grapes is to be distributed evenly to 5 kids in a class, and the grapes that are left over will be thrown out. If each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, what is the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out?",
    "solution": "If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number.  On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student.  So $\\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of grapes by the number of kids in the class. Then we find the remainder after dividing to determine how many grapes are left over.\n\nFor example, if there are 35 grapes in the bag (just for easy math), and we are distributing them to 5 kids, we would divide 35 by 5. This gives us 7 grapes per student. However, since each student should receive the greatest possible number of grapes, we cannot have fractions. Therefore, we need to round down to 7 grapes per student.\n\nNow, 7 grapes per student x 5 students = 35 grapes distributed. Since all the grapes are distributed, there are no leftovers in this scenario.\n\nHowever, if we had 36 grapes in the bag, we would divide 36 by 5, giving us 7 grapes per student with 1 grape left over. Therefore, the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out in this scenario is 1.",
