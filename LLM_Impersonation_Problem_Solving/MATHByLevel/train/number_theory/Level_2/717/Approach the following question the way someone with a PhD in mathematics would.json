    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A bag of grapes is to be distributed evenly to 5 kids in a class, and the grapes that are left over will be thrown out. If each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, what is the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out?",
    "solution": "If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number.  On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student.  So $\\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we need to understand the concept of integer division and remainders. \n\nLet's denote the total number of grapes in the bag as G. We want to distribute these grapes evenly to 5 kids, so each kid will receive G/5 grapes. However, since the number of grapes must be an integer, we need to consider the remainder when dividing G by 5. \n\nLet's say the remainder is R. This means that G = 5 * (G/5) + R. Since each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, G/5 will be the largest integer less than or equal to G/5. Therefore, the greatest possible value of R is 4. \n\nWhen R = 4, the number of grapes that will be thrown out is 4 (since we can't evenly distribute them). Therefore, the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out is 4. \n\nIn conclusion, if the bag of grapes is to be distributed evenly to 5 kids and each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out is 4.",
