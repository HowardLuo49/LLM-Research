    "solution": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is $0.\\overline{324}$. When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\\left( 308\\div 3=102 \\ R2\\right)$. Therefore the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the second digit of $324$, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point when $\\frac{12}{37}$ is expressed as a decimal, we first need to perform the long division to find the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$. \n\nWhen performing the long division, we find that $\\frac{12}{37} = 0.324324324...$ with the decimal repeating in a pattern of length 3.\n\nSince the pattern repeats every 3 digits after the decimal point, we can determine the 308th digit by finding the remainder when dividing 308 by 3. \n\n308 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. Therefore, the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the 2nd digit in the repeating pattern, which is 2.\n\nThus, the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point when $\\frac{12}{37}$ is expressed as a decimal is 2.",
