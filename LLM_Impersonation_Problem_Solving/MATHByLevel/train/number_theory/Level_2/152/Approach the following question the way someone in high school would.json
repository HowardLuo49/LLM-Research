    "solution": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is $0.\\overline{324}$. When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\\left( 308\\div 3=102 \\ R2\\right)$. Therefore the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the second digit of $324$, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point in $\\frac{12}{37}$, we need to first convert the fraction to a decimal.\n\nPerforming the division, we get:\n\n$\\frac{12}{37} = 0.324324...$\n\nSince the decimal repeats in a pattern (324), we can determine that the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point will be the 308th digit in the repeating pattern.\n\nTo find the specific digit, we divide 308 by 3 (the number of digits in the repeating pattern) and find the remainder:\n\n$308 \\div 3 = 102 R 2$\n\nTherefore, the 308th digit in the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is the second digit in the repeating pattern, which is 2.",
