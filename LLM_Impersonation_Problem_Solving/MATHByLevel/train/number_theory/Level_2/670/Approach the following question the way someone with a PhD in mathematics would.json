    "solution": "The units digit of $31^3$ is the same as the units digit of $1^3$, which is 1.  The units digit of $13^3$ is the same as the units digit of $3^3$, which is 7.  Therefore, the units digit of $31^3+13^3$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit of $31^3+13^3$, we must first calculate the individual values of $31^3$ and $13^3$ and then find their sum. \n\nFirstly, we note that the units digit of a number is only affected by the units digit of its power. Hence, we can simplify the calculation of the cubes by only considering the units digits of $31$ and $13$. \n\nThe units digit of $31$ is 1, and the cubes of the digits 1 through 9 are:\n\n1^3 = 1\n2^3 = 8\n3^3 = 7\n4^3 = 4\n5^3 = 5\n6^3 = 6\n7^3 = 3\n8^3 = 2\n9^3 = 9\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $31^3$ is the same as the units digit of $1^3$, which is 1.\n\nSimilarly, the units digit of $13$ is 3, and the units digit of $13^3$ is the same as the units digit of $3^3$, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $31^3+13^3$ can be calculated by finding the sum of the units digits: $1 + 7 = 8$.\n\nThus, the units digit of $31^3+13^3$ is 8.",
