    "solution": "Consider the differences between consecutive prime numbers and look for the first difference of 6 or greater.  The first several prime numbers are \\[\n2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, 37,\\ldots,\n\\] and the differences between consecutive terms of this sequence are  \\[\n1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,\\ldots.\n\\] The first appearance of a difference of 6 or greater occurs between 23 and $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing the first five positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now, let's find out if any of these numbers are prime. \n\n1 is not prime because it is only divisible by 1 and itself. \n2 is prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. \n3 is prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 3. \n4 is not prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, and 4. \n5 is prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 5. \n\nSo, the first five positive integers include two prime numbers: 2 and 3. Now, let's find the smallest prime number that occurs after a sequence of five consecutive positive integers, all of which are nonprime. \n\nSince we already have 2 and 3, we need to find the next five consecutive numbers that are not prime. \n\n6 is not prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n7 is prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 7. \n8 is not prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 4, and 8. \n9 is not prime because it is divisble by 1, 3, and 9. \n10 is not prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 5, and 10. \n\nSo, after the sequence of five consecutive nonprime numbers (6, 8, 9, 10), the smallest prime number that occurs is 7.",
