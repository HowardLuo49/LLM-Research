    "solution": "Consider the differences between consecutive prime numbers and look for the first difference of 6 or greater.  The first several prime numbers are \\[\n2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, 37,\\ldots,\n\\] and the differences between consecutive terms of this sequence are  \\[\n1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,\\ldots.\n\\] The first appearance of a difference of 6 or greater occurs between 23 and $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest prime number that occurs after a sequence of five consecutive nonprime integers, we first need to identify the sequence of nonprime integers.\n\nA nonprime integer is an integer greater than 1 that is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the sequence of five consecutive nonprime integers that follow each other will be the numbers immediately after the first five prime numbers.\n\nThe first five prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. The numbers that immediately follow these primes are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10, which are nonprime.\n\nAfter these five nonprime numbers, the smallest prime number that occurs is 13. This is because 12 is not prime as it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and 13 is the next number in the list that is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime number that occurs after a sequence of five consecutive nonprime positive integers is 13.",
