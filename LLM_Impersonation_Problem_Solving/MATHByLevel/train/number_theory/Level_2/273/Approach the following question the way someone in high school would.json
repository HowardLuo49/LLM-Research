    "solution": "Let the desired number be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 4\\pmod 5,\\\\\na\\equiv 6\\pmod 7.\n\\end{align*} The first congruence means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=4+5n$. Substituting this into the second congruence yields \\[4+5n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $6$. Then $n\\ge 6\\implies a=4+5n\\ge 34$. $\\boxed{34}$ is the smallest solution since it is a lower bound of $a$ and satisfies both original congruences.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 7, we can start by listing out numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 5:\n\n4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49, ...\n\nNext, we can list out numbers that leave a remainder of 6 when divided by 7:\n\n6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, 48, ...\n\nWe can see that the number 34 appears in both lists, meaning it satisfies both conditions.
