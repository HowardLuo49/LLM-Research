    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 7?",
    "solution": "Let the desired number be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 4\\pmod 5,\\\\\na\\equiv 6\\pmod 7.\n\\end{align*} The first congruence means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=4+5n$. Substituting this into the second congruence yields \\[4+5n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $6$. Then $n\\ge 6\\implies a=4+5n\\ge 34$. $\\boxed{34}$ is the smallest solution since it is a lower bound of $a$ and satisfies both original congruences.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions, we can set up a system of congruences. Let the integer be represented as x. We want to find x such that:\n\nx \u2261 4 (mod 5) and x \u2261 6 (mod 7)\n\nFrom the first congruence, we can rewrite x as x = 5k + 4 for some integer k. Substituting this into the second congruence, we get:\n\n5k + 4 \u2261 6 (mod 7)\n\n5k \u2261 2 (mod 7)\n\nTo find the solution for k, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 5 modulo 7, which is 3, we get:\n\n3*5k \u2261 3*2 (mod 7)\n\nk \u2261 6 (mod 7)\n\nThus, k can be written as k = 7m + 6 for some integer m. Substituting back into x = 5k + 4, we get:\n\nx = 5(7m + 6) + 4\n\nx = 35m + 30 + 4\n\nx = 35m + 34\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions is x = 34.",
