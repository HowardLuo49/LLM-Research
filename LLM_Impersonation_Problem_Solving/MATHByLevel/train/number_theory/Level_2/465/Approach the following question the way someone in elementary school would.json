    "solution": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit whole number that has a product of 6 for its digits, we need to think about which three digits when multiplied together equals to 6. The digits that multiply to 6 are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTo form the smallest three-digit number from these digits, we would use the smallest digit (1) for the hundreds place, then the next smallest digit (2) for the tens place, and finally the last digit (3) for the ones place.\n\nSo, the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6, is 123.",
