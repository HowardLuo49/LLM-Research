    "solution": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit whole number, we need to start with the smallest digit possible, which is 1. Since the product of the digits needs to be 6, we can try different combinations of digits to find the smallest number.\n\n1 * 1 * 6 = 6, so the number 116 fits the criteria. \n\nTherefore, the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6, is 116.",
