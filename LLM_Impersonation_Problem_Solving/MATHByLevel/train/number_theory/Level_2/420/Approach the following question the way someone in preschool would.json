    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. In a certain warehouse, there are $1335$ boxes, each containing $39$ books.\n\nMelvin's boss orders him to unpack all the books and repack them so that there are $40$ books in each box. After packing as many such boxes as possible, Melvin has how many books left over?",
    "solution": "The total number of books in the warehouse is $1335\\cdot 39$. If Melvin packs $b$ boxes of $40$ books each and has $r$ books left over, then $1335\\cdot 39 = 40b+r$. Thus, what we are looking for is the remainder when $1335\\cdot 39$ is divided by $40$.\n\nWe note that $39\\equiv -1\\pmod{40}$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n1335\\cdot 39 &\\equiv 1335\\cdot (-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv -1335\\pmod {40}.\n\\end{align*}Now we note that $-1335 = -1400 + 65$, and $-1400$ is a multiple of $40$. Therefore, $-1335 \\equiv 65 \\equiv 25\\pmod{40}$, which implies that the remainder is $\\boxed{25}$ books.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's pretend we have a big block tower with 1335 blocks. Each block tower has 39 blocks. Melvin's boss wants Melvin to make new towers with 40 blocks each. So Melvin starts taking blocks from the old towers and making new towers. He can make 1330 new towers with 40 blocks.\n\nBut after making all those towers, Melvin has 5 blocks left over. So, Melvin has 5 books left over in the end.",
