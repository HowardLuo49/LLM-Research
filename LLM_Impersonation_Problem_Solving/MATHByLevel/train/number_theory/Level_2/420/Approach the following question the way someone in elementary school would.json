    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. In a certain warehouse, there are $1335$ boxes, each containing $39$ books.\n\nMelvin's boss orders him to unpack all the books and repack them so that there are $40$ books in each box. After packing as many such boxes as possible, Melvin has how many books left over?",
    "solution": "The total number of books in the warehouse is $1335\\cdot 39$. If Melvin packs $b$ boxes of $40$ books each and has $r$ books left over, then $1335\\cdot 39 = 40b+r$. Thus, what we are looking for is the remainder when $1335\\cdot 39$ is divided by $40$.\n\nWe note that $39\\equiv -1\\pmod{40}$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n1335\\cdot 39 &\\equiv 1335\\cdot (-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv -1335\\pmod {40}.\n\\end{align*}Now we note that $-1335 = -1400 + 65$, and $-1400$ is a multiple of $40$. Therefore, $-1335 \\equiv 65 \\equiv 25\\pmod{40}$, which implies that the remainder is $\\boxed{25}$ books.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to figure out how many books there are in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of books in each box. So, $1335 \\times 39$ equals 52065 books.\n\nNext, Melvin needs to pack these books into boxes of 40. To figure out how many full boxes he can make, we divide the total number of books by 40. $52065 \\div 40$ equals 1301 boxes.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many books are left over. To do this, we subtract the number of books in the boxes Melvin packed from the total number of books. $52065 - (1301 \\times 40)$ equals 25 books left over.\n\nSo, Melvin has 25 books left over after packing as many boxes as possible with 40 books each.",
