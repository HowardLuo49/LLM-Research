    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Winnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.  With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.  Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.  How many balloons does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many balloons Winnie keeps for herself, we first add up the total number of balloons she has: 17 red + 33 white + 65 green + 83 chartreuse = 198 balloons.\n\nThen, we divide this total number of balloons by the number of friends Winnie has (8 friends) to find out how many balloons each friend gets: 198 balloons / 8 friends = 24.75 balloons.\n\nSince we can't give out fractional balloons, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means each friend gets 24 balloons.\n\nTo find out how many balloons Winnie ends up keeping for herself, we multiply the number of balloons each friend gets by the number of friends and subtract that total from the total number of balloons. \n\nWinnie keeps: 198 balloons - (24 balloons/friend * 8 friends) = 198 balloons - 192 balloons = 6 balloons. \n\nSo, Winnie ends up keeping 6 balloons for herself.",
