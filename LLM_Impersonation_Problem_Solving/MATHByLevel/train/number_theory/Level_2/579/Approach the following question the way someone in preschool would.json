    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Winnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.  With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.  Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.  How many balloons does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to count how many balloons Winnie has in total. Let's count together: 17 + 33 + 65 + 83 equals... (counting on fingers) 198 balloons! Wow, that's a lot of balloons!\n\nNow, Winnie needs to share her balloons with her friends. She has 8 friends, so let's try to share the balloons equally. If we divide 198 balloons by 8 friends, each friend will get... (calculating) 24 balloons!\n\nAfter Winnie gives each friend 24 balloons, we need to figure out how many balloons she kept for herself. Let's do some more counting: 198 total balloons minus the 24 balloons she gave to each friend times 8 friends equals... 0 balloons left for Winnie!\n\nSo, Winnie ends up giving all of her balloons to her friends and doesn't keep any for herself. It's nice of her to share with her friends, don't you think?",
