    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Winnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.  With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.  Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.  How many balloons does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first determine the total number of balloons Winnie has in order to distribute them. \n\nTotal number of balloons = 17 (red) + 33 (white) + 65 (green) + 83 (chartreuse) = 198 balloons\n\nSince Winnie has 8 nearest and dearest friends, she will be dividing the balloons into 8 equal groups. This means she will be giving away a number of balloons that is a multiple of 8. \n\nThe largest number less than or equal to 198 that is divisible by 8 is 192. This means Winnie will be giving each friend 192/8 = 24 balloons.\n\nThe total number of balloons given to friends = 24 (balloons per friend) * 8 (number of friends) = 192 balloons\n\nTherefore, the number of balloons Winnie keeps for herself = Total number of balloons - Total number of balloons given to friends\n= 198 - 192\n= 6 balloons\n\nSo, Winnie ends up keeping 6 balloons for herself.",
