    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the digit is a 4, we first need to find the decimal representation of the fraction $\\frac{5}{7}$. \n\nTo do this, we divide 5 by 7 using long division: \n\n$0.\\overline{714285}$\n\nNow, we look at the decimal representation and see that the digit 4 does not appear at all. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting the digit 4 from the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is 0.\n\nThus, the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",
