    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see...we know that $\\frac{5}{7}$ is a decimal number. So if we look at the decimal representation, we have 0.7142857... and it goes on and on forever. If we pick a random digit, we see that the only digit 4 in the decimal representation is the first digit after the decimal point. So the probability of picking a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
