    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that a randomly selected digit of the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is a 4, we can consider the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$.\n\nWhen we divide 5 by 7, we get $0.\\overline{714285}$, where the digits 714285 repeat infinitely. This means that each digit (0-9) has an equal probability of being selected.\n\nSince the digit 4 is just one of the ten possible digits that can be selected, the probability of selecting a 4 is $\\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the digit selected is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
