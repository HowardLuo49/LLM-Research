    "solution": "Noticing that 221 is close to the perfect square 225, we write 221 as a difference of two squares: $221=225-4=15^2-2^2=(15-2)(15+2)=13\\cdot 17$.  The largest prime factor here is $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count and see! The factors of 221 are 1, 13, and 17. Since 17 is the biggest number that can't be divided by any of the other factors, it is the greatest prime factor of 221!",
