    "solution": "First, we have $$53_6=5\\cdot6^1+3\\cdot6^0=33_{10}.$$ and  $$113_b=1\\cdot b^2+1\\cdot b^1+3\\cdot b^0=(b^2+b+3)_{10}.$$ Therefore, we must have $b^2+b+3=33$, so $b^2+b-30=0$. Factoring we have $(b-5)(b+6)=0$. Thus, $b=5$ or $b=-6$. The positive value is $b=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive value of $b$, we need to determine what the number $53_{6}$ is equal to in base 10 and then find what the number $113_{b}$ is equal to in base 10. \n\nIn base 10, $53_{6}$ is equal to $5*6^{1} + 3*6^{0} = 30 + 3 = 33$. \n\nTo find what $113_{b}$ is equal to in base 10, we can set up an equation: \n\n$1*b^{2} + 1*b^{1} + 3*b^{0} = 33$\n\n$ b^{2} + b + 3 = 33$\n\nSince $b$ is a positive integer, we can start by trying $b=5$. \n\n$5^{2} + 5 + 3 = 33$\n\n$25 + 5 + 3 = 33$\n\n$33 = 33$\n\nSo, the positive value of $b$ is $5$!
