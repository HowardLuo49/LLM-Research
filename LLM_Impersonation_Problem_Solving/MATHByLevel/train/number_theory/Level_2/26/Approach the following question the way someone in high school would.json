    "solution": "The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 6, 2, 3. The sum of their reciprocals is $1/1+1/6+1/2+1/3=6/6+1/6+3/6+2/6=12/6=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6, first we need to find all the factors of 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n\nNext, we need to find the reciprocals of these factors. The reciprocals of 1, 2, 3, and 6 are 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6, respectively. \n\nNow, we just need to add these reciprocals together to find the sum. \n1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2.",
