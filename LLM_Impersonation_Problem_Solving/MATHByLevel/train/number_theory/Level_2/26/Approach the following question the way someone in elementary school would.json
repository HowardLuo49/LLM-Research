    "solution": "The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 6, 2, 3. The sum of their reciprocals is $1/1+1/6+1/2+1/3=6/6+1/6+3/6+2/6=12/6=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6, we need to first find the factors of 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n\nNext, we need to find the reciprocals of these factors. The reciprocals are 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6.\n\nFinally, we add these reciprocals together: 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.33 + 0.17 = 2.0.\n\nSo, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2.",
