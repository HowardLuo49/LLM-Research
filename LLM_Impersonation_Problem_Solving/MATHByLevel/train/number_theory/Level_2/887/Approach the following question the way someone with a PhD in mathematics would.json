    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If 52 cards are dealt to 8 people as evenly as possible, how many people will end up with fewer than 7 cards?",
    "solution": "When you divide 52 by 8, you get 6 with a remainder of 4.  Therefore, 4 of the people will get an extra card, bringing their total to 7, while the remaining $\\boxed{4}$ people have only 6 cards.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can first calculate how many cards each person would receive if they were dealt as evenly as possible. Since there are 52 cards and 8 people, each person would receive 52/8 = 6 cards with 4 cards left over.\n\nNext, we can calculate how many people can receive 6 cards without anyone receiving fewer than 6. We can do this by dividing 52 by 6 to get 8 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, 4 people can receive 7 cards (6+1) before anyone receives fewer than 6.\n\nFinally, we need to distribute the remaining 4 cards to the remaining people. Since there are 4 people left and each person can only receive 6 cards, each of the remaining 4 people will receive one additional card. Therefore, the remaining 4 people will end up with fewer than 7 cards.\n\nIn conclusion, 4 people will end up with fewer than 7 cards when 52 cards are dealt to 8 people as evenly as possible.",
