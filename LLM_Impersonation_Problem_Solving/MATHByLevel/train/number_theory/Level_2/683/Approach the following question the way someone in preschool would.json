We know that in base eight, the place values go like this: 1's place, 8's place, 64's place, 512's place, and so on. \n\nSo in base eight, we have 5 ones, 4 eights, and 2 sixties. To convert this to base ten, we can multiply each digit by its corresponding place value and then add them all together. \n\n5 + 4x8 + 2x64 = 5 + 32 + 128 = 165 years old!
