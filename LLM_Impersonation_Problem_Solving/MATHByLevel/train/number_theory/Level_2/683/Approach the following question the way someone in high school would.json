    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. An octopus told me that his underwater cave is $245_{8}$ years old. How many years is this in base ten?",
    "solution": "$245_{8} = 5\\cdot8^{0}+4\\cdot8^{1}+2\\cdot8^{2} = 5+32+128= \\boxed{165}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the octopus said that his cave is $245_{8}$ years old. In base eight, each place value represents a power of eight. So, we can calculate the total number of years in base ten by multiplying each digit by its corresponding power of eight and then adding them all together.\n\nStarting from the right, we have:\n$5 \\times 8^{0} = 5 \\times 1 = 5$\n$4 \\times 8^{1} = 4 \\times 8 = 32$\n$2 \\times 8^{2} = 2 \\times 64 = 128$\n\nNow, we add these values together:\n$128 + 32 + 5 = 165$\n\nTherefore, the octopus's cave is 165 years old in base ten.",
