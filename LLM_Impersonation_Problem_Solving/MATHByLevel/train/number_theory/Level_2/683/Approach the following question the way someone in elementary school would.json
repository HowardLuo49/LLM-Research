    "solution": "$245_{8} = 5\\cdot8^{0}+4\\cdot8^{1}+2\\cdot8^{2} = 5+32+128= \\boxed{165}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember what the number $245_{8}$ means. The subscript 8 shows that it is in base 8, which means the digits are from 0 to 7.\n\nTo convert this number to base ten, we need to multiply each digit by 8 raised to the power of its position (starting from the right side with 0).\n\nSo, $245_{8} = (2 * 8^{2}) + (4 * 8^{1}) + (5 * 8^{0})$\n\n$= (2 * 64) + (4 * 8) + (5 * 1)$\n\n$= 128 + 32 + 5$\n\n$= 165$\n\nTherefore, the octopus's underwater cave is 165 years old in base ten.",
