    "solution": "Note that $16^2 = 256 < 273$ while $17^2 = 289 > 273$.  Since all other perfect squares are farther away from $273$, our answer is the closer of these two, $\\boxed{289}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the perfect-square integer closest to 273, we need to think about what numbers multiplied by themselves will give us a number close to 273. Let's start by looking at the perfect squares of numbers and see which one is closest to 273.\n\nThe square of 16 is 256 (16 x 16 = 256), and the square of 17 is 289 (17 x 17 = 289). Since 273 is closer to 256 than to 289, the perfect-square integer closest to 273 is 16.",
