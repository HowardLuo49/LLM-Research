    "solution": "Note that $16^2 = 256 < 273$ while $17^2 = 289 > 273$.  Since all other perfect squares are farther away from $273$, our answer is the closer of these two, $\\boxed{289}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the perfect-square integer closest to 273, we first need to determine the square roots of the numbers around 273. The square root of 273 is approximately 16.52, which means the perfect-square integers closest to 273 are 16^2 and 17^2. \n\nCalculating 16^2, we get 256, and calculating 17^2, we get 289. \n\nSince 273 is closer to 289 than it is to 256, the perfect-square integer closest to 273 is 289, which is 17^2.",
