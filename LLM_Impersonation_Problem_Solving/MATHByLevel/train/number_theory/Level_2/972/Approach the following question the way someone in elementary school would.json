    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Fifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box. One card is randomly selected. What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's look at the numbers from 1 to 50 to see which ones are both prime and a multiple of 7. The prime numbers in that range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. Among these, the only number that is also a multiple of 7 is 7. So, there is only 1 card that meets both conditions.\n\nThere are a total of 50 cards, so the probability of picking a card that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 1/50.",
