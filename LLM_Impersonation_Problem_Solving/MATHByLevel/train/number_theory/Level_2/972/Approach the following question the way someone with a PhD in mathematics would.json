    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Fifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box. One card is randomly selected. What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to identify the prime numbers between 1 and 50 that are also multiples of 7. The prime numbers between 1 and 50 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. Among these prime numbers, only 7 is a multiple of 7.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a card that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 1/50, since there is only one such card in the box and there are a total of 50 cards.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/50.",
