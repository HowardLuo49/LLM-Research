    "solution": "To find the first year after $2000$ for which the sum of the digits is $12$, take the greatest possible units digit, $9$. $2+9=11$, so take $1$ as the tens digit and $0$ as the hundreds digit. The answer is therefore $\\boxed{2019}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12, we can start by adding the digits of 2000: 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2. \n\nNext, we can add 1 to the year (2001) and find that the sum of the digits is 4 (2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3).\n\nThen we add 1 again and find that the sum of the digits of 2002 is 4 (2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 4).\n\nAfter that, we add 1 again and find that the sum of the digits of 2003 is 5 (2 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 5).\n\nLastly, we add 1 more to the year and find that the sum of the digits of 2004 is 6 (2 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 6).\n\nSo, the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12 is 2009 (2 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 11).",
