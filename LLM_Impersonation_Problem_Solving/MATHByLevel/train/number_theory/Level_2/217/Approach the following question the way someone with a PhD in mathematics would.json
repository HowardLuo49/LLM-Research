    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The sum of the digits of the year 2004 is 6. What is the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12?",
    "solution": "To find the first year after $2000$ for which the sum of the digits is $12$, take the greatest possible units digit, $9$. $2+9=11$, so take $1$ as the tens digit and $0$ as the hundreds digit. The answer is therefore $\\boxed{2019}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the year after 2000 by 2000 + x, where x is a positive integer representing the number of years after 2000. We can then write the sum of the digits of this year as the sum of the digits of 2, x, 0, 0. This gives us 2 + x + 0 + 0 = x + 2 = 12. Solving for x, we find that x = 10. Therefore, the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12 is 2010.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2019?: Let us denote the year after 2000 by 2000 + x, where x is a positive integer representing the number of years after 2000. We can then write the sum of the digits of this year as the sum of the digits of 2, x, 0, 0. This gives us 2 + x + 0 + 0 = x + 2 = 12. Solving for x, we find that x = 10.
