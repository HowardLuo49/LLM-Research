    "solution": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$.",
