    "solution": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. The four smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We need to find a number that is divisible by all of them. Let's start with the smallest four-digit number, which is 1000. \n\nFirst, let's check if 1000 is divisible by 2. Yes, it is because it is an even number.\n\nNext, let's check if 1000 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 1000 is 1+0+0+0 = 1, which is not divisible by 3. So 1000 is not divisible by 3.\n\nThen, let's check if 1000 is divisible by 5. Since the number ends with a 0, it is divisible by 5.\n\nLastly, let's check if 1000 is divisible by 7. 1000 is not divisible by 7 because when you divide 1000 by 7, the remainder is 1.\n\nSince 1000 is not divisible by all four of the smallest prime numbers, we need to try a larger number. Let's try 1050.\n\n1050 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers is 1050! Yay!",
