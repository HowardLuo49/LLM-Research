    "solution": "The prime numbers are $23$ and $29$. Since $29-23=6$, the mean is $\\frac62=3$ numbers away from $23$ and from $29$. The mean is $\\boxed{26}$. We can also find the mean of $23$ and $29$ with $\\frac{29+23}{2}=\\frac{52}{2}=26$ or just by noticing that the number in the middle of $23$ and $29$ is $26$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list, we first need to identify the prime numbers present. \n\nThe prime numbers in the list are 23 and 29. \n\nTo find the arithmetic mean, we add the prime numbers together and divide by the total number of prime numbers in the list. \n\n(23 + 29)/2 = 52/2 = 26 \n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list is 26.",
