    "solution": "The prime numbers are $23$ and $29$. Since $29-23=6$, the mean is $\\frac62=3$ numbers away from $23$ and from $29$. The mean is $\\boxed{26}$. We can also find the mean of $23$ and $29$ with $\\frac{29+23}{2}=\\frac{52}{2}=26$ or just by noticing that the number in the middle of $23$ and $29$ is $26$.",

Prime numbers are numbers that are greater than 1 and can only be divided evenly by 1 and themselves.\n\nOut of the numbers in the list, only 23 and 29 are prime numbers.\n\nTo find the mean of these two numbers, we add them together: 23 + 29 = 52\n\nThen, we divide the sum by the total number of prime numbers, which is 2: 52 \u00f7 2 = 26\n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 is 26.",
