    "gpt_response": "To figure out the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31, we first need to understand how base-eight works. Base-eight, also known as octal, uses the digits 0-7 to represent numbers. \n\nThe base-eight number 31 can be broken down into the digits 3 and 1. To convert this to base-ten, we can use the formula:\n(3 * 8^1) + (1 * 8^0)\n\nCalculating this gives us:\n(3 * 8) + (1 * 1) = 24 + 1 = 25\n\nTherefore, the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31 is 25.",
