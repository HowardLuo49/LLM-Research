    "gpt_response": "To determine the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31, we must understand that the digits in base-eight number systems represent powers of eight. \n\nIn base-eight, the number 31 can be expressed as:\n3 * 8^1 + 1 * 8^0\n24 + 1\n25\n\nTherefore, the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31 is 25.",
