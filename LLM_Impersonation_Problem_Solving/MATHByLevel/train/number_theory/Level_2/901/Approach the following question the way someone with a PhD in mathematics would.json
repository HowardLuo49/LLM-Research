    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct positive factors does 32 have?",
    "solution": "Since 32 is a power of 2, its only factors are the powers of 2 less than or equal to it.  These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, so there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive factors of 32.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the distinct positive factors of 32, we first note that 32 can be expressed as a product of prime factors: \n\n32 = 2^5\n\nFrom the prime factorization, we observe that 32 can be represented as 2 raised to the power of 5. To find the total number of factors, we can use the formula for the number of factors of a given number. \n\nIf a number can be expressed as a product of prime factors as \\( p1^a1 * p2^a2 * p3^a3 * ... * pn^an \\), where \\( p1, p2, p3,...,pn \\) are prime numbers and \\( a1, a2, a3,...,an \\) are the powers to which the primes are raised, then the total number of factors of the number is given by \\( (a1+1)*(a2+1)*(a3+1)*...*(an+1) \\).\n\nIn the case of 32, which can be written as 2^5, there is only one prime factor (2) raised to the power of 5. Therefore, the total number of factors of 32 is calculated as \\( (5+1) = 6 \\).\n\nHence, 32 has 6 distinct positive factors.",
