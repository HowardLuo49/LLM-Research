    "solution": "Since 32 is a power of 2, its only factors are the powers of 2 less than or equal to it.  These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, so there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive factors of 32.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the distinct positive factors of 32, we can list out all the factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. So, 32 has 6 distinct positive factors.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 6?: To find the distinct positive factors of 32, we can list out all the factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. So, 32 has 6 distinct positive factors.",
