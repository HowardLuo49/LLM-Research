    "solution": "Terminating decimals can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{10^b}$. So, we try to get our fraction in this form: $$\\frac{11}{125} = \\frac{11}{5^3} = \\frac{11}{5^3} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3} = \\frac{11\\cdot2^3}{10^3} = \\frac{88}{1000} = \\boxed{0.088}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal expansion of $\\frac{11}{125}$, we can do long division. \n\nFirst, let's set up the long division like this:\n\n```\n        0.088\n  _______________\n125 | 11.000\n         -10\n        _____\n          100\n          -100\n         _______\n             0\n```\n\nSo, $\\frac{11}{125} = 0.088$. This is a terminating decimal because we have a remainder of 0.",
