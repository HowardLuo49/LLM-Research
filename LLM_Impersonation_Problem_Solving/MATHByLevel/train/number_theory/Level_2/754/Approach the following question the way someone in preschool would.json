    "solution": "Terminating decimals can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{10^b}$. So, we try to get our fraction in this form: $$\\frac{11}{125} = \\frac{11}{5^3} = \\frac{11}{5^3} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3} = \\frac{11\\cdot2^3}{10^3} = \\frac{88}{1000} = \\boxed{0.088}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "So, we need to find out what $\\frac{11}{125}$ is as a decimal. First, we can see that 125 does not go into 11 evenly, so we need to add zeros after the decimal point. We can rewrite 11 as 11.000. Now we can see that 125 goes into 1100 eight times because 125 times 8 is 1000. So, the decimal expansion for $\\frac{11}{125}$ is 0.088. Yay!",
