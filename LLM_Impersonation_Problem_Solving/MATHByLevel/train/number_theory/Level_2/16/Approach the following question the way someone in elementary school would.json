    "solution": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of $1100$, we can first find the prime factorization of $1100$. \n$1100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 11$. \n\nTo find the total number of factors, we add $1$ to each of the exponents and multiply them together. \nIn this case, we have $(2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 18$. \n\nTherefore, $1100$ has $18$ distinct, positive factors.",
