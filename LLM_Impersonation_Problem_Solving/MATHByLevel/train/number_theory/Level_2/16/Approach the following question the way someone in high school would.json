    "solution": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the prime factorization of $1100$. We start by dividing $1100$ by the smallest prime number, which is $2$. We get:\n\n$1100 = 2 \\times 550$\n\nNow, we divide $550$ by $2$ to get:\n\n$550 = 2 \\times 275$\n\nNext, we divide $275$ by $5$ to get:\n\n$275 = 5 \\times 55$\n\nAnd finally, we divide $55$ by $5$ to get:\n\n$55 = 5 \\times 11$\n\nPutting it all together, the prime factorization of $1100$ is:\n\n$1100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 11$\n\nTo find the total number of factors, we add $1$ to each of the exponents and multiply:\n\n$(2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 18$\n\nTherefore, $1100$ has $18$ distinct positive factors.",
