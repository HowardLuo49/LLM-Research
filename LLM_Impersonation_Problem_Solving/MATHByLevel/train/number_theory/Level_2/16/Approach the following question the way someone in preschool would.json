    "solution": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$.",
