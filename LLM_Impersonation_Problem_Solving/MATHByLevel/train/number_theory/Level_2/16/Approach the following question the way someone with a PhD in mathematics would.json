    "solution": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct, positive factors of $1100$, we can first find the prime factorization of $1100$. \n\n$1100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 11$\n\nTo find the total number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and multiply the results. \n\n$(2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 18$\n\nTherefore, $1100$ has 18 distinct, positive factors.",
