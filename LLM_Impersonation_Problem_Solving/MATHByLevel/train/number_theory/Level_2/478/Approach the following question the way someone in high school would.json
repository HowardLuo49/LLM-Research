    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors?",
    "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly eight distinct positive factors, we need to think about how factors work. Factors are numbers that can be divided into a larger number without leaving a remainder. \n\nTo have exactly eight distinct positive factors, the number must be in the form of a prime number cubed or a prime number multiplied by another prime number.\n\nThe smallest prime number is 2. If we cube 2 (2^3), we get 8. The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8, giving us a total of 4 factors. \n\nNext, we try multiplying two prime numbers together. The next prime number is 3. Multiplying 2 and 3 gives us 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, giving us a total of 4 factors.\n\nNext, let's try 2^3 * 3. Multiplying 2^3 (8) by 3 gives us 24. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24, giving us a total of 8 factors.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors is 24.",
