    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors?",
    "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly eight distinct positive factors, we can use the formula for the number of factors a positive integer has. \n\nLet the prime factorization of this integer be \\( n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{e_k} \\), where \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k \\) are distinct prime numbers and \\( e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_k \\) are positive integers.\n\nThe number of factors of \\( n \\) is given by the formula \\( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_k + 1) \\). We want this expression to equal 8.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest possible integer, we can start with the smallest prime numbers. Let's try with \\( p_1 = 2 \\) and \\( p_2 = 3 \\). We want the product of the exponents to equal 8. The only way to do this with two prime numbers is for the exponents to be 7 and 1. Therefore, the smallest positive integer with exactly eight distinct positive factors is \\( 2^7 \\cdot 3^1 = 128 \\).",
