    "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. To find the smallest positive integer with exactly eight distinct positive factors, we need to count them. Let's count together: \n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n\nOh, I found it! The smallest positive integer with exactly eight distinct positive factors is 24. Yay!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 24?: Hmm, let's see.
