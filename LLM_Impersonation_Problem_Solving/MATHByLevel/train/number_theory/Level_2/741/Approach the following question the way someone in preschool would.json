    "solution": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let me think about this. I know that the largest three-digit number is 999. Let's see if that works. \n\n9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \n\nOops that's too big. Let's try another number. How about 990? \n\n9 + 9 + 0 = 18 \n\nYay! That works! So the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18 is 990.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 990?: Hmm let me think about this. I know that the largest three-digit number is 999.
