    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18?",
    "solution": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit multiple of 9 with a sum of 18 for its digits, let's first think about what three-digit numbers can have a sum of 18. The three digits of the number have to add up to 18, so they could be 9, 5, and 4, or 8, 6, and 4.\n\nWe want the largest three-digit multiple of 9, so we need to start with the largest digit in the hundreds place. Since 9 is the largest digit possible, let's use that.\n\nNow we have 9 in the hundreds place, and we need to figure out the rest of the digits. Let's use 5 and 4 for the tens and ones places to make sure the sum is 18, and our number will be 954.\n\nNow, we need to check if this number is a multiple of 9. To do this, we can add up the digits of 954 (9 + 5 + 4 = 18), and since 18 is a multiple of 9, we know 954 is also a multiple of 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit multiple of 9 with a digit sum of 18 is 954.",
