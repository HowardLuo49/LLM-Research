    "solution": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18, we can use the fact that the sum of the digits of a multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9.\n\nWe are looking for a three-digit number, so let's express the number as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits, with A being the hundreds digit, B being the tens digit, and C being the units digit.\n\nThe sum of the digits is given to be 18, so we have A + B + C = 18.\n\nSince the number is a multiple of 9, the sum of the digits must also be a multiple of 9. So, we can write the equation A + B + C = 9 * k, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, we can use these two equations to find the largest three-digit number that fulfills these conditions. One way to approach this is to start with the largest value for A (which is 9) and work our way down until we find a valid combination that satisfies both equations.\n\nStarting with A = 9, we have 9 + B + C = 9k, which simplifies to B + C = 9k - 9.\n\nSince B and C are digits, they must be between 0 and 9 inclusive. Therefore, the largest value for B and C that satisfies the equation B + C = 9k - 9 is B = 9 and C = 9. This gives us the number 999.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18 is 999.",
