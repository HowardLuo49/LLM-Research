    "solution": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break it down: A three-digit number is in the form of ABC, where A, B, and C represent digits. The sum of the digits is 18, so we can write the equation A + B + C = 18. Since we want the number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of the digits must also be a multiple of 9. 18 is a multiple of 9, so we're good there.\n\nThe largest three-digit number that fits these requirements will have the largest possible digit in the hundreds place (A) since that will contribute the most to the overall value of the number. Therefore, let's make A as large as possible, which is 9.\n\nNow, since A is 9 and the sum of the digits is 18, this leaves us with B + C = 9. To get the largest possible number, we want B and C to be as small as possible, so let's set B = 1 and C = 8.\n\nPutting it all together, the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18 is 918.",
