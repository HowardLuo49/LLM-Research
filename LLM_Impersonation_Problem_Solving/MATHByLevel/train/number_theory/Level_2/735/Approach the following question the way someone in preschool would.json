    "solution": "The only numbers that have 11 and 8 as a factor are multiples of 88.  If we list the first few multiples of 88: $$88,176,264,352,...$$ we can see that there are exactly $\\boxed{2}$ between 100 and 300.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by counting up by 11 and seeing which numbers are between 100 and 300. \n\nFirst, let's find the smallest number between 100 and 300 that is divisible by 11. That number is 110.\n\nLet's add 11 to 110 to get the next number divisible by 11: 121. \n\nWe'll keep adding 11 and looking at the numbers between 100 and 300 until we find a number that is also divisible by 8. \n\nSo far, we have found that 110, 121, 132, 143, 154, 165, 176, 187, 198, 209, 220, 231, 242, 253, 264, 275, 286, and 297 are all divisible by 11 and fall between 100 and 300. \n\nThe next number that is also divisible by 8 is 176. \n\nSo, the integers between 100 and 300 that have both 11 and 8 as factors are: 132, 176, and 220. \n\nDid that make sense?
