    "solution": "The only numbers that have 11 and 8 as a factor are multiples of 88.  If we list the first few multiples of 88: $$88,176,264,352,...$$ we can see that there are exactly $\\boxed{2}$ between 100 and 300.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integers between 100 and 300 that have both 11 and 8 as factors, we should first find the common multiples of 11 and 8 between 100 and 300. \n\nLet's start by finding the multiples of 11 between 100 and 300. The first multiple of 11 greater than 100 is 110, and the last multiple less than 300 is 297. So, there are 18 multiples of 11 between 100 and 300. \n\nNext, let's find the multiples of 8 between 100 and 300. The first multiple of 8 greater than 100 is 104, and the last multiple less than 300 is 296. So, there are 25 multiples of 8 between 100 and 300. \n\nNow, we need to find the common multiples of both 11 and 8 between 100 and 300. The common multiples of 11 and 8 are the multiples of their least common multiple, which is 88. \n\nWe need to find the multiples of 88 between 100 and 300. The first multiple of 88 greater than 100 is 176, and the last multiple less than 300 is 264. So, there are 2 multiples of 88 between 100 and 300. \n\nTherefore, there are 2 integers between 100 and 300 that have both 11 and 8 as factors.",
