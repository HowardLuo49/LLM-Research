    "solution": "We have $1492 = 1500-8 \\equiv -8\\pmod{500}$ and $1999 = 2000-1\\equiv -1\\pmod{500}$.\n\nTherefore, $1492\\cdot 1999\\equiv (-8)\\cdot(-1) \\equiv 8 \\pmod{500}$. The remainder is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when you divide $1492\\cdot 1999$ by 500, you first multiply 1492 by 1999. This equals 2,982,508.\nThen, you divide 2,982,508 by 500. You see how many times 500 goes into 2,982,508. \n500 goes into 2,982,508 about 5,965 times. \nThen, you multiply 500 by 5,965, which equals 2,982,500.\nFinally, you subtract 2,982,500 from 2,982,508 to find the remainder. \nThe remainder is 8. So, the remainder when you divide $1492\\cdot 1999$ by 500 is 8.",
