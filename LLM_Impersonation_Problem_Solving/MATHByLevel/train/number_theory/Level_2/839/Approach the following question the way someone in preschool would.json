When their sum is subtracted from their product, which of the following numbers could be obtained? $$\n\\text A. \\ \\ 21 \\qquad \\text B. \\ \\ 60 \\qquad \\text C. \\ \\ 119 \\qquad \\text D. \\ \\ 180 \\qquad \\text E. \\ \\ 231\n$$",
    "solution": "There are five prime numbers between $4$ and $18:$ namely $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ and $17.$ Hence the product of any two of these is odd and the sum is even. Because $$xy-(x+y)=(x-1)(y-1)-1$$increases as either $x$ or $y$ increases (since both $x$ and $y$ are bigger than $1$), the answer must be an odd number that is no smaller than $$23=5\\cdot 7-(5+7)$$and no larger than $$191=13\\cdot 17-(13+17).$$The only possibility among the options is $\\boxed{119},$ and indeed $119=11\\cdot 13-(11+13).$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's pick two numbers from 4 to 18, like 5 and 7. We add them to get 5 + 7 = 12 and then multiply them to get 5 x 7 = 35. Then we subtract 12 from 35 to get 35 - 12 = 23.\n\nSo, we can get the number 23 when we pick two prime numbers between 4 and 18.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, we can see that 23 is not an option. So, let's try another pair of prime numbers, like 11 and 13. Adding them gives 11 + 13 = 24 and multiplying them gives 11 x 13 = 143. Subtracting 24 from 143 gives 143 - 24 = 119.\n\nSo, the number that we can obtain is $\\boxed{119}$, which is option C.",
