    "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, we first need to convert $233_{10}$ to base-4.\n\nTo do this, we start by dividing 233 by 4:\n\n$233 \\div 4 = 58$ remainder 1\n\n$58 \\div  4 = 14$ remainder 2\n\n$14 \\div  4 = 3$ remainder 2\n\n$3 \\div  4 = 0$ remainder 3\n\nSo, $233_{10}$ is equivalent to $3221_4$.\n\nNow we can count the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation, which are the digits 1 and 3.
