    "solution": "A cube is divisible by $9$ if the number being cubed is divisible by $\\sqrt[3]{9}=3^{\\frac{2}{3}}.$ Since a perfect cube is the cube of an integer, we need the number being cubed to be a multiple of $3,$ so the cube is of the form $(3n)^3=27n^3$. Since $\\frac{999}{27}=37,$ the cubes we need are $27$ times a cube less than or equal to $37,$ of which there are three. However, $27\\cdot1^3=27,$ only has two digits, leaving $\\boxed{2}$ such three-digit cubes.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to see which three-digit perfect cubes are divisible by $9$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest three-digit perfect cube, which is $10^3=1000.$ \n\nThen, the largest three-digit perfect cube is $22^3=10648.$ \n\nSince we are looking for cubes divisible by $9$, we need to find cubes that are also divisible by $3$, because all numbers divisible by $9$ are also divisible by $3$. \n\nTo be divisible by $3$, a number's digits have to add up to a multiple of $3$. \n\nLooking at the smallest three-digit perfect cube, $1000$, we see that the digits do not add up to a multiple of $3$ ($1+0+0+0=1$).\n\nSo, it is not divisible by $9$.\n\nNext, we look at $22^3$, which is $10648$. Adding its digits together, we get $1+0+6+4+8=19$. \n\nSince $19$ is not a multiple of $3$, $10648$ is also not divisible by $9$. \n\nTherefore, there are no three-digit perfect cubes divisible by $9$.",
