    "solution": "A cube is divisible by $9$ if the number being cubed is divisible by $\\sqrt[3]{9}=3^{\\frac{2}{3}}.$ Since a perfect cube is the cube of an integer, we need the number being cubed to be a multiple of $3,$ so the cube is of the form $(3n)^3=27n^3$. Since $\\frac{999}{27}=37,$ the cubes we need are $27$ times a cube less than or equal to $37,$ of which there are three. However, $27\\cdot1^3=27,$ only has two digits, leaving $\\boxed{2}$ such three-digit cubes.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, we first note that a perfect cube is a number that can be written as $n^3$ for some integer $n$. Furthermore, we know that a number is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$.\n\nLet the three-digit perfect cube be represented as $n^3 = abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. Since $n^3$ is a perfect cube, it follows that $n$ must be a multiple of $10$ (as it needs to have at least three digits). Therefore, $n$ is of the form $10k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nExpanding $(10k)^3 = 1000k^3$, we have $abc = 1000k^3$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the hundreds, tens, and units digits of $abc$, respectively.\n\nFrom the divisibility rule for $9$, we know that $a + b + c$ must be divisible by $9$. Therefore, $1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + k^3$ must be divisible by $9$. This simplifies to $1 + k^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nConsidering all possible values of $k$ from $1$ to $9$ (as $n$ must be a three-digit number), we find that $k = 5$ satisfies the above congruence relation, leading to $n = 50$ as the only three-digit perfect cube that is divisible by $9$.\n\nIn conclusion, there is only one three-digit perfect cube that is divisible by $9, and that is $50^3 = 125000$.",
