    "solution": "A cube is divisible by $9$ if the number being cubed is divisible by $\\sqrt[3]{9}=3^{\\frac{2}{3}}.$ Since a perfect cube is the cube of an integer, we need the number being cubed to be a multiple of $3,$ so the cube is of the form $(3n)^3=27n^3$. Since $\\frac{999}{27}=37,$ the cubes we need are $27$ times a cube less than or equal to $37,$ of which there are three. However, $27\\cdot1^3=27,$ only has two digits, leaving $\\boxed{2}$ such three-digit cubes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the three-digit numbers that are perfect cubes and see how many of them are divisible by 9! Let's start with the smallest three-digit perfect cube, which is $1000.$ If we take the cube root of $1000,$ we get $10,$ which is not divisible by 9. The next three-digit perfect cube is $1331,$ which is the cube of $11.$ Since 11 is not divisible by $9,$ this number is not divisible by 9. The next one is $1728,$ which is the cube of $12.$ And 12 is not divisible by $9.$ After that, we have $2197,$ which is the cube of $13.$ Since 13 is also not divisible by 9, $2197$ is not divisible by 9. We can keep going and check all the three-digit perfect cubes, and we will see that none of them are divisible by 9. So the answer is 0!",
