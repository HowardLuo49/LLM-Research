    "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find all the odd positive numbers between 10 and 110. They are 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and so on until 109. \n\nNow, let's find the product of all these numbers. It's like counting a lot of numbers very quickly by adding them all together. So, 11 times 13 is 143, times 15 is 2145, times 17 is 36465, and so on.\n\nThe units digit is the number that is all the way on the right. So, let's look at the last digit of our product. When we keep multiplying all these odd numbers together, we can see a pattern that repeats. The units digit of the product is always 5. \n\nSo, the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110 is 5! Yay!",
