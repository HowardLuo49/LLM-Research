    "solution": "Since the units digits of $7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 1977$ and $7^3$ are the same, their difference has a units digit of $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the expression $7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 1977 - 7^3$, we can simplify the expression step by step using modular arithmetic.\n\nFirst, let's find the units digit of each individual term:\n1. The units digit of $7$ is $7$.\n2. The units digit of $17$ is $7$.\n3. The units digit of $1977$ is $7$.\n4. The units digit of $7^3$ is the same as the units digit of $7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7$, which is $3$.\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n$7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 1977 - 7^3 = 7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7 - 7^3 = 343 - 343 = 0$\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the expression is $0$.",
