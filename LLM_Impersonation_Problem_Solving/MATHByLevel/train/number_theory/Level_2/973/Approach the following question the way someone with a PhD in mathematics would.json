    "solution": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.",
    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician, we can approach this question by considering the property of the 12-hour clock system. Since a 12-hour clock repeats every 12 hours, we can find the equivalent time 2004 hours from now by finding the remainder when 2004 is divided by 12.\n\nLet's compute 2004 hours modulo 12:\n\n2004 mod 12 = 12(167) + 0\n\nTherefore, the time 2004 hours from now will be the same as the current time, which is 9 o'clock.",
