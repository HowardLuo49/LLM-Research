    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The time right now is 9 o'clock. On a 12-hour clock, what time will it be 2004 hours from now?",
    "solution": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to add 2004 hours to the current time of 9 o'clock. To do this, we can divide 2004 by 12 (since there are 12 hours on a clock) to find how many full cycles of 12 hours we have, which is 167 hours. So that means every full cycle of 12 hours adds up to 9 o'clock again. \n\nNext, we need to find the remaining hours after the full cycles. Since 167 * 12 = 2004, we know we have exactly 0 remaining hours. Therefore, the time 2004 hours from now will also be 9 o'clock.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 9?: Ok, so we need to add 2004 hours to the current time of 9 o'clock.
