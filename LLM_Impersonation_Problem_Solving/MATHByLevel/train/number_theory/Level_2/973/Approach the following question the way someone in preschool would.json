    "solution": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, if it's 9 o'clock right now, we need to figure out what time it will be a looong time from now. Let's count together! 9, 10, 11... oh, this is going to take a while! Let's see, if we keep counting by hours, we'll get to 2004 hours eventually. So, keep counting and when we get to 2004 hours from now, we'll see what time it is!",
