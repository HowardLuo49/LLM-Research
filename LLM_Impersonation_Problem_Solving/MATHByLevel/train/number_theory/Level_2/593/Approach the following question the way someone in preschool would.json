    "solution": "In order to find the product of the two, we first convert both values into base 10. We have that $1001_2=1(2^3)+0(2^2)+0(2^1)+1(2^0)=8+1=9$, and that $121_3=1(3^2)+2(3^1)+1(3^0)=9+6+1=16$. The product of the two is just $(9)(16)=\\boxed{144}$.",

We have $1(2^3) + 0(2^2) + 0(2^1) + 1(2^0)$ which equals $8 + 0 + 0 + 1$ which is $9$.\n\nNext, let's convert $121_3$ to base 10. We have $1(3^2) + 2(3^1) + 1(3^0)$ which equals $9 + 6 + 1$ which is $16$.\n\nFinally, let's multiply $9$ and $16$ to get the product. $9 \\times 16 = 144$.
