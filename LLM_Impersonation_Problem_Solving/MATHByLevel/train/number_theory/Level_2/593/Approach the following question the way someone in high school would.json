    "solution": "In order to find the product of the two, we first convert both values into base 10. We have that $1001_2=1(2^3)+0(2^2)+0(2^1)+1(2^0)=8+1=9$, and that $121_3=1(3^2)+2(3^1)+1(3^0)=9+6+1=16$. The product of the two is just $(9)(16)=\\boxed{144}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To multiply $1001_2$ by $121_3$, we can convert both numbers to base 10, multiply them, and then convert the result back to base 10.\n\n$1001_2$ in base 10 is $1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8 + 1 = 9$\n\n$121_3$ in base 10 is $1*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 1*3^0 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16$\n\nNow, when we multiply $9$ by $16$, we get $144$ in base 10.\n\nTherefore, the product of $1001_2$ and $121_3$ in base 10 is $144$.",
