    "solution": "Reducing each number modulo 8 first, we see that \\begin{align*}\n7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149 &\\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 \\\\\n&\\equiv 15 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{7} \\pmod{8}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8, we can first simplify the sum by combining the terms:\n$$7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149 = 3575 \\times 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 3575 \\times 5 + 15.$$\n\nNow, the remainder when $3575 \\times 5 + 15$ is divided by 8 can be found by noting that $3575 \\times 5$ is divisible by 8 since both 3575 and 5 are multiples of 8. Therefore, we only need to consider the remainder when 15 is divided by 8.\n\nSince 15 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 7, the remainder when $7145 + 7146 + 7147 + 7148 + 7149$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
