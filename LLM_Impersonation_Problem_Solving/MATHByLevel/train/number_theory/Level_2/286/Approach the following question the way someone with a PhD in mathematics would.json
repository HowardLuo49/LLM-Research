    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive factors does 30 have?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5. Thus, there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors of 30. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive factors of 30, we can begin by factorizing 30 into its prime factors. In this case, 30 = 2 x 3 x 5. \n\nFor a positive factor of 30, it can be represented as the product of any combination of its prime factors. Therefore, the total number of factors can be calculated by finding all the possible combinations of the prime factors.\n\nThe number of factors can be calculated by taking the product of one more than the exponent of the prime factor in the prime factorization. In this case, the exponents of the prime factors 2, 3, and 5 are 1, 1, and 1, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive factors of 30 can be calculated as (1+1) x (1+1) x (1+1) = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8. \n\nSo, 30 has 8 positive factors.",
