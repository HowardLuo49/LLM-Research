    "solution": "The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5. Thus, there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors of 30. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive factors of 30, we need to list all the factors of 30 and then count how many there are. The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. So, there are a total of 8 positive factors of 30.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: To find the number of positive factors of 30, we need to list all the factors of 30 and then count how many there are. The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. So, there are a total of 8 positive factors of 30.",
