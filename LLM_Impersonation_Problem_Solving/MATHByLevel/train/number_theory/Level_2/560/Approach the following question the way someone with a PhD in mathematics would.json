    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99.  The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal expansion of $8/11$, we can perform long division as follows:\n\n$8/11 = 0.\\overline{72}$\n\nAs we can see, the repeating block of $8/11$ is $72$, which contains 2 digits. In general, the least number of digits in a repeating block for a fraction $p/q$ is equal to the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$. In this case, we have $10^2 = 100 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, so the least number of digits in a repeating block for $8/11$ is 2.",
