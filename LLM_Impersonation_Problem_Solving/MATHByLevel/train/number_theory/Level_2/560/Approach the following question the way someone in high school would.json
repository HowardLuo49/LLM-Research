    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99.  The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal expansion of $8/11$, we can do long division. When we divide $8$ by $11$, we get $0.\\overline{72}$. This means that the decimal repeats the block of 2 digits \"72\" over and over again. \n\nSo, the least number of digits in a repeating block of $8/11$ is 2, which is the number of digits in \"72\".",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: To find the decimal expansion of $8/11$, we can do long division. When we divide $8$ by $11$, we get $0.\\overline{72}$.
