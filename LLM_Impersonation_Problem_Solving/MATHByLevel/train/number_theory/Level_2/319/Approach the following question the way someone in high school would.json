    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by $33$, it needs to be divisible by both $11$ and $3$.\nFor an integer $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ must be divisible by $11$. For it to be divisible by $3$, then $a+b+c+d$ must be divisible by $3$.\nFor our digits to be as small as possible, we want $a-b+c-d$ to be equal to $0$. So $a+c=b+d$. We set $a+c=b+d=x$. Thus, we also have that $2x$ must be divisible by $3$. The smallest even positive integer that's divisible by $3$ is $6$, so $x=3$. Thus we have $a+c=3$ and $b+d=3$.\nFor a number to be as small as possible, we want the left digits to be as small as possible. The smallest number $a$ could be is $1$, so $c=2$. For $b$ and $d$, we want $b$ to be as small as possible since it's a larger place than $d$, so $b=0$ and $d=3$. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{1023}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 33, we need to start by looking at the smallest four-digit number, which is 1000. \n\nNext, we need to find the smallest multiple of 33 that is greater than or equal to 1000. To do this, we can divide 1000 by 33 to see how many times it goes into 1000. \n\n1000 \u00f7 33 = 30 r 10\n\nSo, the smallest multiple of 33 greater than or equal to 1000 is 33 x 31 = 1023.\n\nTherefore, the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 33 is 1023.",
