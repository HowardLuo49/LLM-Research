    "solution": "Keep up with which days are Thursdays by repeatedly adding 7: November 23, November 30, December 7, December 14, and December 21.  Since December 23 is two days after December 21, it falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out what day of the week December 23 falls on, we can count the number of days between Thanksgiving and December 23.\n\nThanksgiving is on November 23, so there are 30 days in November after Thanksgiving day. Then there are 23 days in December before December 23. \n\n30 days in November + 23 days in December = 53 days\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 53 by 7 to find out how many weeks and what day of the week December 23 occurs on.\n\n53 \u00f7 7 = 7 remainder 4\n\nThis means that December 23 falls on the fourth day after Thanksgiving, which is a Saturday.",
