    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The decimal representation of a fraction ends in $0.\\overline{3}$. When the decimal is changed to a common fraction and reduced to lowest terms, what is the denominator of the fraction?",
    "solution": "Let $S = 0.\\overline{3}$. Then $10S = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the second equation from the first we obtain $9S = 3$, so $S = \\frac13$. The desired denominator is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So, we have a decimal that ends in 0.33333... That means it keeps repeating the 3 over and over again. To change this into a fraction, we'll call it x and subtract it from 10x:\n\n10x = 3.33333...\nx = 0.33333...\n\nNow, subtract x from 10x:\n10x - x = 3.333... - 0.333...\n9x = 3\nx = 1/3\n\nSo, the fraction that represents the repeating decimal 0.333... is 1/3. The denominator of the fraction is 3.",
