    "solution": "Let $S = 0.\\overline{3}$. Then $10S = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the second equation from the first we obtain $9S = 3$, so $S = \\frac13$. The desired denominator is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fraction of $0.\\overline{3}$, you first let x = 0.\\overline{3}. Then, multiply both sides by 10 to get 10x = 3.\\overline{3}. Subtracting x from 10x gives you 9x = 3. So, x = 3/9. Reducing 3/9 gives you 1/3. So, the denominator of the fraction is 3.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: To find the fraction of $0.\\overline{3}$, you first let x = 0.\\overline{3}. Then, multiply both sides by 10 to get 10x = 3.\\overline{3}. Subtracting x from 10x gives you 9x = 3. So, x = 3/9. Reducing 3/9 gives you 1/3. So, the denominator of the fraction is 3.",
