    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, first we need to list out a few odd multiples of 3. The first few odd multiples of 3 are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, and so on. So, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57.",
