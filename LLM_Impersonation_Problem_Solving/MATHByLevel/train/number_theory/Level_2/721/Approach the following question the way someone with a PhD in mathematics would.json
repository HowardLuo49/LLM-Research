    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3?",
    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we first need to determine the pattern of such numbers. Since odd numbers are integers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, and multiples of 3 are integers that are divisible by 3, we are looking for numbers that satisfy both conditions.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of odd multiples of 3 is: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, ...\n\nThe tenth positive integer in this sequence is 51. Therefore, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 51.",
