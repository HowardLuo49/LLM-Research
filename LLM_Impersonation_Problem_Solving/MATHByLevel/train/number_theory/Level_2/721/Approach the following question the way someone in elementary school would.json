    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we can start by listing out the first few numbers that meet these conditions.\n\nThe first odd multiple of 3 is 3.\nThe second odd multiple of 3 is 9.\nThe third odd multiple of 3 is 15.\nThe fourth odd multiple of 3 is 21.\nThe fifth odd multiple of 3 is 27.\nThe sixth odd multiple of 3 is 33.\nThe seventh odd multiple of 3 is 39.\nThe eighth odd multiple of 3 is 45.\nThe ninth odd multiple of 3 is 51.\n\nSo, the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57.",
