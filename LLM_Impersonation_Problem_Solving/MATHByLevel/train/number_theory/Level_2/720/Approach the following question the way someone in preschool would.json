    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Winnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.  With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.  Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.  How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the lollipops Winnie has! She has 45 cherry lollipops + 116 wintergreen lollipops + 4 grape lollipops + 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops. That equals 394 lollipops in total!\n\nNow, Winnie has 11 friends that she wants to share her lollipops with. If she gives each friend the same number of lollipops, we need to figure out how many lollipops she can give each friend.\n\nTo do this, we divide 394 lollipops by 11 friends. That equals 35 lollipops for each friend. \n\nNow that Winnie has given each friend 35 lollipops, we need to figure out how many lollipops she gave away in total. 35 lollipops * 11 friends = 385 lollipops given away.\n\nTo find out how many lollipops Winnie keeps for herself, we subtract the lollipops given away from the total lollipops she has. 394 lollipops - 385 lollipops = 9 lollipops left for Winnie!\n\nSo, Winnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself after sharing with her 11 friends! Yay, Winnie!",
