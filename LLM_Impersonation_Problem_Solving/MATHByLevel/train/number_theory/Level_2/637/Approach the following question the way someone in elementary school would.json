    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Every bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In our first bag, we have 7 pieces left over when dividing among 9 kids. That means each kid got an equal (whole) number of pieces, but 7 were left over.\n\nIf we add two more bags, each bag will also have the same number of pieces inside. So, if we have 3 bags total, then that is 3 equal groups we are dividing among the kids.\n\nTherefore, we have a total of $3 \\times 7 = 21$ pieces left over if we divide the candies equally among 9 kids from 3 bags.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: In our first bag, we have 7 pieces left over when dividing among 9 kids. That means each kid got an equal (whole) number of pieces, but 7 were left over.\n\nIf we add two more bags, each bag will also have the same number of pieces inside.
