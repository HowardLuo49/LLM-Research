    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Every bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In the first bag, there are $7$ pieces left over after dividing among $9$ kids. Therefore, in three bags, there would be $3 \\times 7 = 21$ pieces left over.\n\nSo, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: In the first bag, there are $7$ pieces left over after dividing among $9$ kids. Therefore, in three bags, there would be $3 \\times 7 = 21$ pieces left over.\n\nSo, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids is $\\boxed{21}$.",
