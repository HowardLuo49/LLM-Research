    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards. One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Based on the information provided, Leila has run a total distance of $10 \\times 26$ miles + $10 \\times 385$ yards in her ten marathons. Converting yards to miles, we have:\n\n$10 \\times 385$ yards = $10 \\times 385$ yards / $1760$ yards/mile = $2$ miles + $150$ yards\n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by Leila in her ten marathons is $260$ miles + $150$ yards.\n\nWe can further convert the $150$ yards to miles:\n\n$150$ yards / $1760$ yards/mile $\\approx 0.085227$ miles\n\nSo, the total distance covered by Leila in her ten marathons is approximately $260.085227$ miles.\n\nSince $y$ represents the remaining yards after converting all miles in the total distance, we have:\n\n$y = (260.085227 - 260) \\times 1760 \\approx 150.3792$\n\nTherefore, the value of $y$ is approximately $150.3792$ yards.",
