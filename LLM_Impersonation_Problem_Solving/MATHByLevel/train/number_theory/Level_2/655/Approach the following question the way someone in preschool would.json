One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Leila ran ten marathons. That's a lot of running! If one marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons would be $26 \\times 10 = 260$ miles and $385 \\times 10 = 3850$ yards. But wait! We need to convert the yards to miles. Since one mile is $1760$ yards, we can divide $3850$ yards by $1760$ to find out how many extra miles that is. \n\n$3850 \\div 1760 \\approx 2$ with a remainder of $330$ yards. So, the total distance Leila ran is equal to $260 + 2 = 262$ miles and $330$ yards. \n\nSo, the value of $y$ is $330$ yards.",
