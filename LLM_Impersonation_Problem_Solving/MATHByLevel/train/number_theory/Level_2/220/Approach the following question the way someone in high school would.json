    "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube, we can start by listing out the perfect squares less than 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.\n\nNext, we can list out the perfect cubes less than 100: 1, 8, 27, 64.\n\nNow, we can see that the only positive integer less than 100 that is both a square and a cube is 64.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 positive integer less than 100 that is both a square and a cube, which is 64.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: To find positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube, we can start by listing out the perfect squares less than 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.\n\nNext, we can list out the perfect cubes less than 100: 1, 8, 27, 64.\n\nNow, we can see that the only positive integer less than 100 that is both a square and a cube is 64.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 positive integer less than 100 that is both a square and a cube, which is 64.",
