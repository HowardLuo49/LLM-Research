    "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! One, four, nine, sixteen, twenty-five, thirty-six, and eighty-one. So, there are seven positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube. Yay!",
