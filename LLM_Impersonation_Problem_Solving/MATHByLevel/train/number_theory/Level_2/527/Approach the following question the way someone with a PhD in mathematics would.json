    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.\n\nEvery 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\n\nEvery 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.\n\nThe stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game. How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of fans who received all three free items (a hot dog, a cup of soda, and a bag of popcorn), we need to find the least common multiple of 75, 30, and 50.\n\nThe prime factorization of 75 is 3^1 * 5^2\nThe prime factorization of 30 is 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1\nThe prime factorization of 50 is 2^1 * 5^2\n\nTo find the least common multiple, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers:\n\n2^1 * 3^1 * 5^2 = 2 * 3 * 25 = 150\n\nTherefore, every 150th fan who entered the stadium received all three free items. Since the stadium holds 4000 fans, we divide 4000 by 150 to find how many fans received all three items:\n\n4000 / 150 = 26.67\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a fan, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 26 fans were lucky enough to receive all three free items at the game.",
