    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.\n\nEvery 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\n\nEvery 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.\n\nThe stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game. How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! The Madd Batters baseball team gave out lots of free stuff to their fans! Let's see how many lucky fans got all three free items! \n\nFirst, we need to figure out how many fans got each item. \n\nFor the free hot dog, we need to divide 4000 (total fans) by 75 (every 75th fan gets a free hot dog). 4000 \u00f7 75 = 53.33... So, 53 fans got a free hot dog. \n\nFor the free cup of soda, we need to divide 4000 (total fans) by 30 (every 30th fan gets a free soda). 4000 \u00f7 30 = 133.33... So, 133 fans got a free cup of soda. \n\nFor the free bag of popcorn, we need to divide 4000 (total fans) by 50 (every 50th fan gets a free popcorn). 4000 \u00f7 50 = 80 fans got a free bag of popcorn. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many fans got all three free items. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple of 75, 30, and 50.\n\n75 = 3 x 5 x 5\n30 = 2 x 3 x 5\n50 = 2 x 5 x 5\n\nThe least common multiple is 2 x 3 x 5 x 5 = 150. \n\nSo, every 150th fan got all three free items! Since 4000 divided by 150 is 26.67..., we know that 26 fans got all three free items. Yay for them! They must be super happy!",
