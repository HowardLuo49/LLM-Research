    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.\n\nEvery 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\n\nEvery 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.\n\nThe stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game. How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many fans got all three free items, we first need to determine how many fans got each individual free item.\n\nFor the free hot dog coupon, every 75th fan got one. To find out how many fans got a hot dog coupon, we divide the total number of fans (4000) by 75: 4000 / 75 = 53.33. However, since we can't have a fraction of a fan, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, 53 fans got a free hot dog coupon.\n\nFor the free cup of soda coupon, every 30th fan got one. To find out how many fans got a soda coupon, we divide the total number of fans (4000) by 30: 4000 / 30 = 133.33. Rounding down, we find that 133 fans got a free soda coupon.\n\nFor the free bag of popcorn coupon, every 50th fan got one. To find out how many fans got a popcorn coupon, we divide the total number of fans (4000) by 50: 4000 / 50 = 80. So, 80 fans got a free popcorn coupon.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many fans got all three free items. We can do this by finding the least common multiple of 75, 30, and 50: 150. This means that every 150th fan would have received all three free items.\n\nTo find out how many fans got all three free items, we divide the total number of fans (4000) by 150: 4000 / 150 = 26.67. Rounding down, we find that 26 fans were lucky enough to receive all three free items at the game.",
