    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. For the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.\n\nEvery 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\n\nEvery 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.\n\nThe stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game. How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have to figure out how many fans got all three free things - a hot dog, a cup of soda, and a bag of popcorn. Let's break it down!\n\nFirst, let's find out how many fans got a free hot dog. Since every 75th fan got one, we can divide 4000 by 75 to get 53.33. So, about 53 fans got a free hot dog.\n\nNext, let's figure out how many fans got a free cup of soda. Since every 30th fan got one, we can divide 4000 by 30 to get 133.33. So, about 133 fans got a free cup of soda.\n\nFinally, let's find out how many fans got a free bag of popcorn. Since every 50th fan got one, we can divide 4000 by 50 to get 80. So, about 80 fans got a free bag of popcorn.\n\nNow, let's find out how many fans got all three free items. We need to find the common multiples of 75, 30, and 50. The least common multiple of 75, 30, and 50 is 150. So, every 150th fan would have received all three.\n\nWe can divide 4000 by 150 to get 26.6. However, since we can't have a fraction of a fan, we know that 26 fans received all three free items at the game. Yay for them!",
