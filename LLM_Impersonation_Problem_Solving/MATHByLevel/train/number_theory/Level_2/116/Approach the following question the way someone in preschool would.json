    "solution": "For every divisor $d$ of $12$, then $12/d$ is also a divisor of $12$. Their product is $d \\cdot (12/d) = 12$. It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $12$ such that their product is $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. There are $(2+1)(1+1) = 6$ divisors of $12$: $1,2,3,4,6,12$. Thus, the product of the divisors is given by $12^{6/2} = 12^3 = \\boxed{1728}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of all the positive integer divisors of 12, we need to list all the divisors first. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Now, we need to multiply all these numbers together: 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 6 x 12 = 1,728. So, the product of all the positive integer divisors of 12 is 1,728. Yay, we did it!",
