    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Natasha has more than $\\$1$ but less than $\\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! If we start with 3 dimes, Natasha can put them in stacks of 3 and have 1 left over. That means she has 1 more dime. So we now have 4 dimes.\n\nLet's see if we can still stack them in groups of 3. If we do, we have 1 dime left, just like before! That means we have 1 more dime than 4. So now we have 5 dimes.\n\nLet's try stacking them in groups of 4. We still have 1 dime left over. So we have 1 more dime than 5. Now we have 6 dimes.\n\nLet's check if we can still stack them in groups of 5. Guess what? We still have 1 dime left over! So we have 1 more dime than 6. Now we have 7 dimes.\n\nSo Natasha has 7 dimes! Yay!",
