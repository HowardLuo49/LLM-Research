When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about this. Natasha has between $\\$1$ and $\\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts them in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. That means she has a number of dimes that is 1 more than a multiple of 3. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she also has 1 left over. That means she has a number of dimes that is 1 more than a multiple of 4. And when she puts them in stacks of 5, she has 1 left over again. So, she has a number of dimes that is 1 more than a multiple of 5. \n\nLet's look at some numbers that follow these rules: \n- 4 is 1 more than a multiple of 3 ($3 \\times 1 + 1$)\n- 5 is 1 more than a multiple of 4 ($4 \\times 1 + 1$)\n- 6 is 1 more than a multiple of 5 ($5 \\times 1 + 1$)\n- 7, 8, and 9 are not 1 more than a multiple of 3, 4, or 5\n- 10 is 1 more than a multiple of 3 and 5 ($3 \\times 3 + 1$, $5 \\times 2 + 1$)\n\nSo, Natasha must have 10 dimes!
