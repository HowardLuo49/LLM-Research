    "solution": "Prime factorize $72$ as $2^3\\cdot 3^2$.  A positive integer is a factor of 72 if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are less than or equal to the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of 72.  Also, a positive integer is a perfect cube if and only if every exponent is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, in forming a perfect cube factor of 72, we have 2 choices for the exponent of $2$ (either 0 or 3) and only 1 choice for the exponent of 3 (namely 0).  There are $2\\cdot 1=\\boxed{2}$ ways to make these choices.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive factors of 72 that are perfect cubes, we first need to find the prime factorization of 72. \n72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n\nA perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. In this case, the perfect cubes that are factors of 72 are 1, 8, and 27.\n\nSo, there are 3 positive factors of 72 that are perfect cubes: 1, 8, and 27.",
