    "solution": "Prime factorize $72$ as $2^3\\cdot 3^2$.  A positive integer is a factor of 72 if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are less than or equal to the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of 72.  Also, a positive integer is a perfect cube if and only if every exponent is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, in forming a perfect cube factor of 72, we have 2 choices for the exponent of $2$ (either 0 or 3) and only 1 choice for the exponent of 3 (namely 0).  There are $2\\cdot 1=\\boxed{2}$ ways to make these choices.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many positive factors of 72 are perfect cubes, we first need to find the prime factorization of 72. \n\n72 can be expressed as 2^3 * 3^2. This means that 72 has (3+1)(2+1) = 12 factors in total. \n\nNow, to find the perfect cubes among these factors, we need to consider that a perfect cube must have exponents that are multiples of 3 in its prime factorization. In this case, the prime factorization of a perfect cube among the factors of 72 would need to be of the form 2^(3m) * 3^(3n) where m and n are non-negative integers.\n\nSince 2^3 is the only factor of 72 with a cube exponent, there is only 1 perfect cube factor of 72. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive factors of 72 that are perfect cubes is 1.",
