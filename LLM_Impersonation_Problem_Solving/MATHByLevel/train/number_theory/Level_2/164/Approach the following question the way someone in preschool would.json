    "solution": "Prime factorize $72$ as $2^3\\cdot 3^2$.  A positive integer is a factor of 72 if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are less than or equal to the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of 72.  Also, a positive integer is a perfect cube if and only if every exponent is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, in forming a perfect cube factor of 72, we have 2 choices for the exponent of $2$ (either 0 or 3) and only 1 choice for the exponent of 3 (namely 0).  There are $2\\cdot 1=\\boxed{2}$ ways to make these choices.",
    "gpt_response": "I'm not sure what a positive factor or a perfect cube is, can you help me understand?",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: I'm not sure what a positive factor or a perfect cube is, can you help me understand?",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "Without more information on the specific problem, it is not possible to determine if the final solution is equal to 2. A positive factor is a number that can be multiplied together to give the original number, while a perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as the cube of a whole number. If you provide more details or context, I can try to help you understand better.",
