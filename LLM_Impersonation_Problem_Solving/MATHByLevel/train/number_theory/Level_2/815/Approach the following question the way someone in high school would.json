    "solution": "Since the denominator of $\\dfrac{3}{16}$ is $2^4$, we multiply numerator and denominator by $5^4$ to obtain  \\[\n\\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{3\\cdot 5^4}{2^4\\cdot 5^4} = \\frac{3\\cdot 625}{10^4} = \\frac{1875}{10^4} = 0.1875.\n\\] The digit in the thousandths place is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the digit in the thousandths place of the decimal equivalent of $\\frac{3}{16}$, we first need to convert the fraction to a decimal. \n\nTo do this, we divide 3 by 16. The quotient is 0.1875.\n\nSince the thousandths place is three places after the decimal point, the digit in the thousandths place is 7. \n\nTherefore, the digit in the thousandths place of the decimal equivalent of $\\frac{3}{16}$ is 7.",
