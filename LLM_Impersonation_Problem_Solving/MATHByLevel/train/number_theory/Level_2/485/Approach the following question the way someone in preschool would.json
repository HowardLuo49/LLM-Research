    "solution": "If $x=.\\overline{28}$, then $100x=28.\\overline{28}$. Notice that we can eliminate the repeating decimal by subtracting $.\\overline{28}$ from $28.\\overline{28}$. We have $100x-x=99x=28$, so $x=\\frac{28}{99}$. The repeating decimal can be expressed as the fraction $\\boxed{\\frac{28}{99}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In this question, we need to write the decimal number $\\overline{28}$ as a fraction. To do this, we can think of the decimal as having two parts: the whole number part, which is $28$, and the repeating part, which is $28$. \n\nTo write $\\overline{28}$ as a fraction, we first write the whole number part as a fraction by putting it over $1$: \n$28 = \\frac{28}{1}$.\n\nThen, we need to write the repeating part as a fraction. Since there are two digits in the repeating part, we put it over $99$ (since $99$ is $9$ followed by two nines): \n$\\overline{28} = \\frac{28}{1} + \\frac{28}{99}$.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$\\overline{28} = \\frac{28}{1} + \\frac{28}{99} = \\frac{28 \\times 99 + 28}{99} = \\frac{2772 + 28}{99} = \\frac{2800}{99}$.\n\nSo, $\\overline{28} = \\frac{2800}{99}$.",
