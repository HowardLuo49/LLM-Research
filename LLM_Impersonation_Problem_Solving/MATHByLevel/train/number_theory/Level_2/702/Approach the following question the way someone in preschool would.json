    "solution": "$2^{12}\\times5^8=2^4\\times(2\\times5)^8=16\\times10^8$. $10^8$ has 9 digits, so $16\\times(10)^8$ has 10 digits (1, 6, and eight 0's). Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ digits in the value of $2^{12}\\times5^8$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many digits is in $2^{12} \\times 5^8$, we have to first figure out what that number is!\n\nLet's start by figuring out $2^{12}$. If we start at 2 and multiply by 2 twelve times, we get:\n\n2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 4096\n\nNext, let's figure out $5^8$. If we start at 5 and multiply by 5 eight times, we get:\n\n5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 390625\n\nNow, we have to multiply these two numbers together:\n\n4096 x 390625 = 1606931250\n\nSo, the value of $2^{12} \\times 5^8$ is 1606931250.\n\nNow, let's count how many digits is in this number. There are 10 digits in 1606931250.\n\nSo, the number of digits in $2^{12} \\times 5^8$ is 10.",
