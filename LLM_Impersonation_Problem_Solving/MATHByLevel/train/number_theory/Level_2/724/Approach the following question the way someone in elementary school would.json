    "solution": "Produce an exhaustive list of the pairs of factors which multiply to give 60, as well as the sum and the difference of each pair of factors.  \\begin{tabular}{ccc}\nFactors & Sum & Difference \\\\ \\hline\n(1,60) & 61 & 59 \\\\\n(2,30) & 32 & 28 \\\\\n(3,20) & 23 & 17 \\\\\n(4,15) & 19 & 11 \\\\\n(5,12) & 17 & 7 \\\\\n(6,10) & 16 & 4\n\\end{tabular} The only number which appears in both the second column and the third column is 17.

    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to figure out what numbers can multiply together to make 60. Hmm, let's see, 1 times 60 is 60, 2 times 30 is 60, 3 times 20 is 60, 4 times 15 is 60, and 5 times 12 is 60. \n\nLet's try 1 and 60 first. Oh wait, but they have to be distinct positive integers, so that won't work.\n\nNext, let's try 2 and 30. Ok, so $A = 30$ and $B = 2$. \n\nNow let's figure out what numbers can multiply together to make 60 for $C$ and $D$. Hmm, well since $C$ and $D$ have to be distinct positive integers and $C + D = A - B$, we have to look for a pair of numbers that add up to 28 (since $A = 30$ and $B =2$). \n\nLet's try 28 and 0. Oh wait, $C$ and $D$ can't be 0, they have to be positive integers. \n\nLet's try 27 and 1. Yes, that works! So $C = 27$ and $D = 1$. \n\nTherefore, $A$ is equal to 30.",
