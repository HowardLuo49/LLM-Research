    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember our numbers! We have $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. They are all different and positive.\n\nNext, we know that $A$ times $B$ equals $60$. So that means when you multiply $A$ and $B$ together, you get $60. And $C$ times $D$ also equals $60. \n\nLastly, we know that when you subtract $B$ from $A$, you get the same number as when you add $C$ to $D$. That means $A - B = C + D$.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the value of $A$. Since $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are all different and positive integers, we can try different combinations of factors of $60$.\n\nBy checking different combinations, we find that $A = 12$, $B = 5$, $C = 6$, and $D = 10$ satisfies all the conditions given in the question. So, the value of $A$ is $12$. Yay!",
