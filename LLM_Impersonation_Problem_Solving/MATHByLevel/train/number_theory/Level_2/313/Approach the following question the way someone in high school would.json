    "solution": "We compute the powers of 5 modulo 1000: \\begin{align*}\n5^0&\\equiv1\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^1&\\equiv5\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^2&\\equiv25\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^3&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^4&\\equiv625\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^5&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\n\\end{align*} This pattern repeats every two terms starting at the 4th term.  In particular, when $n>2$, and $n$ is odd,  \\[5^n\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\\] Therefore the rightmost digit of $5^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{125}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$, we need to focus on the last three digits of the number.\n\nFirst, we can notice a pattern as we calculate the powers of 5: $5^1 = 5$, $5^2 = 25$, $5^3 = 125$, $5^4 = 625$, $5^5 = 3125$, and so on.\n\nSince we are looking for the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$, we only need to focus on the last three digits as we calculate. \n\nNow, let's find the remainder when $1993$ is divided by $4$. Since we know the pattern of powers of 5 repeats every 4 numbers, we can just find the remainder when 1993 is divided by 4. \n\n$1993 \\div 4 = 498 R 1$\n\nTherefore, the power that we need to find is $5^1$, which is 5.\n\nSo, the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$ are 005.",
