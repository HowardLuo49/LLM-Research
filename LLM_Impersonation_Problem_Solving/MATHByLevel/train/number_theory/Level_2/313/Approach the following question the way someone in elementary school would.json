    "solution": "We compute the powers of 5 modulo 1000: \\begin{align*}\n5^0&\\equiv1\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^1&\\equiv5\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^2&\\equiv25\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^3&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^4&\\equiv625\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^5&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\n\\end{align*} This pattern repeats every two terms starting at the 4th term.  In particular, when $n>2$, and $n$ is odd,  \\[5^n\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\\] Therefore the rightmost digit of $5^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{125}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$, we first need to figure out what happens to the last three digits as we keep multiplying by 5.\n\nIf we start with 5 and keep multiplying by 5, we get:\n$5^1 = 5$\n$5^2 = 25$\n$5^3 = 125$\n$5^4 = 625$\n$5^5 = 3125$\n\nWe can see that the pattern for the last three digits is: 5, 25, 125, 625, 125. \n\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers of 5, we need to find what 1993 divided by 4 is and what the remainder is. \n\n1993 divided by 4 is 498 with a remainder of 1. \n\nThis means that $5^{1993}$ will have the same last three digits as $5^1$, which is 125.\n\nSo, the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$ is 125.",
