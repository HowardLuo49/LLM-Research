    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find a 9-heavy number that is greater than 5 when divided by 9! Let's count and try different numbers. \n\nStart by seeing if 100 is 9-heavy. When we divide 100 by 9, we get a remainder of 1. That's not greater than 5, so 100 is not 9-heavy.\n\nLet's try 101. When we divide 101 by 9, we get a remainder of 2. That's still not greater than 5, so 101 is not 9-heavy.\n\nLet's keep trying! The next number is 102. When we divide 102 by 9, we get a remainder of 3. That's still not greater than 5, so 102 is not 9-heavy.\n\nLet's try 103. When we divide 103 by 9, we get a remainder of 4. That's still not greater than 5, so 103 is not 9-heavy.\n\nLet's try 104. When we divide 104 by 9, we get a remainder of 5. That's not greater than 5, so 104 is not 9-heavy.\n\nLet's try 105. When we divide 105 by 9, we get a remainder of 6. That's greater than 5! So, the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number is 105. Yay!",
