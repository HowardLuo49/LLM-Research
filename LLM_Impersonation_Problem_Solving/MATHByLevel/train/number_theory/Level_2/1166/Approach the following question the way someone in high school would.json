    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number, we need to start by looking at the smallest three-digit numbers and check if they are 9-heavy when divided by 9.\n\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100. When we divide 100 by 9, the remainder is 1, which is not greater than 5. So, 100 is not 9-heavy.\n\nThe next smallest three-digit number is 101. When we divide 101 by 9, the remainder is 2, which is not greater than 5. So, 101 is not 9-heavy.\n\nContinuing this process, we find that the next three-digit number, 102, when divided by 9, has a remainder of 3. Also, 103 has a remainder of 4 when divided by 9. However, when we get to the number 104 and divide it by 9, the remainder is 5 which is greater than 5. Therefore, the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number is 104.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is 104.",
