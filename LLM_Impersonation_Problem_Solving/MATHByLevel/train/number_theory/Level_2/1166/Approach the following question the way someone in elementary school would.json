    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number, we need to find a number that is greater than 100 and when divided by 9 has a remainder greater than 5.\n\nLet's start with the smallest three-digit number, which is 100. When we divide 100 by 9, we get a remainder of 1, which is less than 5.\n\nNext, let's try 101. When we divide 101 by 9, we get a remainder of 2, which is also less than 5.\n\nLet's try 102. When we divide 102 by 9, we get a remainder of 3, which is still less than 5.\n\nLet's try 103. When we divide 103 by 9, we get a remainder of 4, which is still less than 5.\n\nLet's try 104. When we divide 104 by 9, we get a remainder of 5, which is still less than 5.\n\nNow we try 105. When we divide 105 by 9, we get a remainder of 6, which is greater than 5! So, the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number is 105.",
