    "solution": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by looking for two-digit numbers and switching their digits. The smallest two-digit number we can start with is 10. If we switch the digits, we get 01. Now let's add 3 to 01, which gives us 04. That is not equal to 20, so let's try another number.\n\nLet's try 11. If we switch the digits, we get 11 again. If we add 3 to 11, we get 14. That is also not equal to 22, so let's try another number.\n\nLet's try 12. If we switch the digits, we get 21. If we add 3 to 21, we get 24. That is not equal to 2 times 12, which is 24. So, the smallest two-digit integer $n$ that satisfies the condition is 12.",
