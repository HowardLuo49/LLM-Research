    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest two-digit integer $n$ such that switching its digits and then adding 3 results in $2n$?",
    "solution": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the tens digit of the integer $n$ be denoted by $a$ and the units digit be denoted by $b$. \n\nTherefore, the number can be represented as $n = 10a + b$.\n\nWhen the digits are switched, the new number becomes $10b + a$.\n\nAdding 3 to this new number gives $10b + a + 3$.\n\nAccording to the given condition, this sum should be equal to twice the original number $n$, i.e., $2(10a + b)$.\n\nTherefore, we have the equation $10b + a + 3 = 20a + 2b$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $9a - 8b = 3$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are single-digit integers and $a$ must be at least 1, we can test values of $a$ and $b$ to find the smallest possible solution.\n\nThe smallest solution is $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, which gives $n = 12$. \n\nHence, the smallest two-digit integer that satisfies the given conditions is $n = 12$.",
