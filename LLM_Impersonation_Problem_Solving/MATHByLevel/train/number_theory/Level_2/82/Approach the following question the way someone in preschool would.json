    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. What is the smallest two-digit integer $n$ such that switching its digits and then adding 3 results in $2n$?",
    "solution": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see. We have to find a two-digit number $n$. First, let's switch the digits of $n$. This means if $n$ is written as \"ab\", then we switch the digits to get \"ba\". So, if the original number is $10a + b$, then the switched number is $10b + a$.\n\nNow we are told to add 3 to this switched number and get 2 times the original number, $2n$. So, our equation is:\n\n$10b + a + 3 = 2(10a + b)$\n\nLet's try different values of $a$ and $b$ until we find the smallest two-digit number that satisfies this equation. Remember, $a$ and $b$ are digits, so they can only be between 0 and 9.\n\nLet's try $a = 1$ and $b = 0$:\n$10(0) + 1 + 3 = 2(10(1) + 0)$\n$1 + 3 = 2(10)$\n$4 = 20$\n\nOops, that doesn't work! Let's try increasing $b$.\n\nLet's try $a = 1$ and $b = 1$:\n$10(1) + 1 + 3 = 2(10(1) + 1)$\n$10 + 1 + 3 = 2(11)$\n$14 = 22$\n\nHmm, still not right. Let's try increasing $b$ again.\n\nLet's try $a = 1$ and $b = 2$:\n$10(2) + 1 + 3 = 2(10(1) + 2)$\n$20 + 1 + 3 = 2(12)$\n$24 = 24$\n\nYay, we found it! The smallest two-digit number $n$ that satisfies the equation is 24. Great job!",
