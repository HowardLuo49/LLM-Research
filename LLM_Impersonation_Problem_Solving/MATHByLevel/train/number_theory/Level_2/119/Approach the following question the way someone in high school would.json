    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the smallest possible class size for this physical education class, we need to think about the numbers that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nWe know that there are over 30 students in the class, so we can start by trying to find a number that is divisible by 4 (since there are four rows) and has three equal groups of students and one group with one more student.\n\nLet's start with the smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than 30: 32. If we divide 32 by 4, we get 8 students per row. Three rows with 8 students each gives us a total of 24 students, leaving one row with 8 + 1 = 9 students. \n\nSo, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is 32 students, with three rows of 8 students each and one row of 9 students.",
