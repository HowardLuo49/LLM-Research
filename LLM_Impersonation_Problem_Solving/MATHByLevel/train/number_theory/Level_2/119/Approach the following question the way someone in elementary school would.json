    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's think about this. We know that there are over 30 students in the class and they're lining up in four rows. Three of the rows have the same number of students and one row has one more student than the other three rows.\n\nIf we want to have the smallest possible class size, we need to make sure that the number of students in each row is as small as possible. Since three rows have the same number of students, we want to divide the total number of students by 3 to find out how many students are in each of those three rows.\n\nLet's start by finding a number that is divisible by 3 and has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. The smallest number that fits this criteria is 31. If we divide 31 by 4, we get 7 remainder 3. This means that three rows have 7 students each and one row has 8 students.\n\nSo, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is 31 students with three rows having 7 students each and one row having 8 students.",
