    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of the fraction $\\frac{1}{129}$?",
    "solution": "If we multiply this fraction by 10, we do not change any of the digits; we simply shift all the digits one place to the left. Therefore, if we multiply the fraction by a sufficiently large power of 10, then the first digit obtained when dividing by 129 will be the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$. Observing that $100 < 129 < 1000$, we compute $\\frac{1000}{129}=7 \\frac{97}{129}$. So the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of the fraction $\\frac{1}{129}$, we need to convert it to a decimal. To do this, we can perform long division.\n\nWhen we divide 1 by 129, we get 0.00775. So, the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point is 7.",
