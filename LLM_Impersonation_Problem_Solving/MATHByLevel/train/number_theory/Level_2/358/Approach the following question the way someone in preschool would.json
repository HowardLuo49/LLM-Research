The beads are strung in the following order: one red, one orange, two yellow, one green, and one blue. Then the pattern repeats starting again with one red bead. If the first bead of the necklace is red, what is the color of the last bead used to make the necklace?",
    "solution": "The pattern repeats every $1+1+2+1+1=6$ beads. Since $72=6\\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern). The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\\boxed{\\text{orange}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count the beads together! We start with one red bead, then one orange bead, then two yellow beads, then one green bead, and one blue bead. Then we go back to one red bead and continue the pattern. So, if we keep going until we have 74 beads on the string, the last bead will be blue. Yay, we did it! Blue is the color of the last bead on the necklace. Good job!",
