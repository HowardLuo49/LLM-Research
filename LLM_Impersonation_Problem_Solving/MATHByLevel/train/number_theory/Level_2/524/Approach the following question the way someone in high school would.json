    "solution": "If our number is $n$, then $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$.  This tells us that  \\[3n - 7 = n + n + n - 7 \\equiv 6 - 0 \\pmod 7.\\]The remainder is $\\boxed{6}$ when the number is divided by $7.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so the first thing we know is that when the number is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. This means that the number can be represented as 7n + 2, where n is the quotient.\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7. Let's call the original number x. So, three times the number would be 3x and three times the number minus 7 would be 3x - 7.\n\nNow, if we substitute 7n + 2 for x in the expression 3x - 7, we get: 3(7n + 2) - 7 = 21n + 6 - 7 = 21n - 1.\n\nSo, when 3x - 7 is divided by 7, the remainder is -1, or we can think of it as 6. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7 is 6.",
