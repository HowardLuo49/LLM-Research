    "solution": "If our number is $n$, then $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$.  This tells us that  \\[3n - 7 = n + n + n - 7 \\equiv 6 - 0 \\pmod 7.\\]The remainder is $\\boxed{6}$ when the number is divided by $7.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer to this question, let's start by learning about division. When we divide a number by another number, we see how many times the second number fits into the first number and what is left over, which is called the remainder. \n\nFor example, if we have the number 9 and we divide it by 4, we see that 4 fits into 9 two times with a remainder of 1. So, the remainder is the leftover part that doesn't fit evenly into the number we are dividing by.\n\nNow, in the problem we are given, when we divide a number by 7, the remainder is 2. This means that when we divide the number by 7, 2 is left over. \n\nNext, we need to find out what the remainder is when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7. This may sound a bit tricky, but we can break it down step by step.\n\nLet's say our number is 9. When we multiply 9 by 3, we get 27. Then, if we subtract 7 from 27, we get 20. Now, if we divide 20 by 7, we see that 7 goes into 20 two times with a remainder of 6.\n\nSo, the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7 is 6.\n\nGreat job learning about remainders and division! Keep practicing and soon you will be a math whiz!",
