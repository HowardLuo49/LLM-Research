    "solution": "If our number is $n$, then $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$.  This tells us that  \\[3n - 7 = n + n + n - 7 \\equiv 6 - 0 \\pmod 7.\\]The remainder is $\\boxed{6}$ when the number is divided by $7.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the original number as x. According to the given information, x \u2261 2 (mod 7), which means x leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7. \n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 3x - 7 is divided by 7, in other words, (3x - 7) mod 7. Using properties of modular arithmetic, we can rewrite this expression as (3x mod 7 - 7 mod 7) mod 7. \n\nSince 7 mod 7 = 0, the expression simplifies to (3x mod 7 - 0) mod 7 = 3x mod 7. \n\nNow, we know that x \u2261 2 (mod 7), so x can be expressed as x = 7k + 2, where k is an integer. \n\nSubstitute x in the expression 3x mod 7:\n3x mod 7 = 3(7k + 2) mod 7 = 21k + 6 mod 7 = 6 mod 7\n\nTherefore, the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7 is 6.",
