    "solution": "We notice that 16 divides $78+82$ as well as $79+81$ and also 80.  Therefore the sum is congruent to  \\[75+76+77\\pmod{16}.\\]Since these numbers are congruent to $-5$, $-4$, and $-3$ modulo 16, this can be computed as  \\[-5-4-3\\equiv-12\\pmod{16}.\\]Finally, since $-12\\equiv4\\pmod{16}$ the remainder we seek is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the numbers and see how many we have. We have 8 numbers to add. Now let's add them all up: 75 + 76 + 77 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 82. Let's count on our fingers: 75 plus 76 equals 151, plus 77 equals 228, plus 78 equals 306, plus 79 equals 385, plus 80 equals 465, plus 81 equals 546, plus 82 equals 628. We got 628! Now, let's divide 628 by 16. Let's see how many times 16 can fit into 628: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, 240, 256, 272, 288, 304, 320, 336, 352, 368, 384, 400, 416, 432, 448, 464, 480, 496, 512, 528, 544, 560, 576, 592, 608, 624, 640. So, 16 can fit into 628, but not 40 times. How many times can it fit? We found out it can fit 39 times with a remainder of 4. So, the remainder when we divide the sum by 16 is 4.
