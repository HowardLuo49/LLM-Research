    "solution": "We notice that 16 divides $78+82$ as well as $79+81$ and also 80.  Therefore the sum is congruent to  \\[75+76+77\\pmod{16}.\\]Since these numbers are congruent to $-5$, $-4$, and $-3$ modulo 16, this can be computed as  \\[-5-4-3\\equiv-12\\pmod{16}.\\]Finally, since $-12\\equiv4\\pmod{16}$ the remainder we seek is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, to find the remainder when the sum \\[75+76+77+78+79+80+81+82\\] is divided by 16, we first add up all the numbers: \\[75+76+77+78+79+80+81+82 = 628\\].\n\nNow, we divide 628 by 16. \n\nWhen we divide 628 by 16, we get a quotient of 39 and a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, the remainder when the sum \\[75+76+77+78+79+80+81+82\\] is divided by 16 is 4.",
