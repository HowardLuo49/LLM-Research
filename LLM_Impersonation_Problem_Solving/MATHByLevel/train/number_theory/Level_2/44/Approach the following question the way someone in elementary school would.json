    "solution": "We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\\cdot t \\equiv 36\\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\\cdot t \\equiv 324 \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \\equiv -24\\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\\boxed{76}$. Indeed, we can check that $11\\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, first we need to figure out what number we can multiply by 11 to get the last two digits to be 36. Let's start by finding the multiples of 11: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, 121, 132, 143, 154, 165, 176, 187, 198, 209, 220...\n\nWe can see that 154 is the first multiple of 11 that ends in 4. If we multiply 154 by 11, we get 1694, which ends in 36. So our unique two-digit positive integer $t$ is 154.",
