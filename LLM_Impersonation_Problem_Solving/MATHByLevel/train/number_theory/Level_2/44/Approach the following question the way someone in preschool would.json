    "solution": "We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\\cdot t \\equiv 36\\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\\cdot t \\equiv 324 \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \\equiv -24\\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\\boxed{76}$. Indeed, we can check that $11\\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! When we multiply 11 by a two-digit number, the last two digits of the result will just be the last two digits of the product of the ones digits of 11 and the two-digit number. \n\nIn this case, the ones digit of 11 is 1, and we want the last two digits of the product to be 36. So, we need to find a two-digit number that, when multiplied by 1, gives us 36.\n\nCan you think of a number that we can multiply by 1 to get 36?
