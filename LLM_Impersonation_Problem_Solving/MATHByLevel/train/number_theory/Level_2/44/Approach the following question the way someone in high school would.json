    "solution": "We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\\cdot t \\equiv 36\\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\\cdot t \\equiv 324 \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \\equiv -24\\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\\boxed{76}$. Indeed, we can check that $11\\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that the last two digits of $11\\cdot t$ are $36$. This means that when we multiply $11$ by $t$, the resulting number ends in $36$. So, let's think about what happens when we multiply a two-digit number by $11. \n\nWhen we multiply a two-digit number by $11$, we get a three-digit number where the first digit is the sum of the two digits in the original number. So, if the last two digits of $11\\cdot t$ are $36$, that means the first digit of the product must be $3$.\n\nSince the product of $11$ and $t$ ends in $36$ and starts with $3$, this means that $11\\cdot t = 336$. To find $t$, we just need to divide $336$ by $11$. \n\n$336 \\div 11 = 30$\n\nSo, the two-digit positive integer $t$ is $30$.",
