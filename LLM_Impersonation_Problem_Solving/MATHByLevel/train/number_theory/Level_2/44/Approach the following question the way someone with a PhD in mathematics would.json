    "solution": "We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\\cdot t \\equiv 36\\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\\cdot t \\equiv 324 \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \\equiv -24\\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\\boxed{76}$. Indeed, we can check that $11\\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the unique two-digit positive integer $t$ such that the last two digits of $11\\cdot t$ are $36$, we need to solve the congruence $11t \\equiv 36 \\pmod{100}$. \n\nSince $11$ and $100$ are relatively prime, we can reduce the congruence $11t \\equiv 36 \\pmod{100}$ to the equation $11t \\equiv 36 \\pmod{100}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $11$ modulo $100$.
