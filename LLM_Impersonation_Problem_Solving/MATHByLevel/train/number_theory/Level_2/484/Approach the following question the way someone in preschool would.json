    "solution": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let's see. A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself. So, let's think of some prime numbers... like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. \n\nTo find the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes, we need to multiply three different prime numbers together. \n\nLet's start with the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, and 5. If we multiply them together, we get 2 x 3 x 5 = 30. And 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5. \n\nSo, the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes is 30! Yay, we did it!",
