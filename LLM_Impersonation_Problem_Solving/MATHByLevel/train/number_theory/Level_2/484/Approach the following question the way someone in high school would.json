    "solution": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes, we need to identify the smallest primes possible and multiply them together. \n\nThe smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Since we need three distinct primes, we can choose the first three primes: 2, 3, and 5. \n\nTo find the least positive integer that is divisible by these three primes, we multiply them together:\n\n2 x 3 x 5 = 30\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes is 30.",
