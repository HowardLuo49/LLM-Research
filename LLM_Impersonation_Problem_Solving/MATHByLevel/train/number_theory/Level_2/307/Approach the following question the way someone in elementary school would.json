    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. It is now 12:00:00 midnight, as read on a 12-hour digital clock. In 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds the time will be $A:B:C$. What is the value of $A + B + C$?",
    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to figure out what the time will be in 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds. First, let's break it down:\n\n- 122 hours is the same as 5 days and 2 hours (Because there are 24 hours in a day)\n- 39 minutes is, well, 39 minutes\n- 44 seconds is 44 seconds\n\nNow, let's add that time to midnight:\n\n- Adding 5 days to midnight brings us to midnight again\n- Adding 2 hours brings us to 2:00:00 AM\n- Adding 39 minutes brings us to 2:39:00 AM\n- Adding 44 seconds brings us to 2:39:44 AM\n\nSo, when 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds have passed since midnight, the time will be 2:39:44 AM.\n\nNow, to find the sum of A, B, and C, we need to add 2 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 4, which equals 22.\n\nSo, the value of A + B + C is 22.",
