    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",

We need to add 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds. \n\nFirst, let's add the hours:\n12 + 122 = 134\n\nNext, let's add the minutes:\n0 + 39 = 39\n\nNow, let's add the seconds:\n0 + 44 = 44\n\nSo, the time will be 134:39:44. \n\nTo find the sum of $A + B + C$, we need to add the digits in each position:\n1 + 3 + 4 = 8\n3 + 9 = 12 which further adds to 1 + 2 = 3\n4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, $A + B + C = 8 + 3 + 8 = 19$. \n\nYay, we did it!",
