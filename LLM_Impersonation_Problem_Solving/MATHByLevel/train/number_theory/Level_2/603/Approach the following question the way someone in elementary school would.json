The number of students in Teresa's graduating class is more than 50 and fewer than 100 and is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5. How many students are in Teresa's graduating class?",
    "solution": "Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv -1\\equiv 2\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv -2\\equiv 2\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv -3\\equiv 2\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv 2\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 2\\pmod{60}$. Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\\boxed{62}$.",

So, let's think of the numbers between these two ranges. \n\nNext, we know that the number is 1 less than a multiple of 3. This means we need to find a number that is just one less than a number that can be divided by 3. \n\nThen, we know that the number is 2 less than a multiple of 4. This means we need to find a number that is just two less than a number that can be divided by 4. \n\nLastly, we know that the number is 3 less than a multiple of 5. This means we need to find a number that is just three less than a number that can be divided by 5. \n\nLet's think of a number that fits all these clues. Which number fits all the clues?
