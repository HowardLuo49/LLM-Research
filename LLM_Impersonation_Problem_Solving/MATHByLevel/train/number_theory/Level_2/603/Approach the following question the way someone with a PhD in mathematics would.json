The number of students in Teresa's graduating class is more than 50 and fewer than 100 and is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5. How many students are in Teresa's graduating class?",
    "solution": "Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv -1\\equiv 2\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv -2\\equiv 2\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv -3\\equiv 2\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv 2\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 2\\pmod{60}$. Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let n be the number of students in Teresa's graduating class. We know that n is more than 50 and fewer than 100, so we have the inequality 50 < n < 100.\n\nWe are also given that n is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\nn = 3k - 1\nn = 4m - 2\nn = 5p - 3\n\nfor some integers k, m, and p.\n\nFrom the first equation, n = 3k - 1, we know that n is 2 mod 3. From the second equation, n = 4m - 2, we know that n is 2 mod 4. From the third equation, n = 5p - 3, we know that n is 2 mod 5.\n\nPutting these congruences together, we can set up the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve for n. The solution to this system of congruences will give us the number of students in Teresa's graduating class within the given range of 50 to 100.",
