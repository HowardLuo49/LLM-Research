    "solution": "The units digit of any positive integer power of 5 is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(Note: this claim may be proved by induction, since the units digit of $5n$ is 5 whenever the units digit of $n$ is 5.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the unit digit of $5^4$, we need to consider the pattern of unit digits when powers of 5 are multiplied out. \n\nWhen $5$ is raised to any power, the unit digit will always be 5. Therefore, when $5^2$ is multiplied out, the units digit will be $5 \\times 5 = 25$, which has a units digit of 5. \n\nSimilarly, when $5^3$ is multiplied out, the units digit will be $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$, which has a units digit of 5.\n\nNow, when $5^4$ is multiplied out, we have $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$. The units digit of 625 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $5^4$ is 5.",
