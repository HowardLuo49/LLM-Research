    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Each row of a seating arrangement seats 7 or 8 people. Forty-six people are to be seated. How many rows seat exactly 8 people if every seat is occupied?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of rows that seat 8 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of rows that seat 7 people would be (46 - 8x)/7.\n\nIn order for every seat to be occupied, the total number of seats in the rows must equal 46:\n\n8x + 7((46 - 8x)/7) = 46\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of x, which represents the number of rows that seat exactly 8 people.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4?: Let x be the number of rows that seat 8 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of rows that seat 7 people would be (46 - 8x)/7.\n\nIn order for every seat to be occupied, the total number of seats in the rows must equal 46:\n\n8x + 7((46 - 8x)/7) = 46\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of x, which represents the number of rows that seat exactly 8 people.",
