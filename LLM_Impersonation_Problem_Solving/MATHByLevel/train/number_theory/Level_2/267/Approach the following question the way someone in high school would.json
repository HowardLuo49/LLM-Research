    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many rows seat exactly 8 people, we need to first find out how many total seats there are. \n\nLet's start by calculating the total number of seats in the seating arrangement. Since each row seats 7 or 8 people, we can create an equation:\n\nLet x be the number of rows that seat 8 people and y be the number of rows that seat 7 people. The total number of seats can be represented as:\n\n8x + 7y = 46\n\nSince we want to find the number of rows that seat exactly 8 people, we are looking for the value of x.\n\nNow we can substitute the total number of seats (46) into the equation:\n\n8x + 7y = 46\n\nSince each row of a seating arrangement seats 7 or 8 people, we can assume that there are no rows with less than 7 people. Therefore, we can set y to be 0:\n\n8x + 7(0) = 46\n8x = 46\nx = 5.75\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a row, we know that there are 5 rows that seat exactly 8 people if every seat is occupied.",
