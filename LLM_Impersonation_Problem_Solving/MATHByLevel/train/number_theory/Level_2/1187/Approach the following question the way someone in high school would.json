    "solution": "We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot13\\cdot(14+98)=\\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we first need to determine all the two-digit multiples of 7. \n\nThe first two-digit multiple of 7 is 7*2 = 14. The last two-digit multiple of 7 is 7*14 = 98. \n\nNow, we need to find the total number of two-digit multiples of 7. To do this, we divide the last multiple of 98 by 7 and subtract the first multiple of 14 by 7. \n\n(98 - 14) / 7 = 12\n\nThere are a total of 12 two-digit multiples of 7. \n\nNext, we find the sum of all the two-digit multiples of 7. To do this, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nS = n/2 * (first term + last term)\nS = 12/2 * (14 + 98)\nS = 6 * 112\nS = 672\n\nNow, we find the arithmetic mean by dividing the sum by the total number of multiples:\n\nMean = sum / total number\nMean = 672 / 12\nMean = 56\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56.",
