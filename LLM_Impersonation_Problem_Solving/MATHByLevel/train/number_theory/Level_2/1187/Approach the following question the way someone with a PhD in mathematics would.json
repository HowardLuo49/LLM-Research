    "solution": "We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot13\\cdot(14+98)=\\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we first need to determine the range of numbers we are considering. Since we are looking at two-digit multiples of 7, the smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14 and the largest is 98. \n\nTo find the total number of terms in this range, we can use the formula for finding the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: \nNumber of terms = (last term - first term)/common difference + 1\n= (98 - 14)/7 + 1\n= 84/7 + 1\n= 12 + 1\n= 13\n\nNow, to find the sum of all these two-digit multiples of 7, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \nSum = (number of terms)*(first term + last term)/2\n= 13*(14 + 98)/2\n= 13*112/2\n= 728\n\nFinally, to find the arithmetic mean, we divide the sum by the number of terms: \nArithmetic mean = 728/13\n= 56\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56.",
