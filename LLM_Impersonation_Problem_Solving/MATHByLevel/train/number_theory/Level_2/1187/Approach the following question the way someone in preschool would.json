    "solution": "We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot13\\cdot(14+98)=\\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we first need to list all the two-digit multiples of 7. The two-digit multiples of 7 are: 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, and 98. \n\nNext, we need to add up all these numbers and then divide by the total number of multiples (13 in this case) to find the average. \n\nSo, 14 + 21 + 28 + 35 + 42 + 49 + 56 + 63 + 70 + 77 + 84 + 91 + 98 = 728\nThen, 728 / 13 = 56\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56.
