    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down the information we have. \nWe know that $a = 45q + 37$ for some integer $q$ because when he divides $a$ by 45 he gets a remainder of 37. \nSimilarly, $b = 30p + 9$ for some integer $p$ because when he divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of 9.\n\nNow, we want to find a remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15. \nSubstitute the expressions for $a$ and $b$ into $a+b$:\n$a+b = (45q + 37) + (30p + 9)$\nSimplify:\n$a+b = 45q + 30p + 46$\n\nTo find the remainder of $a+b$ when divided by 15, we need to simplify the expression further. We know that $45q + 30p$ is divisible by 15, so we just need to consider the remainder when 46 is divided by 15.\nThe remainder when 46 is divided by 15 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is 1.",
