When he divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of $9$.  What remainder does he get when he divides $a+b$ by 15?",
    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what remainders are. When you divide two numbers, the remainder is what is left over after you divide as much as you can evenly.\n\nSo let's start with $a$. Marcus divides $a$ by 45 and gets a remainder of 37. This means that $a$ can be written as $45n + 37$, where $n$ is a whole number. \n\nNext, let's think about $b$. Marcus divides $b$ by 30 and gets a remainder of 9. This means that $b$ can be written as $30m + 9$, where $m$ is a whole number.\n\nNow, let's add $a$ and $b$ together to find out what remainder Marcus would get if he divided $a+b$ by 15.\n\n$a+b = (45n + 37) + (30m + 9) = 45n + 30m + 46$\n\nNow, let's think about what this means. When Marcus divides $a+b$ by 15, he wants to see what the remainder is. So we need to see what is left over after dividing $45n + 30m + 46$ by 15.\n\nIf we simplify $45n + 30m + 46$ by finding a common factor of 15, we get $15(3n + 2m) + 1$. \n\nThis means that when Marcus divides $a+b$ by 15, he would get a remainder of 1.",
