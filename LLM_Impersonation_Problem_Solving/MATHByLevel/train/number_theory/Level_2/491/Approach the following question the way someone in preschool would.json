    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's think like we are little kids! Okay, so Marcus has two numbers, $a$ and $b$, right? And when he divides $a$ by 45 he gets a remainder of 37. And when he divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of 9. So he must have big numbers! Now, if he adds $a$ and $b$ together and divides that by 15, what's the remainder? Let's see... Oh! I think the remainder is 7! Yeah, that sounds like a good answer! Yay!",
