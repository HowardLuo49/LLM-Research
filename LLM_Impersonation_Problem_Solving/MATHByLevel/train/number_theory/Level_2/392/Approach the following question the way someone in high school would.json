    "solution": "For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible. Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$. The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$. The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$. Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\\boxed{9700}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16, we need to start with the largest possible digit in the thousands place, which is 9. Then, we can work our way down to smaller digits for the other places.\n\nSo, we have 9 in the thousands place. That leaves us with 7 as the remaining sum of the digits (16 - 9 = 7).\n\nTo maximize the number, we want to make the hundreds place as large as possible. So, we put 7 in the hundreds place.\n\nThat leaves us with a sum of 0 for the remaining two digits, which means the tens and ones places should be 0.\n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16 is 9700.",
