    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible. Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$. The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$. The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$. Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\\boxed{9700}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation that represents the sum of the digits of the four-digit number. Let the four digits be represented as a, b, c, and d. Therefore, the sum of the digits can be expressed as:\n\na + b + c + d = 16\n\nSince we want to find the largest four-digit number, we should maximize the leftmost digit (a) while keeping the condition that the sum of the digits is 16. Therefore, we should set a = 9 to make the number as large as possible. However, this would make the sum of the remaining digits (b + c + d) equal to 7.\n\nTo maximize the number further, we would want to maximize the next digit (b), so we set b = 7. This leaves us with a sum of 2 for the remaining two digits (c + d).\n\nTo maximize the number even further, we should set c = 1 and d = 1 to make the number as large as possible while still maintaining the condition that the sum of the digits is 16.\n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16 is 9711.",
