    "solution": "The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $24$ is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 3)$, as each factor of $24$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the sum of the factors of 24 is $(1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3) = (15)(4)$, or $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the sum of the positive factors of 24, we first need to find all the factors of 24. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. \n\nThe sum of these factors is:\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 60\n\nTherefore, the sum of the positive factors of 24 is 60.",
