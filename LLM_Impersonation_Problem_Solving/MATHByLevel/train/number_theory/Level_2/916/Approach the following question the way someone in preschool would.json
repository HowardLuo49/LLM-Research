    "solution": "The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $24$ is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 3)$, as each factor of $24$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the sum of the factors of 24 is $(1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3) = (15)(4)$, or $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the positive factors of 24, we need to look at all the numbers that can divide evenly into 24. These numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Now we can add them all up to find the sum. Let's count and see: \n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 60 \n\nSo, the sum of the positive factors of 24 is 60. Yay!",
