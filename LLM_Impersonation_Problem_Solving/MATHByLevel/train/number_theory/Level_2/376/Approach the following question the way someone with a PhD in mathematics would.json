    "solution": "Since a terminating decimal can be written in the form of $\\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, we want to rewrite our fraction with a denominator of $10^b=2^b\\cdot5^b$. \\[ \\frac{37}{80}=\\frac{37}{2^{4}\\cdot5}\\cdot\\frac{5^{3}}{5^{3}}=\\frac{37\\cdot5^{3}}{10^{4}}=\\frac{4625}{10^{4}}=\\boxed{0.4625}. \\]",
    "gpt_response": "To express $\\frac{37}{80}$ as a terminating decimal, we need to find a power of 10 that makes the denominator 80. Since $80 = 2^4 \\times 5$, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by $5^3 = 125$ to get a denominator of 1000.\n\nThus, $\\frac{37}{80} = \\frac{37 \\times 125}{80 \\times 125} = \\frac{4625}{1000} = 4.625$.
