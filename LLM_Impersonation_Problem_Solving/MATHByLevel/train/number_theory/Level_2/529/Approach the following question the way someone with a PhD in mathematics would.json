    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Use each of the digits 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 exactly once to create the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6. What is that multiple of 6?",
    "solution": "A multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3, and a multiple of 2, which means its units digit is even. We note that 4, 6, and 8 are even and that $3+4+6+8+9=30=3(10)$, so indeed it is possible to create a multiple of 6. Choose the smallest even number on the list, 4, for the units digit and arrange the rest of the digits in decreasing order to maximize the multiple of 6: $\\boxed{98,634}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To create the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6 using the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 exactly once, we need to consider the divisibility rule for 6, which states that a number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nStarting with the last digit, we want to have the highest possible even number to make sure the entire number is divisible by 2. The highest even number from the digits given is 8, so it should be the last digit.\n\nNext, we need to determine the sum of the digits to check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits is 3 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 8 = 30, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, any permutation of these digits will result in a number that is divisible by 3.\n\nPutting the digits in descending order, we get 98643. This is the greatest possible five-digit number that can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 exactly once, and it is divisible by 6 since it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6 that can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 exactly once is 98,643.",
