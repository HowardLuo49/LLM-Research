    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Use each of the digits 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 exactly once to create the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6. What is that multiple of 6?",
    "solution": "A multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3, and a multiple of 2, which means its units digit is even. We note that 4, 6, and 8 are even and that $3+4+6+8+9=30=3(10)$, so indeed it is possible to create a multiple of 6. Choose the smallest even number on the list, 4, for the units digit and arrange the rest of the digits in decreasing order to maximize the multiple of 6: $\\boxed{98,634}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest five-digit multiple of 6 using the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9, we first need to know that a number is a multiple of 6 if it is a multiple of both 2 and 3.\n\nFirst, we know that the last digit of a multiple of 6 needs to be an even number because 6 is an even number, so our options for the last digit are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nWe want to create the greatest possible number, so we should put the largest digit in the ten-thousands place. That would be 9.\n\nNow, we need to figure out which even number (4, 6, or 8) should go in the ones place to make the number as large as possible. To do that, we look at the sum of all the digits we haven't used yet (3, 4, 6, 8). The sum of these digits is 21, which is divisible by 3. Thus, we know the entire number will be divisible by 3.\n\nSo, the greatest possible number we can make using the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 as a multiple of 6 is 98634.",
