    "solution": "Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$.  We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8).",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the positive two-digit integers as x, where 10 \u2264 x \u2264 99. We are looking for integers that satisfy the congruence x \u2261 2 (mod 8).\n\nSince 8 = 2^3, we can simplify the congruence to x \u2261 2 (mod 2^3).\n\nThis implies that the last three digits of x must be 010, 018, 026, 034, ..., 090.\n\nThe first integer that satisfies this condition is 10, and the last one is 90. Therefore, there are 9 integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 9 positive two-digit integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.",
