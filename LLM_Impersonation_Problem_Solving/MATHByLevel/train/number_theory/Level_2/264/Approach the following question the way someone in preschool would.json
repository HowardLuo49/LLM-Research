    "solution": "Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$.  We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8).",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We can start counting at 10 and just keep going up by 8 each time to find all the two-digit numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8. So, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, 98. There are 12 of them! Yay!",
