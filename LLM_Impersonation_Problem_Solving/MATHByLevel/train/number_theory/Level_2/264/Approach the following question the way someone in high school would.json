    "solution": "Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$.  We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive two-digit integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8, we can start by listing out the numbers starting from 10 (the smallest two-digit number). \n\nWhen we divide 10 by 8, we get a remainder of 2. So, 10 is a number that meets the criteria.\n\nNext, we can move on to 18 (10 + 8), which also leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.\n\nWe continue this pattern and add 8 to each previous number: 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 10 positive two-digit integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.",
