    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?",
    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, a perfect square number is like 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. And a perfect cube number is like 1, 8, 27, 64, and so on. \n\nSo one year ago, Jane's age was a perfect square. That means her age must have been either 1 or 4 years old.\n\nAnd one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. That means her age will be either 8 or 27 years old.\n\nSince Jane's age can't be 1 or 8 years old, that means she must be 4 years old. So, Jane is 4 years old.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 26?: Let's see, a perfect square number is like 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on.
