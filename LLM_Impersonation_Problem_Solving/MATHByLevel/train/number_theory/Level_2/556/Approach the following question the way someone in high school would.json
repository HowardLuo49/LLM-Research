    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's try to break down the question.\n\nOne year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square. So, let's think about some perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25...\n\nNow, one year from now, Jane's age will be a perfect cube. Some perfect cubes are: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125...\n\nLet's try to find a number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. The only number that fits this criteria is 64 (8 is both a perfect square and a perfect cube).\n\nSo, Jane is currently 8 years old.",
