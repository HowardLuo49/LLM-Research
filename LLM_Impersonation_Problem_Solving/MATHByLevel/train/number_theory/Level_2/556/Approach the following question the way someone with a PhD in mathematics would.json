    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old.",
    "gpt_response": "Let Jane's current age be represented by an unknown variable, say \"x\".\n\nGiven the information, one year ago, Jane's age was (x-1), which is a perfect square. Therefore, we can express this as:\n\nx - 1 = a^2, where 'a' is a positive integer representing the square root of the perfect square.\n\nSimilarly, one year from now, Jane's age will be (x + 1), which will be a perfect cube. Therefore, we can express this as:\n\nx + 1 = b^3, where 'b' is a positive integer representing the cube root of the perfect cube.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = a^2 +1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\na^2 + 1 + 1 = b^3\na^2 + 2 = b^3\n\nSince 'a' and 'b' are positive integers, the only solution to this equation is a=1, b=2.\n\nTherefore, Jane's current age x = a^2 +1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2 years old. \n\nHence, Jane is currently 2 years old.",
