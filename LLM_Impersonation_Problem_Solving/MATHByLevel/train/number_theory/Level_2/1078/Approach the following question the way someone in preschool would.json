    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm.. so when we have a number and we divide it by 15, we have 7 left over. Now, we want to find out how much is left over when we divide that same number by 3 and 5. Let's see..\n\nSo, if we first divide the number by 3, we will have 1 left over. And then, if we divide that same number by 5, we will have 2 left over. \n\nNow, to find the sum of the remainders when we divide by 3 and by 5, we just have to add them together. So 1 + 2 equals 3.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remainders when the number is divided by 3 and by 5 is 3. Yay!",
