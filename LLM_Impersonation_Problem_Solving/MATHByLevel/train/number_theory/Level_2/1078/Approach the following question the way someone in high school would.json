    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the remainders, we first need to find the remainders when the integer is divided by 3 and 5.\n\nLet's denote the integer as x. \n\nWhen x is divided by 15, the remainder is 7.
