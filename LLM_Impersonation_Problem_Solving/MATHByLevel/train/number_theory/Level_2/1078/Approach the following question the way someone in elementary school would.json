    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the remainders when an integer is divided by 3 and by 5, we need to remember some math rules.\n\nFirst, we know that when the integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7. This means that if we take away 7 from the integer, then the new number can be divided evenly by 15.\n\nTo find out what number can be divided evenly by 15 if the remainder is 7, we can count by 15 and look for a number that is 7 more than a multiple of 15. Starting with 7 and counting by 15, we find that 7, 22, and so on. So, the number is 22.\n\nNow, if we divide 22 by 3, we get a remainder of 1 because 21 is 7 times 3 and 22 is 1 more than that. And if we divide 22 by 5, we get a remainder of 2 because 20 is 4 times 5 and 22 is 2 more than that.\n\nTo find the sum of the remainders, we add 1 and 2 together. So, when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5, the sum of the remainders is 1 + 2 = 3.",
