The digits of a two-digit number $AB$ are reversed to form a second two-digit number, and the lesser of the two-digit numbers is subtracted from the greater. What prime number must be a factor of the difference if $A\\neq B$?",
    "solution": "$AB -BA= 10\\cdot A+B - (10\\cdot B+A)= 9\\cdot A-9\\cdot B=3(3\\cdot A-3\\cdot B)$. If $A\\neq B$, then the difference is a (non-zero) multiple of 3. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ must be a factor of $AB -BA$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two-digit number $AB$ be represented as $10A + B$, and the reversed number as $10B + A$. The difference between the two numbers is $(10A + B) - (10B + A) = 9A - 9B = 9(A - B)$.\n\nSince $A \\neq B$, it follows that $A - B \\neq 0$, which means that the difference is divisible by 9. Therefore, the prime factorization of the difference will include 3 as a factor. Additionally, since the difference is a two-digit number, it must be at least 10. Therefore, the prime number that must be a factor of the difference is $\\boxed{3}$.",
