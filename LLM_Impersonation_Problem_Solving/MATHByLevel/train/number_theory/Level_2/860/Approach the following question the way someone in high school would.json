The digits of a two-digit number $AB$ are reversed to form a second two-digit number, and the lesser of the two-digit numbers is subtracted from the greater. What prime number must be a factor of the difference if $A\\neq B$?",
    "solution": "$AB -BA= 10\\cdot A+B - (10\\cdot B+A)= 9\\cdot A-9\\cdot B=3(3\\cdot A-3\\cdot B)$. If $A\\neq B$, then the difference is a (non-zero) multiple of 3. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ must be a factor of $AB -BA$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so let's say our original two-digit number is $AB$. When we reverse the digits, we get the number $BA$. \n\nIf $AB > BA$, then we need to find the difference $AB - BA$. Since $A\\neq B$, our two-digit number is not a palindrome, so $AB - BA \\neq 0$. \n\nLet's see what the difference is when we subtract $BA$ from $AB$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&AB \\\\\n-& BA \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can rewrite this as $10A + B - 10B - A = 9A - 9B = 9(A - B)$. Since $A\\neq B$, $A-B$ is a nonzero integer, and $9$ will be a factor of the difference $AB - BA$.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a prime factor, we need to find the prime factor of $9$ which is $3$. So, the prime number that must be a factor of the difference if $A\\neq B$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
