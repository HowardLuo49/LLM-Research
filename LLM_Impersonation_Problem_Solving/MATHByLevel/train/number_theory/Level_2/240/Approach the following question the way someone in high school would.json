    "solution": "When you divide 40 days in a week by 7 days, you get a remainder of 5.  Five days from Tuesday is $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out what day of the week it will be 40 days from Tuesday, we first need to count the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday).\n\nSo, if we add 40 days to Tuesday, we need to figure out how many weeks that is. 40 divided by 7 is 5 with a remainder of 5 (40 = 7 x 5 + 5).\n\nStarting from Tuesday, if we count 5 days ahead, we get Sunday. Then, we add the remaining 5 days and it takes us to Friday.\n\nSo, the day of the week that will be 40 days from Tuesday is Friday.",
