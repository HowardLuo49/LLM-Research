    "solution": "Simplify $(2+3)^{23}=5^{23}$. Since the ones digit of $5\\times5$ is 5, the ones digit of $5^n$ is 5 for any positive integer $n$. Similarly, since the tens digit of $25\\times5$ is 2 (and the ones digit is 5), the tens digit of $5^n$ is 2 for all positive integers $n\\ge2$. Therefore, the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of $(2+3)^{23}$ is $2+5=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! First, we have to find out what $(2+3)^{23}$ is. That's like saying $5^{23}$. So, let's see... if we keep multiplying 5 by itself 23 times, we'll get a really big number. After some calculations, we find that $(2+3)^{23} = 11920928955078125$.\n\nNow, we want to find the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of this big number. The tens digit is 2 and the ones digit is 5. So, let's add 2 and 5 together to get the final answer. \n\n2 + 5 = 7 \n\nSo, the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of the integer form of $(2+3)^{23}$ is 7.",
