    "solution": "Simplify $(2+3)^{23}=5^{23}$. Since the ones digit of $5\\times5$ is 5, the ones digit of $5^n$ is 5 for any positive integer $n$. Similarly, since the tens digit of $25\\times5$ is 2 (and the ones digit is 5), the tens digit of $5^n$ is 2 for all positive integers $n\\ge2$. Therefore, the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit of $(2+3)^{23}$ is $2+5=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, that looks like a math problem! Let's start by adding 2 and 3 together. That makes 5. Then we need to raise it to the 23rd power. Let's see... that's a lot of 5s! Okay, let's see... the tens digit of the integer form of $(2+3)^{23}$ is 3, and the ones digit is 1. So, if we add them together, we get 3 + 1 which equals 4. Yay, we got the sum of the tens digit and the ones digit! Great job!",
