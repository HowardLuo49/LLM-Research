    "solution": "Factor out $7^3$ in the given expression $7^4-7^3=7^3(7-1)=7^3\\cdot6=2\\cdot3\\cdot7^3$. Thus, the least prime factor of $7^4-7^3$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3, we can first factor out a $7^3$ from both terms to get $7^3(7 - 1)$. Then we simplify to get $7^3(6)$. The least prime factor of $7^3(6)$ is 2 because 6 can be divided by 2. So, the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3$ is 2.",
