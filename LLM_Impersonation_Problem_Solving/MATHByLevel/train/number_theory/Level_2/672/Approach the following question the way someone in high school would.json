    "solution": "Factor out $7^3$ in the given expression $7^4-7^3=7^3(7-1)=7^3\\cdot6=2\\cdot3\\cdot7^3$. Thus, the least prime factor of $7^4-7^3$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3$, we can first factor out a $7^3$, so it becomes $7^3(7 - 1)$. Then, simplify it to $7^3 * 6$. Since $6$ is not a prime number, the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3$ is $2$.",
