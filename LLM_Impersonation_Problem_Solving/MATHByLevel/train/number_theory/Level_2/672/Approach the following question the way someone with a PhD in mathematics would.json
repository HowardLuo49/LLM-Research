    "solution": "Factor out $7^3$ in the given expression $7^4-7^3=7^3(7-1)=7^3\\cdot6=2\\cdot3\\cdot7^3$. Thus, the least prime factor of $7^4-7^3$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3$, we can first factor out the common factor of $7^3$ to obtain $7^3(7 - 1) = 7^3 \\cdot 6 = 7^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3$. This expression simplifies to $49 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\cdot 7^2$. \n\nHence, the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3$ is 3.",
