    "solution": "The only numbers that leave no remainder when divided by $5$ are those that are divisible by $5$. Starting from $1,$ every five integers is divisible by $5: 5,10,15,\\ldots$ This continues even until the last group of five numbers $96$ through $100$ where $100$ is divisible by $5$. Therefore, since we have a whole number of groups of five and every group has exactly one element that is divisible by $5$, $1/5 = \\boxed{20}$ percent of the integers less than $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the percent of positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that have no remainders when divided by $5$, we need to find how many numbers fit this criteria first. \n\nSince every fifth number is divisible by $5$, we need to find how many multiples of $5$ there are between $1$ and $100$. There are $20$ multiples of $5$ less than or equal to $100$: $5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 100$. \n\nNow let's find the total number of positive integers less than or equal to $100$. There are $100$ positive integers less than or equal to $100$.\n\nTo find the percent, we divide the number of multiples of $5$ by the total number of positive integers and multiply by $100$:\n\n$\\frac{20}{100} \\times 100 = \\boxed{20\\%}$\n\nTherefore, $20\\%$ of the positive integers less than or equal to $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
