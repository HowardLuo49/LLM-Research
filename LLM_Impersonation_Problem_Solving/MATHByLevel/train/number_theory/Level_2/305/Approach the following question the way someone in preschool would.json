    "solution": "The only numbers that leave no remainder when divided by $5$ are those that are divisible by $5$. Starting from $1,$ every five integers is divisible by $5: 5,10,15,\\ldots$ This continues even until the last group of five numbers $96$ through $100$ where $100$ is divisible by $5$. Therefore, since we have a whole number of groups of five and every group has exactly one element that is divisible by $5$, $1/5 = \\boxed{20}$ percent of the integers less than $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count to 100 and find all the numbers that are divisible by 5! Let's start with 5, then 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100! So there are 20 numbers that are divisible by 5. And that means 80 numbers are left that aren't divisible by 5. So the percent of numbers that have no remainders when divided by 5 is $\\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{1}{5} = 20\\%$! Yay, we did it!",
