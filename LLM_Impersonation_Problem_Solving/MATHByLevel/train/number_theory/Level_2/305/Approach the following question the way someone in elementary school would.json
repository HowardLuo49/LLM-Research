    "solution": "The only numbers that leave no remainder when divided by $5$ are those that are divisible by $5$. Starting from $1,$ every five integers is divisible by $5: 5,10,15,\\ldots$ This continues even until the last group of five numbers $96$ through $100$ where $100$ is divisible by $5$. Therefore, since we have a whole number of groups of five and every group has exactly one element that is divisible by $5$, $1/5 = \\boxed{20}$ percent of the integers less than $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many numbers have no remainders when divided by $5$, we can see that every fifth number is divisible by $5$. So, to find out how many of the first $100$ numbers are divisible by $5$, we can do $100 \\div 5 = 20$. \n\nSo, $20$ out of the $100$ numbers have no remainders when divided by $5$. To find the percent, we just do $\\frac{20}{100} \\times 100 = 20\\%$.\n\nTherefore, $20\\%$ of the positive integers less than or equal to $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 20?: To find out how many numbers have no remainders when divided by $5$, we can see that every fifth number is divisible by $5$.
