    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares?",
    "solution": "Squares of perfect squares are fourth powers. $1^4=1$, $2^4=16$, and $3^4=81$ are the only fourth powers less than 100. Their sum is $1+16+81=\\boxed{98}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares, we first need to figure out which numbers are squares of perfect squares. A square of a perfect square is a number that is the square of a number that is also a square. So, we need to find the numbers that can be expressed as the square of another number that is also a square.\n\nLet's make a list of perfect squares less than 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.\n\nNow, let's find the squares of these numbers and see which ones are less than 100: 1, 16, 81\n\nAdd these numbers together: 1 + 16 + 81 = 98\n\nSo, the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares is 98.",
