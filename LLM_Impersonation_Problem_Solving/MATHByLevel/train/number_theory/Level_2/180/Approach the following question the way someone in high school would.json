    "solution": "Squares of perfect squares are fourth powers. $1^4=1$, $2^4=16$, and $3^4=81$ are the only fourth powers less than 100. Their sum is $1+16+81=\\boxed{98}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to figure out what numbers are squares of perfect squares. Since we're looking for numbers less than 100, we only need to consider perfect squares that are less than 100. \n\nThe perfect squares less than 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81. \n\nThese perfect squares can be squared to give us the numbers 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, and 6561. \n\nWe need to find the sum of these numbers that are less than 100. \n\n1 + 16 + 81 = 98 \n\nSo, the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares is 98.",
