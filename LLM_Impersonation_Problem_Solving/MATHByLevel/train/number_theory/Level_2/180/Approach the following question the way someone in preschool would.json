    "solution": "Squares of perfect squares are fourth powers. $1^4=1$, $2^4=16$, and $3^4=81$ are the only fourth powers less than 100. Their sum is $1+16+81=\\boxed{98}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We need to find all the numbers that are squares of perfect squares and add them all up. First, let's list the perfect squares less than 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81. Now, let's find the squares of each of these numbers: 1, 16, 81. Finally, let's add them all together: 1 + 16 + 81 = 98. So, the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares is 98!",
