    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares?",
    "solution": "Squares of perfect squares are fourth powers. $1^4=1$, $2^4=16$, and $3^4=81$ are the only fourth powers less than 100. Their sum is $1+16+81=\\boxed{98}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares, we need to first identify the perfect squares that are less than 100. These perfect squares are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, and 9^2.\n\nNext, we need to find the squares of these perfect squares: (1^2)^2, (2^2)^2, (3^2)^2, (4^2)^2, (5^2)^2, (6^2)^2, (7^2)^2, (8^2)^2, and (9^2)^2.\n\nCalculating these values gives us: 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, and 6561.\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares:\n\n1 + 16 + 81 + 256 + 625 + 1296 + 2401 + 4096 + 6561 = 15337.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares is 15337.",
