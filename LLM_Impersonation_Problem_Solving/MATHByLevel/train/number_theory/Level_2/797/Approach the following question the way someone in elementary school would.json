The next digit to the left is the sevens place, which is 3. And the leftmost digit is the 49s place, which is 1. \n\nTo convert this number to base 10, we need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 7 and then add them together. \n\nSo, $1(49) + 3(7) + 5(1) = 49 + 21 + 5 = 75$. \n\nTherefore, $135_7 = 75$ in base 10.",
