    "solution": "Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \\cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. First, we write $\\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\\dfrac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$. To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \\cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$. Thus, we have $$\\frac{3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits. Therefore, there are $4-2=\\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To change the fraction $\\frac{3}{1250}$ into a decimal, first we need to divide 3 by 1250. Let's count the number of zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.\n\n1. First, we divide 3 by 1250. Since 3 is smaller than 1250, we need to add a decimal point to 3 and make it 3.0.\n2. We start dividing. 1250 can't fit into 3, so we add a zero to the right of the decimal point and make it 30.0.\n3. Now, we divide 1250 by 30, which is 4.16666667. It goes on and on.\n4. We find that after the 0.0, there are 3 zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit, which is 0.\n\nSo, when $\\frac{3}{1250}$ is written as a decimal, there are 3 zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",
