    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When $\\frac{3}{1250}$ is written as a decimal, how many zeros are there between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit?",
    "solution": "Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \\cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. First, we write $\\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\\dfrac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$. To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \\cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$. Thus, we have $$\\frac{3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits. Therefore, there are $4-2=\\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many zeros are there between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit when we write $\\frac{3}{1250}$ as a decimal, we first need to divide 3 by 1250.\n\nSo, when we divide 3 by 1250, we get 0.0024. \n\nNow, we can see that there are 2 zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit (2 and 4). \n\nTherefore, there are 2 zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit when we write $\\frac{3}{1250}$ as a decimal.",
