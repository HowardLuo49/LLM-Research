    "solution": "Dividing using long division, we find that $2007=81\\cdot24 + 63$, so the remainder is $\\boxed{63}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$, we can use the division algorithm. \n\nFirst, we can rewrite $2007$ as $81 \\times 24 + 63$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$ is $63$. \n\nIn conclusion, the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$ is $63$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 63?: To find the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$, we can use the division algorithm. \n\nFirst, we can rewrite $2007$ as $81 \\times 24 + 63$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$ is $63$. \n\nIn conclusion, the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$ is $63$.",
