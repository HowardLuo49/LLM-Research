    "solution": "Dividing using long division, we find that $2007=81\\cdot24 + 63$, so the remainder is $\\boxed{63}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81, we can divide $2007$ by $81$ using long division. \n\n$2007$ divided by $81$ gives us a quotient of $24$ with a remainder of $63$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$ is $63$.",
