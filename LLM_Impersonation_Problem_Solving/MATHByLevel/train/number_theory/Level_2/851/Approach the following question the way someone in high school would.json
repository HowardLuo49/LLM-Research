    "solution": "We use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince all numbers with the units digit of $2$ has a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$ and we have $10$ numbers,  $$2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92 \\equiv 2^{10} \\equiv 1024 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{5}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses: $2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92$. We can see that all the numbers in the expression have a units digit of 2, so let's focus on the units digit. \n\nWhen we multiply numbers with a units digit of 2, the units digit of the product will always be 4. Therefore, the units digit of the entire expression will be 4.\n\nNext, we need to find the remainder when 4 is divided by 5. The remainder is 4.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92$ is divided by 5 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
