    "solution": "We use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince all numbers with the units digit of $2$ has a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$ and we have $10$ numbers,  $$2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92 \\equiv 2^{10} \\equiv 1024 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{5}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when we multiply all those numbers and divide by 5, we need to look at each number and see if it's a multiple of 5 or not.\n\nLet's start with $2$. $2$ is not a multiple of $5$, so when we multiply it by anything, the result won't be a multiple of $5$.\n\nNext, we have $12$. $12$ is not a multiple of $5$, so we'll still get a remainder of $2$ when we multiply $2$ by $12$ and then divide by $5$.\n\nFor $22$, we also get a remainder of $2$.\n\nAnd so on for all the numbers from $32$ to $92$.\n\nSince all the numbers are not multiples of $5$, when we multiply them all together and divide by $5$, the remainder will be $2$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92$ is divided by $5$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
