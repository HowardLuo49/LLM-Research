    "solution": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when a large number is divided by 10, we only need to look at the last digit of the number. \n\nFirst, let's multiply the three numbers: $1734 \\times 5389 \\times 80,\\!607$. The product is a very large number, but we only need to focus on the last digit, which is the product of the last digits of the three numbers.\n\nThe last digit of 1734 is 4, the last digit of 5389 is 9, and the last digit of 80,607 is 7. \n\nMultiplying the last digits, $4\\times 9\\times 7 = 252$. The last digit of 252 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product $1734\\times 5389 \\times 80,\\!607$ is divided by 10 is 2.",
