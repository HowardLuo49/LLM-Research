    "solution": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the product $1734 \\times 5389 \\times 80,607$ is divided by 10, we can consider the remainders of each individual factor when divided by 10.\n\nWe know that when a number is divided by 10, the remainder is simply the last digit of the number.
