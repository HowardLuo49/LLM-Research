    "solution": "We divide 1000 by 47 and get a remainder of 13. Therefore, if we subtract 13 from 1000, we should get an integer divisible by 47. Since $1000-13 = 987$ and 987 is divisible by 47, we can then add 47 to 987 to get the smallest four-digit integer that is divisible by 47, namely $987+47 = \\boxed{1034}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, well let's see. Four-digit numbers start from 1000 and go up to 9999. So first, I have to remember how to count to 47. Okay, 1-47, 1-47, 1-47. Let's see if I can find a number that is divisible by 47 between 1000 and 9999. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I can ask a grown-up for help!",
