    "solution": "We divide 1000 by 47 and get a remainder of 13. Therefore, if we subtract 13 from 1000, we should get an integer divisible by 47. Since $1000-13 = 987$ and 987 is divisible by 47, we can then add 47 to 987 to get the smallest four-digit integer that is divisible by 47, namely $987+47 = \\boxed{1034}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47, we must determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 47 and the smallest four-digit number, which is 1000. \n\nThe LCM of two numbers can be calculated using the formula LCM(a,b) = (a * b) / GCD(a,b), where GCD(a,b) represents the greatest common divisor of the two numbers a and b.\n\nIn this case, calculating the LCM of 47 and 1000 gives LCM(47,1000) = (47 * 1000) / GCD(47,1000).\n\nTo find the GCD of 47 and 1000, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.
