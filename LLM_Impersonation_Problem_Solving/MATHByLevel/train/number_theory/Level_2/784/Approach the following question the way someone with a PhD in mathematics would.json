    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 0\\pmod 2\\\\\na & \\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na & \\equiv 2\\pmod 4\n\\end{align*} Note that $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ automatically implies $a \\equiv 0\\pmod 2$, so only $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ and $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ need to be considered. The first few positive solutions of $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ are $2,6,10$. While the first two do not satisfy $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$, luckily $\\boxed{10}$ does!",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the unknown integer as x. From the given information, we can write three congruences:\n\nx \u2261 0 (mod 2)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nx \u2261 2 (mod 4)\n\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can solve for x. \n\nFirst, since x \u2261 0 (mod 2), x must be even. Next, from x \u2261 2 (mod 4), we know x = 4k + 2 for some integer k. Substituting this into the first two congruences:\n\n4k + 2 \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nk \u2261 -1 (mod 3)\n\nTherefore, k = 3m - 1 for some integer m. Substituting back into x = 4k + 2:\n\nx = 4(3m - 1) + 2\nx = 12m - 2\n\nSo, the least positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is x = 12m - 2, where m is a positive integer. Plugging in the smallest possible positive integer for m, we find:\n\nm = 1 \u21d2 x = 12(1) - 2 = 10\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is x = 10.",
