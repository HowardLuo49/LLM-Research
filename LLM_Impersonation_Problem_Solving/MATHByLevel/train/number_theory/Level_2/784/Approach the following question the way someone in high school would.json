    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 0\\pmod 2\\\\\na & \\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na & \\equiv 2\\pmod 4\n\\end{align*} Note that $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ automatically implies $a \\equiv 0\\pmod 2$, so only $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ and $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ need to be considered. The first few positive solutions of $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ are $2,6,10$. While the first two do not satisfy $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$, luckily $\\boxed{10}$ does!",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple of 2, 3, and 4, and then add 2 to that number. \n\nThe least common multiple of 2, 3, and 4 is 12. So, we start with 12 and add 2 to get the least positive integer that meets the conditions: 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 is 14.",
