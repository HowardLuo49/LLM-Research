    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the least positive integer that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 4?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 0\\pmod 2\\\\\na & \\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na & \\equiv 2\\pmod 4\n\\end{align*} Note that $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ automatically implies $a \\equiv 0\\pmod 2$, so only $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ and $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ need to be considered. The first few positive solutions of $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ are $2,6,10$. While the first two do not satisfy $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$, luckily $\\boxed{10}$ does!",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about this problem step by step. \nFirst we need to find a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. So, any even number will work, like 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. \nNext, we need to find a number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. So, we can start with the numbers we found before and add 1 to each of them: 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. \nLastly, we need to find a number that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. So, let's look at the numbers we found before and add 2 to each of them: 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on. \nPutting it all together, we can see that the least positive integer that meets all three conditions is 10. 10 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, 10 divided by 3 has a remainder of 1, and 10 divided by 4 has a remainder of 2.",
