    "solution": "Calculate the remainders when $1^2$, $2^2$, ..., $10^2$ are divided by 11 and sum them to find that the remainder when $1^2+2^2+\\cdots+10^2$ is divided by 11 is the same as that of $1+4+9+5+3+3+5+9+4+1=44$, which is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \\dots + 10^2$ is divided by 11, we can first calculate the sum of the squares.\n\nThe sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers can be expressed by the formula:\n$1^2 + 2^2 + \\dots + n^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$\n\nUsing this formula, we find that the sum of the squares of the first 10 natural numbers is:\n$1^2 + 2^2 + \\dots + 10^2 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 21}{6} = 385$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 385 is divided by 11.
