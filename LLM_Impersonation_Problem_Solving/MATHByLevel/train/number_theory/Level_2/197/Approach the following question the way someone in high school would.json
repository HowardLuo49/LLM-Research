    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The least common multiple of two integers is 36 and 6 is their greatest common divisor. What is the product of the two numbers?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers. We can use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{216}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of two numbers when you know their least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD), you can use the formula: LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b) = a * b. \n\nIn this case, we know that LCM = 36 and GCD = 6. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n36 * 6 = a * b \n\n216 = a * b \n\nTherefore, the product of the two numbers is 216.",
