    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The least common multiple of two integers is 36 and 6 is their greatest common divisor. What is the product of the two numbers?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers. We can use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{216}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let us denote the two integers as a and b. Given that the least common multiple of a and b is 36, we can express this relationship as lcm(a, b) = 36. \n\nThe relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers can be expressed as gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b. Therefore, we have gcd(a, b) * 36 = a * b. \n\nGiven that the greatest common divisor of a and b is 6, we have gcd(a, b) = 6. Substituting this into our equation, we have 6 * 36 = a * b. Therefore, the product of the two numbers a and b is 216.",
