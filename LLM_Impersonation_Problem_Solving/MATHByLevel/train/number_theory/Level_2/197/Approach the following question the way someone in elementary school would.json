    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers. We can use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{216}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of the two numbers, we need to know what numbers these are. We know that their greatest common divisor is 6 and their least common multiple is 36.\n\nLet's first find the two numbers that have a GCD of 6. To do this, we can divide 36 (which is their LCM) by 6 (which is their GCD). So, 36 \u00f7 6 = 6. This means that one of the numbers is 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the other number. To find the other number, we can divide the LCM (36) by the number we already found (6). So, 36 \u00f7 6 = 6. This means that the other number is also 6.\n\nFinally, we can find the product of the two numbers by multiplying them together. So, 6 x 6 = 36.\n\nTherefore, the product of the two numbers is 36.",
