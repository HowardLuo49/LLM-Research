    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. You have a number of gold coins that you were going to distribute equally among your 11 best friends. However, after dividing your gold coins into 11 equal piles, you realize that if you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin. You have less than 100 gold coins. What is the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen?",
    "solution": "If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11. However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$. We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \\frac{98}{11}$. Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of gold coins you have. Since you have divided the gold coins into 11 equal piles, each pile has x/11 gold coins. \n\nIf you distribute all x gold coins among your 11 best friends, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin. This implies that x is such that x is congruent to 2 modulo 11. \n\nWe need to find the largest possible x such that x < 100 and x is congruent to 2 modulo 11. \n\nChecking the remainders when numbers less than 100 are divided by 11, we find that the largest number satisfying the above conditions is x = 91. \n\nTherefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen is 91.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 90?: Let x be the number of gold coins you have.
