    "gpt_response": "To begin, let's set up the problem with a diagram:\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the circle inscribed in equilateral triangle $ABC$. Since $ABC$ is equilateral, we know that $\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ$. Since $AB = 2$, we can use the law of sines to find that $AC = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nNow, extend $AB$ through $B$ to point $D$ such that $AD = 13$. Also, extend $AC$ through $C$ to point $E$ such that $AE = 11$. \n\nSince $l_1$ is parallel to $AE$ and $l_2$ is parallel to $AD$, we have that $\\angle FAE = \\angle EAF = \\angle AEF = \\angle AFE = 60^\\circ$.\n\nLet $X$ be the point on $l_1$ such that $DX$ is perpendicular to $l_1$, and $Y$ be the point on $l_2$ such that $EY$ is perpendicular to $l_2$. \n\nWe can now use similar triangles to find $DF$ and $EF$. Since $\\triangle AEF$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle, we have that $EF = \\frac{AE}{2} = \\frac{11}{2}$. Similarly, $\\triangle AED$ is also a $30-60-90$ triangle, giving us that $ED = \\frac{AD}{2} = \\frac{13}{2}$.\n\nSince $\\triangle DXF$ is similar to $\\triangle AEF$ and $\\triangle EYF$ is similar to $\\triangle ADF$, we can set up proportions to find $DF$ and $EF$. \n\nUsing the similar triangles, we find that $DF = \\frac{EF}{AX} \\cdot DX = \\frac{11}{2} \\times \\frac{13}{11} = \\frac{13}{2}$ and $EF = \\frac{DF}{EY} \\cdot AY = \\frac{13}{2} \\times \\frac{11}{13} = \\frac{11}{2}$. \n\nNow, we can consider triangle $CFB$ in the circle. Since $CF$ is a diameter and $\\triangle FCB$ is inscribed in a semicircle, we have that $\\angle CFB = 90^\\circ$. \n\nThis means that triangle $CFB$ is a right triangle, with leg $CB$ equal to the radius of the circle, which is $2$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find $CF = \\sqrt{11^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{121 + 4} = \\sqrt{125}$.\n\nFinally, to find the area of $\\triangle CBG$, we can use the fact that it is half the area of rectangle $CFGH$ (where $H$ is the point on the circle collinear with $A$ and $F$). The area of the rectangle is $CF \\times CG = \\sqrt{125} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{125}$. Therefore, the area of $\\triangle CBG = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\sqrt{125} = \\sqrt{125} = 5\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThus, $p+q+r = 5 + 5 + 5 = \\boxed{015}$.",
