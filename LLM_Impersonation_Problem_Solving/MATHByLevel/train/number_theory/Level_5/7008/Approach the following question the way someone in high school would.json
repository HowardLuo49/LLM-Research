    "solution": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $100^\\text{th}$ term of the sequence, we can simply continue the pattern. We see that the sequence starts with powers of 3: $1, 3, 9, 27, \\ldots$. \n\nThe $100^\\text{th}$ term will be whichever power of 3 is closest to 100. To find this, we can use the formula $3^n \\leq 100 < 3^{n+1}$.\n\nBy trial and error, we see that $3^4 = 81$ and $3^5 = 243$. Since $3^4 = 81$ is the largest power of 3 less than 100, we know that the $100^\\text{th}$ term will be a sum of distinct powers of 3 that add up to 100.\n\nTo find which powers of 3 we need to add, we can start with 100 and subtract the largest powers of 3 until we reach 0: $100 - 81 = 19$, $19 - 9 = 10$, $10 - 9 = 1$.\n\nSo, the $100^\\text{th}$ term of the sequence will be $3^4 + 3^2 + 3^0 = 81 + 9 + 1 = \\boxed{91}$.",
