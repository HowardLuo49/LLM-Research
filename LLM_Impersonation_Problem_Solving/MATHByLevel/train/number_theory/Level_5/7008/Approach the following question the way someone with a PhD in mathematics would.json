The increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3. Find the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of this sequence.\n",
    "solution": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th term of this sequence, we need to first identify the pattern of the sequence. We see that the sequence starts with the powers of 3 (1, 3, 9) and then includes the sums of distinct powers of 3 (4, 10, 12, 13). \n\nLet's denote the powers of 3 as $3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3,$ and so on. We can see that the sums of distinct powers of 3 are formed by selecting one or more of the powers of 3 and summing them up. For example, 4 = $3^1 + 3^0$, 10 = $3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0$, and so on.\n\nTo find the 100th term, we need to first find the largest power of 3 that is less than or equal to 100. This is $3^4 = 81$. Now, we need to consider the sums of distinct powers of 3 that add up to 100. We can write 100 as a sum of distinct powers of 3 as $100 = 3^4 + 3^0 + 3^0$. Thus, the 100th term of the sequence is 100.\n\nTherefore, the 100th term of this sequence is 100.",
