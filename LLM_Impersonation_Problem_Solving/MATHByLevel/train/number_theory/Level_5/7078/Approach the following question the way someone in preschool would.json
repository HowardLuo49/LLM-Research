    "solution": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's look for numbers that have 3 different digits and when we read them from left to right, they form a pattern! \n\nLet's start by finding the smallest geometric number. The smallest digit we can use is $1$ and then the next number in the sequence should be greater than $1$, so let's use $2$. The next number should be a multiple of $2$, so let's use $4$. So the smallest geometric number is $124$. \n\nNow let's find the largest geometric number. We can start with the largest digit, which is $9$. Then we need to find a number greater than $9$, and since $12$ isn't a $3$-digit number, we'll use $18$. The next number should be a multiple of $2$, so let's use $36$. So the largest geometric number is $936$.\n\nNow we need to find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers. $936 - 124 = 812$. So, the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers is $812$. Yay, we did it!",
