    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Call a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence. Find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers.\n",
    "solution": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So a geometric number is a three-digit number where the digits form a sequence like 123, 135, 246, etc. We need to find the biggest and smallest geometric numbers and then find the difference between them.\n\nThe biggest geometric number would be 987 because that is the biggest possible three-digit number with three distinct digits in decreasing order.\n\nThe smallest geometric number would be 123 because that is the smallest possible three-digit number with three distinct digits in increasing order.\n\nSo the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers is $987 - 123 = 864$. So the answer is $864$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 840?: Okay!
