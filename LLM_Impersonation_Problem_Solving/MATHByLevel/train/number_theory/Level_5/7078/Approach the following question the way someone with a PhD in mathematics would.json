Call a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence. Find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers.\n",
    "solution": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest and smallest geometric numbers, we first need to determine the restrictions on the possible digits that can form a geometric sequence. \n\nLet the $3$-digit geometric number be denoted as $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the individual digits. Since the digits must form a geometric sequence when read from left to right, we have the equation $b^2 = ac$. \n\nWe can find the possible values for $b$ by considering that $b$ must be an integer and $b^2$ must be a multiple of $a$. This leads to the following possibilities:\n\nIf $a = 1$, then $b$ can be $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\nIf $a = 2$, then $b$ can be $2, 4, 6, 8$.\nIf $a = 3$, then $b$ can be $3, 9$.\nIf $a = 4$, then $b$ can be $4$.\nIf $a = 5$, then there are no possible values for $b$.\nIf $a = 6$, then $b$ can be $6$.\nIf $a = 7$, then there are no possible values for $b$.\nIf $a = 8$, then $b$ can be $8$.\nIf $a = 9$, then there are no possible values for $b$.\n\nFrom the possibilities above, we can find the largest geometric number by choosing the largest $a$, followed by the largest $b$ that satisfies the geometric condition, and then the largest $c$. Similarly, we find the smallest geometric number by choosing the smallest $a$, followed by the smallest $b$ that satisfies the geometric condition, and then the smallest $c$. \n\nThe largest geometric number is $986$, and the smallest geometric number is $124$. Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers is $986 - 124 = 862$.",
