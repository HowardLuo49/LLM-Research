    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. You are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$. Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\n",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we gots this big ol' number $P$ that's the product of all the prime numbers from $2$ to $61$. Then we add some numbers to $P$ like $P+2, P+3, P+4, \\ldots, P+59$. We gotta count how many of those numbers are prime, mmkay?\n\nWell, we gotta remember that if we add a number to a big ol' prime number product $P$, we might not get a prime number. So we gotta be careful with this. Let's think about it...\n\nHmm... well $P+2$ is definitely not prime, 'cause it's even. And $P+3$ is not prime either 'cause $3$ goes into $P$! And $P+4$ is even as well, so it's not prime. But $P+5$ is prime 'cause $5$ isn't in $P$! And $P+6$, well, that's not prime 'cause $2$ and $3$ go into $P$.\n\nWe gotta keep doin' this for all the numbers from $2$ to $59$... but y'know what? Maybe we don't need to! Think about it for a moment. How many primes are there less than or equal to $61$? Can we have a prime number added to a product of primes to get another prime?\n\nHehe, if we think about it, we'll see that there are no prime numbers less than or equal to $61$ that can be added to $P$ to get another prime number! So our answer must be $\\boxed{\\text{(A) }0}$! Woo-hoo!",
