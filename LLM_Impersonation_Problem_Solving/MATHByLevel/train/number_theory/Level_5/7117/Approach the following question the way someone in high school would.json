    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. You are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$. Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\n",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know $P$ is the product of all the primes less than or equal to $61$, which is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\ldots \\times 61$. This is a pretty big number. \n\nNow, we are given that each term in the sequence is $P+n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $59$. Since $n$ is going from $2$ to $59$, all the terms in the sequence are greater than $P$, which is the product of all primes less than or equal to $61$. Therefore, no term in this sequence is a prime number since all terms are greater than $P$.\n\nTherefore, the number of primes in this sequence is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to ?: Okay, so we know $P$ is the product of all the primes less than or equal to $61$, which is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\ldots \\times 61$. This is a pretty big number. \n\nNow, we are given that each term in the sequence is $P+n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $59$.
