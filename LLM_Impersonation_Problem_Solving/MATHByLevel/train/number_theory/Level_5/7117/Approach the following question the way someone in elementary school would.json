    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. You are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$. Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\n",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay so we have a sequence of $58$ terms given by $P+n$, where $P$ is the product of prime numbers less than or equal to $61$ and $n$ ranges from $2$ to $59$. We need to find how many primes appear in this sequence.\n\nLet's start by finding the product $P$ of all primes less than or equal to $61$: $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times \\cdots \\times 61$. We could do this by hand but it would take too long, so let's think of a faster way.\n\nTo find the total number of primes less than $61$, we simply need to do $\\frac{61}{\\ln 61}$, as given by the Prime Number Theorem, which approximates the number of primes less than a number $n$ as $\\frac{n}{\\ln n}$. Then, we find the $n$th prime number, where $n$ is the total number of primes less than $61$. This would be a faster way to find the product $P$.\n\nNow, back to the sequence. Since $P$ itself is a product of consecutive prime numbers, $P$ will have very few divisors, possibly only $2, P, 1$. This means that the sequence will not have many primes, if any at all. In fact, since every term is $P$ plus a positive integer, every prime $p$ will have one term with $2+p$, which is not prime. Since there are a total of $16$ primes less than $61$, and each prime $p$ only appears once, the number of primes in the sequence is $16$, giving us answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 16}$.",
