    "solution": "We must have that $p^3+7+3p^2+6+p^2+p+3+p^2+2p+5+6=p^2+4p+2+2p^2+7p+1+3p^2+6p$, meaning that $p^3-p^2-14p+24=0$. But the only prime solutions of this can be factors of $24$, i.e. $2$ and $3$. But $7$ is not a digit in base $2$ or $3$, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ possible $p$!\n\nRemark: $2$ and $3$ are, in fact, roots of this polynomial.",

Let's start by adding up the numbers on both sides of the equation. \n\nOn the left side, when we add $1007_p + 306_p + 113_p + 125_p + 6_p$, we get a number in base $p$. We can combine all the numbers to get a single number. \n\nOn the right side, when we add $142_p + 271_p + 360_p$, we also get a number in base $p$. \n\nNow, we want to find out how many different values of $p$ can make the two sides equal. Let's try different values of $p$ and see if we can make them equal. \n\nFor example, let's try $p=2$. We can convert all the numbers on both sides of the equation to base $10$ and check if they are equal. If they are, then $p=2$ works. \n\nLet's try different values of $p$ and see how many times we can make the two sides equal. The number of times we can make the two sides equal will tell us how many possible values of $p$ there are. \n\nLet's do some math and see how many possible values of $p$ we can find!",
