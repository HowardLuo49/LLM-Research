    "solution": "We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits. Every one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \\cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits. Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\\cdots+9)(72) \\times 100 = 45 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 100 = 324000$.\nEvery one of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it. Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$). Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 10 = 28800$.\nThe same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 1 = 2880$. Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\\boxed{680}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first note that there are a total of $9 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 = 648$ three-digit positive integers with three distinct digits. \n\nNext, we find the sum of all these numbers. Let's denote the sum of the hundreds digit, tens digit, and units digit as $a, b,$ and $c$ respectively. The sum of all the three-digit positive integers with distinct digits can then be written as:\n\n$S = 100a + 10b + c + 100a + 10c + b + 100b + 10a + c + 100b + 10c + a + 100c + 10a + b + 100c + 10b + a + 100b + 10a + c + 100c + 10b + a$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$S = 222(100a + 10b + c) + 222(100b + 10c + a) + 222(100c + 10a + b)$\n\n$S = 222(111a + 111b + 111c)$\n\n$S = 222 \\cdot 111(a + b + c)$\n\n$S = 24642(a + b + c)$\n\nAs the hundreds digit, tens digit, and units digit can range from $1$ to $9$, the sum of the digits $a+b+c$ can range from $1+2+3=6$ to $7+8+9=24$.
