    "solution": "We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits. Every one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \\cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits. Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\\cdots+9)(72) \\times 100 = 45 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 100 = 324000$.\nEvery one of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it. Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$). Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 10 = 28800$.\nThe same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 1 = 2880$. Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\\boxed{680}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's see. We need to find the sum of all the three-digit numbers with three different digits. Hmm... let's start by listing out all the possible three-digit numbers with three distinct digits: 123, 124, 125, ..., 987, 986, 987. \n\nTo find the sum, let's try to pair up the numbers that have the same place values. For the hundreds place, we have 1 showing up in the hundreds place 8 times, so the sum of the hundreds place values would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9 = 45. \n\nFor the tens place, we have 123 + 124 + 125 + ... + 986 + 987, and there are 2 of each digit showing up in the tens place, so we have 2(0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 9) = 90.\n\nFor the ones place, it's the same as the tens place, so we also get 90.\n\nAdding these up, we get 45 + 90 + 90 = 225. \n\nNow, when we divide 225 by 1000, we get a remainder of $\\boxed{225}$.",
