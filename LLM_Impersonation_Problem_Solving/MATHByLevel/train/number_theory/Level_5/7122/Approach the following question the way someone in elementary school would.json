    "solution": "We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits. Every one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \\cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits. Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\\cdots+9)(72) \\times 100 = 45 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 100 = 324000$.\nEvery one of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it. Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$). Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 10 = 28800$.\nThe same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 1 = 2880$. Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\\boxed{680}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what three digit positive integers with three distinct digits means. This means that each number must have three different digits, like 123 or 456 or 789. We need to find the sum of all of these numbers.\n\nTo do this, let's think about each place value - the hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place. We can fill these in with different digits to make a unique number. \n\nIn the hundreds place, we can put any digit from 1 to 9 (since it's a three digit number and we can't have 0 in the hundreds place). In the tens place, we can put any digit from 0 to 9 (except for the digit we put in the hundreds place). In the ones place, we can put any digit from 0 to 9 (except for the digits we put in the hundreds and tens places).\n\nSo for each number we create, we can choose 9 options for the hundreds place, 9 options for the tens place, and 8 options for the ones place. This gives us a total of $9 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 648$ different numbers.\n\nNow we need to find the sum of all of these numbers. Let's add up the digits in each place value. In the hundreds place, the sum will be $9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 45$. In the tens place, the sum will be $0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45$. In the ones place, the sum will be $0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45$.\n\nTo get the sum of all these three-digit numbers, we multiply the digit sums in each place by the appropriate place value (100 for hundreds, 10 for tens, and 1 for ones) and add them all up. So the sum $S$ is $45 \\times 100 + 45 \\times 10 + 45 \\times 1 = 4500 + 450 + 45 = 4995$.\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when $S$ is divided by 1000. This means we need to find the last three digits of $S$. Since $4995$ has the last three digits as $995$, the remainder when $S$ is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{995}$.",
