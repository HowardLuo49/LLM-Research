    "solution": "Multiplying out all of the denominators, we get:\n\\begin{align*}104(n+k) &< 195n< 105(n+k)\\\\ 0 &< 91n - 104k < n + k\\end{align*}\nSince $91n - 104k < n + k$, $k > \\frac{6}{7}n$. Also, $0 < 91n - 104k$, so $k < \\frac{7n}{8}$. Thus, $48n < 56k < 49n$. $k$ is unique if it is within a maximum range of $112$, so $n = \\boxed{112}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest positive integer $n$, we need to see when we have only one integer $k$ that makes the fractions in between $\\frac{8}{15}$ and $\\frac{7}{13}$. We can start by trying out some numbers.\n\nLet's start with $n = 1$. If $n = 1$, then our fractions become $\\frac{8}{9}$ and $\\frac{7}{14}$. There are many values of $k$ that work for both of these fractions, so $n=1$ doesn't work.\n\nLet's try $n = 2$. The fractions become $\\frac{8}{10}$ and $\\frac{7}{15}$. For $n=2$, we can find a unique integer $k$ that makes these fractions work \u2013 for example, $k=2$. So, $n=2$ is a possible answer.\n\nWe can keep trying higher numbers for $n$ until we find the largest one that works. This process might take a bit of trial and error, but we can eventually find the largest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the condition.",
