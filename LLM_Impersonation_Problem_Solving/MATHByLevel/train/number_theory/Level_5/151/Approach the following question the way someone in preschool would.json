School begins on Monday, September 4. What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts? (If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)",
    "solution": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So, we know that every month with 5 Mondays is a Marvelous Monday! Let's see, September starts on a Monday, so that's 1 Monday. Then we have September 11, 18, and 25. That's 4 Mondays in September... so the first Marvelous Monday after school starts is October 30! Yay for Marvelous Mondays!",
