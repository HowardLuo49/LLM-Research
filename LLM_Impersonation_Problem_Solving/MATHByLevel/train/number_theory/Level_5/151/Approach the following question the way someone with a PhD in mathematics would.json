School begins on Monday, September 4. What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts? (If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)",
    "solution": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts, we need to first identify the fifth Mondays in the month after September 4. \n\nIn September 2017, Mondays fall on the following dates: 4th, 11th, 18th, and 25th. There are no fifth Mondays in September, so the first Marvelous Monday after school starts will occur in October. \n\nIn October 2017, Mondays fall on the following dates: 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th.
