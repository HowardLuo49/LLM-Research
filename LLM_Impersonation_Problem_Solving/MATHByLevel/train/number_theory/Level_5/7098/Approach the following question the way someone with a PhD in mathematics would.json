    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For each positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-four representation of $n$ and let $g(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-eight representation of $f(n)$. For example, $f(2020) = f(133210_{\\text{4}}) = 10 = 12_{\\text{8}}$, and $g(2020) = \\text{the digit sum of }12_{\\text{8}} = 3$. Let $N$ be the least value of $n$ such that the base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Let's work backwards. The minimum base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ that cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$ is $A_{16}$, which is equal to $10$ in base 10. Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-eight representation of the sum of the digits of $f(n)$ is $10$. The minimum value for which this is achieved is $37_8$. We have that $37_8 = 31$. Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-four representation of $n$ is $31$. The minimum value for which this is achieved is $13,333,333,333_4$. We just need this value in base 10 modulo 1000. We get $13,333,333,333_4 = 3(1 + 4 + 4^2 + \\dots + 4^8 + 4^9) + 4^{10} = 3\\left(\\dfrac{4^{10} - 1}{3}\\right) + 4^{10} = 2*4^{10} - 1$. Taking this value modulo $1000$, we get the final answer of $\\boxed{151}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by computing $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ explicitly. \n\nGiven a positive integer $n$, we want to find $f(n)$ which is the sum of the digits in the base-four representation of $n$. To do this, we can find the remainder of $n$ when divided by $4$ and add that to $f(\\frac{n}{4})$. This process can be continued recursively until $n=0$. \n\nOnce we have $f(n)$, we want to find $g(n)$ which is the sum of the digits in the base-eight representation of $f(n)$. Similar to before, we can find the remainder of $f(n)$ when divided by $8$ and add that to $g(\\frac{f(n)}{8})$. \n\nNow, we need to repeat this process for increasing values of $n$ until we find the smallest $n$ such that the base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$. \n\nThis process could be very time consuming to implement, so we might want to consider some properties or patterns that could simplify the computation. For example, we could look for cyclical patterns in the values of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ that would allow us to predict when the base-sixteen representation will contain a letter. \n\nOnce we have found $N$, we can find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ to get our final answer. \n\nOverall, this problem requires a solid understanding of number theory, base representations, and recursive functions to efficiently solve.",
