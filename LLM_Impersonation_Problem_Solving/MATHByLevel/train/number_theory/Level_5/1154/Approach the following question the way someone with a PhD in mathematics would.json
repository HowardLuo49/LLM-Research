    "solution": "Note that $9^{1995} \\equiv 2^{1995} \\pmod{7}$.  Also, note that $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Therefore, \\[2^{1995} = 2^{3 \\cdot 665} = (2^3)^{665} \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{7}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic and the property of remainders of powers.\n\nSince $9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, we can rewrite $9^{1995}$ as $(2^{1})^{1995}$. Using the property of remainders of powers, we know that the remainder when a number is raised to a power can be found by taking the remainder of the base after each multiplication, and only considering the remainder.\n\nTherefore, $(2^{1})^{1995} \\equiv 2^{1995} \\pmod{7}$. \n\nNow, we can find the remainder of $2^{1995}$ when divided by 7 by observing the pattern of remainders of powers of 2 modulo 7. \n\n$2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n$2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n$2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n$2^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n\nWe can see that the remainders of powers of 2 repeat with a period of 3.
