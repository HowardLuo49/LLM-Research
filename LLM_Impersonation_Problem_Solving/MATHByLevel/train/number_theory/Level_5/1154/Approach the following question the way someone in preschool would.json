    "solution": "Note that $9^{1995} \\equiv 2^{1995} \\pmod{7}$.  Also, note that $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Therefore, \\[2^{1995} = 2^{3 \\cdot 665} = (2^3)^{665} \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{7}.\\]",

When we keep going and divide by 7, we find that the remainders repeat in a pattern.\n\nSo when we keep going all the way to $9^{1995}$ and divide by 7, we find that the remainder is the same as $9^{3}$, which is 729.\n\nSo the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7 is 3.
