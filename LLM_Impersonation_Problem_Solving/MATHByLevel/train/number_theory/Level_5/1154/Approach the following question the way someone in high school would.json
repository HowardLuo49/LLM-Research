    "solution": "Note that $9^{1995} \\equiv 2^{1995} \\pmod{7}$.  Also, note that $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Therefore, \\[2^{1995} = 2^{3 \\cdot 665} = (2^3)^{665} \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{7}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7, we can use the concept of remainders in modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, we can simplify $9^{1995}$ by looking at the patterns of remainders when powers of 9 are divided by 7. We can calculate a few powers of 9 and see what their remainders are when divided by 7:\n\n$9^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ \n\n$9^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ \n\n$9^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ \n\n$9^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ \n\n$9^5 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ \n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that $9^3$ is congruent to 1 when divided by 7. \n\nNow, we can express $9^{1995}$ as $(9^3)^{665}$, as $1995 = 3 \\times 665$. \n\nTherefore, $9^{1995} \\equiv (9^3)^{665} \\equiv 1^{665} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nSo, the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7 is 1.",
