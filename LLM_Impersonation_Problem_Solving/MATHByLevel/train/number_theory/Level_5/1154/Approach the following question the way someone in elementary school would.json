    "solution": "Note that $9^{1995} \\equiv 2^{1995} \\pmod{7}$.  Also, note that $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Therefore, \\[2^{1995} = 2^{3 \\cdot 665} = (2^3)^{665} \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{7}.\\]",

To find the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7, we can start by finding patterns.\n\nIf we start by finding the remainders of $9^1$, $9^2$, $9^3$, and so on when divided by 7, we will notice a pattern. \n\n$9^1 = 9 \\text{ (remainder 2)}$\n\n$9^2 = 81 = 11 \\times 7 + 4 \\text{ (remainder 4)}$\n\n$9^3 = 729 = 104 \\times 7 + 1 \\text{ (remainder 1)}$\n\n$9^4 = 6561 = 937 \\times 7 + 1 \\text{ (remainder 1)}$\n\nFrom the pattern we see that the remainders repeat every 4th power.
