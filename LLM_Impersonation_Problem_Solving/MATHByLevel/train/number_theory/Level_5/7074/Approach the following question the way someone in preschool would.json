The first crate is placed flat on the floor. Each of the remaining nine crates is placed, in turn, flat on top of the previous crate, and the orientation of each crate is chosen at random. Let $\\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that the stack of crates is exactly $41\\mathrm{ft}$ tall, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m$.\n",
    "solution": "Only the heights matter, and each crate is either 3, 4, or 6 feet tall with equal probability. We have the following:\n\\begin{align*}3a + 4b + 6c &= 41\\\\ a + b + c &= 10\\end{align*}\nSubtracting 3 times the second from the first gives $b + 3c = 11$, or $(b,c) = (2,3),(5,2),(8,1),(11,0)$. The last doesn't work, obviously. This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$. In terms of choosing which goes where, the first two solutions are analogous.\nFor $(5,2,3),(3,5,2)$, we see that there are $2\\cdot\\dfrac{10!}{5!2!3!} = 10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7$ ways to stack the crates. For $(1,8,1)$, there are $2\\dbinom{10}{2} = 90$. Also, there are $3^{10}$ total ways to stack the crates to any height.\nThus, our probability is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 90}{3^{10}} = \\dfrac{10\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 10}{3^{8}} = \\dfrac{570}{3^8} = \\dfrac{190}{3^{7}}$. Our answer is the numerator, $\\boxed{190}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, let's stack these crates and see how tall they get! We have to put the first crate flat on the floor, so that's $6\\mathrm{ft}$ tall. Then, we can randomly choose to stack the next crate with any of its three dimensions facing up. Since each crate is $6\\mathrm{ft}$ tall, we need to find out how many ways we can stack the crates to get to exactly $41\\mathrm{ft}$ tall.\n\nLet's see how many ways we can stack the crates to get to a height of $41\\mathrm{ft}$. We can calculate this by finding the number of ways to reach $35\\mathrm{ft}$ (since we already have $6\\mathrm{ft}$) and then adding the number of ways to reach that extra $6\\mathrm{ft}$.\n\nTo reach $35\\mathrm{ft}$, we need to stack $5$ more crates.
