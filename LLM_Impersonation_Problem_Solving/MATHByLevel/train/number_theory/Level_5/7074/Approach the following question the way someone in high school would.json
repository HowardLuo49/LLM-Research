    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Ten identical crates each of dimensions $3\\mathrm{ft}\\times 4\\mathrm{ft}\\times 6\\mathrm{ft}$. The first crate is placed flat on the floor. Each of the remaining nine crates is placed, in turn, flat on top of the previous crate, and the orientation of each crate is chosen at random. Let $\\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that the stack of crates is exactly $41\\mathrm{ft}$ tall, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m$.\n",
    "solution": "Only the heights matter, and each crate is either 3, 4, or 6 feet tall with equal probability. We have the following:\n\\begin{align*}3a + 4b + 6c &= 41\\\\ a + b + c &= 10\\end{align*}\nSubtracting 3 times the second from the first gives $b + 3c = 11$, or $(b,c) = (2,3),(5,2),(8,1),(11,0)$. The last doesn't work, obviously. This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$. In terms of choosing which goes where, the first two solutions are analogous.\nFor $(5,2,3),(3,5,2)$, we see that there are $2\\cdot\\dfrac{10!}{5!2!3!} = 10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7$ ways to stack the crates. For $(1,8,1)$, there are $2\\dbinom{10}{2} = 90$. Also, there are $3^{10}$ total ways to stack the crates to any height.\nThus, our probability is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 90}{3^{10}} = \\dfrac{10\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 10}{3^{8}} = \\dfrac{570}{3^8} = \\dfrac{190}{3^{7}}$. Our answer is the numerator, $\\boxed{190}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out how many possible ways the crates can be stacked. For each crate, there are 3 possible ways to stack it: a 4 ft side on top, a 6 ft side on top, or a 3 ft side on top. Since there are 9 additional crates being stacked on top of the first one, the total number of possible ways to stack the crates is $3^9$.\n\nNow we need to determine how many of these ways result in a stack that is exactly 41 ft tall. Since each crate can add 3, 4, or 6 ft to the height of the stack, the total height after stacking 9 additional crates will always be a multiple of 3 ft. Therefore, it is impossible to reach a stack height of 41 ft.\n\nSince there are no possible ways for the stack height to be exactly 41 ft tall, the probability $\\frac{m}{n}$ is 0, and thus $m = \\boxed{0}$.",
