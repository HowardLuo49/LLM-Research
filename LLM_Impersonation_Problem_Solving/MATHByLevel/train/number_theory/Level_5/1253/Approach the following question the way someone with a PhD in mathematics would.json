    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number with its digits all different whose digits add up to 16, we want to maximize the leftmost digit as this will increase the overall value of the number. Since all digits must be different and the sum must be 16, the leftmost digit must be as large as possible. \n\nLet's start by trying to maximize the leftmost digit. The largest digit is 9, so we will start by placing 9 as the leftmost digit. This leaves us with 16 - 9 = 7 for the remaining digits. \n\nTo further maximize the number, we will place the next largest digit, which is 8, as the next digit. This leaves us with 7 - 8 = -1, which is not possible. Therefore, we backtrack and try placing the next largest digit, which is 7, as the next digit. This leaves us with 7 - 7 = 0, so we have successfully used all digits. \n\nTherefore, the largest number with its digits all different whose digits add up to 16 is 987.",
