    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. An integer $n$ is said to be square-free if the only perfect square that divides $n$ is $1^2$. How many positive odd integers greater than 1 and less than $100$ are square-free?",
    "solution": "If an integer $n$ is not square-free, then there is a square greater than $1$ that does divide $n$. The odd squares less than $100$ are $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$, and $9^2 = 81$. If an integer is divisible by $81$, then it is divisible by $9$, so we will only consider $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. There are $11$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $100$. Six of them are odd and five are even. There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$. Two of them are odd and one is even. There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$. One of them is odd and one is even. Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free. The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100. Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1. There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the odd numbers less than 100 that are not square-free. The perfect squares less than 100 are $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2$, and $9^2$, which is a total of $9$ perfect squares.\nEach even perfect square has an odd root, so let's find the odd perfect squares less than 100 that we need to count. These are $3^2$ and $5^2$, so there are $2$ odd perfect squares less than 100.\nSo, there are $9$ even perfect squares and $2$ odd perfect squares less than 100, for a total of $11$ numbers that are not square-free. Since there are $50$ odd numbers less than 100, the number of odd numbers that are square-free is $50 - 11 = 39$.",
