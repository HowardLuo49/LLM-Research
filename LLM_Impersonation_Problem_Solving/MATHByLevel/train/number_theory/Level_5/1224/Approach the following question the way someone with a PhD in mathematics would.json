    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If we let $f(n)$ denote the sum of all the positive divisors of the integer $n$, how many integers $i$ exist such that $1 \\le i \\le 2010$ and $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$?",
    "solution": "Note firstly that $f(i)$ must be an integer, so this means that $i$ must be a perfect square in order for $\\sqrt{i}$ to be an integer. Out of the perfect squares, we claim that $i$ must be the square of some prime $p$. For if $\\sqrt{i}$ is composite, then it can be written as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$ and we find $f(i) \\ge 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i + a + b > 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. Moreover, if $\\sqrt{i}$ is prime, then the only factors of $i$ are 1, $\\sqrt{i}$, and $i$, so $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ as desired. It follows that we only need to calculate the number of primes less than $\\sqrt{2010}$. Since $\\sqrt{2010} < 45$, the desired set of primes is $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\\}$. The set has $\\boxed{14}$ elements.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we first need to understand the properties of the sum of divisors function, denoted by $f(n)$. \n\nThe sum of positive divisors function is a multiplicative function, which means that if we have two coprime integers $a$ and $b$, then $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$. \n\nUsing this property, we can break down the equation $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ into its prime factors. Let's assume that $i$ can be expressed as $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ are positive integers. \n\nThen, we have $f(i) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + ... + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_2^{a_2})...(1 + p_k + p_k^2 + ... + p_k^{a_k})$. \n\nGiven the equation $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$, we can expand the right-hand side in a similar fashion and compare coefficients. This comparison will allow us to derive constraints on the prime factors $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ and their respective exponents $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$. \n\nBy carefully analyzing the constraints, we can count the number of possible integers $i$ that satisfy the given equation within the specified range $1 \\le i \\le 2010.",
