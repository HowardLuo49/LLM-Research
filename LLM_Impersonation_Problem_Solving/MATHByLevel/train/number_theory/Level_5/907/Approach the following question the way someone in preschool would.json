    "solution": "Let us iterate over larger and larger positive integers for $k$. If $k=1$, then $p^2-k = p^2-1 = (p+1)(p-1)$. Since $p$ is odd, both $p+1$ and $p-1$ are even, so therefore $p^2-1$ is divisible by 4. Also, since $p$ is not divisible by 3, then $p$ must either be one greater or two greater than a multiple of 3, which means that $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3, respectively. As a result, $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 4, so it is divisible by 12. Therefore, we have $\\boxed{k = 1}$.",

Then we have to figure out the smallest number we can take away from the square of that big number to make it divisible by 12. That means we have to find a number that can be divided by 12 without leaving a remainder. \n\nLet's think about it like this: if we have a number that ends in 2 zeros, like 100 or 200 or 300, then we can divide it by 12 easily because 100, 200, and 300 are all divisible by 4 (which means they're also divisible by 12). \n\nSo maybe if we find the biggest prime number with 2010 digits, square it, and then subtract a number that ends in 2 zeros, we can make it divisible by 12. The smallest number we can subtract is 100, so k = 100!\n\nYay, we did it!",
