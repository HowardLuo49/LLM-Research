    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8 + 1$, we first need to simplify the expression. We know that $a^2 + b^2$ can be factored as $(a+b)(a-b)$, so we can try to use this identity.\n\nLet $a = 2019^4$ and $b = 1$. Then, we have:\n\n$$2019^8 + 1 = (2019^4 + 1)(2019^4 - 1)$$\n$$= (2019^4 + 1)(2019^2 + 1)(2019^2 - 1)$$\n$$= (2019^4 + 1)(2019^2 + 1)(2019 + 1)(2019 - 1)$$\n\nWe know that $2019 - 1 = 2018$ is divisible by 2, so we can ignore it. Now we have:\n\n$$(2019^4 + 1)(2019^2 + 1)(2019 + 1)$$\n\nNow, we can test the divisibility of each factor by odd primes. Starting with the smallest odd prime, 3, we find that $2019 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, $2019^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, and $2019^4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Thus, $2019^4 + 1$ is not divisible by 3.\n\nMoving on to the next odd prime, 5, we find that $2019 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, $2019^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, and $2019^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Therefore, $2019^4 + 1$ is divisible by 5.\n\nThus, the least odd prime factor of $2019^8 + 1$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
