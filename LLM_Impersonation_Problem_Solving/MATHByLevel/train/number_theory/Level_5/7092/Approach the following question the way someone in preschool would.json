    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, to find the least odd prime factor of this big number we need to break it down. First, let's start by finding the prime factors of 2019. \n\n2019 is an odd number, so we know that 2 is not a factor. Let's try dividing by the next smallest prime number, 3. \n\n2019 divided by 3 is 673. So 2019 can be written as 3 x 673. \n\nNow, we need to find the prime factorization of $2019^8+1$. If we substitute in the prime factorization of 2019, we get:\n\n$(3 x 673)^8 + 1$\n\nWe know that adding 1 won't change the prime factorization, so we can just focus on the first part, which is $(3 x 673)^8$. \n\nWhen we expand that, we get a really big number. But if we look closer, we can see that 3 is a factor of every term in that expansion. And since we're looking for the least odd prime factor, we can cancel out the factor of 3. \n\nSo, the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$ is 673. Yay, we did it!",
