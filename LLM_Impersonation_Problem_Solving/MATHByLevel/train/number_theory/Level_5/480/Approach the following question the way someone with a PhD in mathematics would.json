    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, we need to consider the relationship between $n$ and $g(n)$.\n\nWe know that $g(n)$ is the product of the proper divisors of $n$. Therefore, if any proper divisor of $n$ is equal to $n$, then $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$.\n\nLet's examine each possible value of $n$ from 2 to 50. For any prime number $p$, the only proper divisor of $p$ is 1. Therefore, for any prime number $p$, $p$ does not divide $g(p)$.\n\nFor composite numbers $n$, we know that $1 < d < n$ divides $n$. Therefore, $n$ will divide $g(n)$ unless $n$ is a perfect square. In the case where $n$ is a perfect square, $n$'s square root is also a proper divisor of $n$, distinct from $n$ itself. Thus, $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.\n\nHence, the values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ are perfect squares within the range from 2 to 50.\n\nWe need to find the number of perfect squares in the range from 2 to 50. Since the largest perfect square less than or equal to 50 is $7^2 = 49$, we have perfect squares 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49, making a total of 6 values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
