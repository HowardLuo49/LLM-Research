    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so $g(n)$ is the product of all the numbers that divide $n$ except for $n$ itself. We want to find out how many numbers $n$ from 2 to 50 do not divide $g(n)$.\n\nLet's try a couple of examples to understand this better. \nFor $n = 6$, the proper divisors are 1, 2 and 3. So $g(6) = 2*3 = 6$ and 6 does divide 6. So 6 is not one of the values we are looking for.\nFor $n = 8$, the proper divisors are 1, 2, and 4. So $g(8) = 2*4 = 8$ and 8 does divide 8. So 8 is not one of the values we are looking for.\nFor $n = 10$, the proper divisors are 1, 2, and 5. So $g(10) = 2*5 = 10$ and 10 does divide 10.

For 2, $g(2) = 1$ since 2 only has 1 as a proper divisor. Since 2 does not divide 1, 2 is one of the numbers we are looking for.\nWe keep checking and we find that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, and 50 are the numbers from 2 to 50 that do not divide $g(n)$.\n\nSo there are 17 values of n from 2 to 50 that do not divide $g(n)$.",
