(Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many values of $n$ there are such that $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, we can start by listing out all the possible values of $n$ from $2$ to $50$ and calculating $g(n)$ for each of them.\n\nLet's start with $n=2$. The proper divisors of $2$ are $1$, so $g(2) = 1$. Since $2$ does not divide $1$, we have one value of $n$ that satisfies the condition.\n\nNext, let's try $n=3$. The proper divisors of $3$ is $1$, so $g(3) = 1$. Since $3$ does not divide $1$, we have one more value of $n$ that satisfies the condition.\n\nWe continue this process for $n=4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 50$ until we have checked all values of $n$.\n\nAfter checking all values, we find that the values of $n$ that do not divide $g(n)$ are $2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47$.\n\nTherefore, there are $16$ values of $n$ such that $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, when $2 \\le n \\le 50$.",
