    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $S(n)$ equal the sum of the digits of positive integer $n$. For example, $S(1507) = 13$. For a particular positive integer $n$, $S(n) = 1274$. Which of the following could be the value of $S(n+1)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 12\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1265$\n",
    "solution": "Note that $n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{9}$. This can be seen from the fact that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n}10^{k}a_k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k \\pmod{9}$. Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$, then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$, and thus $n+1 \\equiv S(n+1) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$. The only answer choice that is $6 \\pmod{9}$ is $\\boxed{1239}$.",

For example, if we have the number 1507, $S(1507)$ would be 1+5+0+7 = 13!\n\nNow, we have a number where $S(n) = 1274$. Wow, that's a big number! But don't worry, we can still have fun with it. We want to find what $S(n+1)$ could be. So, if we add 1 to the number n, what could the sum of the digits be?\n\nLet's think about it together. Maybe we could start with the number 1. If we add 1 to 1274, we get 1275. What is $S(1275)$? Let's add up the digits: 1+2+7+5 = 15. Yay!\n\nSo, the answer could be 15! Oh no, that's not one of the answer choices. Let's look back at what we found. Maybe we made a mistake or missed something.\n\nOh, wait! We forgot to check if the sum could be another number too. Let's think about it some more and try to find the right answer. Good luck!",
