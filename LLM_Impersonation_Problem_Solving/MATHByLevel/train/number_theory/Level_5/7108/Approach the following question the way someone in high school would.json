    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $S(n)$ equal the sum of the digits of positive integer $n$. For example, $S(1507) = 13$. For a particular positive integer $n$, $S(n) = 1274$. Which of the following could be the value of $S(n+1)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 12\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1265$\n",
    "solution": "Note that $n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{9}$. This can be seen from the fact that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n}10^{k}a_k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k \\pmod{9}$. Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$, then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$, and thus $n+1 \\equiv S(n+1) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$. The only answer choice that is $6 \\pmod{9}$ is $\\boxed{1239}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the possible values of $S(n+1)$ given that $S(n) = 1274$. Since $S(n)$ is 1274, the sum of the digits of $n$ is 1274. To find $S(n+1)$, we first need to realize that adding 1 to a number will increase the sum of the digits by 1. Therefore, $S(n+1)$ must be one more than $S(n)$. \n\nIf $S(n) = 1274$, then $S(n+1)$ could equal $1274 + 1 = 1275$. This is not one of the options, so let's think again. Another possibility is $S(n) = 1274$, so $S(n+1)$ could be $1274 + 10 = 1284$. This is also not one of the options. Let's keep trying. \n\nOk, we know that $S(n+1)$ must be one more than $S(n)$, so let's consider the answer choices given. We see that $1239$ could be a possible value of $S(n+1)$ because it is only one less than $1274$, which fits our requirement. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239}$.",
