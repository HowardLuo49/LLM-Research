    "solution": "$150=2^13^15^2$.  Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$.  So the number of possible factors is\n\n$$(10)(14)(7)=\\boxed{980}$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of natural-number factors of $n$ that are multiples of 150, we need to consider the prime factorization of 150, which is $2^{1} \\cdot 3^{1} \\cdot 5^{2}$. \n\nA factor of $n$ will be a multiple of 150 if it contains at least $1$ factor of $2$, $1$ factor of $3$, and $2$ factors of $5$. Therefore, we can construct such factors by choosing from the exponents of the prime factorization of $n$.\n\nFor the factor to contain at least $1$ factor of $2$, we can choose from $0$ to $10$ factors of $2$.\nFor the factor to contain at least $1$ factor of $3$, we can choose from $0$ to $14$ factors of $3$.\nFor the factor to contain at least $2$ factors of $5$, we must choose exactly $2$ factors of $5$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of $n$ that are multiples of 150 is:\n\n$$(10+1) \\cdot (14+1) \\cdot 1 = 11 \\cdot 15 = 165$$\n\nSo, there are 165 natural-number factors of $n$ that are multiples of 150.",
