    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",
    "solution": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to find sets $S_i$ where none of the numbers in the set are perfect squares.\n\nLet's start with $S_0$. The numbers in $S_0$ range from 0 to 99. The only perfect squares in this range are $0^2 = 0$, $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$, $5^2 = 25$, $6^2 = 36$, $7^2 = 49$, $8^2 = 64$, and $9^2 = 81$. So $S_0$ contains a perfect square.\n\nFor $S_1$, the only perfect square in the range of numbers is $10^2 = 100$, and since that's the upper limit of our range, $S_1$ also contains a perfect square.\n\nThis pattern continues for sets $S_2$ through $S_9$ because the square of the largest integer in those ranges (20, 30, ..., 90) is between 200 and 900, which falls into the range of those sets.\n\nBut for $S_{10}$ through $S_{31}$, there are no perfect squares in those ranges. That's because the square of the largest integer in those sets is less than 1000.\n\nSo that means there are $\\boxed{22}$ sets $S_i$ out of $S_0$ through $S_{999}$ that do not contain a perfect square.",
