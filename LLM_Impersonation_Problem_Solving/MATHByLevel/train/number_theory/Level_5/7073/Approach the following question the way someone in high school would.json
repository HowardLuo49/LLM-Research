For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",
    "solution": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "To start, let's find the smallest perfect square greater than $100i$. We know that the smallest perfect square greater than $100i$ is $(\\lceil \\sqrt{100i} \\rceil)^2$, where $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$. \n\nSo, for each $i$, we want to find the smallest perfect square greater than $100i$ and the largest integer less than the square root of the square of the next hundred, $(\\lceil \\sqrt{100(i+1)} \\rceil)^2$.\n\nNow, we can compute how many $S_i$ sets do not contain a perfect square. Let's start with $i=0$. For $i=0$, we know that ${0,1,2,...,99}$ are not perfect squares so $S_0$ does not contain a perfect square.\n\nNext, move to $i=1$. The smallest perfect square greater than $100$ is $10^2=100$, so $S_1$ starts at $101$ and ends at $199$. Since $121$ and $144$ fall in this range, $S_1$ does contain perfect squares.\n\nContinue this process for each $i$ up to $999$ and count how many $S_i$ sets do not contain perfect squares. The final count will give us how many of the $S_0, S_1, S_2, ..., S_{999}$ sets do not contain a perfect square.",
