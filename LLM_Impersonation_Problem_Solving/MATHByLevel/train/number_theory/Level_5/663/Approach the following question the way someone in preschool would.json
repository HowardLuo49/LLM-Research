Suppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$. (Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's say our numbers are less than 6, so we have to use 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let's start by looking at the first equation: ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$. We know that $C$ can't be 0 because then the first number would just be $AB$, and that's not a three-digit number. So let's try out numbers for $A$ and $B$ to see what works. \n\nLet's try $A = 5$ and $B = 4$. Then we have $54_6 + C = C0_6$. In base 6, this is the same as $5*6^1 + 4*6^0 + C = C*6^1$. Simplifying, we have $30 + 4 + C = 6C$, which gives us $34 + C = 6C$, or $34 = 5C$. Since $C$ has to be less than or equal to 5, we can see that 34 is not a multiple of 5, so this doesn't work.\n\nLet's try a different set of numbers: $A = 5$ and $B = 3$. Then we have $53_6 + C = C0_6$, which simplifies to $30 + 3 + C = 6C$, or $33 + C = 6C$, or $33 = 5C$. Here, $C = 3$, so we got our first equation correct! \n\nNow we need to find $AB_6 + BA_6 = CC_6$. If $A = 5$ and $B = 3$, this simplifies to $53_6 + 35_6 = CC_6$. Converting to base 10, this is $5*6^1 + 3*6^0 + 3*6^1 + 5*6^0 = C*6^1 + C*6^0$. This simplifies to $38 + 23 = 42C$, or $61 = 42C$. Since this is not possible, our numbers of $A = 5$ and $B = 3$ do not work. \n\nLet's try a different combination of numbers and see if we can find the three-digit number ${ABC}$.",
