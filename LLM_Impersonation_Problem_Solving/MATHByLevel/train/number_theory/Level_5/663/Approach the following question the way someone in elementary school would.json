Suppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$. (Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct digits less than 6 to make our numbers. Let's start by finding what ${C_6}$ is in the first equation.\n\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all digits less than 6, $A+B<C$, and when we add ${AB_6}+{C_6}$, the result has to be a two-digit number starting with the digit $C$. So, the only digit that can make $C$ the tens place is 5.\n\nNow we can plug in $C=5$ into the first equation. We get ${AB_6}+{5_6}={50_6}$. This means $A+B$ has to be $45_6$ to add up to $50_6$. The only way to achieve this is if $A=4$ and $B=1$.\n\nNow we know that $A=4$, $B=1$, and $C=5$. We can plug these values into the second equation which is ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$. So, $41_6+14_6=55_6$. Therefore, the three-digit number ${ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",
