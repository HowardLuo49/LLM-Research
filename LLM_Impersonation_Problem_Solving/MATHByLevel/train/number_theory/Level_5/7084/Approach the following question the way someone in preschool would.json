    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $R$ be the set of all possible remainders when a number of the form $2^n$, $n$ a nonnegative integer, is divided by 1000. Let $S$ be the sum of the elements in $R$. Find the remainder when $S$ is divided by 1000.\n",
    "solution": "Note that $x \\equiv y \\pmod{1000} \\Leftrightarrow x \\equiv y \\pmod{125}$ and $x \\equiv y \\pmod{8}$. So we must find the first two integers $i$ and $j$ such that $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{125}$ and $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{8}$ and $i \\neq j$. Note that $i$ and $j$ will be greater than 2 since remainders of $1, 2, 4$ will not be possible after 2 (the numbers following will always be congruent to 0 modulo 8). Note that $2^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$ (see Euler's theorem) and $2^0,2^1,2^2,\\ldots,2^{99}$ are all distinct modulo 125 (proof below). Thus, $i = 103$ and $j =3$ are the first two integers such that $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{1000}$. All that is left is to find $S$ in mod $1000$. After some computation:\\[S = 2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+...+2^{101}+ 2^{102} = 2^{103}-1 \\equiv 8 - 1 \\mod 1000 = \\boxed{7}.\\]To show that $2^0, 2^1,\\ldots, 2^{99}$ are distinct modulo 125, suppose for the sake of contradiction that they are not. Then, we must have at least one of $2^{20}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$ or $2^{50}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$. However, writing $2^{10}\\equiv 25 - 1\\pmod{125}$, we can easily verify that $2^{20}\\equiv -49\\pmod{125}$ and $2^{50}\\equiv -1\\pmod{125}$, giving us the needed contradiction.",
    "gpt_response": "Oooh, this is a fun question! So, we want to look at what happens when we take powers of 2 and divide them by 1000. We know that when we multiply 2 by itself, we get 4, then 8, then 16, and so on. Let's see what happens when we divide those numbers by 1000 and look at the remainders.\n\nLet's start with 2\u2070. When we divide that by 1000, the remainder is 1. When we look at 2\u00b9, the remainder is 2. When we look at 2\u00b2, the remainder is 4. Do you see a pattern here? It looks like the remainders are just cycling through 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, and so on!\n\nSo, the sum of all the remainders in $R$ will be 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 2 + 4 + ... and the sum will keep repeating in this pattern. So, the sum will be 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 6 + ... \n\nWe can see that this sum will continue in a cycle of 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, so when we keep adding these numbers together, the sum will never become really big. In fact, the sum will just repeat over and over again!\n\nSince we want to find the remainder when S (the sum) is divided by 1000, we just need to find the remainder when we divide this sum by 1000. And because the sum just repeats in the pattern 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, we know that the remainder when dividing by 1000 will also be a number in that pattern.\n\nSo, the remainder when S is divided by 1000 will be 1.
