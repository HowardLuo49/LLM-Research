    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a three-digit number that is divisible by all of its distinct, non-zero digits. \n\nLet's start by looking for the largest three-digit number that fits this criteria. We know that the number must be divisible by its digits, so we can start by listing out the possible three-digit numbers and checking if each one satisfies the condition. \n\nWe can start by looking at the largest digit, which is 9. A three-digit number divisible by 9 must have a sum of its digits that is a multiple of 9. The largest sum of three distinct non-zero digits is 9+8+7=24, which is not a multiple of 9. \n\nNext, we can look at the digit 8. A three-digit number divisible by 8 must end in 8, and the hundreds digit must be even. Checking numbers that fit this criteria, we find that 864 is divisible by 8 and by 4. \n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit number that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is 864.",
