    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible combinations of three distinct non-zero digits that can form a three-digit integer. Since the integer must be divisible by each of its distinct non-zero digits, we can list out the possible combinations and check if any of them satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\nThe distinct non-zero digits that can form a three-digit integer are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. However, we can eliminate the digits 1, 5, and 9 as they cannot divide any three-digit integer.\n\nNext, we can consider the combinations of two distinct non-zero digits that can form a three-digit integer. The possible combinations are (2,4,8), (3,6), and (6,8).\n\nAmong these combinations, the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct non-zero digits is 864. This is because 864 is divisible by both 8 and 4, which are the distinct non-zero digits in this case.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct non-zero digits is 864.",
