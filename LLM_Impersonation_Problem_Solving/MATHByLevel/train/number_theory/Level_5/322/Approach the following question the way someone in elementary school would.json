    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit number that is divisible by its digits, we need to start with the hundreds place, which can be any number between 1 and 9 since it cannot be zero. Next, we need to see if the number is divisible by its tens and ones digits.\n\nLet's try starting with 9 in the hundreds place. This means our number is 9 _ _. To be divisible by its tens digit, the number must end with 3, 6, or 9 because these are the only numbers that can be divided evenly by 9. Let's try 9 in the hundreds place and 9 in the tens place, making the number 999. 9 can be divided by 9, so this number works!\n\nSo the largest three-digit number that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is 999.",
