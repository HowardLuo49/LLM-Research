    "solution": "Rewrite the expression as\\[4(5x + 1)(5x + 3)(5x+5)\\]Since $x$ is odd, let $x = 2n-1$. The expression becomes\\[4(10n-4)(10n-2)(10n)=32(5n-2)(5n-1)(5n)\\]Consider just the product of the last three terms, $5n-2,5n-1,5n$, which are consecutive. At least one term must be divisible by $2$ and one term must be divisible by $3$ then. Also, since there is the $5n$ term, the expression must be divisible by $5$. Therefore, the minimum integer that always divides the expression must be $32 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{960}$.\nTo prove that the number is the largest integer to work, consider when $x=1$ and $x = 5$. These respectively evaluate to be $1920,\\ 87360$; their greatest common factor is indeed $960$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so if $x$ is an odd number, that means it could be something like 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Let's think about the expression \\((10x+2)(10x+6)(5x+5)\\) when \\(x\\) is an odd number.\n\nLet's try substituting $x=1$ into the expression: \\((10(1)+2)(10(1)+6)(5(1)+5)=(10+2)(10+6)(5+5)=12 \\times 16 \\times 10\\). The largest integer that divides into 12, 16, and 10 is 2.\n\nNow, let's try substituting $x=3$ into the expression: \\((10(3)+2)(10(3)+6)(5(3)+5)=(30+2)(30+6)(15+5)=32 \\times 36 \\times 20\\). The largest integer that divides into 32, 36, and 20 is also 2.\n\nThis pattern seems to continue for other odd numbers as well, so it looks like the largest integer that always divides the expression is 2.",
