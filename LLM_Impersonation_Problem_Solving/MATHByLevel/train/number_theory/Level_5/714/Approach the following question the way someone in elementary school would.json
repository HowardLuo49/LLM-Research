    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to understand what \"lcm\" and \"gcd\" mean. The lcm is the Least Common Multiple and the gcd is the Greatest Common Divisor. \n\nTo find the sum of all positive integers that satisfy the equation, we need to figure out what values of n make both sides of the equation equal. \n\nLet's start by looking at n = 100. \n\nThe lcm[100, 100] = 100 and the gcd(100, 100) = 100. \n\nSo, for n = 100, the equation becomes 100 = 100 + 450, which is not true. \n\nNext, let's try n = 50. \n\nThe lcm[50, 100] = 100 and the gcd(50, 100) = 50. \n\nSo, for n = 50, the equation becomes 100 = 50 + 450, which is also not true. \n\nWe can keep trying different values of n, but it's better to look for patterns in the equation. \n\nFrom the equation, we can see that the gcd(n, 100) will always be a factor of 100. \n\nLet's look at the factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. \n\nIf we add 450 to any of these factors, we get different values. \n\nSo, the sum of all positive integers n that satisfy the equation is 0, because there are no values of n that make both sides of the equation equal. \n\nRemember, it's important to try different values and look for patterns when solving math problems like this one!",
