    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by breaking down the question. We are looking for positive integers $n$ that satisfy the given equation involving the least common multiple (lcm) and greatest common divisor (gcd) of $n$ and $100$. \n\nFirst, let's remember that the gcd of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers evenly, while the lcm of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. \n\nNow, the question asks for the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy the equation $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450$. \n\nTo solve this, we need to understand the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers. The relationship is given by the formula: \n\n$$\\text{lcm}(a, b) \\cdot \\text{gcd}(a, b) = a \\cdot b$$\n\nFrom this formula, we can see that $\\text{lcm}[n,100] \\cdot \\gcd(n,100) = 100 \\cdot n$.\n\nSubstituting this relationship into the original equation, we get:\n\n$$100 \\cdot n = \\gcd(n,100) \\cdot n + 450$$\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n$$99n = 450$$\n\nDividing both sides by $99$, we find:\n\n$$n = \\frac{450}{99} = \\frac{150}{33} = \\frac{50}{11}$$\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, the only possible solution is $n = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy the given equation is $\\boxed{4}$. \n\nThis high school-level approach should help you understand the problem and the solution process better.",
