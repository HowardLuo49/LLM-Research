    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",

We also know that $100$ is a big number that we can use to help us find the answer.\n\nThe rule we have to follow is that the product of two numbers, called the least common multiple (lcm) of $n$ and $100$, should equal the sum of the same two numbers minus a number called the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $n$ and $100$ added to $450$.\n\nSo all we have to do is find happy numbers $n$ that satisfy this rule.
