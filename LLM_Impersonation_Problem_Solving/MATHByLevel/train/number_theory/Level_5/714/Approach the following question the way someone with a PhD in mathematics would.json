    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",

Let $d = \\gcd(n,100)$. Then we have:\n\\[ n = 100 + 450d. \\]\n\nThis implies that $d$ must divide $n-100$, so $n-100 = kd$ for some positive integer $k$.

Since $\\gcd(n,100) = d$, the only possible values for $d$ are divisors of $450$. \n\nThe divisors of $450$ are $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 25, 30, 45, 50, 75, 90, 150, 225,$ and $450$.
