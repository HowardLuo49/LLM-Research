    "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all integer values of $n$ that make $\\frac{20}{2n-1}$ an integer, we can start by trying different values of $n$ and seeing which ones make the fraction into a whole number. Let's count together! \n\nWhen $n = 1$, we get $\\frac{20}{2(1) - 1} = \\frac{20}{1} = 20$, which is an integer. So we found one value that works! \n\nWhen $n = 2$, we get $\\frac{20}{2(2) - 1} = \\frac{20}{3}$, which is not an integer. \n\nWhen $n = 3$, we get $\\frac{20}{2(3) - 1} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4$, which is an integer. \n\nWe can keep trying more values of $n$ until we find them all.
