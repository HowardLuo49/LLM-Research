    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Mary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$. From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. (Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)\n",
    "solution": "Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)\nIt follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to solve this problem, we know that John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly based on her score being over 80. This means that her score must have been 81, 82, or 83, because any lower score would not uniquely determine the number of correct answers.\n\nLet's plug in the possible scores into the formula $s=30+4c-w$ and see which one works:\n- For $s=81$: $81=30+4c-w$, so $51=4c-w$. Since $4c$ must be an integer, the possible values for $w$ are 0, 1, 2, 3. But, if $w=3$, $4c=51+3=54$, which is not possible because $c$ must be between 0 and 30.\n- For $s=82$: $82=30+4c-w$, so $52=4c-w$. Possible values for $w$ are 0, 1, 2. If $w=2$, then $4c=52+2=54$, so $c=13$, which is a possible number of correct answers.\n- For $s=83$: $83=30+4c-w$, so $53=4c-w$. Possible values for $w$ are 0, 1. If $w=1$, then $4c=53+1=54$, so $c=13$, which is also a possible number of correct answers.\n\nTherefore, Mary's score on the AHSME was either 82 or 83, and she answered 13 problems correctly.",
