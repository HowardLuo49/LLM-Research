    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For a positive integer $p$, define the positive integer $n$ to be $p$-safe if $n$ differs in absolute value by more than $2$ from all multiples of $p$. For example, the set of $10$-safe numbers is $\\{ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, \\ldots\\}$. Find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ which are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe.\n",
    "solution": "We see that a number $n$ is $p$-safe if and only if the residue of $n \\mod p$ is greater than $2$ and less than $p-2$; thus, there are $p-5$ residues $\\mod p$ that a $p$-safe number can have. Therefore, a number $n$ satisfying the conditions of the problem can have $2$ different residues $\\mod 7$, $6$ different residues $\\mod 11$, and $8$ different residues $\\mod 13$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for a number $x$ that is $a$ (mod b) $c$ (mod d) $e$ (mod f) has one solution if $gcd(b,d,f)=1$. For example, in our case, the number $n$ can be: 3 (mod 7) 3 (mod 11) 7 (mod 13) so since $gcd(7,11,13)$=1, there is 1 solution for n for this case of residues of $n$.\nThis means that by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $n$ can have $2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = 96$ different residues mod $7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 1001$. Thus, there are $960$ values of $n$ satisfying the conditions in the range $0 \\le n < 10010$. However, we must now remove any values greater than $10000$ that satisfy the conditions. By checking residues, we easily see that the only such values are $10006$ and $10007$, so there remain $\\boxed{958}$ values satisfying the conditions of the problem.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, this sounds like a fun challenge! Let's start by finding the possible $7$-safe numbers. We need to find numbers that are more than $2$ away from any multiple of $7$.
