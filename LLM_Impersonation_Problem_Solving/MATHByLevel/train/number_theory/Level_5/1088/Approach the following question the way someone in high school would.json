    "solution": "Any number in $S$ has a leftmost (eights) digit that is equal to $1$. The remaining three digits can either be $0$ or $1$, so there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ elements in $S$. Notice that element $x$ in $S$ can be paired with another element $10111_2-x$, which is the base $2$ number whose right-most three digits are the opposite of those of $x$. Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is equal to $4 \\times 10111_2 = 100_2 \\times 10111_2 = \\boxed{1011100}_2$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many four-digit numbers there are in base $2$. Since a four-digit number in base $2$ ranges from $1000_2$ to $1111_2$, there are $1111_2 - 1000_2 + 1 = 111_2$ four-digit numbers in base $2$.\n\nTo find the sum of all the four-digit numbers in base $2$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n$$\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})$$\n\nIn this case, $n = 111_2$, the first term is $1000_2$, and the last term is $1111_2$.
