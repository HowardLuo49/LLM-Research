    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers that have four digits in base $2$. What is the sum of all of the elements in $S$, when expressed in base $2$?",
    "solution": "Any number in $S$ has a leftmost (eights) digit that is equal to $1$. The remaining three digits can either be $0$ or $1$, so there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ elements in $S$. Notice that element $x$ in $S$ can be paired with another element $10111_2-x$, which is the base $2$ number whose right-most three digits are the opposite of those of $x$. Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is equal to $4 \\times 10111_2 = 100_2 \\times 10111_2 = \\boxed{1011100}_2$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's understand what a positive integer with four digits in base $2$ means. \n\nIn base $2$, we only use the digits $0$ and $1$. So a positive integer with four digits in base $2$ means a number that can be expressed with four digits made up of only $0$s and $1$s. \n\nTo find out all the numbers with four digits in base $2$, we need to consider all possible combinations of $0$s and $1$s that can be arranged into four-digit numbers. There are $2^4 = 16$ possible combinations because we have 2 choices for each digit and there are 4 digits.\n\nLet's list out all the numbers with four digits in base $2$: $0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111$.\n\nNow, we want to find the sum of all these numbers in base $2$. \n\n$0000$ is $0$ in base $10$, $0001$ is $1$ in base $10$, $0010$ is $2$ in base $10$, and so on up to $1111$ which is $15$ in base $10$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the elements in $S$ when expressed in base $2$ is $0 + 1 + 2 + \\cdots + 15$.\n\n$0 + 1 + 2 + \\cdots + 15$ equals $120$ in base $10$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all the elements in $S$, when expressed in base $2$, is $1111000$.",
