    "solution": "The desired integer has at least two digits.  Let $d$ be its leftmost digit, and let $n$ be the integer that results when $d$ is deleted.  Then for some positive integer $p$, $10^p\\cdot\nd+n=29n$, and so $10^p\\cdot d=28n$. Therefore 7 is a divisor of $d$, and because $1\\le d\\le9$, it follows that $d=7$. Hence $10^p=4n$, so $\\displaystyle n={{10^p}\\over4}=\n{{100\\cdot10^{p-2}}\\over4}=25\\cdot10^{p-2}$.  Thus every positive integer with the desired property must be of the form $7\\cdot10^p+25\\cdot10^{p-2}=10^{p-2}(7\\cdot10^2+25)=725\\cdot10^{p-2}$ for some $p\\ge2$. The smallest such integer is $\\boxed{725}$.",

We need to find a number where if we delete the leftmost digit, the resulting number is 1/29 of the original number.\n\nLet's start by picking a random positive integer, say 100. If we delete the leftmost digit, we get 00 which is not a valid number. So that's not the answer.\n\nLet's try another number, let's say 200. If we delete the leftmost digit, we get 00 which again is not a valid number. So that's not the answer either.\n\nLet's keep trying different numbers until we find the right one. After some trial and error, we find that the least positive integer that satisfies the conditions is 203. If we delete the leftmost digit (2), we get 03, which is equal to 1/29 of 203.\n\nSo, the answer is 203.",
