Let $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To tackle this problem as a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics, we need to analyze the properties of $f(n)$ and understand how factorials behave.\n\nFirst, we note that $f(n)$ returns the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. This means that for the function to return a value greater than 15, we must find a number $n$ such that $k!$ is not divisible by $n$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq 15$ and then find the smallest $n$ that satisfies this condition.\n\nSince $n$ is a multiple of 15, we need to consider the factorials of numbers up to 15. We see that $15!$ is the smallest factorial divisible by all the numbers from 1 to 15. Therefore, to find the smallest $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$, we need to find a number that is not divisible by any of the numbers from 1 to 15.\n\nConsidering the prime factorization of 15, which is $3 \\cdot 5$, we observe that for $n$ to be not divisible by a number $m$, $n$ must not contain any factors of $m$. Therefore, $n$ should not contain any factors of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or 15.\n\nThe smallest number that does not contain any of these factors is the smallest common multiple of the primes from 2 to 15. This number is 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 = 30030.\n\nHence, the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$ is 30030.",
