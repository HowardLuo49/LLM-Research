    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "OK, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ that is a multiple of 15 such that $f(n) > 15$. To do that, let's start by finding the prime factorization of 15, which is $3 \\cdot 5$. \n\nNext, we need to figure out what $f(n)$ means. It wants us to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Basically, we're looking for the smallest factorial that is divisible by $n$.\n\nSince $n$ is a multiple of 15, we know that $n = 3^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. \n\nTo make $k!$ divisible by $n$, we need to have at least $a$ factors of 3 and $b$ factors of 5 in $k!$. This means we'll need at least $3^a \\cdot 5^b$ as a factor in $k!$.\n\nThe smallest value of $n = 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 15$. For $k!$ to be divisible by $15$, we need at least one factor of 3 and one factor of 5 in $k!$. The smallest value of $k$ in this case is $5$ because $5!$ has both 3 and 5 as factors.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$ is $\\boxed{75}$, which is $3^1 \\cdot 5^2$.",
