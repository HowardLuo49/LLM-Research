    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A group of 25 friends were discussing a large positive integer. ``It can be divided by 1,'' said the first friend. ``It can be divided by 2,'' said the second friend. ``And by 3,'' said the third friend. ``And by 4,'' added the fourth friend. This continued until everyone had made such a comment. If exactly two friends were incorrect, and those two friends said consecutive numbers, what was the least possible integer they were discussing?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ denote the large positive integer that everyone is discussing.\n\nThe two incorrect numbers are consecutive numbers.  To get the smallest possible value of $N$, we must maximize the incorrect numbers. As such, we should start with the highest possible incorrect numbers and work down.\n\nSuppose the two incorrect numbers are 24 and 25.  Then $N$ must still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 23.$  This means $N$ is divisible by 3 and 8, so $N$ is divisible by $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$, contradiction.  So the two incorrect numbers cannot be 24 and 25.  We can eliminate the other high cases similarly.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 22, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 11.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 20, because $N$ would still be divisible by 4 and 5.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 18, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 9.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the incorrect numbers were 16 and 17.  Then $N$ would still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 15, 18, 19, \\dots, 25$.  The lcm of these remaining numbers is\n\\[2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 = 787386600,\\]which is not divisible by 16 or 17.  Thus, the incorrect numbers can be 16 and 17, and the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{787386600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "This problem can be approached using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let the unknown integer be denoted by x. The fact that each friend claims that x is divisible by a certain number can be represented by the following system of congruences:\n\nx \u2261 0 (mod 1)\nx \u2261 0 (mod 2)\nx \u2261 0 (mod 3)\n...\nx \u2261 0 (mod 23)\nx \u2261 0 (mod 24)\nx \u2261 0 (mod 25)\n\nThese congruences imply that x is divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 25. The LCM of these numbers is 30030.\n\nNow, we know that exactly two friends were incorrect and they said consecutive numbers. This implies that x is not divisible by the number k and k+1, for some integer k. The smallest k that satisfies this condition is 11, since 11*12 = 132.\n\nTherefore, the least possible integer the friends were discussing is 30030 + 132 = 30162.",
