    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A group of 25 friends were discussing a large positive integer. ``It can be divided by 1,'' said the first friend. ``It can be divided by 2,'' said the second friend. ``And by 3,'' said the third friend. ``And by 4,'' added the fourth friend. This continued until everyone had made such a comment. If exactly two friends were incorrect, and those two friends said consecutive numbers, what was the least possible integer they were discussing?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ denote the large positive integer that everyone is discussing.\n\nThe two incorrect numbers are consecutive numbers.  To get the smallest possible value of $N$, we must maximize the incorrect numbers. As such, we should start with the highest possible incorrect numbers and work down.\n\nSuppose the two incorrect numbers are 24 and 25.  Then $N$ must still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 23.$  This means $N$ is divisible by 3 and 8, so $N$ is divisible by $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$, contradiction.  So the two incorrect numbers cannot be 24 and 25.  We can eliminate the other high cases similarly.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 22, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 11.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 20, because $N$ would still be divisible by 4 and 5.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 18, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 9.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the incorrect numbers were 16 and 17.  Then $N$ would still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 15, 18, 19, \\dots, 25$.  The lcm of these remaining numbers is\n\\[2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 = 787386600,\\]which is not divisible by 16 or 17.  Thus, the incorrect numbers can be 16 and 17, and the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{787386600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that 23 out of the 25 friends said the correct factors of this positive integer. And we also know that the two friends who were incorrect said consecutive numbers. This means that the integer can't be divisible by either of these consecutive numbers, so it must be divisible by the next number in the sequence.\n\nThe smallest set of consecutive numbers where one is a factor of the integer and the other is not is 4 and 5. So the integer must not be divisible by 4, but it must be divisible by 5. That means the integer must be at least 5 * 4 = 20.\n\nNow we need to check if any of the other statements are incorrect. The next set of consecutive numbers is 8 and 9. Since the integer must be divisible by 8, 20 is too small. So the smallest possible integer they could be discussing is 8 * 5 = 40.\n\nSo the least possible integer they were discussing is 40.",
