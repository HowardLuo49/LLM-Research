    "solution": "$\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.\nSince $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 15 \\pmod{16}$.\nIf $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k$. If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$. If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.\nThus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\\pmod{3}$.\nIt is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$. So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 24, 12 \\pmod{25}$.\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \\equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \\pmod{400}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\\boxed{112}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$, we can start by plugging in different values of $k$ into the formula $\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ and checking if the result is divisible by $200$.\n\nLet's start with $k=1$, then $1^2=1$ which is not divisible by $200$.\nNext, let's try $k=2$, then $1^2+2^2=5$ which is not divisible by $200$.\nThen, for $k=3$ we get $1^2+2^2+3^2=14$ which is also not divisible by $200$.\nTrying $k=4$, we find $1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2=30$ which is still not divisible by $200$.\nContinuing this process, we find that for $k=15$, $1^2+2^2+3^2+...+15^2=1240$ which is divisible by $200$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
