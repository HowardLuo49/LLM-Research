It is known that, for all positive integers $k$,\n$1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^{2}=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}6$.\nFind the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$.\n",
    "solution": "$\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.\nSince $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 15 \\pmod{16}$.\nIf $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k$. If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$. If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.\nThus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\\pmod{3}$.\nIt is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$. So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 24, 12 \\pmod{25}$.\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \\equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \\pmod{400}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\\boxed{112}$.",

This can be achieved by simplifying the expression and analyzing the factors of both 6 and 200.\n\nExpanding $\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$, we get $\\frac{2k^3+3k^2+k}{6}$. Factoring out a k, we have $k(\\frac{2k^2+3k+1}{6})$.\n\nSimplifying further, we get $k(\\frac{(2k+1)(k+1)}{6}) = \\frac{k(2k+1)(k+1)}{6}$.\n\nTo see if this expression is a multiple of 200, we need to analyze the factors of both 6 and 200. Since 200 can be factored into 2^3 * 5^2, we need to ensure that our expression has at least one factor of 2^3 and one factor of 5^2.\n\nBy examining the terms in the expression, we see that there is a factor of 2 in $2k+1$ and no factor of 3. Therefore, in order for the entire expression to be divisible by 6, we need to have at least two factors of 2 and one factor of 3 in either $k$, $k+1$, or $2k+1$.\n\nNext, we determine the factors of 6 in $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$:\n\n1.

If $2k+1$ is divisible by 2, then $k$ and $k+1$ are odd.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of 200 must have a factor of 4 in it since it needs to satisfy the factor of 2^3 condition.
