It is known that, for all positive integers $k$,\n$1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^{2}=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}6$.\nFind the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$.\n",
    "solution": "$\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.\nSince $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 15 \\pmod{16}$.\nIf $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k$. If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$. If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.\nThus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\\pmod{3}$.\nIt is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$. So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 24, 12 \\pmod{25}$.\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \\equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \\pmod{400}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\\boxed{112}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know the formula for adding up the squares of all the numbers from $1$ to $k$ is $\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$. We want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that this sum is a multiple of $200$.\n\nFirst, let's plug in some values of $k$ and see if the sum is a multiple of $200$. If we try $k=1$, the sum is $1^2 = 1$, which is not a multiple of $200$. If we try $k=2$, the sum is $1^2 + 2^2 = 5$, which is also not a multiple of $200$. Let's try $k=3$, the sum is $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14$, still not a multiple of $200$. Continuing in this way, we find that $k=14$ gives us $1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 14^2 = 1015$, which is a multiple of $200$ (since $1015 = 200 \\cdot 5 + 15$).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$ is $\\boxed{14}$.",
