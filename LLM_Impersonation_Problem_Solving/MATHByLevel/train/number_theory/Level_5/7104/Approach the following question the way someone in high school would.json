    "solution": "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in this form, we need to consider all possible values for $a_i$ for $0\\le i \\le 7$. Since $a_i$ can be either $-1$, $0$, or $1$, there are $3$ choices for each $a_i$, giving a total of $3^8 = 6561$ possible combinations. \n\nHowever, we are only interested in nonnegative integers. Since $a_7$ is multiplied by $3^7$, it will always be nonnegative. Therefore, $a_7$ must be either $0$ or $1$. This reduces the number of possible combinations to $2 \\cdot 3^7 = 4374$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$.",
