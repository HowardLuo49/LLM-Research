    "solution": "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in this form, we can think about each $a_i$ as being able to take on 3 different values: $-1$, $0$, or $1$. Since there are 8 $a_i$ in total, there are $3^8 = 6561$ different ways to choose values for all of them.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that not all combinations of $a_i$ will result in a nonnegative integer. For example, if all $a_i$ are $-1$, the resulting number will be negative. Similarly, if $a_7$ is $1$ and $a_i$ are $-1$ for all $i$ from 0 to 6, the resulting number will be $3^7 - 1$, which is also negative.\n\nTo find the number of nonnegative integers, we need to exclude the combinations that will result in negative integers. These are cases where $a_7 = 1$ and $a_i = -1$ for $0\\le i \\le 6$. There are 3 such combinations. Therefore, the number of nonnegative integers is $3^8 - 3 = 6561 - 3 = 6558$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 59,048}$.",
