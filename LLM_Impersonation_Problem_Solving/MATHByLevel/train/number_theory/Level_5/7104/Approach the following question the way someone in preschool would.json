    "solution": "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok! So let's start by looking at each $a_i$ value. We have three choices for each $a_i$: $-1$, $0$, or $1$. So for $a_7$, we have 3 choices, for $a_6$ we have 3 choices, and so on until $a_0$. Because we have 8 values of $a_i$ to choose, we multiply $3\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot3=3^8=6561$. \n\nBut wait! We are asked for nonnegative integers, so we cannot have $a_7=-1$. So that eliminates $3^7$ choices. So our final answer is $3^8-3^7=3281$, which is answer choice $\\textbf{(D)}$.",
