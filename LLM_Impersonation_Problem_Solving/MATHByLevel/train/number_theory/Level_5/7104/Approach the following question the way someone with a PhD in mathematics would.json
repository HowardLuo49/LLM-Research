    "solution": "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first consider the range of each $a_i$. Since $a_i\\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$, there are a total of $3$ choices for each $a_i$. There are $8$ $a_i$'s, so there are $3^8=6561$ possible ways to choose the $a_i$'s. \n\nHowever, we are asked to find the number of nonnegative integers. Notice that changing $a_i$ to $-1$ is equivalent to reducing the whole expression by $3^i$. Therefore, adding $1$ to $a_i$ is equivalent to increasing the overall value by $3^i$. This means that to ensure that the overall expression is nonnegative, we need to count the number of ways to determine the values of the $a_i$'s such that the total sum is within the range $[0,3^8-1]$.\n\nWe can approach this problem by dynamic programming. We start by setting up a $9\\times 6561$ table with rows representing the index $i$ and columns representing the total sum. We initialize the first row with a $1$ on the column corresponding to $a_0$ to make the total sum equal to $0$.\n\nThen, we iterate from $i=1$ to $i=8$. For each $i$, we iterate over the total sum range $[0,3^8-1]$. For each total sum $k$, we update the value at row $i$ and column $k$ by summing up the values from the previous row at columns $k-3^i, k-3^i+3^i$, and $k-3^i+2\\cdot3^i$.\n\nAfter going through all $i$ and total sums, we sum up the total number of possible ways in the last row of the table to get our answer.\n\nThis may seem quite complicated, but this approach efficiently and accurately calculates the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the specified form.",
