Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers satisfying the conditions\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ \\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ and\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m$ is not a multiple of $n.$\nFind the least possible value of $m+n.$\n",
    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding all the factors of 210. We can list them out: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210.\n\nNow let's look at the first condition. $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$ means that $m+n$ and 210 have no common factors other than 1. This means that $m+n$ cannot be any of the numbers we listed above.\n\nNext, let's look at the second condition. $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$. This means that $m$ has to be a multiple of $n$ because $n^n$ is a factor of $m^m$. But wait, the third condition says that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $n. That means $m$ and $n$ have to be relatively prime (no common factors)!\n\nSince $m$ and $n$ have to be relatively prime, they cannot add up to any of the factors of 210. Let's try and find the smallest pair of relatively prime numbers that have a difference that is not a factor of 210. The numbers 2 and 3 are relatively prime, and their difference is 1, which is not a factor of 210. This means that a possible pair is $m=3$ and $n=2$.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $3+2=\\boxed{5}$.",
