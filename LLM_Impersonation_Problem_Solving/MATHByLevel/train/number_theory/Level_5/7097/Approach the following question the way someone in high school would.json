Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers satisfying the conditions\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ \\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ and\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m$ is not a multiple of $n.$\nFind the least possible value of $m+n.$\n",
    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's break this down one step at a time. First, we know $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, which means that $m+n$ and $210$ are coprime. This tells us that $m+n$ and $210$ do not share any common factors other than 1.\n\nNext, we have $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, which means that $m^m$ divided by $n^n$ results in a whole number. This implies that $m$ has to have at least as many factors of $n$ as $n$ does. In other words, every prime factor of $n$ must also be a prime factor of $m$.\n\nFinally, we are told that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, so $n$ must have some prime factors that $m$ does not have.\n\nPutting it all together, we are looking for the smallest possible values of $m$ and $n$ that satisfy all these conditions.\n\nLet's start by checking prime factorizations of 210: $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. \nFrom the first two conditions, we can see that $m$ and $n$ cannot have any factors of 2, 3, 5, or 7 in common. We also know that $m$ must have at least as many factors of each prime as $n$ does.\n\nSo, the smallest possible $n$ is 2, giving $m$ as 3. \nThis satisfies all the conditions: $\\gcd(3+2,210)=1$, $3^3$ is a multiple of $2^2$, and $m$ is not a multiple of $n$. \n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is 5.",
