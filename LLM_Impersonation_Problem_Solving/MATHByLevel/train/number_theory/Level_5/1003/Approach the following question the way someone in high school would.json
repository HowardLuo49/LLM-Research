    "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\n66666_{16} &= 6\\cdot 16^4 + 6\\cdot 16^3 + 6\\cdot 16^2 + 6\\cdot 16 + 6 \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (16^4+16^3+16^2+16+1) \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= (2^2+2)\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= 2^{18}+2^{17}+2^{14}+2^{13}+2^{10}+2^9+2^6+2^5+2^2+2.\n\\end{align*}Actually, this is more detail than necessary; what is important is that $2^{18} \\le 66666_{16} < 2^{19}$, which tells us that the base-2 expression of this number has $\\boxed{19}$ digits or bits (with place values $2^{18},2^{17},2^{16},\\ldots,2^2,2^1,2^0$).",
    "gpt_response": "To convert a base-16 number to base 2, we need to know the binary representations of each hexadecimal digit. In base-16, the four hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. \n\nFor example, in base-2 conversion:\n- 0 is 0000\n- 1 is 0001\n- 2 is 0010\n- 3 is 0011\n- 4 is 0100\n- 5 is 0101\n- 6 is 0110\n- 7 is 0111\n- 8 is 1000\n- 9 is 1001\n- A is 1010\n- B is 1011\n- C is 1100\n- D is 1101\n- E is 1110\n- F is 1111\n\nGiven the hexadecimal number $66666_{16}$, we can convert it to binary as follows:\n- 6 is 0110\n- 6 is 0110\n- 6 is 0110\n- 6 is 0110\n- 6 is 0110\n\nSo $66666_{16}$ in binary is $01100110011001100110_{2}$.
