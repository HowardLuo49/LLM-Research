    "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\n66666_{16} &= 6\\cdot 16^4 + 6\\cdot 16^3 + 6\\cdot 16^2 + 6\\cdot 16 + 6 \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (16^4+16^3+16^2+16+1) \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= (2^2+2)\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= 2^{18}+2^{17}+2^{14}+2^{13}+2^{10}+2^9+2^6+2^5+2^2+2.\n\\end{align*}Actually, this is more detail than necessary; what is important is that $2^{18} \\le 66666_{16} < 2^{19}$, which tells us that the base-2 expression of this number has $\\boxed{19}$ digits or bits (with place values $2^{18},2^{17},2^{16},\\ldots,2^2,2^1,2^0$).",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many base-2 digits there are in the number $66666_{16}$, we first need to convert it into base-2.\n\nThe number $66666_{16}$ in base-10 is  409974. To convert this number into base-2, we start by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than 409974, which is $2^{18} = 262144$. Since $409974 - 262144 = 147830$, we know that the first digit in base-2 will be 1. \n\nNext, we repeat this process for the remainder (147830), finding the largest power of 2 that is less than this number, which is $2^{17} = 131072$. Since $147830 - 131072 = 16758$, the second digit in base-2 will be 0.\n\nWe continue this process until we reach the last digit. Thus, when the number $66666_{16}$ is written in base-2, it will have 18 base-2 digits (bits).\n\nTherefore, the number $66666_{16}$ when written in base-2 has 18 base-2 digits.",
