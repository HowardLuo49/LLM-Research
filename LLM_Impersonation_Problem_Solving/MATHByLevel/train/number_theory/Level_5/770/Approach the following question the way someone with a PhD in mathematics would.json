    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When the least common multiple of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor, the result is 33. If one integer is 45, what is the smallest possible value of the other integer?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the other integer, so \\[\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n]}{\\gcd(45,n)} = 33.\\]We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, so \\[\\gcd(45,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n] = 45n.\\]Dividing this equation by the previous equation, we get \\[[\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = \\frac{45n}{33} = \\frac{15n}{11},\\]so $11 [\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = 15n$.\n\nSince 11 divides the left-hand side, 11 also divides the right-hand side, which means $n$ is divisible by 11.  Also, 15 divides the right-hand side, so 15 divides the left-hand side, which means $\\gcd(45,n)$ is divisible by 15.  Since $45 = 3 \\cdot 15$, $n$ is divisible by 15.  Hence, $n$ must be divisible by $11 \\cdot 15 = 165$.\n\nNote that $\\gcd(45,165) = 15$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,165] = 495$, and $495/15 = 33$, so $n=165$ is achievable and the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{165}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can use the relationship between the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. \n\nLet the other integer be denoted as x. We know that the LCM of two integers is equal to the product of the integers divided by their GCD. Therefore, we have:\n\nLCM(45, x) = (45 * x) / GCD(45, x) = 33\n\nWe also know that the GCD of 45 and x must be a factor of both 45 and x. As 45 = 3 * 3 * 5, the GCD must contain at least a factor of 3. Therefore, x must have a factor of 3 as well. \n\nNow we can rewrite the equation with x = 3m, where m is an integer:\n\nLCM(45, 3m) = (45 * 3m) / GCD(45, 3m) = 33\n\nWe can factor this out to:\n\n3 * 5 * m = 33\n\nSolving for m, we find that m = 11. Therefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer x is:\n\nx = 3 * 11 = 33\n\nHence, the smallest possible value of the other integer is 33.",
