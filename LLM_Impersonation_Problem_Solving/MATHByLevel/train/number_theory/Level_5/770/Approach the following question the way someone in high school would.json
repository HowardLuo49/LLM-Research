    "solution": "Let $n$ be the other integer, so \\[\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n]}{\\gcd(45,n)} = 33.\\]We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, so \\[\\gcd(45,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n] = 45n.\\]Dividing this equation by the previous equation, we get \\[[\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = \\frac{45n}{33} = \\frac{15n}{11},\\]so $11 [\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = 15n$.\n\nSince 11 divides the left-hand side, 11 also divides the right-hand side, which means $n$ is divisible by 11.  Also, 15 divides the right-hand side, so 15 divides the left-hand side, which means $\\gcd(45,n)$ is divisible by 15.  Since $45 = 3 \\cdot 15$, $n$ is divisible by 15.  Hence, $n$ must be divisible by $11 \\cdot 15 = 165$.\n\nNote that $\\gcd(45,165) = 15$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,165] = 495$, and $495/15 = 33$, so $n=165$ is achievable and the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{165}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of the other integer, we first need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two integers. Since we know that one integer is 45, we can set up an equation using the fact that the least common multiple (LCM) divided by the GCD is 33:\n\nLCM / GCD = 33\n\nThe formula for finding the LCM given the two integers a and b is LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). Since one integer is 45, we can rewrite this as:\n\nLCM(45, b) / GCD(45, b) = 33\n\nNext, we find the GCD(45, b). The GCD of 45 and any number is 45 if 45 divides the number, otherwise it is 1. Since we are looking for the smallest possible value of the other integer, the GCD must be 45 in this case.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nLCM(45, b) / 45 = 33\n\nWe know that LCM(45, b) = (45 * b), so we substitute this in:\n\n(45 * b) / 45 = 33\nb = 33\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer is 33.",
