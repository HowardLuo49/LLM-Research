    "solution": "We can simplify as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n13(3x-2)&\\equiv 26 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x-2&\\equiv 2 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n9x&\\equiv 4\\cdot 3 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 12 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\n\\end{align*}So $x=4+8n$ is a solution for all $n$ and all solutions are of this form. The solutions in the range $0<x\\le 20$ are $4,12,20$, so their sum is $4+12+20=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Firstly, we should expand the left side of the congruence: $13(3x-2) = 39x - 26$. Knowing this, the congruence becomes $39x - 26 \\equiv 26 \\pmod 8$. Simplifying, we get $39x \\equiv 52 \\pmod 8$, which reduces to $3x \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n\nTo find all solutions less than or equal to $20$, we can substitute integer values for $x$ and check which ones satisfy the congruence. Starting with $x=1$, we have $3(1) \\equiv 3 \\not\\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. Trying $x=2$ gives $3(2) \\equiv 6 \\not\\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. Continuing in this manner, we find that $x=6, 10,$ and $14$ satisfy the congruence.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer solutions less than or equal to $20$ to the given congruence is $6 + 10 + 14 = 30$.",
