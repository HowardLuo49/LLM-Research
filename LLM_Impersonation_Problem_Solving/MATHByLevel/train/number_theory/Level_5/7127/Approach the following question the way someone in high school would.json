Let $S$ be the set of integers $n > 1$ for which $\\tfrac1n = 0.d_1d_2d_3d_4\\ldots$, an infinite decimal that has the property that $d_i = d_{i+12}$ for all positive integers $i$. Given that $9901$ is prime, how many positive integers are in $S$? (The $d_i$ are digits.)\n",
    "solution": "Let $k = d_1 d_2 d_3 \\ldots d_{12}$, the first $12$ decimal digits of $\\tfrac{1}{n}$. We can see that\\[(10^{12} - 1)\\left(\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right) = k \\implies kn = 10^{12} - 1,\\]so $S$ is the set that contains all divisors of $10^{12} - 1$ except for $1$. Since\\[10^{12} - 1 = (10^6 + 1)(10^6 - 1) = (10^2 + 1)(10^4 - 10^2 + 1)(10^3 + 1)(10^3 - 1) = 101 \\cdot 9901 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 37,\\]the number $10^{12} -1$ has $4 \\cdot 2^6 = 256$ divisors and our answer is $256 - 1 = \\boxed{255}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's look at the decimal $\\frac{1}{n} = 0.d_1d_2d_3d_4\\ldots$. If $d_i = d_{i+12}$ for all positive integers $i$, that means the decimal repeats every 12 digits. \n\nSince $n > 1$, the decimal is less than 1, so we need to find a number $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ has a repeating block of length 12 that ends in $9901$ when written as a decimal. \n\nNow, we know that $9901$ is prime, so it cannot be divided by any other positive integers other than 1 and itself. That means $n$ must be a multiple of 9901, and the smallest multiple of 9901 that is greater than 1 is 9901 itself. \n\nTherefore, the only positive integer $n$ that works is 9901. So the total number of positive integers in $S$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
