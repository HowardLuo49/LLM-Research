    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. The closest multiple of $2a+9$ that we can spot to $6a^2 + 49a + 108$ is $6a^2 + 49a + 99 = (2a+9)(3a+11),$ so we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108,2a+9)\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(2a+9)(3a+11),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(6a^2+49a+99),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(9,2a+9).\n\\end{align*}Since $7767$ is a multiple of 9, both $2a$ and $9$ are multiples of $9$, $2a+9$ is also a multiple of $9$ so the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by thinking about what numbers are odd multiples of 7767. Since 7767 is odd, any multiple of it will also be odd. So if a is an odd multiple of 7767, that means a is an odd number that can be written as 7767 times some other number.\n\nLet's pick a fun number for a. How about we say a=7767*3 = 23201? That way, a is an odd multiple of 7767.\n\nNow let's find the greatest common divisor of 6a^2+49a+108 and 2a+9 using our special number for a.\n\nFirst, substitute a=23201 into both expressions:\n\n6(23201)^2 + 49(23201) + 108 = 6(537355201) + 1135129 + 108 \u2248 3224131261 + 1135129 + 108 \u2248 3225266398\n\n2(23201) + 9 = 46402 + 9 = 46411\n\nNow let's find the greatest common divisor of 3225266398 and 46411. Since we're in preschool, we might need some help from a grown-up or a calculator for this part.\n\nAfter calculating, we find that the greatest common divisor of our two numbers is 1.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 6a^2+49a+108 and 2a+9 when a is an odd multiple of 7767 is 1.
