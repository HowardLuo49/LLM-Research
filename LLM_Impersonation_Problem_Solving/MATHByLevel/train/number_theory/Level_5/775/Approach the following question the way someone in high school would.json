    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. The closest multiple of $2a+9$ that we can spot to $6a^2 + 49a + 108$ is $6a^2 + 49a + 99 = (2a+9)(3a+11),$ so we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108,2a+9)\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(2a+9)(3a+11),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(6a^2+49a+99),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(9,2a+9).\n\\end{align*}Since $7767$ is a multiple of 9, both $2a$ and $9$ are multiples of $9$, $2a+9$ is also a multiple of $9$ so the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{9}$.",
