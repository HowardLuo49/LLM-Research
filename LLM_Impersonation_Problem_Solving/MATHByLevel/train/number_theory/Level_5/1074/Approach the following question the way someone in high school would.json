    "solution": "Note that $60$ is divisible by $3$, but $20$ is not divisible by $3$. Therefore, if $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$, then $\\nu$ must be divisible by 3 and we may write $\\nu=3n$ (where $n$ is a positive integer).\n\nThus we have $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]=60$, and since the $3n$ contributes the factor of $3$ to $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]$, it follows that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,20]=\\frac{60}{3}=20$. This is true if and only if $n$ is a divisor of $20$. Therefore, the possible values of $\\nu$ are $3$ times the positive divisors of $20$: $$\\nu = 3,6,12,15,30,\\,\\text{or}\\,60.$$The sum of these values is $\\boxed{126}$.",

In this case, we want to find all positive integers $\\nu$ such that the LCM of $\\nu$ and $20$ is $60$.\n\nTo find the sum of all positive integers $\\nu$ that satisfy this condition, we can start by listing out the factors of $60$ and $20$, and then finding the multiples of $20$ that have an LCM of $60$:\n\nFactors of $60$: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60$\n\nFactors of $20$: $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$\n\nWe can see that the LCM of $20$ and $30$ is $60$, so $\\nu = 30$ is a solution.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $\\nu$ for which $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$ is $30$.",
