    "solution": "Note that $60$ is divisible by $3$, but $20$ is not divisible by $3$. Therefore, if $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$, then $\\nu$ must be divisible by 3 and we may write $\\nu=3n$ (where $n$ is a positive integer).\n\nThus we have $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]=60$, and since the $3n$ contributes the factor of $3$ to $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]$, it follows that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,20]=\\frac{60}{3}=20$. This is true if and only if $n$ is a divisor of $20$. Therefore, the possible values of $\\nu$ are $3$ times the positive divisors of $20$: $$\\nu = 3,6,12,15,30,\\,\\text{or}\\,60.$$The sum of these values is $\\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers $\\nu$ that make $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$, we can start by listing out the multiples of 20: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and so on. We are looking for a number that when we find the least common multiple (LCM) with 20 is equal to 60.\n\nThe only number that fits this rule is 60, because the LCM of 60 and 20 is 60. So the sum of all positive integers $\\nu$ that make $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$ is just 60.",
