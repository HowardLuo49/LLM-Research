    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the odd integers $1,3,5,\\ldots,99$ in increasing order. Each row below the first has one fewer entry than the row above it, and the bottom row has a single entry. Each entry in any row after the top row equals the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the row immediately above it. How many entries in the array are multiples of $67$?\n",
    "solution": "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to draw out our triangular array of numbers like a pyramid. We start with 1 at the top, then 3 and 5 on the next row, and so on until 99. \n\nNext, we see that each number in a row is the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the row above. So we can fill out the rest of the numbers in the pyramid by adding the numbers together to get the next number.\n\nTo find out how many numbers are multiples of 67, we need to go through each number in the pyramid and see if it is a multiple of 67. This might take some time, but we can do it one by one and count as we go.\n\nLet's start with the top number, 1. Is 1 a multiple of 67? No. What about 3? No. 5? No. We continue this process for all the numbers until we reach the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nBy doing this, we should be able to figure out how many entries in the array are multiples of 67. It might take a bit of time and counting, but we can do it if we are patient and careful.",
