    "solution": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the least positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$, we must first rewrite the expression $n^2 - n$ as $n(n-1)$. \n\nFor $n(n-1)$ to be divisible by a specific integer $k$, we need $k$ to be a factor of $n$ or $n-1$, but not both. This means that $n$ and $n-1$ must not have any common factors other than 1 in order for $n(n-1)$ to be divisible by some but not all values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$.\n\nTo find the least positive integer $n$ that satisfies this condition, we need to look for the smallest number that breaks this \"rule\". This happens when $n$ and $n-1$ are consecutive integers that share a common factor. The smallest such positive integer $n$ is when $n=2$, since $2(2-1) = 2$ is divisible by only 2 but not 1.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$ is $n=2$.",
