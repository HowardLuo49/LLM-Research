    "solution": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

Let's start by trying some numbers!\n\n1: $1^2 - 1 = 0$. That's divisible by all numbers from 1 to 1.\n\n2: $2^2 - 2 = 2$. That's not divisible by any numbers from 1 to 2.\n\n3: $3^2 - 3 = 6$. That's divisible by 1, 2, and 3.\n\n4: $4^2 - 4 = 12$. That's divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nSo it looks like the least positive integer $n$ that works is 2 since $n = 2$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$.
