    "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find the remainder when $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ is divided by $1000$. This is like a really big sum, but I think we can use a trick here. We can rewrite the sum as a geometric series where the first term is $1$, the common ratio is $7$, and there are 2005 terms. So we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n\n$1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{1(7^{2005}-1)}{7-1}$\n\nNow we just need to find the remainder when this sum is divided by $1000$. We can simplify the expression to get $\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$.\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when $7^{2005}$ is divided by $1000$. We can just look for a pattern in the last 3 digits of the powers of 7:\n\n$7^1 \\equiv 007 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^2 \\equiv 049 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^3 \\equiv 343 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^4 \\equiv 401 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^5 \\equiv 807 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^6 \\equiv 649 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^7 \\equiv 543 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^8 \\equiv 801 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^9 \\equiv 607 \\pmod{1000}$\n$7^{10} \\equiv 249 \\pmod{1000}$\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that the last 3 digits of $7^n$ repeat every four powers of 7. Since $2005 = 4 \\cdot 501 + 1$, we know that $7^{2005}$ has the same last 3 digits as $7^1$, which is 007.\n\nSo now we can plug 007 back into our expression:\n\n$\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{007-1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{6}{6} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ is divided by $1000$ is $N=\\boxed{1}$.",
