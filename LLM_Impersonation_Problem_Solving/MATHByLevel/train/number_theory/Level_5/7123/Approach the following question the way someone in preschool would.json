    "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie artichokie! So, we're gonna add up a lot of 7s and then divide by 1000 to find the remainder. Let's start by adding all the 7s together. Hmm, I think I'll start by figuring out $7^{2004}$...that's a BIG number! But I can do it! And then I'll add up all the other 7s before that one. Finally, once I get that big sum, I'll divide it by 1000 to find the remainder. Hmm, this might take a while, but I'll do my best! Let's get started!",
