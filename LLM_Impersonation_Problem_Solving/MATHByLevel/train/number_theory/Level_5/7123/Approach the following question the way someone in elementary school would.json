    "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
