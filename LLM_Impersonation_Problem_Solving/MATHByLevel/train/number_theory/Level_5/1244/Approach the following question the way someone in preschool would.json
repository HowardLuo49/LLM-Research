    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We know that a decimal terminates if the denominator is a product of only 2's and 5's. So, we need to find the prime factorization of 475. \n\nNow, let's see...475 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 5. 475 is equal to 5 * 5 * 19. That means the fraction $\\frac{n}{475}$ will only have a terminating decimal if n is divisible by 5 and 19. \n\nNow, we need to count how many integers between 1 and 474 are divisible by both 5 and 19. We can do this by listing out all the multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, 20, ...) and checking if each one is also a multiple of 19. \n\nSo, let's see...5, 10, 15, 20, 25...oh! 95 is divisible by both 5 and 19. And 95 is less than 474. Is there any other number between 1 and 474 that is divisible by both 5 and 19? Nope, looks like 95 is the only one. \n\nSo, the answer is 1 integer value of n (which is 95) between 1 and 474 inclusive makes the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminate. Yay, we did it!",
