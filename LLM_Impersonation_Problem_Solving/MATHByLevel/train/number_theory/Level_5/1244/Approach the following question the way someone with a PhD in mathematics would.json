    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine for how many integer values of $n$ the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates, we need to consider the prime factorization of the denominator, 475.\n\nFirst, we can write 475 as $475 = 5^2 \\cdot 19$. In order for the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ to terminate, there should be no prime factors other than 2 and 5 in the denominator. Since 19 is also a prime factor, the decimal representation will only terminate for those values of $n$ that are divisible by 19.\n\nTherefore, the integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates are those values of $n$ that are multiples of 19. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{474}{19} \\right\\rfloor = 24$ such integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive.",
