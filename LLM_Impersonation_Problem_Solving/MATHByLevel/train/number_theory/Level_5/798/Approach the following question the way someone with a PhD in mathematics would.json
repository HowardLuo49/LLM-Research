    "solution": "We use the property that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\n$333 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$, therefore $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333} \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $3^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, we get that $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333}=3^{5 \\cdot 66 +3}=(3^5)^{66} \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv 1^{66} \\cdot 27 \\equiv \\boxed{5} \\pmod{11}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Since $11$ is a prime number and $333$ is not divisible by $11$, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to simplify the calculation.\n\nFirst, we note that $11$ is prime, so $333^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $10$ by using the fact that $333 = 33 \\times 10 + 3$. Thus:\n\n$333^{333} = (33 \\times 10 + 3)^{333}$\n\nExpanding this using the binomial theorem, we get:\n\n$(33 \\times 10 + 3)^{333} = \\sum_{k=0}^{333} \\binom{333}{k} (33 \\times 10)^{333-k} 3^k$\n\nSince $10^{333-k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ for all $k \\geq 1$, we only need to consider the terms where $k = 0$ and $k = 1$. \n\nFor $k = 0$, we have $\\binom{333}{0} (33 \\times 10)^{333} 3^0 = 333^{333}$. \n\nFor $k = 1$, we have $\\binom{333}{1} (33 \\times 10)^{332} 3^1 = 11 \\times 10 \\times (33 \\times 10)^{332} 3 = 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$ is the same as the remainder when $3^{333} = 3^{10 \\times 33 + 3}$ is divided by $11$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $3^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, so\n\n$3^{333} = 3^{10 \\times 33 + 3} \\equiv 3^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nThus, the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$ is $5$.",
