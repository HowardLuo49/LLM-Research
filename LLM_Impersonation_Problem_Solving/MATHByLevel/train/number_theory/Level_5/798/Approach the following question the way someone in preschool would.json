    "solution": "We use the property that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\n$333 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$, therefore $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333} \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $3^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, we get that $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333}=3^{5 \\cdot 66 +3}=(3^5)^{66} \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv 1^{66} \\cdot 27 \\equiv \\boxed{5} \\pmod{11}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count and see what happens! Let's start with $333$ and see what happens when we keep multiplying it by itself. \n\n$333$ divided by $11$ is $30$ with a remainder of $3$. \n\n$3$ divided by $11$ is $0$ with a remainder of $3$. \n\nSo, when we keep multiplying $333$ by itself, the remainder will always be $3$ when divided by $11$. So the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$ is $3$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 5?: Let's count and see what happens! Let's start with $333$ and see what happens when we keep multiplying it by itself. \n\n$333$ divided by $11$ is $30$ with a remainder of $3$. \n\n$3$ divided by $11$ is $0$ with a remainder of $3$. \n\nSo, when we keep multiplying $333$ by itself, the remainder will always be $3$ when divided by $11$.
