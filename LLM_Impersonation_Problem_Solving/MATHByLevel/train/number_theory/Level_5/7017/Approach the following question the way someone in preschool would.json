Given that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?\n",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... So we have a bunch of numbers that are all powers of 9, like 9, 81, 729, 6561, and so on. We want to know how many of these numbers start with the digit 9. Well, if 9^4000 starts with a 9, that means all the smaller powers of 9 will also start with a 9! So that means all the numbers in $T$ will start with a 9 too! There are 4001 numbers in total, so all of them start with a 9. Yay, we did it!",
