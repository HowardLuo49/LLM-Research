Given that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?\n",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's start by finding how many digits are in $9^{4000}$. Since $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and its first digit is 9, that means the number is a 4-digit number.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit. Since $T$ consists of all powers of 9 from $9^0$ to $9^{4000}$, we can see that all powers of 9 that are less than 10 have 9 as their leftmost digit. There are 10 such numbers ($9^0, 9^1, ..., 9^9$).\n\nTherefore, there are 10 elements in $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit.",
