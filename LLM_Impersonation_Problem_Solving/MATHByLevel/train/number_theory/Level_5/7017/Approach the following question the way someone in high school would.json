    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $T = \\{9^k : k ~ \\mbox{is an integer}, 0 \\le k \\le 4000\\}$. Given that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?\n",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit, we can think about how the leftmost digit changes as $9^k$ gets larger.\n\nSince $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and its leftmost digit is 9, we know that $9^{3999}$ has only 3816 digits and the leftmost digit must be less than 9. Therefore, $9^{3999}$ does not have 9 as its leftmost digit.\n\nSimilarly, $9^{3998}$ has even fewer digits and its leftmost digit must also be less than 9, so $9^{3998}$ does not have 9 as its leftmost digit either.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we see that $9^{3997}$ will have 3815 digits, but it can still have a leftmost digit less than 9. However, $9^{3996}$ will have 3814 digits and we know it must have a leftmost digit less than 9. Therefore, $9^{3996}$ does not have 9 as its leftmost digit.\n\nProceeding in this way, we find that every 4th power of 9 starting from $9^4$ will have 9 as its leftmost digit, because the powers of 9 wrap around in groups of 4.\n\nSince $4000 \\div 4 = 1000$, we can conclude that there are $\\boxed{1000}$ elements of $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit.",
