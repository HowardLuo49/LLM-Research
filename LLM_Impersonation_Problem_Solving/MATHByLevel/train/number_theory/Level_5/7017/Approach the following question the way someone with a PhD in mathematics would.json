Given that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?\n",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit, we first need to establish the range of powers of 9 we are considering. We know that $T = \\{9^k : k ~ \\mbox{is an integer}, 0 \\le k \\le 4000\\}$, so the largest element in $T$ is $9^{4000}$.\n\nGiven that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and its first digit is 9, we can infer that $9^{4000}$ is not a power of 10, but rather a power of 9. This means that $9^k$ where $k$ ranges from 0 to 4000 must start with 9 as its leftmost digit. Therefore, all of the elements in $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit.\n\nHence, all 4001 elements in $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit.",
