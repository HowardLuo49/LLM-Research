If a number is chosen at random from $S,$ the probability that it is divisible by $9$ is $p/q,$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.$\n",
    "solution": "A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \\neq k$ nonnegative integers. Thus, the set $S$ is equal to the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n = 2^j + 2^k \\,\\mathrm{ and }\\, 0 \\leq j < k \\leq 39\\}$. (The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \\neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.\nNow, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \\equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \\equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \\equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\nIt's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like. If one is of the form $6n$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 3$ (7 choices). If one is of the form $6n + 1$ (7 choices) the other must be of the form $6n + 4$ (6 choices). And if one is of the form $6n + 2$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 5$ (6 choices). This means that there are $7\\cdot 7 + 7\\cdot 6 + 7\\cdot 6 = 49 + 42 +42 = 133$ total \"good\" numbers.\nThe probability is $\\frac{133}{780}$, and the answer is $133 + 780 = \\boxed{913}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To start, let's figure out how many integers in set $S$ are divisible by $9$. In order for a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of $9$. Since each number in set $S$ has exactly two $1$'s in its binary representation, this means the sum of the digits in the binary representation must be $2$ (since the binary digits of $1$ add up to $2$).\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many ways there are to choose the two positions for the $1$'s in the binary representation. There are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ ways to choose the two positions out of $40$.\n\nTo find the probability that a number chosen randomly from set $S$ is divisible by $9$, we need to find the number of numbers in set $S$ that are divisible by $9$ and divide by the total number of numbers in set $S$.\n\nThe number of numbers in set $S$ that are divisible by $9$ is the number of ways to place the $1$'s in the binary representation so that the sum is $2$ (and therefore divisible by $9$), which is $8$, times the number of ways to fill in the remaining digits (with $0$'s) in the binary representation, which is $38$. So there are $8 \\cdot 38 = 304$ numbers in set $S$ that are divisible by $9$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a number chosen randomly from set $S$ is divisible by $9$ is $\\frac{304}{780} = \\frac{38}{97}$. \n\nSo, $p+q = 38+97 = \\boxed{135}$.",
