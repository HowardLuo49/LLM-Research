Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of real numbers that can be represented as repeating decimals of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ where $a, b, c$ are distinct digits. Find the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}.$\n",
    "solution": "Numbers of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ can be written as $\\frac{abc}{999}$. There are $10\\times9\\times8=720$ such numbers. Each digit will appear in each place value $\\frac{720}{10}=72$ times, and the sum of the digits, 0 through 9, is 45. So the sum of all the numbers is $\\frac{45\\times72\\times111}{999}= \\boxed{360}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's see what numbers can be represented as repeating decimals in the form $0.\\overline{abc}$. This means that $a, b, c$ are all different digits. \n\nLet's start by listing out all the possible combinations for $a, b, c$:\n- $a=1, b=2, c=3$\n- $a=1, b=3, c=2$\n- $a=2, b=1, c=3$\n- $a=2, b=3, c=1$\n- $a=3, b=1, c=2$\n- $a=3, b=2, c=1$\n\nThese are the only possibilities because $a, b, c$ must all be different digits. \n\nSo the numbers that can be represented in the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ are $0.123$, $0.132$, $0.213$, $0.231$, $0.312$, and $0.321$.\n\nTo find the sum of these numbers, we simply add them up:\n\n$0.123 + 0.132 + 0.213 + 0.231 + 0.312 + 0.321 = 1.332$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ is $1.332$.",
