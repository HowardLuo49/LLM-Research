Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of real numbers that can be represented as repeating decimals of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ where $a, b, c$ are distinct digits. Find the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}.$\n",
    "solution": "Numbers of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ can be written as $\\frac{abc}{999}$. There are $10\\times9\\times8=720$ such numbers. Each digit will appear in each place value $\\frac{720}{10}=72$ times, and the sum of the digits, 0 through 9, is 45. So the sum of all the numbers is $\\frac{45\\times72\\times111}{999}= \\boxed{360}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$, we first need to determine all possible numbers that can be represented in the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ where $a, b, c$ are distinct digits.\n\nWe note that for any number $0.\\overline{abc}$, we can express it as \n\n$$0.\\overline{abc} = \\frac{abc}{999} = \\frac{100a + 10b + c}{999} = \\frac{100a}{999} + \\frac{10b}{999} + \\frac{c}{999}$$\n\nSince $a,b,c$ are distinct digits, we have $a,b,c \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ and $a \\neq 0$. Thus, $0.\\overline{abc}$ is in lowest terms if and only if  $\\frac{100a}{999}$, $\\frac{10b}{999}$, and $\\frac{c}{999}$ are all in lowest terms. Therefore, $abc$ must be divisible by 999. However, $abc$ is a three-digit number where $a \\neq 0$, and $999 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 37$. It follows that $abc$ must be a multiple of 3 and 37.\n\nThe possible values for $a$ are 1 to 9, and it must be a multiple of 3, giving us $a=3,6,9$. The possible values for $b$ are 0 to 9 excluding the value of $a$ chosen, and the possible values for $c$ are the remaining ones not chosen for $a$ and $b$. Thus, there are $3 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 168$ distinct numbers in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all these numbers. Let's denote a number in $\\mathcal{S}$ as $0.\\overline{a_{i}b_{i}c_{i}}$, where $a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}$ are the specific digits chosen for the $i$-th number. The sum of all elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ is then:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{168} 0.\\overline{a_{i}b_{i}c_{i}} = 0.\\overline{\\sum_{i=1}^{168} a_{i}b_{i}c_{i}}$$\n\nSince we have already counted all three-digit numbers $abc$ that are multiples of 999, the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{168} a_{i}b_{i}c_{i}$ is the sum of all three-digit numbers that are multiples of 999. This is equivalent to finding the sum of all multiples of 999 from 111 to 999.\n\nThe sum of all multiples of 999 from 111 to 999 is a finite arithmetic series. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we have:\n\n$$\\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2} = \\frac{89(111 + 999)}{2} = 44,550$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of all elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ is $0.\\overline{44550} = \\boxed{44550}$",
