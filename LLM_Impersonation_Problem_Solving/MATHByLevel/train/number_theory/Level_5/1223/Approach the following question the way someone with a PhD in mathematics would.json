Find the smallest positive integer $N$ with the following property: of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$, one of them is divisible by $2^2$, one of them is divisible by $3^2$, one is divisible by $5^2$, and one is divisible by $7^2$.",
    "solution": "The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$.  The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$.  But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98.  To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100.  Hence we should take $N=\\boxed{98}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $N$ with the given property, we can start by considering the remainders when $N$ is divided by $4$, $9$, $25$, and $49$.\n\nIf $N$ is divisible by $4$, then $N+1$ would have a remainder of $1$ when divided by $4$, $N+2$ would have a remainder of $2$ when divided by $4$, and none of them would be divisible by $4^2 = 16$. This means $N$ cannot be divisible by $4$.\n\nSimilarly, $N$ cannot be divisible by $9$, $25$, or $49$, as in each case one of $N$, $N+1$, or $N+2$ would not be divisible by the square of the corresponding prime.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $N$ that satisfies the given conditions must be the least common multiple of $4$, $9$, $25$, and $49$, which is $4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 49 = 220500$. Thus, $N = 220500$.",
