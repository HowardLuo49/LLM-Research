    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 25 + \\frac{8}{11} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 5}{55} \\equiv \\frac{62}{-1} \\equiv -62 \\equiv \\boxed{50} \\pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows. Suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \\equiv 55n \\equiv 22 + 40 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the modular inverses of $5$ and $11$ modulo $56$.\n\nTo find the inverse of $5$ modulo $56$, we need to find an integer $a$ such that $5a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$. Checking through possible values, we see that $a = 45$ works since $5 \\cdot 45 \\equiv 225 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$.\n\nTo find the inverse of $11$ modulo $56$, we need to find an integer $b$ such that $11b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$. Checking through possible values, we see that $b = 3$ works since $11 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 33 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these modular inverses back into the expression:\n\n$2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} = 2 \\cdot 45 + 8 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 90 + 24 \\equiv 114 \\pmod{56}$\n\nSince $114 = 2 \\cdot 56 + 2$, the remainder when dividing by $56$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
