    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the dimensions of the solid rectangular block by $a \\times b \\times c$, where $a, b, c$ are the lengths of the three sides of the block. The total number of 1-cm cubes used to form the block is $abc$, and the total number of cubes visible from the three sides is $(a-2)(b-2)c + (a-2)b(c-2) + a(b-2)(c-2)$. \n\nSince $abc - (a-2)(b-2)c - (a-2)b(c-2) - a(b-2)(c-2) = 231$, we have\n$2(ab+bc+ca) - 4(a+b+c) + 8 = 231$.\n This simplifies to \n$(a-2)(b-2)+(b-2)(c-2)+(c-2)(a-2) =117$.\n\nSince $117 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 13$, we are looking for a solution where $(a-2), (b-2), (c-2)$ are either $1,1,117$ or $1,3,39$ (or similar rearrangements).\n\nIf we take $(a-2,b-2,c-2) = (1,1,117)$, we get $abc = 246$ which gives $N = 246$.\n\nIf we take $(a-2,b-2,c-2) = (1,3,39)$, we get $abc = 48$ which gives $N = 48$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{48}$.",
