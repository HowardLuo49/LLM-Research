    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of $N$, let's start by thinking about how many cubes are visible when we look at the block from each side.\n\nWhen we look at one side of the block, $N$ cubes are visible because they're on the outside. When we look at the second side, $N-1$ cubes are visible because one layer of cubes is hidden by the first side. And when we look at the third side, $N-2$ cubes are visible because two layers of cubes are hidden by the first two sides.\n\nSo the total number of cubes visible is $N + (N-1) + (N-2) = 3N - 3$.\n\nSince we know that $231$ cubes are not visible, we can set up the equation $N^3 - (3N - 3) = 231$.\n\nAfter solving this equation, we find $N = \\boxed{9}$ as the smallest possible value.",
