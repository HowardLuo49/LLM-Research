    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have a solid rectangular block made up of $N$ 1-cm cubes. When we view it from certain angles, exactly 231 of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. We want to find the smallest possible value of $N$. \n\nTo approach this problem, we can think about how many cubes can be seen from each face of the block. If we consider the three visible faces, we are essentially counting the number of cubes that make up the volume of the block, minus the 231 cubes that can't be seen. \n\nLet's call the length, width, and height of the block $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively. The total number of cubes in the block is $abc$, and the number of cubes that can be seen from the three visible faces is $2(ab + ac + bc)$. \n\nSo, we have the equation $abc - 231 = 2(ab + ac + bc)$. \n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible value of $N$. To do this, we can start plugging in small values of $N$ and see if we can find a solution. \n\nBy trial and error, we find that when $N = 36$, the equation $abc - 231 = 2(ab + ac + bc)$ holds true.
