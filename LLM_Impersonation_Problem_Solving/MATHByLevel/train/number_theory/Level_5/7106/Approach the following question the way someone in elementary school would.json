    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Last year, Isabella took 7 math tests and received 7 different scores, each an integer between 91 and 100, inclusive. After each test she noticed that the average of her test scores was an integer. Her score on the seventh test was 95. What was her score on the sixth test? $\\textbf{(A)} 92 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} 94 \\qquad\textbf{(C)} 96 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} 98 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} 100$",
    "solution": "Let us simplify the problem. Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$. Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.\nFrom this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$. We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$.\nThe average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$. We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$. However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)\nThus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$. Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$. However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$. Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$. Our final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{100}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Isabella took 7 math tests and all her scores were between 91 and 100. After each test, she found out that the average of her scores was a whole number. Since all her scores were only between 91 and 100, we know that the average after 7 tests must be between 91 and 100 too. \n\nWe also know that Isabella got a 95 on her 7th test. Since the average of 7 whole numbers is a whole number, the average of her first 6 tests must also be a whole number. Therefore, the sum of her first 6 tests must be divisible by 6.\n\nSince the average of all her tests is between 91 and 100, it must be 95 (the score of her 7th test). Therefore, the sum of all her 7 tests is \\(95 \\times 7 = 665\\).\n\nSince the sum of her first 6 tests is divisible by 6, we know that it must end in either a 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since the sum of all her tests is 665, we know that the sum of the first 6 tests must end in a 5. The only option for the score on her 6th test that gives a sum ending in 5 is 94. \n\nTherefore, her score on the sixth test was $\\boxed{94}$.",
