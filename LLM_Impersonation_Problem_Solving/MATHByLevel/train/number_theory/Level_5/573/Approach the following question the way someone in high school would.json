    "solution": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
    "gpt_response": "In high school, when we are dividing numbers we usually look at the remainder. In this case, we want to find out how many different counting numbers will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.\n\nTo figure this out, we need to think about the factors of 42 (47-5=42) because when we divide 47 by any of the factors of 42, we will get a remainder of 5.\n\nThe factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. So there are 8 different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
