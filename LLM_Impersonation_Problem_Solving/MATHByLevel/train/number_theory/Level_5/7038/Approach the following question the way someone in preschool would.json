    "solution": "We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$. If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$. Thus, our answer is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{180}$.",

And a positive even integer is a number like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on. \n\nTo find the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors, we need to think about what numbers can be divided evenly by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and another odd number. \n\nAnd to find the smallest positive integer with twelve positive even integer divisors, we need to think about what numbers can be divided evenly by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and another even number.\n\nHmm... I think the number that fits both requirements is 15. \n\nLet's see:\n1, 3, 5, 15 are odd divisors.\n2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 are even divisors.\n\nYay!
