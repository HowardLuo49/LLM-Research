    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors?\n",
    "solution": "We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$. If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$. Thus, our answer is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{180}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors, we can start by considering the prime factorization of the integer. \n\nLet's denote this integer as N. Since the integer has six odd divisors and twelve even divisors, we need to find a number that can be expressed as the product of some odd prime factors and some even prime factors.\n\nTo have six odd divisors, the integer N must have the form p^5, where p is an odd prime number. Similarly, to have twelve even divisors, N must have the form 2*q^11, where q is an odd prime number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions would be the product of the smallest odd prime (3) raised to the fifth power and the smallest odd prime (5) raised to the eleventh power. \n\nSo, the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors would be:\n\nN = 3^5 * 5^11 = 7109376000.",
