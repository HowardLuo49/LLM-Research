    "solution": "We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$. If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$. Thus, our answer is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{180}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the smallest positive integer that has 6 odd divisors and 12 even divisors. \n\nFirst, let's list out some odd divisors. The smallest odd integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13... \n\nNow let's list out some even divisors. The smallest even integers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14... \n\nTo have 6 odd divisors, we need to have a total of 3 odd numbers raised to different powers. So our number can be in the form of \\(a^2 * b * c\\), where a, b, and c are distinct odd prime numbers.\n\nTo have 12 even divisors, we need to have a total of 3 even numbers raised to different powers. Since \\(2^3 = 8\\), we need to include 2 raised to the power of 3 in our number.\n\nSo the smallest number that fits these conditions would be \\(2^3 * 3^2 * 5 = 360\\). Therefore, the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors is 360.",
