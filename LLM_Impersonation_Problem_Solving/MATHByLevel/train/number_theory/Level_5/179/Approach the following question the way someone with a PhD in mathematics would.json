When the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, their product is 200. How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 200$.  The prime factorization of 200 is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 5^q$ and $b = 2^r \\cdot 5^s$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + r} \\cdot 5^{q + s}$.  But $ab = 200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $p + r = 3$ and $q + s = 2$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,r\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{q,s\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,r)$ are $(0,3)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,r\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 5^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 5$, and $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two integers in question be denoted as $a$ and $b$, with the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $a$ and $b$ denoted as $d$ and the least common multiple (lcm) of $a$ and $b$ denoted as $l$. We are given that $d \\times l = 200$.\n\nWe know that the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two integers can be represented by the formula:\n\n$$d \\times l = a \\times b$$\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$$d \\times l = 200$$\n\nSince $d$ must be a divisor of 200, the possible values of $d$ are the divisors of 200. The number of divisors of 200 can be found by writing 200 as a product of its prime factors: $200 = 2^3 \\times 5^2$. \n\nBy the rule of counting divisors, the total number of divisors of 200 is given by $(3+1)(2+1) = 12$. However, we are interested in the number of different values that $d$ can take on, not just the total count. \n\nTo find the number of distinct divisors of 200, we need to consider the prime factorization further. The divisors of 200 are all possible combinations of powers of 2 and 5 that multiply to 200, ranging from $2^0 \\times 5^0 = 1$ to $2^3 \\times 5^2 = 200$. \n\nTherefore, the number of different values that the greatest common divisor of the two integers can take on is equal to the number of distinct divisors of 200, which is 12. Thus, there are 12 different values that could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers.",
