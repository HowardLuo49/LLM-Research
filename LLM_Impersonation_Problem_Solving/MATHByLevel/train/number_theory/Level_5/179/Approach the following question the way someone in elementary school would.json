    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 200$.  The prime factorization of 200 is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 5^q$ and $b = 2^r \\cdot 5^s$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + r} \\cdot 5^{q + s}$.  But $ab = 200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $p + r = 3$ and $q + s = 2$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,r\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{q,s\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,r)$ are $(0,3)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,r\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 5^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 5$, and $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers, we need to think of all the factors of 200.\n\nLet's find the factors of 200:\n1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, and 200\n\nNow, we need to think of pairs of factors whose product is 200.
