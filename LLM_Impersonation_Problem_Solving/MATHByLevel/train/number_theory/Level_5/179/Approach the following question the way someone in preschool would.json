    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 200$.  The prime factorization of 200 is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 5^q$ and $b = 2^r \\cdot 5^s$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + r} \\cdot 5^{q + s}$.  But $ab = 200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $p + r = 3$ and $q + s = 2$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,r\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{q,s\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,r)$ are $(0,3)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,r\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 5^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 5$, and $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so the question is asking us about the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two numbers. When we multiply them together, we get 200. Let's see how many different values the greatest common divisor could be!\n\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of 200. We can write 200 as 2 x 2 x 2 x 5 x 5.\n\nNow, we know that the greatest common divisor and least common multiple share the same prime factors. So let's think about how we can split up these factors to find the different values of the greatest common divisor.\n\nSince the product of the greatest common divisor and least common multiple is 200, we know that the greatest common divisor has to be a factor of 200. So the different values of the greatest common divisor could be 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, or 200.\n\nSo there are 11 different values the greatest common divisor could be!
