For some positive integer $n$, the number $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, including $1$ and the number $110n^3$. How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?\n$\\textbf{(A) }110\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }191\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }261\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }325\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }425$\n",
    "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, we know that it can be represented in the form $p_1^{d_1} \\cdot p_2^{d_2} \\cdot p_3^{d_3} \\cdots p_k^{d_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_k$ are prime numbers and $d_1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots, d_k$ are their corresponding exponents.\n\nSince $110n^3 = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$, we know that $110n^3$ has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(3+1) = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 = 32$ positive integer divisors.\n\nTherefore, $n^4$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b \\cdot 11^c$. Since $110n^3 = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$, we know that $n^3$ must be of the form $2^x \\cdot 5^y \\cdot 11^z$. We know that $n^4 = n^3 \\cdot n = 2x \\cdot 5y \\cdot 11z$, so the number of positive integer divisors of $81n^4$ is then $(x+1)(y+1)(z+1) = (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the number $81n^4$ has $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }110}$ positive integer divisors.",
