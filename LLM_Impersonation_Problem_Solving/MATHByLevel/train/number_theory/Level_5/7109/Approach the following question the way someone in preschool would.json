    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For some positive integer $n$, the number $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, including $1$ and the number $110n^3$. How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?\n$\\textbf{(A) }110\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }191\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }261\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }325\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }425$\n",
    "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "If 110n^3 has 110 divisors, that's a lot! But I know that 1 and 110n^3 are definitely divisors. So maybe n is 1! That would make 110*1^3 equal to 110, which has 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 22, 55, and 110 as divisors. That's 8 divisors, but not 110! Let me try n as 2. That makes 110*8 equal to 880. That has 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 16, 20, 22, 40, 44, 55, 80, 88, 110, 176, 220, 440, and 880 as divisors. That's way more than 110! Let me try n as 3. That makes 110*27 equal to 2970.

But I need 110 divisors, so let me try out a few more numbers for n and see if one works. If I find the right number for n, maybe I can figure out how many divisors 81n^4 has!",
