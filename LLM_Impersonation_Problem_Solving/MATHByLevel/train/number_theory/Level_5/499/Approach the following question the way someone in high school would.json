    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Mady has an infinite number of balls and empty boxes available to her. The empty boxes, each capable of holding four balls, are arranged in a row from left to right. At the first step, she places a ball in the first box (the leftmost box) of the row. At each subsequent step, she places a ball in the first box of the row that still has room for a ball and empties any boxes to its left. How many balls in total are in the boxes as a result of Mady's $2010$th step?",
    "solution": "After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$). In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth. An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \\le k \\le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.\n\nWe need to verify that this is true. On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$. For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full. The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$. Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box. Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$. Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find out how many balls are in the boxes after Mady's $2010$th step, we can consider the size of each box in relation to the steps taken.\n\nAt the first step, Mady places 1 ball in the first box. At the second step, she places 1 ball in the second box. At the third step, she places 1 ball in the third box. At the fourth step, she places 1 ball in the fourth box, filling it up. \n\nAt the fifth step, she places 1 ball in the first box again, making it 2 balls in the first box. At the sixth step, she places 1 ball in the second box again, making it 2 balls in the second box. At the seventh step, she places 1 ball in the third box again, making it 2 balls in the third box. At the eighth step, she places 1 ball in the fourth box, filling it up.\n\nThis pattern continues, with Mady filling up each box of size 4 at every fourth step. So after her $2010$th step, she would have filled up $2010 \\div 4 = 502$ sets of 4 boxes, with 2 balls in the last box. \n\nTherefore, the total number of balls in the boxes after Mady's $2010$th step is $502 \\times 4 + 2 = \\boxed{2006}$ balls.",
