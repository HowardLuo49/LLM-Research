    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Mady has an infinite number of balls and empty boxes available to her. The empty boxes, each capable of holding four balls, are arranged in a row from left to right. At the first step, she places a ball in the first box (the leftmost box) of the row. At each subsequent step, she places a ball in the first box of the row that still has room for a ball and empties any boxes to its left. How many balls in total are in the boxes as a result of Mady's $2010$th step?",
    "solution": "After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$). In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth. An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \\le k \\le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.\n\nWe need to verify that this is true. On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$. For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full. The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$. Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box. Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$. Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, Mady puts one ball in the first box, then another ball in the first box, and keeps going like that. Let's count together! \n\nAfter one step, there is $1$ ball in the box. \nAfter two steps, there are $2$ balls in the boxes. \nAfter three steps, there are $3$ balls in the boxes. \nAfter four steps, there are $4$ balls in the boxes! \n\nSince each box can only hold $4$ balls, after every four steps the boxes will be full. So, after the $2010$th step, the boxes will be full again. \n\nSince $2010$ divided by $4$ leaves a remainder of $2$, that means after $2010$ steps, there will be $2$ balls in the first box, and $4$ balls in all the other boxes. \n\nSo, in total, there will be $2+4=6$ balls in the boxes after the $2010$th step!",
