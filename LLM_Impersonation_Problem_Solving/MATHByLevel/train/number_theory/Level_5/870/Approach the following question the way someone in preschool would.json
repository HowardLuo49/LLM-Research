    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Suppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. How many different denominators are possible?",
    "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see. If we have the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$, that means the fraction will be $\\frac{ab}{99}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, they can be any numbers from $0$ to $9$ except for both being zero or both being nine. So let's count how many different possibilities we have for the denominator $99$. Well, $99$ can be factored as $3^2 \\times 11$. That means the possible factors we can have for the denominator $99$ are $3, 9, 11, 33, 99$. So there are five different possible denominators we can have. Yay, we did it!",
