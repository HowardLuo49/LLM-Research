Suppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. How many different denominators are possible?",
    "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by figuring out the fraction form of the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits (numbers between 0 and 9), the fraction $0.\\overline{ab}$ can be written as $\\frac{ab}{99}$, because there are 99 possible two-digit combinations of a and b.\n\nNext, we need to simplify the fraction $\\frac{ab}{99}$ to its lowest terms. This means we divide both the numerator $ab$ and denominator 99 by their greatest common factor (GCF).\n\nThe GCF of $ab$ and 99 can vary depending on the specific values of a and b. Let's list out the possible values for a and b to find the different denominators:\n- If a is 1, b can be any digit from 0 to 9, excluding 9 (since not both a and b can be 9). This gives us 9 possible combinations.\n- If a is 2, b can be any digit from 0 to 9, excluding 9. This gives us another 9 possible combinations.\n- We continue this process until a is 9 (9 combinations) and find the different possible denominators.\n\nAdding up all the possible denominators for each value of a (1+1+1+...+1), we find that there are a total of $\\boxed{40}$ different denominators that are possible for the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$.",
