    "solution": "We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$. From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct values of $z$, we must consider all possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nFirst, we note that $y$ is the number formed by reversing the digits of $x$. This means that $y$ must be between 100 and 999 (inclusive) and must have the same hundreds digit as $x$. Let $x = 100a + 10b + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the hundreds, tens, and units digits of $x$ respectively. Then $y = 100c + 10b + a$.\n\nNow we can calculate $z$:\n\n$z = |x - y| = |100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a)| = |99a - 99c| = 99|a - c|$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $z$ are multiples of 99. Since $a$ and $c$ are integers between 1 and 9, inclusive, the possible values of $|a - c|$ range from 0 to 8. This gives us a total of 9 distinct values of $z$: 0, 99, 198, ..., 792. \n\nTherefore, there are 9 distinct values of $z$ that are possible.",
