    "solution": "We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$. From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).",

That would be 198. \n\nSo, for the numbers 456 and 654, the value of z is also 198. \n\nHmm, it looks like no matter what number we pick, the value of z is always going to be 198. \n\nSo, let's try to find out how many different values of z are possible using this process. \n\nLet's see...if z is always going to be 198, then there is only 1 distinct value of z possible! \n\nYay, we found the answer!
