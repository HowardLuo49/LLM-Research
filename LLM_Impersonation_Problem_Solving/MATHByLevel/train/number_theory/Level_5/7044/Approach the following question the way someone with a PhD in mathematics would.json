    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence.\nHarold starts with the first picket and paints every $h$ th picket;\nTanya starts with the second picket and paints every $t$ th picket; and\nUlysses starts with the third picket and paints every $u$ th picket.\nCall the positive integer $100h+10t+u$ paintable when the triple $(h,t,u)$ of positive integers results in every picket being painted exactly once. Find the sum of all the paintable integers.\n",
    "solution": "Note that it is impossible for any of $h,t,u$ to be $1$, since then each picket will have been painted one time, and then some will be painted more than once.\n$h$ cannot be $2$, or that will result in painting the third picket twice. If $h=3$, then $t$ may not equal anything not divisible by $3$, and the same for $u$. Now for fourth and fifth pickets to be painted, $t$ and $u$ must be $3$ as well. This configuration works, so $333$ is paintable.\nIf $h$ is $4$, then $t$ must be even. The same for $u$, except that it can't be $2 \\mod 4$. Thus $u$ is $0 \\mod 4$ and $t$ is $2 \\mod 4$. Since this is all $\\mod 4$, $t$ must be $2$ and $u$ must be $4$, in order for $5,6$ to be paint-able. Thus $424$ is paintable.\n$h$ cannot be greater than $5$, since if that were the case then the answer would be greater than $999$, which would be impossible for the AIME.\nThus the sum of all paintable numbers is $\\boxed{757}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the factors of the number of pickets in the fence. Let's denote the number of pickets by $n$. \n\nSince Harold starts with the first picket and paints every $h$th picket, the pickets he paints are $h, 2h, 3h, ..., nh$. Similarly, Tanya paints $t, 2t, 3t, ..., nt$ pickets, and Ulysses paints $u, 2u, 3u, ..., nu$ pickets.\n\nFor a picket to be painted exactly once, the picket must be painted by exactly one of Harold, Tanya, or Ulysses. Therefore, each picket must be painted by exactly one of the painters. \n\nSince $h, t,$ and $u$ are all positive integers, $h, t,$ and $u$ must be factors of $n$. But since each painter starts at a different picket, $h, t,$ and $u$ must also be relatively prime. \n\nLet's denote the set of factors of $n$ as $A$. We can find a combination of $h, t,$ and $u$ for each factor $f \\in A$ that satisfies the conditions. The sum of all the paintable integers is then the sum of all the elements in $A$.\n\nFor example, consider $n=12$. The factors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$. \nFor $f=1$, we have $(h, t, u) = (1, 1, 1)$.\nFor $f=2$, we have $(h, t, u) = (1, 1, 2)$.\nFor $f=3$, we have $(h, t, u) = (1, 3, 2)$.\nFor $f=4$, we have no solution.\nFor $f=6$, we have $(h, t, u) = (1, 5, 2)$.\nFor $f=12$, we have no solution.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all paintable integers for $n=12$ is $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$.\n\nIn general, the sum of all the paintable integers for a fence with $n$ pickets is the sum of all the factors of $n$ that satisfy the conditions mentioned above.",
