    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence.\nHarold starts with the first picket and paints every $h$ th picket;\nTanya starts with the second picket and paints every $t$ th picket; and\nUlysses starts with the third picket and paints every $u$ th picket.\nCall the positive integer $100h+10t+u$ paintable when the triple $(h,t,u)$ of positive integers results in every picket being painted exactly once. Find the sum of all the paintable integers.\n",
    "solution": "Note that it is impossible for any of $h,t,u$ to be $1$, since then each picket will have been painted one time, and then some will be painted more than once.\n$h$ cannot be $2$, or that will result in painting the third picket twice. If $h=3$, then $t$ may not equal anything not divisible by $3$, and the same for $u$. Now for fourth and fifth pickets to be painted, $t$ and $u$ must be $3$ as well. This configuration works, so $333$ is paintable.\nIf $h$ is $4$, then $t$ must be even. The same for $u$, except that it can't be $2 \\mod 4$. Thus $u$ is $0 \\mod 4$ and $t$ is $2 \\mod 4$. Since this is all $\\mod 4$, $t$ must be $2$ and $u$ must be $4$, in order for $5,6$ to be paint-able. Thus $424$ is paintable.\n$h$ cannot be greater than $5$, since if that were the case then the answer would be greater than $999$, which would be impossible for the AIME.\nThus the sum of all paintable numbers is $\\boxed{757}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So, let's break this problem down step by step.\n\nFirst, Harold paints every $h$th picket starting from the first picket. This means he paints pickets $1, h+1, 2h+1, 3h+1,$ and so on.\n\nNext, Tanya starts from the second picket and paints every $t$th picket. This means she paints pickets $2, t+2, 2t+2, 3t+2,$ and so on.\n\nLastly, Ulysses starts from the third picket and paints every $u$th picket. This means he paints pickets $3, u+3, 2u+3, 3u+3,$ and so on.\n\nWe want to find the sum of all paintable integers, i.e. integers that fit this pattern.\n\nLet's think about the pattern of painting. Since the fence is very long, it's likely that at some point, Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses will cover all the pickets. To find this point, we need to find the least common multiple of $h$, $t$, and $u$.\n\nOnce we find the least common multiple, we can start from the first picket and paint every picket up to that point to make sure all the pickets will be painted exactly once.\n\nThen, the sum of all paintable integers will be all the multiples of the least common multiple less than 1000.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the least common multiple of $h$, $t$, and $u$. Can you think of a way to do that? Feel free to ask if you need any help!",
