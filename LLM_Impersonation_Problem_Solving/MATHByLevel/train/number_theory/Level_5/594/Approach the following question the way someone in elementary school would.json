    "solution": "First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\\boxed{1456}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all the positive even factors of 504, we need to look at all the numbers that can be divided evenly into 504. First, we know that 504 is an even number because it ends in a 4. So, we start by finding all the factors of 504.\n\nWe can start by finding the factors of 504 by dividing it by 2 since all even numbers can be divided by 2. 504 \u00f7 2 = 252. So, 2 is a factor of 504.\n\nNext, we can divide 504 by 4 because it's an even number. 504 \u00f7 4 = 126. So, 4 is also a factor of 504.\n\nWe can continue this process and find all the factors of 504 by dividing it by more even numbers like 6, 8, 10, and so on.\n\nAll the positive even factors of 504 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 28, 42, 56, 84, 126, 252.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all these factors by adding them up:\n2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 14 + 18 + 28 + 42 + 56 + 84 + 126 + 252 = 624\n\nSo, the sum of all the positive even factors of 504 is 624.",
