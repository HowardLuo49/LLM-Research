    "solution": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find a pattern in the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{n+1}$. We notice that if we write $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ as a fraction, we get $\\frac{n}{n+1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}$. \n\nNow, we know that $\\frac{1}{n+1}$ will always be less than 1, so when we subtract it from 1, we get a decimal that will either be repeating or terminating. \n\nIf $\\frac{1}{n+1}$ is a power of 2 (e.g. $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{8}$, etc.), then the decimal representation will terminate. Otherwise, it will repeat.\n\nIn this case, we are asked for how many values of $n$ between 1 and 100 will give a repeating decimal. \n\nWe know that $n$ can be any integer between 1 and 100, which means there are a total of 100 possible values for $n$. \n\nIf we find out how many values of $n$ will make $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ repeat, we can subtract that number from 100 to get our answer. \n\nTherefore, we need to find out how many integers between 1 and 100 have $(n+1)$ as a power of 2. These are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So there are 6 values of $n$ between 1 and 100 that will make the decimal terminate. Therefore, the number of integers such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal is $100 - 6 = 94$. \n\nSo the answer to the question is 94 integers between 1 and 100 that will make $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ a repeating decimal.",
