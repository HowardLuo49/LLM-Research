    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.\n\nTherefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$. We get \\begin{align*}\n23n+1&<-999 \\\\\n23n&<-1000\\\\\nn&<-\\frac{1000}{23} \\approx -43.48.\n\\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \\cdot -44 +1 =\\boxed{-1011}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$, we need to find an integer $N$ such that $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$ and $N \\leq -1000$. \n\nSince $23$ divides $(23k+1) - 1 = 23k$ for any integer $k$, we can see that $N = -23$ satisfies the congruence $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{23}$. \n\nTo find the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$, we need to find the largest $n$ such that $-23n \\leq -1000$. Solving the inequality gives us $n \\geq 44$, so the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is $-23 \\times 44 = -1012$.",
