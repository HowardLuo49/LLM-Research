    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.\n\nTherefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$. We get \\begin{align*}\n23n+1&<-999 \\\\\n23n&<-1000\\\\\nn&<-\\frac{1000}{23} \\approx -43.48.\n\\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \\cdot -44 +1 =\\boxed{-1011}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$, we need to find the largest four-digit negative integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 23.\n\nFirst, let's find the largest four-digit negative integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 23. This means we need to find an integer of the form $23k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nTo find the largest possible value for $k$ such that $23k + 1$ is a four-digit negative integer, we can set $23k + 1 = -1000$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = -44$. \n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is $23(-44) + 1 = \\boxed{-1011}$.",
