    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.\n\nTherefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$. We get \\begin{align*}\n23n+1&<-999 \\\\\n23n&<-1000\\\\\nn&<-\\frac{1000}{23} \\approx -43.48.\n\\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \\cdot -44 +1 =\\boxed{-1011}$.",
    "gpt_response": "I am 4 years old and I don't know what a digit is, but I think I can try! To find the largest negative number with four numbers that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 23, I think we can start by finding the largest negative number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 23. That number will be -1. Then we can add multiples of 23 to get to a four-digit number. Let's see... -1 + 23 = 22, which is only two digits. Let's try adding another 23. 22 + 23 = 45, which is a three-digit number. Oh no! I don't know how to get to a four-digit number. Maybe someone older can help me figure it out!",
