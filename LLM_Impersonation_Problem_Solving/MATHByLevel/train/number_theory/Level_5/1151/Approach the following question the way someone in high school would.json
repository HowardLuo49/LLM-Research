    "solution": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the divisors of $8!$, we can simply list them out and count how many are larger than $7!$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $8!$ is $2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. To find all the divisors, we can consider all the possible combinations of these prime factors. \n\nWe can see that for a divisor to be larger than $7!$, it must contain the prime factor $8$ in its factorization. Therefore, the divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$ are those that are of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c \\cdot 7^d \\cdot 8$. \n\nSince $8! = 2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, we can have $2^1 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 \\cdot 7^0 \\cdot 8$, $2^2 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 \\cdot 7^0 \\cdot 8$, ..., $2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 8$. \n\nCounting these up, we get a total of $8$ divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$.",
