For positive integers $n$, let $f(n)$ return the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. How many positive integer divisors does $f(2010)$ have?",
    "solution": "We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$. Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. If we multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10. Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10. If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10. For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10. Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.\n\nAs a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$. The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \\le x \\le 2010$. There are $\\boxed{2011}$ such integers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the number of friends that $f(2010)$ has!\n\nFirst, let's find out what $f(2010)$ is. We need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly 2010 digits after the decimal point. \n\nWe can see that the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{k}$ will repeat after $k-1$ digits if it does not terminate. So, we want to find the smallest $k$ such that $k-1 = 2010$. Therefore, $k = 2011$.\n\nNow, we need to find how many divisors $f(2010) = 2011$ has. To do this, we need to find the prime factorization of 2011.\n\n2011 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is just 2011. The only divisors are 1 and 2011 itself, so there are 2 positive integer divisors of 2011.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is 2!",
