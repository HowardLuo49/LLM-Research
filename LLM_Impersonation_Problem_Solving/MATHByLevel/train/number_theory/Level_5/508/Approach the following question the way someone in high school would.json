    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For positive integers $n$, let $f(n)$ return the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. How many positive integer divisors does $f(2010)$ have?",
    "solution": "We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$. Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. If we multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10. Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10. If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10. For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10. Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.\n\nAs a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$. The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \\le x \\le 2010$. There are $\\boxed{2011}$ such integers.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so $f(n)$ is like a function that tells us the smallest integer that gives us a certain number of decimal points when we take the reciprocal of it. We want to find $f(2010)$, which means we need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $2010$ digits after the decimal point. \n\nTo find this, we need to think about how decimal representations work. We know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ will have 1 digit after the decimal point if $k=10$, and it will have 2 digits after the decimal point if $k=100$, and so on. So to get $2010$ digits after the decimal point, we need $k=10^{2010}$.\n\nSo $f(2010) = 10^{2010}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of positive integer divisors of $10^{2010}$.\n\nSince $10^{2010} = 2^{2010} \\cdot 5^{2010}$, any positive integer divisor of $10^{2010}$ will be of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 2010$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 2010$.\n\nThere are $(2010+1)(2010+1) = 2011^2$ divisors of $10^{2010}$.\n\nSo, $f(2010)$ has $2011^2$ positive integer divisors.",
