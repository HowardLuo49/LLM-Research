    "solution": "Let $m = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $n = 2^{1989}-1$. Then, $2^9n = 2^9(2^{1989}-1) = 2^{1998} - 2^9 = m - (2^9 - 1)$. By the Euclidean algorithm, it follows that \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(m,n) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,m-2^9n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,2^9-1). \\\\\n\\end{align*}Since $9$ divides $1998$, by the difference of odd powers factorization, it follows that $2^{1989}-1$ is divisible by $2^9 - 1$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is $2^9 - 1 = \\boxed{511}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, we find the remainder when dividing $2^{1998}$ by $2^{1989}-1$:\n\\begin{align*}\n2^{1998} & = (2^{1989}-1) \\cdot 2^9 + (2^9-1)\n\\end{align*}\n\nNext, we find the remainder when dividing $2^{1989}-1$ by $2^9-1$:\n\\begin{align*}\n2^{1989}-1 & = (2^9-1) \\cdot 2^{1980} + 2^{1980} - 1\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe continue this process until we reach a remainder of 0.
