    "solution": "Let $m = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $n = 2^{1989}-1$. Then, $2^9n = 2^9(2^{1989}-1) = 2^{1998} - 2^9 = m - (2^9 - 1)$. By the Euclidean algorithm, it follows that \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(m,n) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,m-2^9n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,2^9-1). \\\\\n\\end{align*}Since $9$ divides $1998$, by the difference of odd powers factorization, it follows that $2^{1989}-1$ is divisible by $2^9 - 1$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is $2^9 - 1 = \\boxed{511}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nLet $a = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $b = 2^{1989} - 1$. We want to find $\\text{gcd}(a,b)$.\n\nFirst, we can use the property that $a - b = 2^{1998} - 1 - (2^{1989} - 1) = 2^{1989}(2^9 - 1) = 2^{1989}(511)$. Since $511 = 7 \\cdot 73$, we have that $2^{1989}(2^9 - 1) = 2^{1989} \\cdot 7 \\cdot 73$.\n\nNext, we can use the property that $b$ can be written as $b = 2^{1989} - 1 = 2^{1989} \\cdot 1$. \n\nNow, we can see that $2^{1989}$ is a common factor of $a$ and $b$.
