    "solution": "For a number $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ to be divisible by $11$, we need $(a+c)-(b+d)$ to be divisible by $11$. If the digits of $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ add up to $9$, then $(a+c)-(b+d)$ must be $0$, because $(a+c)-(b+d)$ cannot be as large as 11 or as small as $-11$ without having $a+c+b+d\\geq 11$.\n\nNow $(a+c)-(b+d)=0$ implies that $a+c=b+d$, which in turn implies that $a+c$ and $b+d$ have the same parity (that is, they are either both odd or both even). Therefore, $a+b+c+d = (a+c)+(b+d)$ is even and therefore cannot be equal to $9$. So there are $\\boxed{0}$ possible numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing out all possible four-digit numbers whose digits add up to $9. We can start with numbers where the first digit is $1$. The remaining three digits can be chosen in $\\binom{11}{3} = 165$ ways. Similarly, for first digit as $2$, the remaining three digits can be chosen in $\\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways. For first digit as $3$, the remaining three digits can be chosen in $\\binom{9}{3} = 84$ ways. \n\nNow, we need to check which of these numbers are divisible by $11$. For a number to be divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of its odd-placed digits and the sum of its even-placed digits should be divisible by $11$. \n\nLet's try to find all such numbers. We can see that $1188, 1269, 1359, 1440, 1449, 1531, 1620, 1629, 1710, 1719, 1803$ are the numbers that satisfy this condition. \n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{11}$ four-digit numbers whose digits add up to $9$ and are divisible by $11$.",
