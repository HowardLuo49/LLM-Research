    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The formula for converting a Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to the corresponding Celsius temperature $C$ is $C = \\frac{5}{9}(F-32).$ An integer Fahrenheit temperature is converted to Celsius, rounded to the nearest integer, converted back to Fahrenheit, and again rounded to the nearest integer.\nFor how many integer Fahrenheit temperatures between 32 and 1000 inclusive does the original temperature equal the final temperature?\n",
    "solution": "Examine $F - 32$ modulo 9.\nIf $F - 32 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x = F - 32$. This shows that $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = 9x + 32$. This case works.\nIf $F - 32 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x + 1 = F - 32$. This shows that $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x + 1) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow$$F = \\left[9x + \\frac{9}{5}+ 32 \\right] \\Longrightarrow F = 9x + 34$. So this case doesn't work.\nGeneralizing this, we define that $9x + k = F - 32$. Thus, $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(9x + k)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x + \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k\\right]) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5} \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k \\right] \\right] + 9x + 32$. We need to find all values $0 \\le k \\le 8$ that $\\left[ \\frac{9}{5} \\left[ \\frac{5}{9} k \\right] \\right] = k$. Testing every value of $k$ shows that $k = 0, 2, 4, 5, 7$, so $5$ of every $9$ values of $k$ work.\nThere are $\\lfloor \\frac{1000 - 32}{9} \\rfloor = 107$ cycles of $9$, giving $5 \\cdot 107 = 535$ numbers that work. Of the remaining $6$ numbers from $995$ onwards, $995,\\ 997,\\ 999,\\ 1000$ work, giving us $535 + 4 = \\boxed{539}$ as the solution.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and see which numbers stay the same when we convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius and back to Fahrenheit.\n\nFirst, let's start with the numbers between 32 and 1000. In preschool, we know that we need to start with the smallest number and count up to the biggest number. So we start with 32 and count all the way to 1000.\n\nThen, we take each number and use the formula to convert it from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Once we have the Celsius temperature, we round it to the nearest integer.\n\nNext, we convert the rounded Celsius temperature back to Fahrenheit using the formula. Again, we round it to the nearest integer.\n\nFinally, we see which numbers stay the same after this process. Those are the numbers we are looking for.\n\nIt might take some time, but by following each step carefully, we can find out how many numbers between 32 and 1000 stay the same after going through this process. Remember, it's okay to take your time and try different numbers to see which ones work!",
