    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Suppose that $x$ is an integer that satisfies the following congruences: \\begin{align*}\n3+x &\\equiv 2^2 \\pmod{3^3} \\\\\n5+x &\\equiv 3^2 \\pmod{5^3} \\\\\n7+x &\\equiv 5^2 \\pmod{7^3}\n\\end{align*}What is the remainder when $x$ is divided by $105$?",
    "solution": "Since $105 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the remainders when $x$ is divided by $3$, $5$, and $7$. As $3+x$ leaves a remainder of $4$ when divided by $27 = 3^3$, it follows that $3+x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{3}$, and thus that $x\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. Similarly, \\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 25 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}As $4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, it follows from the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $x \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{105}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have to find a number that is one less than $2^2$, $3^2$, and $5^2$ when divided by $3^3$, $5^3$, and $7^3$ respectively. \n\nSo let's start with the first one. We know that $2^2$ is $4$, so the number we're looking for when divided by $27$ must be $3$. Similarly, for the second one, $3^2$ is $9$, so the number we're looking for when divided by $125$ must be $116$. Lastly, for the third one, $5^2$ is $25$, so the number we're looking for when divided by $343$ must be $316$. \n\nNow we need to find a number that is one less than $3$, $116$, and $316$ when divided by $3$, $125$, and $343$ respectively. This number is $105$. \n\nSo the remainder when $x$ is divided by $105$ is $\\boxed{105}$.",
