    "solution": "Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\\ge 10$ or $c+g\\ge 10$ or $b+f\\ge 10$. 6. Consider $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. $1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.\nWith $c \\in \\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$, there obviously must be a carry. Consider $c = 9$. $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ have no carry. This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions. Considering $b = 9$, $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\\}$ have no carry. Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\\boxed{156}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the pairs of numbers from 1000 to 2000 and see if we need to carry when we add them together. \n\nFirst, let's look at 1000 and 1001. We add them together and we get 2001. Since 2 is less than 10, we don't need to carry. \n\nNext, let's look at 1001 and 1002. We add them together and we get 2003. Again, since 2 is less than 10, we don't need to carry. \n\nWe can keep going like this, adding consecutive pairs of numbers until we get to the end. \n\nIn this way, we can see that for all the consecutive pairs of numbers from 1000 to 2000, no carrying is required. \n\nSo the answer is, for all pairs of consecutive integers in $\\{1000,1001,1002,\\ldots,2000\\}$, no carrying is required when the two integers are added.
