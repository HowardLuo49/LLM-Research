    "solution": "Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\\ge 10$ or $c+g\\ge 10$ or $b+f\\ge 10$. 6. Consider $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. $1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.\nWith $c \\in \\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$, there obviously must be a carry. Consider $c = 9$. $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ have no carry. This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions. Considering $b = 9$, $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\\}$ have no carry. Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\\boxed{156}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many pairs of consecutive integers in the given set do not require any carrying when added, we need to examine the units and tens places of each pair.\n\nLooking at the units place, if the sum of the two units digits is less than 10, then no carrying is required. This happens when the units digit of the first number is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 and the units digit of the second number is one less than the first number's units digit.\n\nFor example, if we take the pair of consecutive integers 1000 and 1001, there is no carrying needed because the units digits (0 and 1) add up to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, if the sum of the two tens digits is less than 10, then no carrying is required. This happens when the tens digit of the first number is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 and the tens digit of the second number is one less than the first number's tens digit.\n\nWe can create pairs of consecutive integers that meet these conditions and count how many there are in the given set to determine the total number of pairs that do not require carrying when added.",
