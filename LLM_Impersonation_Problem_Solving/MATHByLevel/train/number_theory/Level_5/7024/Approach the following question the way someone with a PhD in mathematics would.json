    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For how many pairs of consecutive integers in $\\{1000,1001,1002,\\ldots,2000\\}$ is no carrying required when the two integers are added?\n",
    "solution": "Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\\ge 10$ or $c+g\\ge 10$ or $b+f\\ge 10$. 6. Consider $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. $1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.\nWith $c \\in \\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$, there obviously must be a carry. Consider $c = 9$. $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ have no carry. This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions. Considering $b = 9$, $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\\}$ have no carry. Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\\boxed{156}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible carries that may occur when adding two integers from the given set. Carrying occurs when the sum of two digits is greater than or equal to 10. \n\nLet's denote the two consecutive integers as $n$ and $n+1$. In order to avoid carrying when adding $n$ and $n+1$, we need to examine the possible cases for the digits of $n$ and $n+1$:\n\nCase 1: Both $n$ and $n+1$ have a units digit less than 5. In this case, no carrying will occur when adding the two numbers.\n\nCase 2: One of $n$ or $n+1$ has a units digit of 9. In this case, carrying will occur when adding the two numbers.\n\nCase 3: Both $n$ and $n+1$ have a units digit of 9. In this case, carrying will occur when adding the two numbers.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of pairs of consecutive integers for which no carrying is required, we need to count the number of pairs where both numbers have a units digit less than 5. \n\nIn the given set $\\{1000,1001,1002,\\ldots,2000\\}$, the possible values for the units digit are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. This gives us 5 options for each consecutive pair of integers.\n\nSince there are 1000 integers in total in the set, there will be 999 pairs of consecutive integers. Therefore, the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the given set where no carrying is required when they are added is $999 \\times 5 = 4995$. \n\nThus, a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics would approach this problem by analyzing the possible cases for carrying when adding consecutive integers and calculating the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions.",
