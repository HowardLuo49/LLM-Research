    "solution": "Call the two integers $a$ and $b$. Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$. We also know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.\n\nTherefore, $$\\gcd(a,b) < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\\boxed{3}$ digits.\n\n(We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits. There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)",
    "gpt_response": "If the least common multiple of two numbers has 10 digits, that means the two numbers are pretty big! And if the numbers are big, then their greatest common divisor might not be as big. So the greatest common divisor of two 6-digit numbers may have fewer digits, maybe around 5 or 6.",
