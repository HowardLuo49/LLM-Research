    "solution": "Call the two integers $a$ and $b$. Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$. We also know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.\n\nTherefore, $$\\gcd(a,b) < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\\boxed{3}$ digits.\n\n(We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits. There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about big numbers! If the least common multiple of two really big numbers has 10 digits, then that means those numbers must be pretty big. And if their greatest common divisor has at most how many digits? Well, the greatest common divisor is usually smaller than the numbers themselves. So if the least common multiple has 10 digits, maybe the greatest common divisor has a few less digits, like maybe 8 or 9 digits. So the greatest common divisor has at most 9 digits!",
