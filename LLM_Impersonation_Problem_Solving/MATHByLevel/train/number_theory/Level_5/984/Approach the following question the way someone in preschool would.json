    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to compute $2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. \n\nFirst, let's look at the units digit of powers of 2. We know that $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 8$, $2^4 = 6$, and the pattern repeats every 4 powers. \n\nSince $1000 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, the units digit of $2^{1000}$ is 6. \n\nNext, we add 1 to get the Fermat number $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. \n\nThe units digit of $6+1$ is 7. So the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
