How many positive integers $n$ satisfy\\[\\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor?\\](Recall that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer not exceeding $x$.)\n$\\textbf{(A) } 2 \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } 4 \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } 6 \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } 30 \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } 32$\n",
    "solution": "First notice that the graphs of $(n+1000)/70$ and $\\sqrt[]{n}$ intersect at 2 points. Then, notice that $(n+1000)/70$ must be an integer. This means that n is congruent to $50 \\pmod{70}$.\nFor the first intersection, testing the first few values of $n$ (adding $70$ to $n$ each time and noticing the left side increases by $1$ each time) yields $n=20$ and $n=21$. Estimating from the graph can narrow down the other cases, being $n=47$, $n=50$. This results in a total of $\\boxed{6}$ cases.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's rewrite the equation given to make it easier to understand. \n\\[\\frac{n+1000}{70} = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor\\]\nThis equation is essentially saying that when we divide $n+1000$ by $70$, the result will be the greatest integer not exceeding $\\sqrt{n}$. \n\nTo start, let's examine the bounds for $n$. Since we see $\\sqrt{n}$ in the equation, we know that $n$ must be a perfect square in order for $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor$ to be an integer. Additionally, if $n$ is a perfect square, then $n+1000$ must be a perfect square as well in order for it to be divisible by $70$.\n\nNow, let's think about the perfect squares that are close to multiples of $70$. The smallest perfect square that is greater than $1000$ is $32^2 = 1024$, and the largest perfect square that is less than $1000+70 = 1070$ is $30^2 = 900$. Therefore, we only need to check for perfect squares between $900$ and $1024$.\n\nSince $1000$ is close to $30^2$, let's check when $n=30^2$. $\\frac{900+1000}{70} = 29.99$, which means the greatest integer not exceeding $\\sqrt{n}$ is $29$. Therefore, $n=30^2$ does not work. \n\nNext, let's try $n=31^2$. $\\frac{961+1000}{70} = 27.87$, which means the greatest integer not exceeding $\\sqrt{n}$ is $27$. So $n=31^2$ does not work either. \n\nNow, let's try $n=32^2$. $\\frac{1024+1000}{70} = 33.77$, which means the greatest integer not exceeding $\\sqrt{n}$ is $33$. Therefore, $n=32^2$ is a solution.\n\nContinuing this process, we find that the perfect squares $n$ that satisfy the equation are $32^2, 33^2, 34^2, 35^2, 36^2, 37^2$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive integers $n$ that satisfy the given equation.",
