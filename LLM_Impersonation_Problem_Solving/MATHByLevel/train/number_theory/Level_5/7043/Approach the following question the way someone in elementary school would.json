    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A set $\\mathcal{S}$ of distinct positive integers has the following property: for every integer $x$ in $\\mathcal{S},$ the arithmetic mean of the set of values obtained by deleting $x$ from $\\mathcal{S}$ is an integer. Given that 1 belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$ and that 2002 is the largest element of $\\mathcal{S},$ what is the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have?\n",
    "solution": "Let the sum of the integers in $\\mathcal{S}$ be $N$, and let the size of $|\\mathcal{S}|$ be $n+1$. After any element $x$ is removed, we are given that $n|N-x$, so $x\\equiv N\\pmod{n}$. Since $1\\in\\mathcal{S}$, $N\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and all elements are congruent to 1 mod $n$. Since they are positive integers, the largest element is at least $n^2+1$, the $(n+1)$th positive integer congruent to 1 mod $n$.\nWe are also given that this largest member is 2002, so $2002\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and $n|2001=3\\cdot23\\cdot29$. Also, we have $n^2+1\\le2002$, so $n<45$. The largest factor of 2001 less than 45 is 29, so $n=29$ and $n+1$ $\\Rightarrow{\\boxed{30}}$ is the largest possible. This can be achieved with $\\mathcal{S}=\\{1,30,59,88,\\ldots,813,2002\\}$, for instance.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that 1 is in the set $\\mathcal{S}$ and 2002 is the biggest number. We also know that when we take any number out of $\\mathcal{S}$ and find the average of the remaining numbers, that average is a whole number. \n\nTo try and find the biggest number of elements in $\\mathcal{S$, let's try and see what happens if we add more numbers.\n\nIf we add 2 to the set, then when we remove 1, the average of 2 and 2002 is 1002, a whole number. So far so good.\n\nIf we add 3 to the set, then when we remove 1, the average of 3, 2, and 2002 is 668, which is also a whole number. \n\nIf we keep following this pattern, we can keep adding numbers to the set and always have the average of the remaining numbers be a whole number when we remove 1.\n\nSo, the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have is 2002-1+1 = 2002.\n\nSo the answer is 2002.",
