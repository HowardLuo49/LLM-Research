A set $\\mathcal{S}$ of distinct positive integers has the following property: for every integer $x$ in $\\mathcal{S},$ the arithmetic mean of the set of values obtained by deleting $x$ from $\\mathcal{S}$ is an integer. Given that 1 belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$ and that 2002 is the largest element of $\\mathcal{S},$ what is the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have?\n",
    "solution": "Let the sum of the integers in $\\mathcal{S}$ be $N$, and let the size of $|\\mathcal{S}|$ be $n+1$. After any element $x$ is removed, we are given that $n|N-x$, so $x\\equiv N\\pmod{n}$. Since $1\\in\\mathcal{S}$, $N\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and all elements are congruent to 1 mod $n$. Since they are positive integers, the largest element is at least $n^2+1$, the $(n+1)$th positive integer congruent to 1 mod $n$.\nWe are also given that this largest member is 2002, so $2002\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and $n|2001=3\\cdot23\\cdot29$. Also, we have $n^2+1\\le2002$, so $n<45$. The largest factor of 2001 less than 45 is 29, so $n=29$ and $n+1$ $\\Rightarrow{\\boxed{30}}$ is the largest possible. This can be achieved with $\\mathcal{S}=\\{1,30,59,88,\\ldots,813,2002\\}$, for instance.",
    "gpt_response": "To tackle this problem, we first observe that the arithmetic mean of a set is an integer if and only if the sum of the elements in the set is divisible by the number of elements in the set. Let $n$ be the number of elements in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nSince $1$ belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$, the sum of all the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ must be divisible by $n-1$. Since $2002$ is the largest element in $\\mathcal{S}$, the sum of all the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ is at least $1 + 2 + \\ldots + 2002 = \\frac{2002 \\cdot 2003}{2}$. Therefore, $\\frac{2002 \\cdot 2003}{2}$ must be divisible by $n-1$.\n\nWe know that $2002 \\cdot 2003 = 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 2003$. To maximize $n$, we should choose $n-1$ to be the largest possible factor of $2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 2003$ that is smaller than $\\frac{2002 \\cdot 2003}{2}$. This factor is $3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 3003$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have is $3003+1=3004$.",
