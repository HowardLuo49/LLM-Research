    "solution": "If $n^2-19n+99=x^2$ for some positive integer $x$, then rearranging we get $n^2-19n+99-x^2=0$. Now from the quadratic formula,\n$n=\\frac{19\\pm \\sqrt{4x^2-35}}{2}$\nBecause $n$ is an integer, this means $4x^2-35=q^2$ for some nonnegative integer $q$. Rearranging gives $(2x+q)(2x-q)=35$. Thus $(2x+q, 2x-q)=(35, 1)$ or $(7,5)$, giving $x=3$ or $9$. This gives $n=1, 9, 10,$ or $18$, and the sum is $1+9+10+18=\\boxed{38}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all the positive integers $n$ where $n^2-19n+99$ is a square number, we need to figure out which values of $n$ make $n^2-19n+99$ a perfect square. \n\nMaybe we can try plugging in some numbers for $n$ and see if we get a square number! Let's start with small numbers like $n=1$. \nIf we plug in $n=1$, we get $1^2-19(1)+99 = 1-19+99 = 81$. Hmm, 81 is a square number because it's $9^2$, so $n=1$ works!\n\nLet's try another small number like $n=2$. \nIf we plug in $n=2$, we get $2^2-19(2)+99 = 4-38+99 = 65$. Hmm, 65 is not a square number so $n=2$ doesn't work.\n\nWe can keep trying more numbers, but maybe there are smarter ways to think about this problem. We could try factorization or completing the square to help us find all possible values of $n$. \n\nFor the second question about finding the sum of all integers $n$ so that $\\frac{12}{n}$ is also an integer, we can think about which numbers divide evenly into 12. \nLet's list all the factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. \nIf we plug in each of these factors into $\\frac{12}{n}$ and check if it's an integer, we can find all the values of $n$ that work. \nThen we can find the sum of all those values of $n$ to get our final answer.\n\nIt's always good to try different ways to approach a problem and see what works best!",
