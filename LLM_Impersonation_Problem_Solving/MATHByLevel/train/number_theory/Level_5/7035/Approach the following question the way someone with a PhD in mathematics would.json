    "solution": "If $n^2-19n+99=x^2$ for some positive integer $x$, then rearranging we get $n^2-19n+99-x^2=0$. Now from the quadratic formula,\n$n=\\frac{19\\pm \\sqrt{4x^2-35}}{2}$\nBecause $n$ is an integer, this means $4x^2-35=q^2$ for some nonnegative integer $q$. Rearranging gives $(2x+q)(2x-q)=35$. Thus $(2x+q, 2x-q)=(35, 1)$ or $(7,5)$, giving $x=3$ or $9$. This gives $n=1, 9, 10,$ or $18$, and the sum is $1+9+10+18=\\boxed{38}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers $n$ for which $n^2 - 19n + 99$ is a perfect square, we need to solve the equation $n^2 - 19n + 99 = m^2$ for positive integers $n$ and $m$. Rearranging, we have $n^2 - 19n + (99 - m^2) = 0$. \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, $n = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{19^2 - 4(99-m^2)}}{2} = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{m^2-35}}{2}$. This expression tells us that $m^2 - 35$ must be a perfect square in order for $n$ to be a positive integer. \n\nLet $m^2 - 35 = k^2$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Then, $m^2 - k^2 = 35$ can be factored as $(m+k)(m-k)=35$. The factors of 35 are $(1, 35)$ and $(5, 7)$. By solving each system of equations, we find that the possible pairs $(m,k)$ are $(18, 17)$ and $(6, 1)$. \n\nFor the pair $(18, 17)$, we get $n = \\frac{19 + 17}{2} = 18$ and for $(6, 1)$, we get $n = \\frac{19 + 1}{2} = 10$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers $n$ for which $n^2 - 19n + 99$ is a perfect square is $18 + 10 = \\boxed{28}$. \n\nTo find the sum of all integers $n$ such that $\\frac{12}{n}$ is also an integer, we need the value of $n$ to be a divisor of $12$. The divisors of 12 are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 12$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all integers $n$ such that $\\frac{12}{n}$ is also an integer is $1 + (-1) + 2 + (-2) + 3 + (-3) + 4 + (-4) + 6 + (-6) + 12 + (-12) = \\boxed{0}$.",
