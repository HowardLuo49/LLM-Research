    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. In a rectangular array of points, with 5 rows and $N$ columns, the points are numbered consecutively from left to right beginning with the top row. Thus the top row is numbered 1 through $N,$ the second row is numbered $N + 1$ through $2N,$ and so forth. Five points, $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4,$ and $P_5,$ are selected so that each $P_i$ is in row $i.$ Let $x_i$ be the number associated with $P_i.$ Now renumber the array consecutively from top to bottom, beginning with the first column. Let $y_i$ be the number associated with $P_i$ after the renumbering. It is found that $x_1 = y_2,$ $x_2 = y_1,$ $x_3 = y_4,$ $x_4 = y_5,$ and $x_5 = y_3.$ Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "Let each point $P_i$ be in column $c_i$. The numberings for $P_i$ can now be defined as follows.\\begin{align*}x_i &= (i - 1)N + c_i\\\\ y_i &= (c_i - 1)5 + i \\end{align*}\nWe can now convert the five given equalities.\\begin{align}x_1&=y_2 & \\Longrightarrow & & c_1 &= 5 c_2-3\\\\ x_2&=y_1 & \\Longrightarrow & & N+c_2 &= 5 c_1-4\\\\ x_3&=y_4 & \\Longrightarrow & & 2 N+c_3 &= 5 c_4-1\\\\ x_4&=y_5 & \\Longrightarrow & & 3 N+c_4 &= 5 c_5\\\\ x_5&=y_3 & \\Longrightarrow & & 4 N+c_5 &= 5 c_3-2 \\end{align}Equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ combine to form\\[N = 24c_2 - 19\\]Similarly equations $(3)$, $(4)$, and $(5)$ combine to form\\[117N +51 = 124c_3\\]Take this equation modulo 31\\[24N+20\\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}\\]And substitute for N\\[24 \\cdot 24 c_2 - 24 \\cdot 19 +20\\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}\\]\\[18 c_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}\\]\nThus the smallest $c_2$ might be is $7$ and by substitution $N = 24 \\cdot 7 - 19 = 149$\nThe column values can also easily be found by substitution\\begin{align*}c_1&=32\\\\ c_2&=7\\\\ c_3&=141\\\\ c_4&=88\\\\ c_5&=107 \\end{align*}As these are all positive and less than $N$, $\\boxed{149}$ is the solution.",
