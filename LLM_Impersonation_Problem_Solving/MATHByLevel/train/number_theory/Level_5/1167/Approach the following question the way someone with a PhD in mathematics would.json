Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes.\n\nIf $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, then $a$ has at most how many distinct prime factors?",
    "solution": "The prime factors of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both). The prime factors of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nThus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$. So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we can use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers. \n\nGiven that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly 7 distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly 28 distinct primes, we can express  $\\gcd(a,b)$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ in terms of their prime factorization.\n\nLet $p_1, p_2, ..., p_7$ be the distinct primes dividing $\\gcd(a,b)$ and $q_1, q_2, ..., q_{28}$ be the distinct primes dividing $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly 7 distinct primes, it can be expressed as $p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}...p_7^{k_7}$, where $k_1, k_2, ..., k_7$ are positive integers.\n\nSimilarly, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ can be expressed as $q_1^{l_1}q_2^{l_2}...q_{28}^{l_{28}}$, where $l_1, l_2, ..., l_{28}$ are positive integers.\n\nSince $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, we have that each prime factor of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is also a prime factor of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$.

This implies that the distinct primes $p_1, p_2, ..., p_7$ dividing $\\gcd(a,b)$ must be among the distinct primes dividing $b$.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct prime factors of $a$ is at most 7.
