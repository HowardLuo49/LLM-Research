Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes.\n\nIf $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, then $a$ has at most how many distinct prime factors?",
    "solution": "The prime factors of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both). The prime factors of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nThus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$. So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break it down! First, we know that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes. This means that $a$ and $b$ share those $7$ distinct primes as factors. Next, we know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ includes all the prime factors of both $a$ and $b$, $a$ and $b$ together have $28$ distinct prime factors. \n\nNow, since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we can say that $a$ has $n$ distinct prime factors, where $n$ is less than the number of distinct prime factors in $b$. \n\nSince $a$ and $b$ together have $28$ distinct prime factors, and $a$ has $n$ distinct prime factors, then $b$ must have $28-n$ distinct prime factors.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct prime factors in $a$ and $b$ is $n + (28-n) = 28$. \nFrom this, we can find that $n = 28 - n$, which simplifies to $2n = 28$, and thus $n = 14$.\n\nTherefore, if $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, then $a$ has at most $14$ distinct prime factors.",
