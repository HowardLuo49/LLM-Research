    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes.\n\nIf $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, then $a$ has at most how many distinct prime factors?",
    "solution": "The prime factors of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both). The prime factors of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nThus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$. So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm..what are primes again? Oh yes, they are special numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. Let's count how many different prime numbers can be factors of $a$ and $b$.\n\nIf $a$ has fewer prime factors than $b$, that means $a$ has to have less prime numbers in its factorization. So, let's say $a$ has $x$ distinct prime factors. Since $b$ has more distinct prime factors than $a$, $b$ must have $x+1$ or more distinct prime factors.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by $7$ distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by $28$ distinct primes. This means that the total number of distinct prime factors between $a$ and $b$ is $7 + 28 = 35$.\n\nSince $a$ has $x$ distinct prime factors and $b$ has $x+1$ or more distinct prime factors, we know that $x + (x+1) \\leq 35$. Simplifying this inequality gives $2x + 1 \\leq 35$, which means $2x \\leq 34$ and $x \\leq 17$.\n\nSo, $a$ can have at most $17$ distinct prime factors.",
