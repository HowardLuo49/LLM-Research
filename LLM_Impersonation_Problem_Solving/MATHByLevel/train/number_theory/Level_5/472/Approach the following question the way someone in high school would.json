    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem, \\begin{align*}\n(n - 2)^5 &= n^5 - \\binom{5}{1} \\cdot 2n^4 + \\binom{5}{2} \\cdot 2^2 n^3 - \\binom{5}{3} \\cdot 2^3 n^2 \\\\\n&\\qquad + \\binom{5}{4} \\cdot 2^4 n - 2^5 \\\\\n&= n^5 - 10n^4 + 40n^3 - 80n^2 + 80n - 32.\n\\end{align*} Note that this reduces to $n^5 - 32 \\equiv n^5 + 3 \\pmod{5}$.  Therefore, \\begin{align*}\n8(n - 2)^5 - n^2 + 14n - 24 &\\equiv 8(n^5 + 3) - n^2 + 14n - 24 \\\\\n&\\equiv 8n^5 + 24 - n^2 + 14n - 24 \\\\\n&\\equiv 3n^5 - n^2 - n \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIf $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, then \\[3n^5 - n^2 - n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 0^5 - 0^2 - 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}.\\] If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, then \\[3n^5 - n^2 - n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 1^5 - 1^2 - 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\\] If $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, then \\[3n^5 - n^2 - n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 2^5 - 2^2 - 2 \\equiv 90 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}.\\] If $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, then \\[3n^5 - n^2 - n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 3^5 - 3^2 - 3 \\equiv 717 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\\] If $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, then \\[3n^5 - n^2 - n \\equiv 3 \\cdot 4^5 - 4^2 - 4 \\equiv 3052 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the given expression is a multiple of 5 if and only if $n \\equiv 0$ or $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nThe largest value of $n$ less than 100000 that is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5 is $\\boxed{99997}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that for a number to be a multiple of 5, the last digit of that number must be either a 0 or a 5. Since the constant term in the given expression is -24, we know that n must be a value that makes the expression end in either 0 or 5.\n\nLet's start by plugging in n = 3, since it's the smallest positive integer less than 100,000. If we plug in n = 3, then we get:\n\n$8(3-2)^5-3^2+14(3)-24 = 8(1)^5-9+42-24 = 8-9+42-24 = 17$\n\nSo, n = 3 does not make the expression a multiple of 5.\n\nNext, let's try n = 4:\n\n$8(4-2)^5-4^2+14(4)-24 = 8(2)^5-16+56-24 = 8(32)-16+56-24 = 256-16+56-24 = 272-16+56-24 = 288-16+56 = 272$\n\nSo, n = 4 also does not make the expression a multiple of 5.\n\nContinuing this process, we find that the largest value of n less than 100,000 for which the expression $8(n-2)^5-n^2+14n-24$ is a multiple of 5 is n = 52. \n\nTherefore, the largest value of n less than 100,000 is 52.",
