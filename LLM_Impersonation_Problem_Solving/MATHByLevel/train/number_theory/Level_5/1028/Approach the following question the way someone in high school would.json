    "solution": "Looking at the $d$'s place, we see that $A_d + A_d = 16_d = d + 6$ or $A_d + A_d + 1 = 16_d = d + 6$ (if there is carry-over). Re-arranging and solving for $A_d$, we find that $A_d = \\frac{d + 6}2$ or $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. In either case, since $d > 6$, it follows that $A_d > 2$. Thus, when we add the units digits $B_d + A_d$, there must be carry-over, so $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. It follows that $$B_d + A_d = d + 2 \\Longrightarrow B_d = d+2 - \\frac{d + 5}2 = \\frac d2 - \\frac 12.$$Thus, $A_d - B_d = \\frac{d + 5}2 - \\frac{d-1}{2} = \\boxed{3}_d$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that $\\overline{AB}_d$ is equivalent to $dA + B$ in base 10, and $\\overline{AA}_d$ is equivalent to $dA + A$ in base 10. \n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation $\\overline{AB}_d + \\overline{AA}_d = 162_d$ as $dA + B + dA + A = 1 \\cdot d^2 + 6 \\cdot d + 2$. \n\nThis simplifies to $2dA + B + A = d^2 + 6d + 2$.

So, $A_d - B_d$ in base $d$ is $-(d^2 + 2d - 2)$.",
