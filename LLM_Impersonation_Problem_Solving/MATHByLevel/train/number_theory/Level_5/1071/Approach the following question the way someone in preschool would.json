    "solution": "Let $23a$ be the multiple we seek. Thus $$23a\\equiv 4\\pmod{89}.$$ Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$, then reducing modulo $89$, gives: \\begin{align*}\n92a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89} \\\\\n3a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} Multiplying both sides by $30$, then reducing again, gives: \\begin{align*}\n90a &\\equiv 480 \\pmod{89} \\\\\na &\\equiv 480-445 = 35 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} All of these steps are reversible, so $35$ is the unique solution $\\pmod{89}$ to the original congruence. The smallest positive solution is $a=35$, giving $23a=\\boxed{805}$. (Indeed, we can check that $805 = 9\\cdot 89 + 4$.)",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! Let's count by 23 to find the multiples. Let's start with 23, then 46, and then 69. Now, let's count by 89 to see which number is 4 more than one of the multiples of 89. The multiples of 89 are 89, 178, 267. It looks like 267 is 4 more than 263 which is a multiple of 89. So the smallest positive multiple of 23 that is 4 more than a multiple of 89 is 69. Yay, we did it!",
