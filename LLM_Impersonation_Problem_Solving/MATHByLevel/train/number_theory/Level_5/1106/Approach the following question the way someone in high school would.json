    "solution": "For $n = 1,$ $f(1) = 1,$ so\n\\[f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1.\\]Thus, $n = 1$ does not satisfy $f(f(n)) = n + 2.$  Henceforth, assume that $n \\ge 2$.\n\nSince $1$ and $n$ always divide $n$, we have that $f(n) \\ge n+1$, so $f(f(n)) \\ge n+2$. Therefore, in order for $n$ to be superdeficient, $f(n) = n+1$ and $f(n+1) = n+2$. However, if $f(k) = k+1$, then $k$ must be prime. Therefore, we are searching for consecutive prime integers. However, one of those primes must necessarily be even, and the only even prime is $2$. Note that $f(2) = 3$ and $f(3) = 4$, so there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ superdeficient number: $2$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok so first let's figure out what $f(n)$ is. $f(n)$ is the sum of all the divisors of $n$. So for example, if $n=6$, then $f(6) = 1+2+3+6 = 12$.\n\nNow, we have the equation $f(f(n)) = n+2$. Let's try to find some superdeficient positive integers.\n\nLet's start by trying $n=1$. Since $f(1) = 1$ and $f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$, this doesn't work.\n\nLet's try $n=2$. Since $f(2) = 1+2 = 3$ and $f(f(2)) = f(3) = 1+3 = 4$, this also doesn't work.\n\nLet's try $n=3$.

Since $f(5) = 1+5 = 6$ and $f(f(5)) = f(6) = 1+2+3+6 = 12$, this doesn't work.\n\nOk I'm starting to see a pattern here. It looks like there are no superdeficient positive integers.
