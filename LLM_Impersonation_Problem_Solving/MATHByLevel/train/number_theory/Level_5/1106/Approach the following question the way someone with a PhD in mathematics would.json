    "solution": "For $n = 1,$ $f(1) = 1,$ so\n\\[f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1.\\]Thus, $n = 1$ does not satisfy $f(f(n)) = n + 2.$  Henceforth, assume that $n \\ge 2$.\n\nSince $1$ and $n$ always divide $n$, we have that $f(n) \\ge n+1$, so $f(f(n)) \\ge n+2$. Therefore, in order for $n$ to be superdeficient, $f(n) = n+1$ and $f(n+1) = n+2$. However, if $f(k) = k+1$, then $k$ must be prime. Therefore, we are searching for consecutive prime integers. However, one of those primes must necessarily be even, and the only even prime is $2$. Note that $f(2) = 3$ and $f(3) = 4$, so there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ superdeficient number: $2$.",

The function $f(n)$ gives the sum of all the divisors of the positive integer $n$. \n\nLet's consider the function $f(n)$. For a given positive integer $n$, the divisors of $n$ can be written as $\\{d_1, d_2, ..., d_k\\}$ where $k$ is the number of divisors of $n$. The function $f(n)$ will sum all these divisors, resulting in $f(n) = d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_k$. \n\nNow, if $f(f(n)) = n+2$, then we have $f(d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_k) = n + 2$. This means that the sum of the divisors of the sum of the divisors of $n$ equals $n+2$.\n\nTo find the superdeficient positive integers, we need to find all the $n$'s that satisfy the condition $f(f(n)) = n+2$ and then analyze their properties to classify them as superdeficient.\n\nTo find such $n$'s, we can start by brute force searching for solutions. We can consider small numbers to simplify the process. As we find and analyze these numbers, we can look for patterns or properties that help us identify superdeficient positive integers and ultimately determine how many there are. \n\nThis approach involves a combination of algebraic manipulation, number theory concepts, and pattern recognition to systematically tackle the problem and arrive at the correct solution.",
