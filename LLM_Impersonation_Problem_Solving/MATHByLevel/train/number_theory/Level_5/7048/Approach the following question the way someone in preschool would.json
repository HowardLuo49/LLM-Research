    "solution": "Let the three integers be $a, b, c$. $N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$. Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\\{a, b\\}$ is one of $\\{1, 12\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\\cdot 13 = 156, 12\\cdot 8 = 96, 12\\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \\boxed{336}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's start by figuring out what three numbers we can multiply together to get 6 times their sum. We know that one number is the sum of the other two, so let's call our three numbers $a$, $b$, and $a+b$.\n\nNow we can write an equation! The product $N$ of these three numbers is $ab(a+b)$, and we know that this is equal to 6 times their sum, which is $6(a+b+(a+b))$. Let's set up the equation:\n\n$ab(a+b) = 6(a+b+(a+b))$\n\nSimplify:\n$ab(a+b) = 6(2a+3b)$\n$ab(a+b) = 12a + 18b$\n\nNow let's substitute $a+b$ with $c$ for easier calculations:\n$abc = 12a + 18b$\n\nWe can solve this equation by factoring out a common factor:\n$a(bc - 12) = 18b$\n\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive integers, we can see that the possible solutions are when $bc = 12$ and $bc - 12$ is a factor of $18$. The pairs of $(b,c)$ that satisfy these conditions are $(1,12)$, $(2,6)$, and $(3,4)$.
