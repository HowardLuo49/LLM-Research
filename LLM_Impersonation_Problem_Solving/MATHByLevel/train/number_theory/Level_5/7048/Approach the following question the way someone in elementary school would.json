    "solution": "Let the three integers be $a, b, c$. $N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$. Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\\{a, b\\}$ is one of $\\{1, 12\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\\cdot 13 = 156, 12\\cdot 8 = 96, 12\\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \\boxed{336}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we know that the product of three numbers is 6 times the sum of the numbers. That means $N = 6(a+b+c)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the three numbers.\n\nAnd we also know that one of the numbers is the sum of the other two. Let's call that number $a$. So $a = b+c$.\n\nNow we can substitute $a$ in terms of $b$ and $c$ into the equation $N = 6(a+b+c)$ to get $N = 6(2b+2c) = 12(b+c)$. \n\nSo $N$ is actually 12 times the sum of just two numbers. \n\nNow we can try some possible values for $b$ and $c$ to find all possible values of $N.\n\nLet's start with $b=1$ and $c=1$. Then $a = 2$, so $N = 12(2+2) = 48$.\n\nThen let's try $b=1$ and $c=2$. This gives $a=3$ and $N = 12(1+2) = 36$.\n\nNext, $b=2$ and $c=2$ gives $a=4$ and $N = 12(2+2) = 48$ again.\n\nAnd finally, $b=2$ and $c=3$ gives $a=5$ and $N = 12(2+3) = 60$.\n\nSo the sum of all possible values of $N$ is $48 + 36 + 48 + 60 = \\boxed{192}$.",
