    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $a_n$ be the integer obtained by writing all the integers from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. For example, $a_3 = 123$ and $a_{11} = 1234567891011$. Compute the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $45$.",
    "solution": "We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows: We will compute the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$. The remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 will be the residue (mod 45) which leaves the same remainders when divided by 5 and 9 as $a_{44}$ does. Since $a_{44}$ ends in $4$, it gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.\n\nFor the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 9, note that  \\begin{align*}\na_{44}&=44+43\\cdot 10^2 + 42 \\cdot 10^4+41\\cdot 10^6+\\cdots+10\\cdot10^{68}\\\\\n&\\qquad+9\\cdot 10^{70}+8\\cdot 10^{71}+\\cdots + 1\\cdot 10^{78} \\\\ &\\equiv 44+43+42+\\cdots+1\\pmod{9},\n\\end{align*}since $10^n\\equiv 1^n\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. In words, this calculation shows that we can sum groups of digits in any way we choose to check for divisibility by 9. For example, 1233 is divisible by 9 since $12+33=45$ is divisible by 9. This is a generalization of the rule that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Getting back to the problem at hand, we sum $44+43+\\cdots+1$ using the formula $1+2+\\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$ to find that $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.\n\nWe are looking for a multiple of $9$ that gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$. Nine satisfies this condition, so the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to recognize that we are essentially concatenating the numbers from $1$ to $n$ to form a single integer $a_n$. Therefore, we must find a way to efficiently calculate $a_{44}$ in order to determine the remainder when it is divided by $45$.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to first consider the pattern of remainders when dividing by $45$ for the integers from $1$ to $10$:\n$1 \\mod 45 = 1$\n$12 \\mod 45 = 12$\n$123 \\mod 45 = 123$\n$1234 \\mod 45 = 34$\n$12345 \\mod 45 = 0$\n$123456 \\mod 45 = 21$\n$1234567 \\mod 45 = 12$\n$12345678 \\mod 45 = 33$\n$123456789 \\mod 45 = 6$\n$12345678910 \\mod 45 = 10$\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that after every 9 digits, the remainder when divided by $45$ repeats in a cycle of length $45$. Therefore, we can find the remainder of $a_{44}$ by finding the remainder of $a_9$ and then multiplying it by $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{44}{9}\\right\\rfloor$ and adding the remainder of $a_n$ for $n$ from $1$ to $8$.\n\nCalculating $a_9$:\n$a_9 = 123456789 = 12345678 * 10 + 9 = 123456780 + 9 = 123456789$\n\nFrom the above pattern, we can see that $a_9$ has a remainder of $6$ when divided by $45$. Therefore, the remainder of $a_{44}$ when divided by $45$ can be calculated as follows:\n$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{44}{9}\\right\\rfloor*\\text{remainder of }a_9 + \\text{remainder of }a_{44\\mod 9}$\n$= 4*6 + \\text{remainder of }a_8$\n$= 24 + 33$\n$= 57$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $45$ is $12$.",
