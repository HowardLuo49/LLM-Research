    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the even perfect square factors of a number, we need to consider the exponents of the prime factors in the number. \n\nThe prime factorization of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ is $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$. \n\nIn order for a factor to be a perfect square, all the exponents of its prime factors must be even. Therefore, we need to find all possible combinations of even exponents for the prime factors 2 and 7.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, the even exponents can be 0, 2, or 4. \nFor the prime factor 7, the even exponents can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. \n\nTherefore, the possible combinations of even exponents for the prime factors 2 and 7 are:\n\n(0, 0) - means $2^0 \\cdot 7^0 = 1$\n(0, 2) - means $2^0 \\cdot 7^2 = 49$\n(0, 4) - means $2^0 \\cdot 7^4 = 2401$\n(2, 0) - means $2^2 \\cdot 7^0 = 4$\n(2, 2) - means $2^2 \\cdot 7^2 = 196$\n(2, 4) - means $2^2 \\cdot 7^4 = 9604$\n(4, 0) - means $2^4 \\cdot 7^0 = 16$\n(4, 2) - means $2^4 \\cdot 7^2 = 784$\n(4, 4) - means $2^4 \\cdot 7^4 = 38416$\n\nSo, there are 9 even perfect square factors for the number $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$.",
