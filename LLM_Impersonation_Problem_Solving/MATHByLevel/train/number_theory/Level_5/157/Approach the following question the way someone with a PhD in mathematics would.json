    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ have?",
    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the even perfect square factors of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$, we first need to consider the prime factorization of the number. \n\nThe prime factorization of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ is $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$.\n\nAn even perfect square factor of a number can be expressed as $a^2$, where $a$ is a positive integer. \n\nTo find the even perfect square factors of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$, we need to consider the possible combinations of even powers of 2 and perfect squares of 7 that can be formed from the prime factorization.\n\nFor the even powers of 2, we have 0, 2, and 4 as options.
