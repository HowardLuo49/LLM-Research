    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(168,693) = 21$.  Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 168 = 8 \\cdot 21$, both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 21.  Since $\\gcd(a,c) = 693 = 21 \\cdot 33$, both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by 21.  Therefore, $\\gcd(b,c)$ must be at least 21.\n\nIf we take $a = 5544$ (which is $21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 33$), $b = 168$, and $c = 693$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(5544,168) = 168$, $\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(5544,693) = 693$, and $\\gcd(b,c) = \\gcd(168,693) = 21$, which shows that the value of 21 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$, we can use the properties of greatest common divisors (gcd) in relation to positive integers.\n\nGiven that $\\gcd(a,b) = 168$ and $\\gcd(a,c) = 693$, we can use the following property:\n\nFor any positive integers $x$ and $y$, $\\gcd(ax, ay) = a \\cdot \\gcd(x, y)$.\n\nApplying this property to our situation, we can rewrite the given information as:\n\n$\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(168a, 168b) = 168$ \n\nand \n\n$\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(693a, 693c) = 693$.\n\nNow, by the transitive property of gcd, we have that:\n\n$\\gcd(168a, 168b, 693a, 693c) = \\gcd(168, 693) = 21$.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",
