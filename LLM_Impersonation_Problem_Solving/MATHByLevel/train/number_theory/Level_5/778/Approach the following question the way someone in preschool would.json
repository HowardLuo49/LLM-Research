    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(168,693) = 21$.  Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 168 = 8 \\cdot 21$, both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 21.  Since $\\gcd(a,c) = 693 = 21 \\cdot 33$, both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by 21.  Therefore, $\\gcd(b,c)$ must be at least 21.\n\nIf we take $a = 5544$ (which is $21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 33$), $b = 168$, and $c = 693$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(5544,168) = 168$, $\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(5544,693) = 693$, and $\\gcd(b,c) = \\gcd(168,693) = 21$, which shows that the value of 21 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see, I know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 168$ means that 168 is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, and $\\gcd(a,c) = 693$ means that 693 is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $c. \n\nSo maybe if I find the prime factorization of 168 and 693, then I can figure out the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$.\n\nLet's see, 168 is equal to $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$ and 693 is equal to $3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$. \n\nNow I can see that the common factors between 168 and 693 are 3 and 7.
