    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(168,693) = 21$.  Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 168 = 8 \\cdot 21$, both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 21.  Since $\\gcd(a,c) = 693 = 21 \\cdot 33$, both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by 21.  Therefore, $\\gcd(b,c)$ must be at least 21.\n\nIf we take $a = 5544$ (which is $21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 33$), $b = 168$, and $c = 693$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(5544,168) = 168$, $\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(5544,693) = 693$, and $\\gcd(b,c) = \\gcd(168,693) = 21$, which shows that the value of 21 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",

This means that $a$ must have at least the factors of 168. Since $\\gcd(a,c) = 693$, this means that $a$ must have all the factors of 693. Therefore, $a$ must have the factors of both 168 and 693.\n\nThe smallest possible value for $a$ that satisfies these conditions is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 7^3$.\n\nIf $a = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 7^3$, then the factors of $b$ must be $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$ to ensure that $\\gcd(a,b) = 168$.
