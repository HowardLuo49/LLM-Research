Zan has created this iterative rule for generating sequences of whole numbers:\n\n1) If a number is 25 or less, double the number.\n\n2) If a number is greater than 25, subtract 12 from it.\n\nLet $F$ be the first number in a sequence generated by the rule above. $F$ is a \"sweet number\" if 16 is not a term in the sequence that starts with $F$. How many of the whole numbers 1 through 50 are \"sweet numbers\"?",
    "solution": "Consider the remainders of numbers in one of these sequences modulo 12. The first step doubles the remainder, but second step does not change it. So, if repeatedly doubling a number modulo 12 does not give $16 \\equiv 4$, the number 16 cannot be a term in the sequence. On the other hand, if there is a term congruent to 4 mod 12 in the sequence, it must be 4, 16, or a number greater than 25. If it's 4, two steps later 16 will be in the sequence. If it's 16, then 16 is in the sequence. If it's greater than 25, then subtracting off 12 repeatedly will eventually give 16, the largest number less than 25 which is congruent to 4 modulo 12.\n\nSo, we just need to find which remainders modulo 12 will eventually give 4 when doubled modulo 12 repeatedly. We can easily see that 1, 2, 4, and 8 all give 4 modulo 12 eventually. We can also see that 3, 6, 9 and 0 will just end up at 0 (ie, multiples of 12) when doubled modulo 12, and so they will not reach 4 modulo 12. This leaves 5, 7, 10, and 11. Doubling 11 gives $22\\equiv10$, $20\\equiv8$, so 11 and 10 reach 4 modulo 12. Double 5 gives 10 modulo 12, and double 7 gives 2 modulo 12, so they will eventually reach 4.\n\nTherefore, the only sweet numbers are congruent to 0, 3, 6, or 9 modulo 12, or in other words, multiples of 3. There are $\\boxed{16}$ multiples of 3 between 1 and 50.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the sequence generated by the given rule for each starting number from 1 to 50 and determine if 16 appears in the sequence. \n\nLet's consider the sequence for each starting number from 1 to 50:\n\n1) If the starting number is less than or equal to 25, we double it until we reach a number greater than 25 and then start subtracting 12. Let's analyze this process for each starting number:\n\n- For starting numbers 1 to 25:\n   - For the starting number 1, the sequence will be: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 4, -8, so 16 appears in the sequence.\n   - For starting numbers 2 to 15, the sequence will always contain 16 since we double the number until it reaches 16, and then we subtract 12.\n   - For starting numbers 17 to 24, the sequence will not contain 16 because after doubling the number once, we subtract 12 before reaching 16 again.\n\n2) If the starting number is greater than 25, we subtract 12 until we reach a number less than or equal to 25 and then double it. Let's analyze this process for each starting number:\n\n- For starting numbers 26 to 50:\n   - For starting numbers 26 to 37, the sequence will contain 16 since after subtracting 12, we double the number before reaching 16.\n   - For starting numbers 38 to 50, the sequence will not contain 16 because after subtracting 12 once, we double the number before reaching 16 again.\n\nTherefore, the \"sweet numbers\" are the numbers 2 to 15 and 38 to 50. So, there are a total of 14 \"sweet numbers\" in the range 1 through 50.",
