    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The value $b^n$ has both $b$ and $n$ as positive integers less than or equal to 15. What is the greatest number of positive factors $b^n$ can have?",
    "solution": "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so in order to find the greatest number of positive factors that $b^n$ can have, we need to consider the prime factorization of the number. Let's start by thinking about the factors of $b^n$. \n\nThe factors of $b^n$ will be of the form $b^k$ where $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. This means that the total number of factors of $b^n$ will be $(n+1)$, since there are $n+1$ possible values for $k$.\n\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of $b^n$. Since $b$ is a positive integer less than or equal to 15, it can be expressed as a product of prime factors. \n\nIf $b$ is prime, then its prime factorization will be $b = b^1$, and the number of factors of $b^n$ will be $(n+1)$. \n\nIf $b$ is not prime, then its prime factorization will include prime factors $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. Each prime factor $p_i$ will have a power of $a_i$, and the prime factorization of $b^n$ will be $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$. \n\nThe number of factors of $b^n$ will then be $(a_1+1) \\cdot (a_2+1) \\cdot ... \\cdot (a_k+1)$. To maximize the number of factors, we want to maximize the powers of each prime factor in the prime factorization of $b$. This means setting each power $a_i$ to be equal to $n$. \n\nSo, the greatest number of positive factors of $b^n$ will be $(n+1)^k$ where $k$ is the number of distinct prime factors in the prime factorization of $b$. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of positive factors $b^n$ can have is $(n+1)^k$.",
