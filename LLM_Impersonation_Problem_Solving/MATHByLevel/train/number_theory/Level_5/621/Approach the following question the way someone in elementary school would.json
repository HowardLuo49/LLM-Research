    "solution": "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's try out some numbers to see how many factors they have:\n\n- If $b=2$ and $n=1$, then $b^n = 2^1 = 2$ which has 2 factors: 1 and 2.\n- If $b=2$ and $n=2$, then $b^n = 2^2 = 4$ which has 3 factors: 1, 2, and 4.\n- If $b=2$ and $n=3$, then $b^n = 2^3 = 8$ which has 4 factors: 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\nWe can see that the number of factors of $b^n$ increases as $n$ increases. So to find the greatest number of factors, we would want to have the greatest possible value of $n$. \n\nSince $b$ is a positive integer less than or equal to 15, we need to find the largest factor of 15. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. So if $b=15$ and $n=5$, then $b^n = 15^5$ would have the greatest number of factors.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of positive factors $b^n$ can have is 6: 1, 3, 5, 15, 225, and 3375.",
