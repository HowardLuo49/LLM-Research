    "solution": "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the greatest number of positive factors that $b^n$ can have, we must first understand the relationship between the number of factors and the prime factorization of $b^n$. \n\nLet's express $b$ as a product of prime factors: $b = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{e_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $e_1, e_2, ..., e_k$ are positive integers. \n\nThen, $b^n = (p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{e_k})^n = p_1^{ne_1} \\cdot p_2^{ne_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{ne_k}$. \n\nThe total number of factors of $b^n$ can then be found by adding 1 to each exponent and multiplying these incremented exponents, which gives $(ne_1 + 1)(ne_2 + 1)...(ne_k + 1)$. \n\nTo maximize the number of factors, we must maximize each of the terms $ne_1 + 1$.
