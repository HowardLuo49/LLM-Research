For any integer $n>1$, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is:\n$\\text{(A) } 0\\quad\\qquad \\text{(B) } 1\\quad\\\\ \\text{(C) } \\frac{n}{2} \\text{ for n even, } \\frac{n+1}{2} \\text{ for n odd}\\quad\\\\ \\text{(D) } n-1\\quad \\text{(E) } n$\n",
    "solution": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! To find the number of prime numbers between $n!+1$ and $n!+n$, we first need to figure out which number we get when we add $1$ to $n!$. Then we need to find out which number we get when we add $n$ to $n!$. Let's use an example. \n\nLet's say $n=3$. So $3!=3\\cdot2\\cdot1=6$. If we add $1$ to $6$, we get $6+1=7$. If we add $3$ to $6$, we get $6+3=9$. So we are looking for prime numbers between $7$ and $9$. The only prime number between $7$ and $9$ is $7$.\n\nLet's try another example. Let's say $n=4$. So $4!=4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1=24$. If we add $1$ to $24$, we get $24+1=25$. If we add $4$ to $24$, we get $24+4=28$. The prime numbers between $25$ and $28$ are $26$ and $27$. We can see there are no prime numbers between them.\n\nSo, for even $n$, there is only $1$ prime number between $n!+1$ and $n!+n$. And for odd $n$, there are no prime numbers between $n!+1$ and $n!+n$. \n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B) } 1}$.",
