    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what numbers are multiples of 8. Multiples of 8 end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nSince $N$ is the greatest integer multiple of 8, no two of its digits are the same. This means that $N$ must end in 0 because if it ends in any other digit, there would be another multiple of 8 with the same digits rearranged that is greater than $N$.\n\nSo, $N$ ends in 0. To find the greatest multiple of 8 that has different digits, we can start with the largest possible number and work our way down. \n\nStarting with 0, the next largest number would be 80. Since we can't repeat digits, the next largest number would be 40. Then 24, as we can't repeat digits. Then 16, then 72, then 56, then 48. \n\nSo, $N = 816$ and the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{816}$.",
