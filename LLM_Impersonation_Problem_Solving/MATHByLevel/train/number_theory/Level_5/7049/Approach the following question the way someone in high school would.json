    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $N$ be the greatest integer multiple of 8, no two of whose digits are the same. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000?\n",
    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest integer multiple of 8 with distinct digits, we need to start by looking at the largest number we can make with distinct digits. Since we want a multiple of 8, we should start from the largest possible number and work our way down.\n\nThe largest number we can make with distinct digits is 987654321. However, this number is not a multiple of 8. So, let's try the next largest number with distinct digits: 987654312.\n\nDividing 987654312 by 8 gives us a remainder of 4. Similarly, dividing 987654321 by 8 gives us a remainder of 1. Therefore, the greatest integer multiple of 8 with distinct digits is 987654312 and the remainder when it is divided by 1000 is 312.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{312}$.",
