    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by counting how many positions are unoccupied in each case. When arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied. And when arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied.\n\nSo, if we add one row, we are also adding one unoccupied position. That means, for each additional row, there is an extra unoccupied position.\n\nSo, if there are 8 rows and 2 unoccupied positions, that means there are 10 positions in total.\n\nAnd if there are 9 rows and 3 unoccupied positions, that means there are 12 positions in total.\n\nNow, let's look at the numbers between 100 and 200.\n\nIf the total positions are between 100 and 200, the only possible option is 120.\n\nSo, there are 120 members in the band.",
