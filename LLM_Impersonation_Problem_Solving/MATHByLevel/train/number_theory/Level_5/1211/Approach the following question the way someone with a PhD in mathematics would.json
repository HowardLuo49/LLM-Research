When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the number of members in the band be denoted by M and the number of columns in the rectangular formation be denoted by C. We are given that when the band is arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied, and when arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. \n\nFrom this information, we can set up the following equations:\n\n8C = M + 2\n9C = M + 3\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we get:\nM = 81C - 22\n\nSince we know that the membership is between 100 and 200, we can substitute this range to find possible values of C:\n\n100 < M < 200\n100 < 81C - 22 < 200\n122 < 81C < 222\n1.50 < C < 2.74\n\nSince C must be a positive integer, the only possible value for C is 2. Thus, substituting C = 2 back into the equation M = 81C - 22, we get M = 140.\n\nTherefore, the band has 140 members.",
