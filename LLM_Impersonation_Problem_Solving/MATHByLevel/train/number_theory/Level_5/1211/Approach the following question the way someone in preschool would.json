    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the members in the band together by arranging them in rows. \n\nFirst, let's try with 8 rows. We count the members as we arrange them. Oh no, we have 2 positions left empty. Let's try again with 9 rows. We count again as we arrange them. This time, we have 3 positions left empty. \n\nHmm, let's think carefully. How many members do we need so that when arranged in 8 rows there are 2 positions unoccupied, and when arranged in 9 rows there are 3 positions unoccupied? Let's count together. \n\nIf we try with 104 members, there would be 2 positions left empty in 8 rows. Let's see if with 104 members arranged in 9 rows, there will be 3 positions left empty. \n\nOh no, that's not right. Let's try with 105 members. Will there be 3 positions left empty in 9 rows? Let's count together. \n\nYes, we did it! With 105 members, when arranged in 8 rows there are 2 positions left empty, and when arranged in 9 rows there are 3 positions left empty. \n\nSo there are 105 members in the band.
