    "solution": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by understanding the question. We need to find the largest positive integer $n$ such that $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$. This means that there is no remainder when we divide $n^3+100$ by $n+10$.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Remainder Theorem. According to the Remainder Theorem, if we substitute $n=-10$ into $n^3+100$, we can find the remainder. If the remainder is 0, then $n+10$ is a factor of $n^3+100.\n\nLet's substitute $n=-10$ into $n^3+100$:\n$(-10)^3+100 = -1000+100 = -900$\n\nSince the remainder is not 0, $n+10$ is not a factor of $n^3+100 when $n=-10$.\n\nNow, let's try the next smallest positive integer $n$:\nIf $n=0$, then $n^3+100 = 100$ and $n+10 = 10$. So, $n+10$ is not a factor of $n^3+100 when $n=0$.\n\nLet's continue trying the next smallest positive integer values of $n$ until we find the largest positive integer $n$ such that $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10. \n\nAfter trying a few more values of $n$, we find that $n=90$ is the largest positive integer such that $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$.",
