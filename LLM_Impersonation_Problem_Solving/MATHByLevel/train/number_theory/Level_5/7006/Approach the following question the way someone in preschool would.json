    "solution": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding some numbers that make the expression $n^3+100$ divisible by $n+10$. We can start by trying some small numbers, like 1. When we plug in 1 for $n$, we get $1^3+100=101$, which is not divisible by 1+10, which is 11. Let's try the number 2. When we plug in 2 for $n$, we get $2^3+100=108$, which is not divisible by 2+10, which is 12. Let's try 3. When we plug in 3 for $n$, we get $3^3+100=109$, which is not divisible by 3+10, which is 13. Let's try 4. When we plug in 4 for $n$, we get $4^3+100=136$, which is divisible by 4+10, which is 14. So, the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$ is 4. Yay, we did it!",
