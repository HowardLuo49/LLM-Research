    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmmmm, let's see. To make the decimal of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminate, we need to make sure that $1400$ can be factored into just $2$'s and $5$'s. So let's see, $1400 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$. That means that in order for the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ to terminate, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3 \\times 5^2 = 200$. \n\nSo now we just need to count how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 200. Let's see, we have 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000. So there are 5 integer values of $n$ between 1 and 1000 inclusive that will make the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminate. Yay, we did it!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 142?: Hmmmm, let's see. To make the decimal of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminate, we need to make sure that $1400$ can be factored into just $2$'s and $5$'s. So let's see, $1400 = 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$.
