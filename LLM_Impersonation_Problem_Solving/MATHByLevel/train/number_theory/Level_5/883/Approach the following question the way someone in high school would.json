    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to look at the prime factorization of the denominator 1400. 1400 factors into 2^3 * 5^2 * 7.\n\nFor the decimal representation of a fraction to terminate, the denominator must only have prime factors of 2 and/or 5. Any other prime factors will make the decimal representation repeat.\n\nSo, we can only have 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of n. Since n must be between 1 and 1000, the possible values for n are 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, ..., 625, 800, 1000.\n\nTo count the number of integer values of n that fit these criteria, we can see that n can be written in the form 2^a * 5^b where 0 \u2264 a \u2264 3 and 0 \u2264 b \u2264 2.\n\nSo, there are 4 choices for a and 3 choices for b, leading to a total of 4 * 3 = 12 possible values of n between 1 and 1000 for which the decimal representation of n/1400 terminates.",
