    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to find the remainder when we divide $6^{83} + 8^{83}$ by $49$. Let's see, if we have a lot of blocks labeled \"6\" and \"8\", maybe we can play around and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nHmm, when I add blocks labeled \"6\" and \"8\" together, I see that if I have 6 blocks and I add 8 more blocks, I have 14 blocks. And if I have 14 blocks of those and I add 8 more, I have 22. \n\nI think I see a pattern! The remainder when you divide by 49 keeps going in the sequence 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, 46, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 2, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 0.\n\nSo, when we divide $6^{83} + 8^{83}$ by $49$, the remainder is 0.
