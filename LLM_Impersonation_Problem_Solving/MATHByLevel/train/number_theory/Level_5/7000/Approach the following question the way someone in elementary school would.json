    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ to see if we can spot a pattern. \n\n$a_1 = 6^1 + 8^1 = 6 + 8 = 14$\n\n$a_2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$\n\n$a_3 = 6^3 + 8^3 = 216 + 512 = 728$\n\nHmm, it looks like the numbers are getting big pretty quickly! Let's try and simplify things. \n\nWe can rewrite $6$ and $8$ as $-1$ and $1$ modulo $7$. So, $6^n \\equiv (-1)^n \\pmod{7}$ and $8^n \\equiv 1^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, $a_n = (-1)^n + 1$. Let's see if that makes it easier to find $a_{83}$ modulo $49$. \n\n$a_{83} = (-1)^{83} + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0$\n\nSo, $a_{83} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$.
