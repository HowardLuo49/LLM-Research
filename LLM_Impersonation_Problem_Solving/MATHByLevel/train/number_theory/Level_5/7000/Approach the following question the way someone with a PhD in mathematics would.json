    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of $a_{83}$ when divided by $49$, we can first rewrite $a_{83}$ using modular arithmetic. \n\nWe know that $6 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$, and $8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $a_{83}$ as:\n \n\\begin{align*}\na_{83} & = (-1)^{83} + (-1)^{83} \\\\\n& = -1 + 1 \\\\\n& = 0 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis tells us that $a_{83}$ is divisible by 7. Since $49 = 7^2$, the remainder upon dividing $a_{83}$ by 49 must also be divisible by 7. \n\nThus, the remainder of $a_{83}$ when divided by 49 is $\\boxed{0}$.",
