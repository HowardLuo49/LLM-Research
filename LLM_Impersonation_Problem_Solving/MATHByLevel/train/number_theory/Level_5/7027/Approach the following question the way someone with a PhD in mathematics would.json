    "solution": "We know that $n^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$ must have $(62+1)\\times (38+1)$ factors by its prime factorization. If we group all of these factors (excluding $n$) into pairs that multiply to $n^2$, then one factor per pair is less than $n$, and so there are $\\frac{63\\times 39-1}{2} = 1228$ factors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$. There are $32\\times20-1 = 639$ factors of $n$, which clearly are less than $n$, but are still factors of $n$. Therefore, using complementary counting, there are $1228-639=\\boxed{589}$ factors of $n^2$ that do not divide $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, let us find the prime factorization of $n^2$. Since $n=2^{31}3^{19}$, we have $n^2 = (2^{31}3^{19})^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$.\n\nNow, let us consider the divisors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$. These divisors must have a prime factorization $2^a3^b$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 31$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 19$, since they must be less than $n=2^{31}3^{19}$ but not divide $n$.\n\nTo count the number of such divisors, we notice that for each possible value of $a$ and $b$, except for when $a=31$ and $b=19$ (which would correspond to $n$ itself), we have a valid divisor. So, the total number of such divisors is $(31+1)(19+1) - 1 = 32 \\cdot 20 - 1 = 639$.\n\nTherefore, there are 639 positive integer divisors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$.",
