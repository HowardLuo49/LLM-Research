    "solution": "We know that $n^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$ must have $(62+1)\\times (38+1)$ factors by its prime factorization. If we group all of these factors (excluding $n$) into pairs that multiply to $n^2$, then one factor per pair is less than $n$, and so there are $\\frac{63\\times 39-1}{2} = 1228$ factors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$. There are $32\\times20-1 = 639$ factors of $n$, which clearly are less than $n$, but are still factors of $n$. Therefore, using complementary counting, there are $1228-639=\\boxed{589}$ factors of $n^2$ that do not divide $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the prime factorization of $n^2$. Since $n=2^{31}3^{19}$, we have $n^2 = (2^{31}3^{19})^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$.\n\nNow, we want to find how many positive integer divisors of $n^2$ are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$. To do this, we first need to find all the positive integer divisors of $n^2$. \n\nThe number of positive integer divisors of $n^2$ is equal to $(62+1)(38+1) = 63 \\cdot 39 = 2457$.\n\nNow, we need to find how many of those $2457$ divisors are less than $n$ and do not divide $n$. Since $n=2^{31}3^{19}$, any divisor of $n^2$ that does not have $2^{31}3^{19}$ as a factor will not divide $n$.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integer divisors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$ is equal to the number of divisors of $2^{31}$ times the number of divisors of $3^{19}$, which is $(31+1)(19+1)-1 = 32 \\cdot 20 - 1 = 639$. \n\nSo, there are $639$ positive integer divisors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$.",
