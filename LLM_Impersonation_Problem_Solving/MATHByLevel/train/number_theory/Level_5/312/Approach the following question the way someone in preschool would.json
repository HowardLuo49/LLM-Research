Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list?",
    "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.",
    "gpt_response": "I can count the numbers for you! Let's start with the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square. Hmm... 20 is not a perfect square, so let's try the next one. Oh, 40 is also not a perfect square. Let's try 60! Yay, 60 is a perfect square because 60 x 60 = 3600. So, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square is 60.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube. Let's try 20. Nope, 20 is not a perfect cube. Let's try 40. Still not a perfect cube. Ah, 60! 60 is a perfect cube because 60 x 60 x 60 = 216000. So, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube is 60.\n\nNext, let's find all the multiples of 20 between 60 (perfect square) and 60 (perfect cube). The multiples of 20 between 60 and 60 are 80, 100, 120, 140... and so on. Let me count them. 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 300, 320, 340, 360, 380, 400, 420, 440, 460, 480, 500, 520, 540, 560. \n\nSo, Cameron's list has 25 integers in total.
