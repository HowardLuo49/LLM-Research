    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. What is the least positive integer which when divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4, when divided by 6 gives a remainder of 5, when divided by 7 gives a remainder of 6, when divided by 8 gives a remainder of 7, when divided by 9 gives a remainder of 8, and when divided by 10 gives a remainder of 9?",
    "solution": "Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer satisfying all the given conditions. Note that since $N$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, $N+1$ must be divisible by 5. Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Prime factorizing these numbers, we find that their least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = 2520$. Thus the least possible value for $N$ is $\\boxed{2519}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If we start counting by 1 and keep adding 1 each time, we can figure it out. \n\nSo, when we divide 1 by 5, we get a remainder of 1. When we divide 2 by 5, we get a remainder of 2. When we divide 3 by 5, we get a remainder of 3. When we divide 4 by 5, we get a remainder of 4. Yay! 4 is our answer because when we divide 4 by 5, we get a remainder of 4. \n\nWe can check with the other numbers too to make sure. When we divide 4 by 6, we get a remainder of 4. When we divide 4 by 7, we get a remainder of 4. When we divide 4 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. When we divide 4 by 9, we get a remainder of 4. When we divide 4 by 10, we get a remainder of 4. Hooray, we did it! 4 is the least positive integer that gives the remainders 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 when divided by 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.",
