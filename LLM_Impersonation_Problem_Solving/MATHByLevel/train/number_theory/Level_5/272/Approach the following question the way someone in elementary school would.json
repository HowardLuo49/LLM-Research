What is the least positive integer which when divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4, when divided by 6 gives a remainder of 5, when divided by 7 gives a remainder of 6, when divided by 8 gives a remainder of 7, when divided by 9 gives a remainder of 8, and when divided by 10 gives a remainder of 9?",
    "solution": "Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer satisfying all the given conditions. Note that since $N$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, $N+1$ must be divisible by 5. Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Prime factorizing these numbers, we find that their least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = 2520$. Thus the least possible value for $N$ is $\\boxed{2519}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that does this, we can start by looking for numbers that end in 4, because when a number is divided by 5, the remainder is found by looking at the last digit. Then we can add 1 to see which of those numbers work for the other conditions. Let's start with 4.\n\n4 divided by 5 is 4 with a remainder of 1. So that doesn't work. Let's try 14.\n\n14 divided by 5 is 2 with a remainder of 4. 14 divided by 6 is 2 with a remainder of 2. 14 divided by 7 is 2 with a remainder of 0. 14 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 6. 14 divided by 9 is 1 with a remainder of 5. 14 divided by 10 is 1 with a remainder of 4. \n\nSo, the least positive integer that satisfies all the conditions is 14.",
