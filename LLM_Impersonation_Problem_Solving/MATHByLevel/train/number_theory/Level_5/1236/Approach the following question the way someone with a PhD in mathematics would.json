    "solution": "The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are $2, 4, 6,\\ldots, 100$.  There are 50 such numbers.\n\nThe multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are $3, 6, 9,\\ldots, 99$.  There are 33 such numbers.\n\nThese lists count all of the multiples of 6 twice.  The multiples of 6 are $6, 12,\\ldots,96$, and there are 16 such multiples of 6.  Therefore there are $50+33-16=67$ multiples of 2 or 3 from 1 to 100.\n\nAll of the 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are on this list.  Therefore there are $67-25=\\boxed{42}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integers not exceeding 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4, we first need to establish the total number of multiples of 2 or 3 in this range.\n\nThere are 50 multiples of 2 in the range 1-100, as every other integer is divisible by 2.\nSimilarly, there are 33 multiples of 3 in the same range, as every third integer is divisible by 3.\n\nTo find the total number of multiples of 2 or 3, we must add these counts together: 50 (multiples of 2) + 33 (multiples of 3) = 83.\n\nHowever, this count includes some duplicates, meaning we have counted those integers that are multiples of both 2 and 3 twice.
