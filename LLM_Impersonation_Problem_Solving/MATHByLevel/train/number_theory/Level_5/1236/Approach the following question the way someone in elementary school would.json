    "solution": "The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are $2, 4, 6,\\ldots, 100$.  There are 50 such numbers.\n\nThe multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are $3, 6, 9,\\ldots, 99$.  There are 33 such numbers.\n\nThese lists count all of the multiples of 6 twice.  The multiples of 6 are $6, 12,\\ldots,96$, and there are 16 such multiples of 6.  Therefore there are $50+33-16=67$ multiples of 2 or 3 from 1 to 100.\n\nAll of the 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are on this list.  Therefore there are $67-25=\\boxed{42}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many numbers are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4, first we need to find out how many numbers are multiples of 2 and 3. We can do this by finding the multiples of 6 (2 x 3). \n\nThen we need to subtract the numbers that are multiples of 4 and also of 6. This leaves us with the numbers that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4. \n\nSo let's find the multiples of 6 first. Multiples of 6 that are not greater than 100 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96. There are 16 of them.\n\nNext, let's find the numbers that are multiples of 4 and also of 6. These are numbers that are multiples of 12 (2 x 6). \n\nMultiples of 12 that are not greater than 100 are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96. There are 8 of them.\n\nNow, we subtract the numbers that are multiples of 12 from the numbers that are multiples of 6. So, 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 positive integers not exceeding 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4.",
