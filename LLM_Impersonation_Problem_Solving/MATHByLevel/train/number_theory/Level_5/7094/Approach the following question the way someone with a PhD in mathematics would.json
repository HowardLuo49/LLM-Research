Find the sum of the six least positive integers $n$ that are solutions to $\\tau (n) + \\tau (n+1) = 7$.\n",
    "solution": "In order to obtain a sum of $7$, we must have:\neither a number with $5$ divisors (a fourth power of a prime) and a number with $2$ divisors (a prime), or\na number with $4$ divisors (a semiprime or a cube of a prime) and a number with $3$ divisors (a square of a prime). (No integer greater than $1$ can have fewer than $2$ divisors.)\nSince both of these cases contain a number with an odd number of divisors, that number must be an even power of a prime. These can come in the form of a square-like $3^2$ with $3$ divisors, or a fourth power like $2^4$ with $5$ divisors. We then find the smallest such values by hand.\n$2^2$ has two possibilities: $3$ and $4$ or $4$ and $5$. Neither works.\n$3^2$ has two possibilities: $8$ and $9$ or $9$ and $10$. $(8,9)$ and $(9,10)$ both work.\n$2^4$ has two possibilities: $15$ and $16$ or $16$ and $17$. Only $(16,17)$ works.\n$5^2$ has two possibilities: $24$ and $25$ or $25$ and $26$. Only $(25,26)$ works.\n$7^2$ has two possibilities: $48$ and $49$ or $49$ and $50$. Neither works.\n$3^4$ has two possibilities: $80$ and $81$ or $81$ and $82$. Neither works.\n$11^2$ has two possibilities: $120$ and $121$ or $121$ and $122$. Only $(121,122)$ works.\n$13^2$ has two possibilities: $168$ and $169$ or $169$ and $170$. Neither works.\n$17^2$ has two possibilities: $288$ and $289$ or $289$ and $290$. Neither works.\n$19^2$ has two possibilities: $360$ and $361$ or $361$ and $362$. Only $(361,362)$ works.\nHaving computed the working possibilities, we take the sum of the corresponding values of $n$: $8+9+16+25+121+361 = \\boxed{540}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by noting that $\\tau(n)$ for a prime $n=p$ is equal to $2$ (as $p$ and $1$ are the only divisors of $p$). Therefore, we can rewrite the given equation as $\\tau(n) + \\tau(n+1) = 7$ as $2 + \\tau(n+1) = 7$, which implies $\\tau(n+1) = 5$.\n\nSince $\\tau(n+1) = 5$, the possible values for $n+1$ are either of the form $p^4$ where $p$ is a prime or $p^2q$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes.

Adding these six numbers together gives the sum of the six least positive integers $n$ that are solutions to $\\tau (n) + \\tau (n+1) = 7$ as $15 + 624 + 71 + 1200 + 104 + 1023 = \\boxed{3037}$.",
