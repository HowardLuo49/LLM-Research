What is the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base?  Give your response in base 2.",
    "solution": "The smallest possible 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$, which is $2^4+2^0=17_{10}$. Now we try converting 17 to other bases. In base 3, we get $122_3$, and in base 4, we get $101_4$, which is a palindrome. So $\\boxed{10001_2}$ works.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so a palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. In base 2, a 5-digit palindrome would have the form abccba (where a, b, and c are either 0 or 1). \n\nWe want this number to also be a palindrome in a different base. Let's say the different base is base 10, so our 5-digit palindrome in base 2 will be converted to a 3-digit palindrome in base 10. \n\nThe smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is 10001 (which is 17 in base 10). When we convert this number to base 10, it remains a palindrome (in base 10), as 17 reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nTherefore, the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in base 10 is 10001. So, our response in base 2 is 10001.",
