What is the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base?  Give your response in base 2.",
    "solution": "The smallest possible 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$, which is $2^4+2^0=17_{10}$. Now we try converting 17 to other bases. In base 3, we get $122_3$, and in base 4, we get $101_4$, which is a palindrome. So $\\boxed{10001_2}$ works.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2, we need to look for numbers that read the same forwards and backwards. One way to do this is to start at the lowest 5-digit number in base 2, which is 10000. This number is not a palindrome because it reads 10000 both ways.\n\nSo, let's try the next number, 10001. This number reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome in base 2. Now, we need to see if we can express it as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base.\n\nThe next base we should try is base 3. Let's convert 10001 in base 2 to base 3. \n\n10001 in base 2 is equal to 121 in base 3. This number reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a 3-digit palindrome.\n\nTherefore, the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base is 10001 in base 2, which is equivalent to 121 in base 3.",
