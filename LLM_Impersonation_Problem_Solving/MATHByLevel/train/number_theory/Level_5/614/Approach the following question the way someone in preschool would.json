    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $n$ be an odd integer with exactly 11 positive divisors.  Find the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$.",
    "solution": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count to 11. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11! Woohoo, we did it! Now let's find $n$ that has 11 divisors. Since $n$ is odd, maybe we can start with 1 and then try bigger odd numbers. Let's try 1. That has 1 divisor. What about 3? That has 2 divisors. Oh, I know! What about 5? That has 2 divisors too. Let's keep trying until we find one with 11 divisors. \n\nAfter counting, we found out that $n = 2^5 = 32$. So that means $8n^3 = 8(32)^3 = 8(32768) = 262144$. Now we need to find the number of positive divisors of 262144. I think this number is big, so we can try to break it down into prime factors. 262144 is 2 to the 18th power. That's a lot of twos! \n\nNow we know that $8n^3$ has 19 divisors because of the 18 twos and the extra factor of 8. Yay, we did it!",
