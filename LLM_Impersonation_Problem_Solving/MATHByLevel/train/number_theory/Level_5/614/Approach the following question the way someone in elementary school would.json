    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $n$ be an odd integer with exactly 11 positive divisors.  Find the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$.",
    "solution": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out what kind of number $n$ could be. Since $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors, that means $n$ must be a perfect square. Why? Because a perfect square has an odd number of factors - if you think about it, every factor pairs up with another factor except for the square root of the number. \n\nSo if $n$ is a perfect square, let's call it $k^2$, where $k$ is another positive integer. Now we want to find the number of factors of $8k^6$.\n\nFirst, let's break down $8k^6$. We can write this as $2^3 \\cdot k^6$. Now let's find the number of factors. We add 1 to each exponent and multiply them together: $(3+1)(6+1)=4 \\cdot 7 = 28$.\n\nSo, the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$ is 28.",
