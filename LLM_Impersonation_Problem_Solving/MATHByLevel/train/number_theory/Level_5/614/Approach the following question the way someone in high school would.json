    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Let $n$ be an odd integer with exactly 11 positive divisors.  Find the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$.",
    "solution": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Since $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors, we can write $n$ in the form $p^{10}$ for some prime number $p$. Since $n$ is odd, $p$ must also be odd. Therefore, $n = p^{10}$ is odd if $p$ is odd. \n\nNow, we want to find the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$. Notice that $8 = 2^3$, so $8n^3 = (2n)^3 = 2^3n^3$. Since $n = p^{10}$, we have $8n^3 = 2^3(p^{10})^3 = 2^3p^{30}$.\n\nThe number $2^3p^{30}$ can be written as $2^x \\cdot p^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. \n\nTo find the number of positive divisors of $2^3p^{30}$, we use the formula for the number of divisors of a number: if a number has prime factorization $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, then the number of positive divisors is $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1)$.\n\nSince $2^3p^{30}$ has prime factorization $2^3 \\cdot p^{30}$, the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$ is $(3+1)(30+1) = 4 \\cdot 31 = \\boxed{124}$.",
