    "solution": "Write $n^2 = (m + 1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$, or equivalently, $(2n + 1)(2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 12m^2 + 12m + 3 = 3(2m + 1)^2$.\nSince $2n + 1$ and $2n - 1$ are both odd and their difference is $2$, they are relatively prime. But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square. We cannot have $2n - 1$ be three times a square, for then $2n + 1$ would be a square congruent to $2$ modulo $3$, which is impossible.\nThus $2n - 1$ is a square, say $b^2$. But $2n + 79$ is also a square, say $a^2$. Then $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80$. Since $a + b$ and $a - b$ have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even. To maximize $n$, it suffices to maximize $2b = (a + b) - (a - b)$ and check that this yields an integral value for $m$. This occurs when $a + b = 40$ and $a - b = 2$, that is, when $a = 21$ and $b = 19$. This yields $n = 181$ and $m = 104$, so the answer is $\\boxed{181}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFor condition (i), we want to find an integer $n$ such that $n^2$ can be written as the difference of two consecutive cubes. So the formula for consecutive cubes is $(n-1)^3$ and $n^3$. We want to see if $(n-1)^3 - n^3 = n^2$ has a solution.\n\nBy expanding, we get $(n-1)^3 - n^3 = n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - n^3 = n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - n^3 = -3n^2 + 3n.$ So, we see that $n^2 = -3n^2 + 3n$, which simplifies to $4n^2 - 3n = 0$. Factoring out an $n$ gives $n(4n - 3) = 0$, so the solutions are $n = 0$ and $n = \\frac{3}{4}$. Since we want the largest integer $n$, that means $n = 0$.\n\nFor condition (ii), we want to find an integer $n$ such that $2n + 79$ is a perfect square. We can start by setting $2n + 79 = x^2$, where $x$ is an integer. Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{x^2 - 79}{2}$. We need to find an $x$ such that $n$ is an integer. We can try different values for $x$ until we find the largest one such that $n$ is an integer.\n\nTo put it simply, we're looking for a number $n$ such that it can be written as the difference of two cubes and when we add 79 times 2 to it, we get a perfect square.
