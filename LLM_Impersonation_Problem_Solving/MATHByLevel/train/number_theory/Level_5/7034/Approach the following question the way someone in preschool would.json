    "solution": "It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.\n$6^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12}$\nThe LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\\max(24,a)}3^{\\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \\le a \\le 24$, there are $\\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count together! We know that $12^{12}$ is the least common multiple of $6^6$, $8^8$, and another number we'll call $k$. So we need to figure out how many different values $k$ could be. \n\nFirst, let's find the prime factors of $6^6$ and $8^8$. \n$6 = 2 * 3$\n$6^6 = 2^6 * 3^6$\n$8 = 2^3$\n$8^8 = 2^24$\n\nNow, the least common multiple will have all the prime factors of each number, with the highest power of each one. So we need to make $12^{12}$ with the same prime factors. \n$12 = 2^2 * 3$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24} * 3^{12}$\n\nNow, we need to figure out what other prime factors $k$ could have to make $12^{12}$. \n$12^{12} = 2^{24} * 3^{12} * k^0$\n\nSo, $k$ can't have any prime factors besides $2$ and $3$ (because those are already accounted for in $12^{12}$), so $k$ has to be $1$. That means there is only one value of $k$ that will make $12^{12}$ the least common multiple of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$. \n\nYay, we did it! Just one value of $k$!",
