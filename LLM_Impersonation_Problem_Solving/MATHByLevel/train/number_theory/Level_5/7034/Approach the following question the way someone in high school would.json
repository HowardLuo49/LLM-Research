    "solution": "It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.\n$6^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12}$\nThe LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\\max(24,a)}3^{\\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \\le a \\le 24$, there are $\\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of three numbers, we need to find the prime factorization of each number and then take the highest power of each prime factor present in any of the numbers.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of $6^6$ and $8^8$:\n\n$6^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n\nNow, we know that the LCM of $6^6$ and $8^8$ must have a power of 2 that is at least 24, and a power of 3 that is at least 6.\n\nSince $12^{12} = 2^{24} \\cdot 3^{12}$, we can see that $12^{12}$ is the LCM of $6^6$ and $8^8$. This means that $k$ must not contain any extra factors of 2 or 3 to become the LCM.\n\nSo, $k$ should contain a 5 factor in order to contribute to the LCM. Therefore, $k$ can be written as $2^0 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^1$.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 value of $k$ that makes $12^{12}$ the LCM of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$.",
