    "solution": "It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.\n$6^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12}$\nThe LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\\max(24,a)}3^{\\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \\le a \\le 24$, there are $\\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find the prime factorization of each number. \nFor $6^6$, we have $2^6$ and $3^6$.\nFor $8^8$, we have $2^{24}$.\nAnd for $k$, we don't know so we'll just write it as $k$.\n\nNow we need to see what's missing from $12^{12}$ in the prime factorization. $12^{12}$ is $2^{24}$ and $3^{12}$.\nFrom $6^6$, we have $3^6$ missing in $12^{12}.\nFrom $8^8$, we have $2^{24}$ missing in $12^{12}$.\nAnd from $k$, we don't know what's missing.\n\nSince $12^{12}$ is the least common multiple, we have to make sure all the missing factors are included. That means $k$ has to include both $2^{24}$ and $3^6$.\n\nSo $k = 2^{24} * 3^6$.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 value of $k$ that makes $12^{12}$ the least common multiple of the positive integers $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$.",
