    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Use each of the five digits $2, 4, 6, 7$ and $9$ only once to form a three-digit integer and a two-digit integer which will be multiplied together. What is the three-digit integer that results in the greatest product?",
    "solution": "Let $\\underline{a}\\,\\underline{b}\\,\\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{d}\\,\\underline{e}$ be the two numbers.  The product of the numbers is  \\[\n(100a+10b+c)(10d+e) = 1000ad + 100(ae+bd) + 10 (cd+be) + ce\n\\] Clearly $ad$ should be as large as possible, so $a$ and $d$ should be 9 and 7 or vice versa.  Also, $c$ should be the smallest digit, since it only appears in the terms $10cd$ and $ce$.  Trying $a=9$ and $d=7$, we have a product of  \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(9e+7b) + 10 (14+be) + 2e = 63,\\!140+902e + 700b + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $e$ term is larger than that of the $b$ term, $e=6$ and $b=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $942\\times 76=71,\\!592$.  If $a=7$ and $d=9$, then the sum is \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(7e+9b) + 10 (18+be) + 2e = 63,\\!180+900b + 702e + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $b$ term is larger than that of the $e$ term, $b=6$ and $e=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $762\\times 94=71,\\!628$.  Since $71,\\!628>71,\\!592$, the three-digit integer yielding the maximum product is $\\boxed{762}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the three-digit integer that results in the greatest product when multiplied with a two-digit integer, we need to consider different permutations of the digits $2, 4, 6, 7,$ and $9$.\n\nLet us first consider the three-digit integers that can be formed using the digits $2, 4, 6, 7,$ and $9$. Since we want the greatest product, we should place the largest digit in the hundreds place, the next largest digit in the tens place, and the smallest digit in the units place to maximize the value of the three-digit integer. Therefore, the greatest three-digit integer that can be formed using the given digits is $976$.\n\nNext, we need to find the two-digit integer. The remaining digits are $2, 4,$ and $6$. To maximize the product, we should place the largest digit in the tens place and the next largest digit in the units place. Therefore, the greatest two-digit integer that can be formed using the remaining digits is $64$.\n\nTo find the product of $976$ and $64$, we simply multiply them together:\n\n$$976 \\times 64 = 62464$$\n\nTherefore, the three-digit integer that results in the greatest product when multiplied with a two-digit integer is $976$.",
