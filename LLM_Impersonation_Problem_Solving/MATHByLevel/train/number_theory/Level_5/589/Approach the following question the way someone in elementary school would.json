    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Use each of the five digits $2, 4, 6, 7$ and $9$ only once to form a three-digit integer and a two-digit integer which will be multiplied together. What is the three-digit integer that results in the greatest product?",
    "solution": "Let $\\underline{a}\\,\\underline{b}\\,\\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{d}\\,\\underline{e}$ be the two numbers.  The product of the numbers is  \\[\n(100a+10b+c)(10d+e) = 1000ad + 100(ae+bd) + 10 (cd+be) + ce\n\\] Clearly $ad$ should be as large as possible, so $a$ and $d$ should be 9 and 7 or vice versa.  Also, $c$ should be the smallest digit, since it only appears in the terms $10cd$ and $ce$.  Trying $a=9$ and $d=7$, we have a product of  \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(9e+7b) + 10 (14+be) + 2e = 63,\\!140+902e + 700b + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $e$ term is larger than that of the $b$ term, $e=6$ and $b=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $942\\times 76=71,\\!592$.  If $a=7$ and $d=9$, then the sum is \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(7e+9b) + 10 (18+be) + 2e = 63,\\!180+900b + 702e + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $b$ term is larger than that of the $e$ term, $b=6$ and $e=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $762\\times 94=71,\\!628$.  Since $71,\\!628>71,\\!592$, the three-digit integer yielding the maximum product is $\\boxed{762}$.",
