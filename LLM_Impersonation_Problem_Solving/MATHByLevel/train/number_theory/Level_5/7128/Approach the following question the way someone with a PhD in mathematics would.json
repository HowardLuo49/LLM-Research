    "solution": "Let $\\omega$ and $\\zeta$ be the two complex third-roots of 1. Then let\n$S = (1 + \\omega)^{2007} + (1 + \\zeta)^{2007} + (1 + 1)^{2007} = \\sum_{i = 0}^{2007} {2007 \\choose i}(\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1)$.\nNow, if $i$ is a multiple of 3, $\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$. If $i$ is one more than a multiple of 3, $\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1 = \\omega + \\zeta + 1 = 0$. If $i$ is two more than a multiple of 3, $\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1 = \\omega^2 + \\zeta^2 + 1= \\zeta + \\omega + 1 = 0$. Thus\n$S = \\sum_{i = 0}^{669} 3 {2007 \\choose 3i}$, which is exactly three times our desired expression.\nWe also have an alternative method for calculating $S$: we know that $\\{\\omega, \\zeta\\} = \\{-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i, -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i\\}$, so $\\{1 + \\omega, 1 + \\zeta\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i, \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i\\}$. Note that these two numbers are both cube roots of -1, so $S = (1 + \\omega)^{2007} + (1 + \\zeta)^{2007} + (1 + 1)^{2007} = (-1)^{669} + (-1)^{669} + 2^{2007} = 2^{2007} - 2$.\nThus, the problem is reduced to calculating $2^{2007} - 2 \\pmod{1000}$. $2^{2007} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, so we need to find $2^{2007} \\pmod{125}$ and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since $\\phi (125) = 100$, by Euler's Totient Theorem $2^{20 \\cdot 100 + 7} \\equiv 2^7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{125}$. Combining, we have $2^{2007} \\equiv 128 \\pmod{1000}$, and so $3S \\equiv 128-2 \\pmod{1000} \\Rightarrow S\\equiv \\boxed{42}\\pmod{1000}$.",
