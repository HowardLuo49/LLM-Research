    "solution": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! First, let's think about what perfect squares are. They are numbers that can be made by multiplying a number by itself, like 1x1=1, 2x2=4, and so on. \n\nNext, we need to figure out which perfect squares are multiples of 24. To do that, we can think about the prime factorization of 24, which is 2x2x2x3. This means that any perfect square that is a multiple of 24 must have at least two factors of 2 and one factor of 3 in its prime factorization.\n\nNow, let's look at the perfect squares less than $10^6$, which is 1000000. The largest perfect square less than $10^6$ is 31x31=961. To find all the perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24, we can start from 24x24=576 and keep going by adding the next perfect square that has the required factors of 2 and 3 until we reach 961. \n\nSo, the positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24 are 576, 576+48=624, and 624+48=672. That's 3 perfect squares in total! Yay, we did it!",
