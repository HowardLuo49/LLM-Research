    "solution": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the positive perfect squares less than $10^6$. The perfect squares less than $10^6$ are $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2, 10^2, 11^2, 12^2, 13^2, 14^2, 15^2, 16^2, 17^2, 18^2, 19^2, 20^2, ..., 31^2, 32^2, 33^2, 34^2, 35^2, 36^2, 37^2, 38^2, 39^2, 40^2, ..., 46^2, 47^2, 48^2, 49^2, 50^2, ..., 70^2, ..., 98^2, 99^2, 100^2.\n\nNext, we need to find which of these perfect squares are multiples of 24.
