    "solution": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the perfect squares that are multiples of 24.\n\nSince 24 can be factored as $2^3 \\times 3$, a perfect square that is a multiple of 24 must have at least two factors of 2 and one factor of 3 in its prime factorization.\n\nTherefore, the perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24 are those that can be represented as $2^a \\times 3^b$, where a is even and b is odd.\n\nTo find the number of such perfect squares, we can count the possible values of a and b within the given range.\n\n1. For a: The largest power of 2 less than $10^6$ is $2^{19}$, so the possible even values for a are 0, 2, 4, ..., 18. This gives us 10 possibilities.\n\n2. For b: The largest power of 3 less than $10^6$ is $3^{12}$, so the possible odd values for b are 1, 3, ..., 11. This gives us 6 possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24 is $10 \\times 6 = 60$.",
