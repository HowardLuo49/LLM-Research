    "solution": "The sum of the divisors of $2^i3^j$ is equal to $(1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i-1} + 2^i)(1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j-1} + 3^j) = 600,$ since each factor of $2^i3^j$ is represented exactly once in the sum that results when the product is expanded. Let $A = 1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i}$ and $B = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j}$, so that $A \\times B = 600$. The prime factorization of $600$ is $600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$.\n\nNotice that $A$ is the sum of $1$ and an even number and $B$ is the sum of $1$ and a number divisible by $3$. Thus, $A$ is odd and $B$ is not divisible by $3$. It follows that $A$ is divisible by $3$ and $B$ is divisible by $2^3$. We now have three separate cases: $(A,B) = (3 \\cdot 25,8), (3 \\cdot 5, 8 \\cdot 5), (3, 8 \\cdot 25)$.\n\nIn the first case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 8$; for $j = 1$, we have that $1 + 3 = 4 < 8$, and for $j = 2$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 = 13 > 8$. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\nFor the third case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 200$; for $j = 4$, then $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 < 200$, and for $j = 5$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364 > 200$. Thus, this case is also not possible.\n\nIt follows that $(A,B) = (15, 40)$, in which case we find that $i = j = 3$ works. Thus, the answer is $3 + 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find all the divisors of the number $2^i3^j$. \n\nThe divisors of $2^i3^j$ are numbers that can be divided evenly into $2^i3^j$ without leaving a remainder. These divisors will be numbers of the form $2^a3^b$, where $0\\leq a\\leq i$ and $0\\leq b\\leq j$.\n\nGiven that the sum of all the divisors is $600$, we know that the divisors must satisfy $2^{i+1}-1$ times $3^{j+1}-1=600$. \n\nFrom factoring $600$ as $2^3*3*5^2$, we can find that $(2^3-1)(3-1)(5^2-1)=600$. \n\nThus, we know that $i+1=3$, $j+1=1$. Therefore, $i=2$ and $j=0$. \n\nFinally, $i+j=2$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $2$.",
