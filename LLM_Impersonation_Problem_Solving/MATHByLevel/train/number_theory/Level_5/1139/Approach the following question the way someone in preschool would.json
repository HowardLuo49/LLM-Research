At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
    "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Tom's class has 288 students. We have to figure out how many students can sit in each row at graduation. But we know there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row. So let's think about what the possibilities could be.\n\nThe total number of students, 288, can be divided into different numbers of rows and students in each row. Let's start by breaking down 288 into its factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 288.\n\nBut remember, there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row. So we need to find the factors that are greater than or equal to 10 and 15.\n\nThe possible values that meet these requirements are 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 288. \n\nNow, let's add up all these values to find the sum of all possible values of x: \n$16 + 18 + 24 + 36 + 48 + 72 + 96 + 144 + 288 = 652$ \n\nSo, the sum of all possible values of x is 652.
