    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Tom's graduating class has 288 students. At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
    "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we note that the total number of students in Tom's graduating class, 288, must be divisible by $x$ as each row contains $x$ students. Therefore, we have that $288 = nx$, where $n$ is the number of rows.\n\nNext, we manipulate this equation by factoring 288 as $2^5 \\times 3^2$. We know that the number of rows, $n$, must be at least 10. Therefore, we can write $n = 2^a \\times 3^b$ where $a \\geq 4$ and $b \\geq 1$.\n\nSubstitute $n = 2^a \\times 3^b$ into the equation $288 = nx$ to obtain $288 = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times x$. Therefore, $x = 2^{5-a} \\times 3^{2-b}$. Since $x$ must be at least 15, we have $5 - a \\leq 1$ and $2 - b \\leq 1$.\n\nSolving these inequalities gives us $3 \\leq a \\leq 5$ and $1 \\leq b \\leq 2$. Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 18, 24, and 36, resulting in a sum of $18 + 24 + 36 = \\boxed{78}$.",
