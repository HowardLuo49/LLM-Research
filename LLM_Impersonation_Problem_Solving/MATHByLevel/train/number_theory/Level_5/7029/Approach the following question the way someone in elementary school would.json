A $150\\times 324\\times 375$ rectangular solid is made by gluing together $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes. An internal diagonal of this solid passes through the interiors of how many of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes?\n",
    "solution": "Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$. The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ respectively. We proceed by using PIE.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\\frac{d}{324}$. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324)$ times. Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\\gcd(375, 150)$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ are equal. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.\nThe total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\\gcd(150, 324)+\\gcd(324, 375)+\\gcd(375, 150))] + \\gcd(150, 324, 375) = \\boxed{768}$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break this down into smaller steps. First, let's find the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid. We can use the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular prism: $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the dimensions of the rectangular solid. \n\nSo, for this rectangular solid, the longest diagonal is $\\sqrt{150^2 + 324^2 + 375^2}$. To make things easier, let's simplify things by just finding the square root of the sum of the squares of the dimensions. \n\nNow, let's find out how many $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes the diagonal passes through. If the diagonal passes through the corners of the cubes, it will pass through 3 different faces of each cube. So, we need to figure out how many cubes the diagonal passes through.\n\nLet's try to break this down and think about how to figure this out. Remember when we were learning about counting things in groups? We can think about this problem by considering how many $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes the diagonal passes through on each face of the rectangular solid.\n\nAfter counting up the number of cubes the diagonal passes through on each face, we can add them all up to find the total number of cubes the diagonal passes through.\n\nSo in conclusion, we will need to use our math skills to figure out how many cubes the diagonal of the rectangular solid passes through! It may take some thinking and counting, but we can do it!",
