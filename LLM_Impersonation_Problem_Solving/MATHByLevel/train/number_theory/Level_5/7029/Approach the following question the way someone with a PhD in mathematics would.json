    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A $150\\times 324\\times 375$ rectangular solid is made by gluing together $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes. An internal diagonal of this solid passes through the interiors of how many of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes?\n",
    "solution": "Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$. The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ respectively. We proceed by using PIE.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\\frac{d}{324}$. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324)$ times. Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\\gcd(375, 150)$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ are equal. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.\nThe total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\\gcd(150, 324)+\\gcd(324, 375)+\\gcd(375, 150))] + \\gcd(150, 324, 375) = \\boxed{768}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes that are intersected by the internal diagonal of the rectangular solid, we need to find the number of lattice points that the diagonal passes through.\n\nThe length of the diagonal can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in 3 dimensions:\n$$\\sqrt{(150)^2 + (324)^2 + (375)^2} = \\sqrt{22500 + 104976 + 140625} = \\sqrt{267101}.$$\n\nSince $\\sqrt{267101} \\approx 517.1257$, we know that the diagonal passes through $\\lceil 517.1257 \\rceil = 518$ lattice points. \n\nThus, the internal diagonal of the rectangular solid passes through the interiors of 518 of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes.",
