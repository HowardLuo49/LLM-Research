    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A $150\\times 324\\times 375$ rectangular solid is made by gluing together $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes. An internal diagonal of this solid passes through the interiors of how many of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes?\n",
    "solution": "Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$. The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ respectively. We proceed by using PIE.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\\frac{d}{324}$. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324)$ times. Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\\gcd(375, 150)$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ are equal. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.\nThe total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\\gcd(150, 324)+\\gcd(324, 375)+\\gcd(375, 150))] + \\gcd(150, 324, 375) = \\boxed{768}$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, well, let's see. If we have a giant rectangular solid made up of tiny little cubes, we want to know how many of those little cubes the diagonal goes through. \n\nSo, let's imagine we have a big pile of blocks and we want to stack them up and make a big tower. Then, we want to see how many blocks the line goes through as we move it through the tower. \n\nIf we think about it, the line will go through a bunch of blocks, right? Because it starts at one corner of the tower and ends at the opposite corner. So, that means it's going to go through a whole bunch of blocks, maybe even all of them! \n\nSo, I think the answer is that the line goes through all of the little one-by-one cubes in the big rectangular solid. Wow, that's a lot of blocks it goes through! Good job, line!",
