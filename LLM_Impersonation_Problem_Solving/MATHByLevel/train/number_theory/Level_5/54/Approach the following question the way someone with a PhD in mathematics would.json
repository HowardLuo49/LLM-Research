    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For how many positive integers $n$ does $\\frac{1}{n}$ yield a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit?",
    "solution": "Note that the numbers whose decimal representations begin $0.00\\ldots$ are the positive real numbers less than $1/100$. Therefore, the hundredths digit of $1/n$ is zero for all $n > 100$. Also, recall that $1/n$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $n$ is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The fifteen integers up to 100 whose prime factorizations contain only twos and fives are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, and 100. One way to generate this list systematically is to consider integers of the form $2^m5^n$, starting with $n=0$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$, then $n=1$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4$, etc. Not all of these 15 integers have nonzero hundredths digits, however. For $n\\leq 10$, it is possible that the tenths digit is nonzero while the hundredths digit is zero. Checking the values of $n$ up to 10, we find that the hundredths digits of 1, 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 are zero. Therefore, there are $15 - 4 = \\boxed{11}$ fractions that yield terminating decimals with a nonzero digit two places to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integers $n$ for which $\\frac{1}{n}$ yields a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit, we first note that a decimal representation terminates if and only if the denominator only has prime factors of 2 or 5.\n\nWe seek $n$ such that $n = 2^a \\cdot 5^b$ for non-negative integers $a$ and $b$.
