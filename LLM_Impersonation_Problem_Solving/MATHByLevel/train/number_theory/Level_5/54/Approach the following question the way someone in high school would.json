    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For how many positive integers $n$ does $\\frac{1}{n}$ yield a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit?",
    "solution": "Note that the numbers whose decimal representations begin $0.00\\ldots$ are the positive real numbers less than $1/100$. Therefore, the hundredths digit of $1/n$ is zero for all $n > 100$. Also, recall that $1/n$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $n$ is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The fifteen integers up to 100 whose prime factorizations contain only twos and fives are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, and 100. One way to generate this list systematically is to consider integers of the form $2^m5^n$, starting with $n=0$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$, then $n=1$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4$, etc. Not all of these 15 integers have nonzero hundredths digits, however. For $n\\leq 10$, it is possible that the tenths digit is nonzero while the hundredths digit is zero. Checking the values of $n$ up to 10, we find that the hundredths digits of 1, 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 are zero. Therefore, there are $15 - 4 = \\boxed{11}$ fractions that yield terminating decimals with a nonzero digit two places to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers $n$ that make $\\frac{1}{n}$ have a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit, we need to look at the prime factorization of $n$. \n\nThe decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n}$ terminates if and only if the prime factorization of $n$ includes only the prime factors 2 and 5. That's because 2 and 5 are the only prime factors of 10, which is the base of our decimal system.\n\nMoreover, for the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n}$ to have a non-zero hundredths digit, $n$ must be a multiple of 25 (since the hundredths digit comes from the product of 2 and 5). Therefore, every $n$ can be written in the form $n = 2^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers.\n\nTo make the hundredths digit non-zero, $b$ must be greater than 1. So, we have the options $b = 2, 3, 4, \\ldots$. Since $b$ cannot be more than 2, since we are in high school we can say there are two possibilities for $b$: $b=2$ and $b=3$.\n\nWhen $b=2$, we have $n = 2^a \\cdot 5^2$.
