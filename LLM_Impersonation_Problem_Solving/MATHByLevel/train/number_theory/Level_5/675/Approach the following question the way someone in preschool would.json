    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the biggest number that can divide both numbers, we have to look for common factors. Let's try to find the biggest number that can divide both $a$ and $b$. Let's start by finding two numbers that add up to 1001. Maybe we can try some numbers like 500 and 501. 501 can be divided by 3, 167, and 501 itself. 500 can be divided by 5, 100, and 500 itself. So, the biggest number that can divide both 500 and 501 is 1. So, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is 1.",
