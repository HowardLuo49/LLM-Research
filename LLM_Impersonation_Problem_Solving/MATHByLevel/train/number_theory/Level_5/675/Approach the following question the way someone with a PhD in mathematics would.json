    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor ($\\gcd$) of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ given that their sum is 1001, we can use properties of the $\\gcd$ function.\n\nLet $d = \\gcd(a,b)$. From the definition of $\\gcd$, $d$ must divide both $a$ and $b$. Furthermore, since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, $d$ must also be a positive integer.\n\nSince $d$ divides both $a$ and $b$, $d$ must also divide their sum $a + b = 1001$. This means that $d$ must be a divisor of 1001.\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $d$, we want to find the largest factor of 1001. The prime factorization of 1001 is $7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$. The largest possible value of $d$, and thus the answer to the question, is the greatest common divisor of 1001 and 1001 itself.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ when $a + b = 1001$ is 1001.",
