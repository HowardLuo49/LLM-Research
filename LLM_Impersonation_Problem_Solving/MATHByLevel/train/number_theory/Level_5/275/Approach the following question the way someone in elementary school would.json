    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a$ does not have an inverse modulo 55 and 66. \n\nFirst, let's look at the modulo 55. For $a^{-1}$ to be undefined modulo 55, $a$ must have a common factor with 55 other than 1. The factors of 55 are 1, 5, 11, and 55. The smallest positive integer $a$ that has a common factor with 55 other than 1 is 5.\n\nNext, let's look at the modulo 66. For $a^{-1}$ to be undefined modulo 66, $a$ must have a common factor with 66 other than 1. The factors of 66 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, and 66. The smallest positive integer $a$ that has a common factor with 66 other than 1 is 2.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined modulo 55 and 66 is 5.",
