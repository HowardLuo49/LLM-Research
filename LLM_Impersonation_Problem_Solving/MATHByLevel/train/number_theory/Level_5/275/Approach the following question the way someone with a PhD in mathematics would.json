    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined modulo $55$ and modulo $66$, we can first consider the factorization of $55$ and $66$ to find their common divisors.\n\nWe have $55 = 5 \\cdot 11$ and $66 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$. The only common divisor of $55$ and $66$ is $11$.\n\nFor $a^{-1}$ to be undefined modulo $55$, $a$ must share a common factor with $55$, other than $1$. Similarly, for $a^{-1}$ to be undefined modulo $66$, $a$ must share a common factor with $66$, other than $1$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $a$ that satisfies these conditions is the smallest positive integer $a$ that has $11$ as a factor. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined modulo $55$ and modulo $66$ is $11$.",
