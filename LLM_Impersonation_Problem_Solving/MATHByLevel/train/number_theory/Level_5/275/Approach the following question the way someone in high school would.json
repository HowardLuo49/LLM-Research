    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by figuring out when $a^{-1}$ is undefined modulo 55. Remember, $a^{-1}$ is undefined when $a$ and 55 are not relatively prime. In other words, when they have a common factor greater than 1.\n\nNow, let's do the same thing for $a^{-1}$ being undefined modulo 66. We need to find when $a$ and 66 are not relatively prime.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $a$ that satisfies both conditions will be the smallest integer that has a common factor with both 55 and 66 greater than 1. So, we need to find the smallest common factor of 55 and 66.\n\nStart by finding the prime factorization of 55 and 66:\n$55 = 5 \\cdot 11$\n$66 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$\n\nThe smallest common factor of 55 and 66 is 11. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined modulo 55 and 66 is $\\boxed{11}$.",
