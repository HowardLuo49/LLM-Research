    "solution": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of digits when an integer is written in base $2$, we need to find the highest power of $2$ that is less than or equal to the integer. Since the integer has $4$ digits when written in base $8$, we can write it as $abcd_8$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are digits in base $8$.\n\nConverting this number to base $10$, we get $8^3a + 8^2b + 8c + d$. This number will be equal to $2^n$ for some positive integer $n$.\n\nTherefore, we have $8^3a + 8^2b + 8c + d = 2^n$. \n\nThe highest power of $2$ less than $8^3$ is $2^9$, so $8^3a = 2^9 = 512$ and $a = 1$.\n\nSimilarly, $8^2b = 2^8 = 256$ so $b = 2$.\n\nAnd $8c = 2^7 = 128$ so $c = 1$.\n\nFinally, $d = 2^1 = 2$.\n\nPutting this all together, the number in base $2$ is $11010_2$.\n\nTherefore, $d = 5$.\n\nTo find all possible values of $d$, we need to consider all the possible values of $n$ that result in $2^n$ being equal to the base $8$ number. The only possible value of $n$ that satisfies this condition is $n = 10$.\n\nSo, the sum of all possible values of $d$ would be $5+10 = 15$.",
