    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",
    "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first think about what it means to have a certain number of positive divisors. For example, 6 has 4 positive divisors: 1, 2, 3, and 6. So we can say 6 is 4-nice.\n\nTo find out if a number is $k$-nice, we need to look at how many positive divisors $a^k$ has. For example, if $a=2$ and $k=2$, then $a^k=2^2=4$. The positive divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4, so 4 is 3-nice.\n\nNow, we want to find numbers less than 1000 that are not 7-nice or 8-nice. Let's start by listing the numbers that are 7-nice and 8-nice:\n\nFor 7-nice:\n$7^1, 7^2, 7^3, 7^4, 7^5, ...$\n\nFor 8-nice:\n$2^3, 2^6, 2^9, 2^{12}, ...$\n\nWe can see that 1 is neither 7-nice nor 8-nice. Now we just need to find all the numbers less than 1000 that are not in the sequences above. This might take some time, but we can do it by trying different numbers and checking if they are in those sequences.\n\nSo, after checking all the numbers less than 1000, we find that there are $\\boxed{993}$ positive integers that are neither 7-nice nor 8-nice.",
