    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",
    "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we want to find the number of positive integers less than 1000 that are neither 7-nice nor 8-nice. To do this, we can first count the total number of positive integers less than 1000 and then subtract the number that are 7-nice or 8-nice.\n\nTo count the total number of positive integers less than 1000, we simply subtract 1 from 1000 to get 999.\n\nNow we need to find the number of positive integers less than 1000 that are either 7-nice or 8-nice. To do this, we can find the number of positive integers less than 1000 that are 7-nice and 8-nice, and then subtract this from our total.\n\nLet's start by finding the number that are 7-nice. To be 7-nice, we need to find positive integers $a$ such that $a^7$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. The number of positive divisors of a number $x$ can be found by prime factorizing $x$ and then adding $1$ to each of the exponents of the prime factors and multiplying them together. For $a^7$, this means we need to find positive integers $a$ such that $7$ is a product of two distinct primes.\n\nSince $7$ is a prime number, the only way we can have $7$ as a product of two distinct primes is if $7 \\cdot 1 = 7$. Therefore, there is only $1$ possible value for $a$ that makes $a^7$ have $N$ positive divisors, which is $1$. So, there is $1$ positive integer less than 1000 that is 7-nice.\n\nNext, let's find the number that are 8-nice. To be 8-nice, we need to find positive integers $a$ such that $a^8$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. We can use the same method as before to find this, which means we need to find positive integers $a$ such that $8$ is a product of two distinct primes.\n\nSince $8 = 2^3$, the only way we can have $8$ as a product of two distinct primes is if $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$. Therefore, the only possible values for $a$ that make $a^8$ have $N$ positive divisors are $2^1 = 2$ and $2^2 = 4$. So, there are $2$ positive integers less than 1000 that are 8-nice.\n\nAdding up the positive integers that are either 7-nice or 8-nice gives us $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFinally, we can subtract this from our total to get our final answer. $999 - 3 = 996$.\n\nTherefore, there are $996$ positive integers less than 1000 that are neither 7-nice nor 8-nice.",
