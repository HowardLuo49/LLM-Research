    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(2a^2+29a+65,a+13)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(2a^2+29a+65-(a+13)(2a+3),a+13)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(2a^2+29a+65-(2a^2+29a+39),a+13)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(26,a+13).\n\\end{align*}Since $a$ is an odd multiple of $1183$, which is an odd multiple of $13$, $a+13$ must be an even multiple of $13$. This means that $26$ is a divisor  of $a+13$, so the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So, first we need to figure out what an odd multiple of 1183 is. Let's count by 1183: 1183, 2366, 3549, 4732... oh! 4732 is an odd multiple of 1183. So, $a$ is 4732.\n\nNext, we need to find the greatest common divisor of $2a^2+29a+65$ and $a+13$. Let's substitute 4732 for $a$ in the first expression: \n$2(4732)^2 + 29(4732) + 65$. We can use a calculator to find that this equals 106896821. Now, let's substitute 4732 for $a$ in the second expression: $4732+13 = 4745$.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 106896821 and 4745. This is where things get tricky for me in preschool. Let's ask a grown-up to help us find the greatest common divisor of these two numbers!",
