    "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square, we need to look at the exponents of the prime factors in $x$. \n\n$x = 2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$\n\nTo make $x$ a perfect square, we need to make sure all the exponents are even. \n\nSo, for $2$ we need an even exponent, for $3$ we already have an even exponent, for $4$ we need an even exponent since $4 = 2^2$, for $5$ we already have an even exponent, for $6$ we need an even exponent since $6 = 2*3$, for $7$ we already have an even exponent, for $8$ we need an even exponent since $8 = 2^3$, for $9$ we already have an even exponent since $9 = 3^2$.\n\nThis means that the smallest positive integer to multiply $x$ by to make it a perfect square is $2^2 * 6 = 24$. \n\nSo, when $x$ is multiplied by $24$, the product will be a perfect square.",
