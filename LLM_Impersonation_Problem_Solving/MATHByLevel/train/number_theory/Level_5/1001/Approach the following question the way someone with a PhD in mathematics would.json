    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square, we need to consider the powers of the prime factors in $x$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $x$ is $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. To make the product a perfect square, we need to pair up the prime factors so that each factor appears an even number of times.\n\nFor $2$ to be a perfect square, it needs to appear with an odd power. Similarly, for $3, 5, 7, 9$ to be a perfect square, they need to appear with an even power. \n\nTherefore, we can pair up the $2$ and $9$ from $x$ to make them perfect squares. This gives us $2^29^9 = 6^{18}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square is $6^{18}$.",
