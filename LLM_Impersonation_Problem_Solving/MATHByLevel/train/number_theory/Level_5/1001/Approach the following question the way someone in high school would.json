    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, will make the product a perfect square. \n\nFirst, let's break down $x$ into its prime factors: \n\n$x = 2^{23}3^{3}4^{4}5^{5}6^{6}7^{7}8^{8}9^{9}$\n\nSince $4 = 2^{2}$ and $4^{4} = (2^{2})^{4} = 2^{8}$, we can simplify $x$: \n\n$x = 2^{23}3^{3}4^{4}5^{5}6^{6}7^{7}8^{8}9^{9}$\n$x = 2^{23}3^{3}2^{8}5^{5}6^{6}7^{7}2^{9}9^{9}$\n$x = 2^{40}3^{3}5^{5}6^{6}7^{7}9^{9}$\n\nTo make the product a perfect square, each exponent of the prime factors must be even. However, we see that the exponent of $3$ is odd. \n\nTo make it even, we need to multiply a $3$ to $x$ so that the exponent becomes $3^{4} = 3^{2\\cdot 2} = (3^{2})^{2} = 9^{2}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square is $3$.",
