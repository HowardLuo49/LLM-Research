    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many distinct prime factors does the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ have?",
    "solution": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find all the factors of 400 first. The factors of $400$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 200,$ and $400$. \n\nLet's add them all up: \n$1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10 + 16 + 20 + 25 + 40 + 50 + 80 + 100 + 200 + 400 = 951$ \n\nNow let's find the prime factors of $951$. The prime factors of $951$ are $3$ and $317$. So, the sum of the factors of $400$ has $2$ distinct prime factors: $3$ and $317$.",
