    "solution": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct prime factors of the sum of the positive divisors of 400, first we need to find the prime factorization of 400. \n\nThe prime factorization of 400 is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. \n\nNext, we find the sum of the divisors of 400. The divisors of 400 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 200, and 400. \n\nThe sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10 + 16 + 20 + 25 + 40 + 50 + 80 + 100 + 200 + 400 = 1064. \n\nNow, we need to find the prime factorization of 1064. The prime factorization of 1064 is $2^3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 19$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the positive divisors of 400 has 3 distinct prime factors: 2, 7, and 19. \n\nSo, the answer is 3.",
