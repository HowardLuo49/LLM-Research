    "solution": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the given product, we need to consider the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 in the prime factorization of the product.\n\nGiven that the product is $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$, we can rewrite it as $2^{10} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{15}$.\n\nA perfect square must have even exponents for all its prime factors.

The possible even exponents for 3 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. So, there are 7 options for the exponent of 3.\n\nFor 5, we have 15 as the exponent. The possible even exponents for 5 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.
