    "solution": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$, we need to consider the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 in the prime factorization.\n\nIn the product $2^{10}\\cdot 3^{12}\\cdot 5^{15}$, we can only form a perfect square by pairing up the exponents of each prime factor.\n\nFor 2: since the exponent is 10, we can pair up 2 with powers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. This gives us a total of 6 perfect square integers formed by the factor of 2.\n\nFor 3: similarly, we can pair up 3 with powers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. This gives us a total of 7 perfect square integers formed by the factor of 3.\n\nFor 5: we can pair up 5 with powers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. This gives us a total of 8 perfect square integers formed by the factor of 5.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the given product is $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$.",
