    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $N$ be the number of ways to write $2010$ in the form $2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$, where the $a_i$'s are integers, and $0 \\le a_i \\le 99$. An example of such a representation is $1\\cdot 10^3 + 3\\cdot 10^2 + 67\\cdot 10^1 + 40\\cdot 10^0$. Find $N$.\n",
    "solution": "If we choose $a_3$ and $a_1$ such that $(10^3)(a_3) + (10)(a_1) \\leq 2010$ there is a unique choice of $a_2$ and $a_0$ that makes the equality hold. So $N$ is just the number of combinations of $a_3$ and $a_1$ we can pick. If $a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 1$ we can let $a_1$ be anything from $0$ to $99$. If $a_3 = 2$ then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = 1$. Thus $N = 100 + 100 + 2 = \\boxed{202}$.",

We know that we can have any number between 0 and 99 for each digit, so let's start by figuring out how many options we have for each digit.\n\nIn the thousands place, we can have any number between 0 and 99. That's 100 options!\nIn the hundreds place, again we can have any number between 0 and 99. So that's another 100 options!\nSame goes for the tens place and ones place - 100 options each!\n\nSo overall, we have 100 options for the thousands place, 100 options for the hundreds place, 100 options for the tens place, and 100 options for the ones place. That's a total of $100 \\times 100 \\times 100 \\times 100 = 100^4 = 10000$ options!\n\nSo, there are 10,000 ways to write 2010 in the form $2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$.
