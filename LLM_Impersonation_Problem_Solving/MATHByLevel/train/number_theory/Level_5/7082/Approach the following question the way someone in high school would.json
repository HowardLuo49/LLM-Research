Let $N$ be the number of ways to write $2010$ in the form $2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$, where the $a_i$'s are integers, and $0 \\le a_i \\le 99$. An example of such a representation is $1\\cdot 10^3 + 3\\cdot 10^2 + 67\\cdot 10^1 + 40\\cdot 10^0$. Find $N$.\n",
    "solution": "If we choose $a_3$ and $a_1$ such that $(10^3)(a_3) + (10)(a_1) \\leq 2010$ there is a unique choice of $a_2$ and $a_0$ that makes the equality hold. So $N$ is just the number of combinations of $a_3$ and $a_1$ we can pick. If $a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 1$ we can let $a_1$ be anything from $0$ to $99$. If $a_3 = 2$ then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = 1$. Thus $N = 100 + 100 + 2 = \\boxed{202}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we want to find the number of ways we can write 2010 in the form they gave us. So let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, we know that $a_3$ has to be between 0 and 99. Since it's multiplying $10^3$, we can only choose a value for $a_3$ between 0 and 20 (since $20 \\cdot 10^3 = 20000$) for the sum to be less than 2010. \n\nNext, for $a_2$, since it's multiplying $10^2$, we can choose a value for $a_2$ between 0 and 9 to stay under 2010. \n\nFor $a_1$, since it's multiplying $10$, we can choose a value for $a_1$ between 0 and 9.\n\nLastly, for $a_0$, since it is just a constant term, we can choose a value for $a_0$ between 0 and 9.\n\nSo, the number of choices we have for each $a_i$ are:\n$a_3$: 21 choices\n$a_2$: 10 choices\n$a_1$: 10 choices\n$a_0$: 10 choices\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to write 2010 in the given form is $21 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = \\boxed{21000}$.",
