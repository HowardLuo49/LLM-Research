    "solution": "It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\\boxed{757}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first look at $a^5 = b^4$ and $c^3 = d^2$. This means that $a$ raised to the 5th power is equal to $b$ raised to the 4th power, and $c$ raised to the 3rd power is equal to $d$ raised to the 2nd power.\n\nNow, let's think about $c-a=19$. This means that the difference between $c$ and $a$ is 19.\n\nTo find $d-b$, we need to look at the relationship between $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Since $a^5 = b^4$ and $c^3 = d^2$, we can rewrite $b$ in terms of $a$ and $d$ in terms of $c$ to find the relationship between $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d.\n\nTo simplify, let's express $b$ in terms of $a$ for the first equation. Since $a^5 = b^4$, we can rewrite this as $b = a^{5/4}$. \n\nSimilarly, let's express $d$ in terms of $c$ for the second equation. Since $c^3 = d^2$, we can rewrite this as $d = c^{3/2}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $b = a^{5/4}$ and $d = c^{3/2}$ into the equation $c-a=19$ to find $d-b$. \n\nSo, we have $c-a = c^{3/2} - a^{5/4}$, which equals 19. \n\nSince $c-a = 19$, we can set the equation $c^{3/2} - a^{5/4} = 19$ and solve for $d-b$. \n\nI hope this helps!
