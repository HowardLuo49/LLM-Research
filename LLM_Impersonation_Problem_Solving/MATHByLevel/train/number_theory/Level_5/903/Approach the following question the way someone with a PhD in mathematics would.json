    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest number that is certain to divide the product $P$, we need to analyze the possible outcomes when rolling a standard six-sided die.\n\nWhen a six-sided die is rolled, the possible outcomes are numbers from 1 to 6. The product of these numbers can be calculated by considering the factors that contribute to each number.\n\nThe factors of each number rolled on the die are as follows:\n\n1: 1\n2: 2\n3: 3\n4: 2 x 2\n5: 5\n6: 2 x 3\n\nWhen considering the product $P$ of the five numbers visible after rolling the die, we see that the number 6 is certain to divide $P$ because it contains both the factors 2 and 3, which are present in the product of any five numbers rolled on a standard six-sided die.\n\nTherefore, the largest number that is certain to divide $P$ is 6.",
