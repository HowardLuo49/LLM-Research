    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number that is certain to divide the product $P$ of the five numbers that are visible when a standard six-sided die is rolled, we need to look at the numbers on the opposite sides of the die.\n\nWhen you add up all the numbers on a standard six-sided die, you get 1+2+3+4+5+6=21. Since each pair of opposite sides always adds up to 7 (1+6, 2+5, 3+4), the product of the opposite sides will always be a multiple of 7.\n\nSo, the largest number that is certain to divide $P$ is 7.",
