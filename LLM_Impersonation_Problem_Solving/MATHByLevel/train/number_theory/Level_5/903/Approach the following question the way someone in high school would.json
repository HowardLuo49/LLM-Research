    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number that is certain to divide the product $P$, we need to think about the factors of the numbers on a standard six-sided die. \n\nThe factors of the numbers on a standard six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\nTo make sure that the product $P$ is divisible by the largest number possible, we need to pick the number that has the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the numbers on the die. \n\nThe prime factors of the numbers on the die are 2, 3, and 5. \n\nThe number with the highest power of 2 is 4 (2^2). \n\nThe number with the highest power of 3 is 3. \n\nThe number with the highest power of 5 is 5. \n\nTherefore, the largest number that is certain to divide the product $P$ is $4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60$.",
