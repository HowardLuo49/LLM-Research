The modular inverse of $a$ modulo $m$ is an integer $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. In this case, we need to find $b$ such that $34b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{20}$.\n\nTo find the modular inverse of $34$ modulo $20$, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm. Starting with $20 = 0 \\times 34 + 20$ and $34 = 1 \\times 20 + 14$, we continue to divide until we reach $1$:\n\n$34 = 1 \\times 20 + 14$\n$20 = 1 \\times 14 + 6$\n$14 = 2 \\times 6 + 2$\n$6 = 3 \\times 2 + 0$\n\nNow, we can back-substitute to express $1$ as a linear combination of $20$ and $34$:\n\n$2 = 14 - 2 \\times 6$\n$= 14 - 2 \\times (20 - 1 \\times 14)$\n$= -2 \\times 20 + 3 \\times 14$\n$= -2 \\times 20 + 3 \\times (34 - 1 \\times 20)$\n$= 3 \\times 34 - 5 \\times 20$\n\nTherefore, $3$ is the modular inverse of $34$ modulo $20$.
