    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the congruence $34x+6\\equiv 2\\pmod {20}$. \n\nThis means that $34x +6$ is congruent to $2$ when divided by $20$. In other words, there exists an integer $k$ such that $34x + 6 = 20k + 2$. \n\nNow, let's solve for $x$.\n\nFirst, subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to get $34x = 20k - 4$.\n\nNext, divide by 34 to isolate $x$: $x = \\frac{20k - 4}{34}$.\n\nTo find the largest negative integer for $x$, we need to find the largest possible $k$ that gives us a non-positive $x$. \n\nSince $x$ must be an integer, we need $20k - 4$ to be divisible by 34. \n\nThe largest negative integer we can get for $x$ is when $k = -2$, which gives $x = -2$.\n\nTherefore, the largest negative integer $x$ which satisfies the congruence is $\\boxed{-2}$.",
