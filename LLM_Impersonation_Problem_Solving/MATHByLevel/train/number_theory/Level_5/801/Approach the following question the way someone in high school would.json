    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. An eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So, we need to find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers that are formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. \n\nLet's take a look at some examples:\n- If we repeat the four-digit integer 1234, we get 12341234.\n- If we repeat the four-digit integer 5678, we get 56785678.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that when we repeat a four-digit integer, the resulting eight-digit integer will always be divisible by the four-digit original integer. \n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer is the smallest four-digit integer, which is 1. \n\nSo, the answer is 1.",
