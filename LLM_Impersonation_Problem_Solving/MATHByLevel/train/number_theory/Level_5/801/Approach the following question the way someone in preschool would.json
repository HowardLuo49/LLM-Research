For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer, we can start by looking at some examples.\n\nLet's take the number 12 repeated: 1212,1212.\n\nIf we look closely, we can see that the greatest common divisor of these numbers is actually the original four-digit number, in this case, 12.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is that the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer is the original four-digit number itself.",
