    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer, we can consider the structure of such integers.\n\nLet our positive four-digit integer be denoted by \\(abcd\\). Then the eight-digit integer formed by repeating this four-digit integer will be \\(abcdabcd\\).\n\nWe can express \\(abcdabcd\\) as \\(10000 \\cdot abcd + abcd\\).\n\nThis can be simplified as \\(abcd(10000 + 1)\\), which is equivalent to \\(abcd \\cdot 10001\\).\n\nTherefore, all eight-digit integers formed in this manner are divisible by \\(abcd\\) and 10001. \n\nThus, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form is the greatest common divisor of all possible \\(abcd\\) and 10001.\n\nSince 10001 is a prime number, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer will be 10001.",
