    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many distinct four-digit numbers are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits?",
    "solution": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer we need to think about what numbers can go in the first two digits to make the whole number divisible by 3. In this case, we know that the sum of the digits of a number must be divisible by 3 in order for the whole number to be divisible by 3.\n\nSince the last two digits are 23, we need to think about which two-digit numbers fit that criteria. The only numbers that can work are 23 and 53, because they are the only two-digit numbers that have a sum of 5 which is divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, there are only two distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits: 523 and 823.",
