    "solution": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We need to find four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits. \n\nFirst, let's think about the numbers that end in 23 and are divisible by 3. We know that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3. So, if the last two digits are 23, the first two digits must add up to a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's list down all the possible combinations of the first two digits that add up to a multiple of 3:\n1. 10 + 13 = 23\n2. 11 + 12 = 23\n3. 12 + 11 = 23\n4. 13 + 10 = 23\n\nSo, there are four distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits. Yay, we did it!",
