    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Call a positive integer $n$ $k$-pretty if $n$ has exactly $k$ positive divisors and $n$ is divisible by $k$. For example, $18$ is $6$-pretty. Let $S$ be the sum of positive integers less than $2019$ that are $20$-pretty. Find $\\tfrac{S}{20}$.\n",
    "solution": "Every 20-pretty integer can be written in form $n = 2^a 5^b k$, where $a \\ge 2$, $b \\ge 1$, $\\gcd(k,10) = 1$, and $d(n) = 20$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Thus, we have $20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k)$, using the fact that the divisor function is multiplicative. As $(a+1)(b+1)$ must be a divisor of 20, there are not many cases to check.\nIf $a+1 = 4$, then $b+1 = 5$. But this leads to no solutions, as $(a,b) = (3,4)$ gives $2^3 5^4 > 2019$.\nIf $a+1 = 5$, then $b+1 = 2$ or $4$. The first case gives $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime other than 2 or 5. Thus we have $80p < 2019 \\implies p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$. The sum of all such $n$ is $80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) = 7440$. In the second case $b+1 = 4$ and $d(k) = 1$, and there is one solution $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3 = 2000$.\nIf $a+1 = 10$, then $b+1 = 2$, but this gives $2^9 \\cdot 5^1 > 2019$. No other values for $a+1$ work.\nThen we have $\\frac{S}{20} = \\frac{80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) + 2000}{20} = 372 + 100 = \\boxed{472}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find some numbers that are $20$-pretty. The number $20$ has $6$ positive divisors ($1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$), and it is divisible by $6$, so $20$ is $6$-pretty.\n\nNext, let's find other numbers that are $20$-pretty. One way to do this is to find $20$-pretty numbers that are multiples of $20$. Since $20$ has $6$ positive divisors, its multiples will also have $6$ positive divisors. Some multiples of $20$ less than $2019$ are $40, 60, 80, \\ldots , 2000$. \n\nSince the question asks for the sum of all positive integers less than $2019$ that are $20$-pretty, we need to find the sum of $20$-pretty numbers that are not multiples of $20$. These $20$-pretty numbers will have $20$ as a divisor. Examples include $40 \\cdot 20 = 800, 60 \\cdot 20 = 1200, 80 \\cdot 20 = 1600$.\n\nThe sum we are looking for is $20 + 40 + 60 + 80 + \\ldots + 2000 + 800 + 1200 + 1600$. This is an arithmetic series with first term $20$, last term $2000$, and common difference $20$. \n\nUsing the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, the sum is $\\frac{(20 + 2000)(994)}{2} + 20 + 800 + 1200 + 1600 = 10010$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{S}{20} = \\frac{10010}{20} = \\boxed{500}$.",
