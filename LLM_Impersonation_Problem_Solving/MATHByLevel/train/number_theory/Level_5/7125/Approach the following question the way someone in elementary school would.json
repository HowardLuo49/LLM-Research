    "solution": "Note that $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$. We focus on the large prime $167$ as the powers of $2$ and $3$ in the prime factorization of $2004!$ are going to be much higher. The largest power of $167$ that divides $2004!$ is $\\tfrac{2004}{167} = \\boxed{12}$, the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number $k$ that divides $2004!$, we need to see how many times $2004$ can divide into $2004!$. We start by dividing $2004$ by $2004$ to get $1$. Then we divide $2004$ by $2004$ again and get another $1$. We keep dividing by $2004$ until we can't anymore. \n\nFor example, after dividing by $2004$ three times, we get $2004/2004 = 1$, $1/2004 = 0$, so we stop here. This means $2004^3$ divides $2004!$. \n\nSo the largest integer $k$ such that $2004^k$ divides $2004!$ is $3$.",
