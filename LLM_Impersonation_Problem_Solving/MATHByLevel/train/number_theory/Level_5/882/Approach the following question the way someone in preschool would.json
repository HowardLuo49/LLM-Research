    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Cindy wishes to arrange her coins into $X$ piles, each consisting of the same number of coins, $Y$. Each pile will have more than one coin and no pile will have all the coins. If there are 13 possible values for $Y$ given all of the restrictions, what is the smallest number of coins she could have?",
    "solution": "If Cindy has $n$ coins, then the possible values for $Y$ are the proper factors of $n$ (recall that a proper factor of $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since there are 13 possible values of $Y$, there are $13+2=15$ factors of $n$.  Our goal is to find the least value of $n$ with exactly 15 factors.  Recall that we can determine the number of positive integer factors of $n$ by prime factorizing $n$, adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization, and multiplying the results.  The sets of exponents which would give rise to 15 factors are $\\{14\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has an exponent of 14 is $2^{14}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 2 and 4 is obtained by assigning these exponents in decreasing order to the smallest two primes, which yields $2^4\\cdot 3^2=144$.  The smaller of these two numbers is 144, so Cindy has $\\boxed{144}$ coins.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh boy, let's help Cindy with her coins! So Cindy wants to make a bunch of piles with the same number of coins in each pile, but not all the coins in one pile, and more than one coin in each pile. And there are 13 different numbers she can choose for how many coins go in each pile.\n\nTo figure out the smallest number of coins Cindy could have, we need to think about what number can be divided into the most different ways. Let's count and see which number fits all the rules and has the most different ways to make piles.\n\nHmm, let's start with 2 coins in each pile. That doesn't work because then she'd only have 2 piles. What about 3 coins in each pile? Nope, that only gives her 3 piles. Let's keep counting and trying until we find a number that works.\n\nOkay, let's try 4 coins in each pile. That gives us 4 piles, 3 piles, and 2 piles, so that's one, two, three different options. Maybe we can do better. Let's keep counting!\n\nAfter trying different numbers, we find that 12 coins is the smallest number Cindy could have. If she has 12 coins, she can make 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 piles with the same number of coins in each pile. And that's the smallest number of coins she could have to have 13 different ways to arrange them into piles. Yay, we did it! Good job, Cindy!",
