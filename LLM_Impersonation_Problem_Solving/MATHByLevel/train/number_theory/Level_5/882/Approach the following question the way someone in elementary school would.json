    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Cindy wishes to arrange her coins into $X$ piles, each consisting of the same number of coins, $Y$. Each pile will have more than one coin and no pile will have all the coins. If there are 13 possible values for $Y$ given all of the restrictions, what is the smallest number of coins she could have?",
    "solution": "If Cindy has $n$ coins, then the possible values for $Y$ are the proper factors of $n$ (recall that a proper factor of $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since there are 13 possible values of $Y$, there are $13+2=15$ factors of $n$.  Our goal is to find the least value of $n$ with exactly 15 factors.  Recall that we can determine the number of positive integer factors of $n$ by prime factorizing $n$, adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization, and multiplying the results.  The sets of exponents which would give rise to 15 factors are $\\{14\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has an exponent of 14 is $2^{14}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 2 and 4 is obtained by assigning these exponents in decreasing order to the smallest two primes, which yields $2^4\\cdot 3^2=144$.  The smaller of these two numbers is 144, so Cindy has $\\boxed{144}$ coins.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what the question is asking. Cindy wants to arrange her coins into piles where each pile has the same number of coins, but not all the coins can be in one pile. \n\nTo find the smallest number of coins she could have, we need to think about what numbers could possibly work for the number of coins in each pile, Y. \n\nSince there are 13 possible values for Y, we need to find the smallest number that can be divided into 13 different ways. This means we need to find the smallest number with at least 13 factors.\n\nThe smallest number that has 13 factors is 28. So, Cindy must have at least 28 coins in order to arrange them into piles according to the restrictions given.",
