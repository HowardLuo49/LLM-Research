    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Cindy wishes to arrange her coins into $X$ piles, each consisting of the same number of coins, $Y$. Each pile will have more than one coin and no pile will have all the coins. If there are 13 possible values for $Y$ given all of the restrictions, what is the smallest number of coins she could have?",
    "solution": "If Cindy has $n$ coins, then the possible values for $Y$ are the proper factors of $n$ (recall that a proper factor of $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since there are 13 possible values of $Y$, there are $13+2=15$ factors of $n$.  Our goal is to find the least value of $n$ with exactly 15 factors.  Recall that we can determine the number of positive integer factors of $n$ by prime factorizing $n$, adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization, and multiplying the results.  The sets of exponents which would give rise to 15 factors are $\\{14\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has an exponent of 14 is $2^{14}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 2 and 4 is obtained by assigning these exponents in decreasing order to the smallest two primes, which yields $2^4\\cdot 3^2=144$.  The smaller of these two numbers is 144, so Cindy has $\\boxed{144}$ coins.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. Cindy wants to arrange her coins into piles with the same number of coins in each pile. Each pile should have more than 1 coin and no pile should have all the coins. \n\nSo, we know that the number of coins Cindy has must be divisible by the number of piles she wants to make. That means the number of coins must be divisible by all possible values for $Y$. Since $Y$ must be more than 1, the possible values for $Y$ are all the factors of the number of coins greater than 1. \n\nIf there are 13 possible values for $Y$, that means the number of factors of the number of coins is 13. The smallest number with 13 factors is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 180$. So, the smallest number of coins Cindy could have is $\\boxed{180}$.",
