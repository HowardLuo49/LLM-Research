    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A particular fortune cookie lists four two-digit positive integers as your lucky numbers. The first three are 57, 13, and 72, but you got sauce on the last one and can't read it. If the sum of the digits of all four numbers equals $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, what is the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number?",
    "solution": "The sum of the first three numbers is $57+13+72=142$. If we let $10a+b$ represent the last number, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively, then the sum of the four numbers is $142+10a+b$. The sum of the digits of the first three numbers is $5+7+1+3+7+2=25$, so the total sum of the digits is $25+a+b$. If we multiply the sum of the digits by 5, we should get the sum of the four numbers. \\begin{align*}\n142+10a+b&=5(25+a+b)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=125+5a+5b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n17+5a&=4b\n\\end{align*} We notice that if we add a multiple of 5 to 17, the ones digit will either be 2 or 7. The next multiple of 4 that is greater than 17 and ends with a 2 or 7 is 32. That means $b=8$, while $17+5a=32$, so $5a=15$ and $a=3$. So the last number is $\\boxed{38}$.",
    "gpt_response": "OK, so let's find the sum of the three numbers we know: 57 + 13 + 72 = 142. \n\nNow we need to find the sum of the digits in these three numbers: 5 + 7 + 1 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 25. \n\nWe know that the sum of the digits of all four numbers is $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers. So, 25 is $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, which means the sum of all four numbers is 25 x 5 = 125.\n\nWe already know the sum of the three numbers we have, which is 142. So, the fourth number must be 125 - 142 = -17.\n\nSince the problem asked for the smallest two-digit positive integer, we have to keep adding multiples of 10 to -17 to get closer to a two-digit positive integer. \n\n-17 + 10 = -7\n\n-17 + 10 + 10 = 3\n\n-17 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 13 \n\nSo, the smallest possible fourth number could be 13.",
