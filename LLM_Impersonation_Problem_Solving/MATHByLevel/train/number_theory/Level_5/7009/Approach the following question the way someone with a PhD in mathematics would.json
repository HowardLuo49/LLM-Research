    "solution": "Let us write down one such sum, with $m$ terms and first term $n + 1$:\n$3^{11} = (n + 1) + (n + 2) + \\ldots + (n + m) = \\frac{1}{2} m(2n + m + 1)$.\nThus $m(2n + m + 1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{11}$ so $m$ is a divisor of $2\\cdot 3^{11}$. However, because $n \\geq 0$ we have $m^2 < m(m + 1) \\leq 2\\cdot 3^{11}$ so $m < \\sqrt{2\\cdot 3^{11}} < 3^6$. Thus, we are looking for large factors of $2\\cdot 3^{11}$ which are less than $3^6$. The largest such factor is clearly $2\\cdot 3^5 = 486$; for this value of $m$ we do indeed have the valid expression $3^{11} = 122 + 123 + \\ldots + 607$, for which $k=\\boxed{486}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of $k$ for which $3^{11}$ is expressible as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers, we can set up an equation using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nLet the first term of the series be $a$, and let $k$ be the number of terms in the series. The sum of the series can be expressed as $k(a + \\frac{k-1}{2})$, where $\\frac{k-1}{2}$ is the average of the terms.\n\nGiven that $3^{11}$ is equal to the sum of the series, we have the equation:\n$3^{11} = k(a + \\frac{k-1}{2})$\n\nSince we are looking for the largest possible value of $k$, we should start by considering the smallest possible value for $a$. The smallest possible value for $a$ is 1, which makes the series consecutive positive integers.\n\nSubstitute $a=1$ into the equation:\n$3^{11} = k(1 + \\frac{k-1}{2})$\n$3^{11} = k + \\frac{k^2 - k}{2}$\n$3^{11} = \\frac{k^2 + k}{2}$\n$2\\cdot3^{11} = k^2 + k$\n$2\\cdot3^{11} = k(k+1)$\n\nNow, we need to find the largest possible value of $k$ such that $2\\cdot3^{11}$ is expressible as the product of two consecutive integers.
