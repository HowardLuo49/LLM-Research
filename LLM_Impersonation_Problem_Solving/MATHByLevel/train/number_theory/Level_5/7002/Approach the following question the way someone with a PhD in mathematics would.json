    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The integer $n$ is the largest positive multiple of $15$ such that every digit of $n$ is either $8$ or $0$. Compute $\\frac{n}{15}$.\n",
    "solution": "Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.\nAny multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.\nThe sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3. If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive. Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.\nThe smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880. Thus the answer is $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",
    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this problem by first noting that in order for a number to be a multiple of $15$, it must be divisible by both $3$ and $5$. Since a number is divisible by $3$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, and a number is divisible by $5$ if its last digit is $0 or 5, we can deduce that the number $n$ we are looking for has the form $8880$.\n\nTo verify that $8880$ is the largest such number, we can consider higher multiples of $15$ that only consist of the digits $0$ and $8$. For example, $8880$ is greater than $888$, $8888$, $8800$, $8000$, and so on.\n\nNow, to find $\\frac{n}{15}$, we simply divide $8880$ by $15$ to get $\\frac{8880}{15} = 592$. Therefore, the answer is $592$.",
