    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two numbers $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors. What is the greatest of these three common divisors?",
    "solution": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, let us consider the structure of the divisors of a number. If we prime factorize a number $n$ as $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2} \\ldots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1,p_2, \\ldots ,p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1,a_2, \\ldots ,a_k$ are positive integers, then the number of positive divisors of $n$ is given by $(a_1+1)(a_2+1) \\ldots (a_k+1)$. \n\nSince $90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$ has $2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12$ positive divisors (including 1 and 90), we can see that there are only a few possibilities for the prime factorization of $m$. Since $m$ has only three positive divisors, its possible prime factorizations are either $m=p^2$ or $m=pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nIf $m=p^2$, then $m$ has $(2+1)=3$ positive divisors. This means that $m=9$, which does share three positive divisors with 90 (1, 3, 9).\n\nIf $m=pq$, then $m$ has $(1+1)(1+1)=4$ positive divisors. However, this would not meet the requirement of sharing exactly three positive divisors with 90.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor shared by 90 and $m$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",
