    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing out the problem.\n\nLet's say the two-digit number is AB and the three-digit number is CDE.\n\nSarah actually wanted to multiply AB by CDE. But instead of using the multiplication sign, she just wrote AB next to CDE, getting a five-digit number ABCDE.\n\nThis number ABCDE is nine times the product Sarah should have gotten. So, the product of AB and CDE should be ABCDE divided by 9.\n\nTo find the sum of AB and CDE, we need to solve the problem.\n\nLet's think about it in simpler terms.\n\nWhat two-digit number times what three-digit number will give us a five-digit number when written together?\n\nLet's try to figure out the number by looking at the units digits.\n\nThe units digit of a two-digit number times a three-digit number will be the units digit of the product. So, the units digit of AB must be the same as the units digit of CDE.\n\nAlso, since ABCDE is nine times the product Sarah should have gotten, CDE must be a one-digit number.\n\nA two-digit number's units digit can't be the same as a one-digit number. Therefore, the units digit must be 1. \n\nSo CDE must end in 1.\n\nNow, let's think about how to calculate the sum of AB and CDE, knowing that CDE ends in 1.\n\nBut since we're in elementary school, we might need a teacher's help to explain the full solution.",
