    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Woah, that sounds like a tricky problem for Sarah! Let's see if we can help her out. So first, we know that Sarah should have multiplied a two-digit number by a three-digit number. But instead, she put the two-digit number in front of the three-digit number and got a five-digit number that is 9 times the product she should have gotten.\n\nTo find the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number, we need to figure out what those numbers are. Let's call the two-digit number \"AB\" and the three-digit number \"CDE\".\n\nSo Sarah's number is 10000A + 1000C + 100D + 10B + E. And the product she should have gotten is 10A + B multiplied by 100C + 10D + E.\n\nSo, 10000A + 1000C + 100D + 10B + E = 9(10A + B)(100C + 10D + E)\n\nLet's break it down:\n- 9 * 10A * 100C = 9000AC\n- 9 * 10A * 10D = 90AD\n- 9 * 10A * E = 90AE\n- 9 * B * 100C = 900BC\n- 9 * B * 10D = 90BD\n- 9 * B * E = 9BE\n\nSo, now we have:\n9000AC + 90AD + 90AE + 900BC + 90BD + 9BE = 10000A + 1000C + 100D + 10B + E\n\nIt seems like a lot of math to do, but let's work through it! And once we solve for A, B, C, D, and E, we can find the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number. Let's get started! \ud83e\udd13",
