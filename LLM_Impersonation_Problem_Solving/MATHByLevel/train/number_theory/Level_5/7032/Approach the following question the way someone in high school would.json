    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this problem down. Sarah made a mistake when multiplying a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but instead of getting the product, she ended up with a five-digit number that is exactly nine times the product she should have gotten.\n\nLet's call the two-digit number XY (where X is the tens digit and Y is the units digit) and the three-digit number ABC (where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens digit, and C is the units digit).\n\nSo when Sarah multiplied XY and ABC, she should have gotten XY * ABC. But instead, she got XYABC, which is exactly 9 times the actual product.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation:\n\n10000X + 1000Y + 100A + 10B + C = 9(10X + Y)(100A + 10B + C)\n\nExpanding both sides and simplifying, we get:\n\n90000X + 9000Y + 9000A + 900B + 90C = 9000X + 900Y + 90000A + 9000B + 900C\n\nNow we can simplify this to:\n\n81000X + 8100Y = 89100A + 8100B + 810C\n\nSince X and A are the hundreds digits of the two numbers, they must add up to 9. Similarly, Y, B, and C must add up to 9 as they are the tens and units digits.\n\nTherefore, X + A = 9 and Y + B + C = 9\n\nThis way, we can set up a system of equations to solve for X, Y, A, B, and C and find the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number.",
