    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Three clever monkeys divide a pile of bananas. The first monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The second monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas from the pile, keeps one-twelfth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. Given that each monkey receives a whole number of bananas whenever the bananas are divided, and the numbers of bananas the first, second, and third monkeys have at the end of the process are in the ratio $3: 2: 1,$what is the least possible total for the number of bananas?\n",
    "solution": "Denote the number of bananas the first monkey took from the pile as $b_1$, the second $b_2$, and the third $b_3$; the total is $b_1 + b_2 + b_3$. Thus, the first monkey got $\\frac{3}{4}b_1 + \\frac{3}{8}b_2 + \\frac{11}{24}b_3$, the second monkey got $\\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \\frac{1}{4}b_2 + \\frac{11}{24}b_3$, and the third monkey got $\\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \\frac{3}{8}b_2 + \\frac{1}{12}b_3$.\nTaking into account the ratio aspect, say that the third monkey took $x$ bananas in total. Then,\n$x = \\frac{1}{4}b_1 + \\frac{1}{8}b_2 + \\frac{11}{72}b_3 = \\frac{1}{16}b_1 + \\frac{1}{8}b_2 + \\frac{11}{48}b_3 = \\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \\frac{3}{8}b_2 + \\frac{1}{12}b_3$\nSolve this to find that $\\frac{b_1}{11} = \\frac{b_2}{13} = \\frac{b_3}{27}$. All three fractions must be integral. Also note some other conditions we have picked up in the course of the problem, namely that $b_1$ is divisible by $8$, $b_2$ is divisible by $8$, and $b_3$ is divisible by $72$ (however, since the denominator contains a $27$, the factors of $3$ cancel, and it only really needs to be divisible by $8$). Thus, the minimal value is when each fraction is equal to $8$, and the solution is $8(11 + 13 + 27) = \\boxed{408}$.",

The ratios are $3:2:1$ so let's try to find the smallest numbers that work.\n\nWe start with the third monkey, who takes the remaining bananas and keeps one-twelfth of them. So if we have $x$ bananas left, the third monkey takes $\\frac{1}{12}x$ bananas.\n\nAfter that, the other two monkeys share the remaining bananas equally. So there are $\\frac{11}{12}x$ bananas left for us to share.\n\nThe first monkey takes some bananas, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between me and the other monkey. So if the first monkey takes $y$ bananas, the other two monkeys share $\\frac{11}{12}x - y$ bananas.\n\nThe second monkey takes some bananas, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between me and the other monkey. So if the second monkey takes $z$ bananas, we share $\\frac{11}{12}x - y - z$ bananas.\n\nNow we need to make sure that all of these numbers are whole numbers. Let's try some numbers and see if it works.\n\nLet's say $x=60$, then the third monkey takes $\\frac{1}{12} \\cdot 60 = 5$ bananas.\n\nLet's say the first monkey takes 45 bananas, and the other two monkeys share $60 - 45 = 15$ bananas.\n\nThen the second monkey takes $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 15 = 3$ bananas.\n\nSo the first monkey has 45 bananas, the second monkey has  3 bananas, and the third monkey has 5 bananas.
