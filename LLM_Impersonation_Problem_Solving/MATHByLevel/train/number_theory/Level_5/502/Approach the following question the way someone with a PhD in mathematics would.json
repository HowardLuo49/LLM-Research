    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit?",
    "solution": "$343 = 7^3 = 1000_7$, so the first 343 natural numbers in base 7 are $1_7, 2_7, \\ldots 1000_7$.  Any number in this list that neither includes 4 or 5 only includes the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.  If we replace 6 with 4, these have the same decimal expansions as the integers in base 5.  Since there are $5^3 = 125$ positive integers less than or equal to $1000_5$, there are 125 integers less than or equal to $1000_7$ that contain no 4's or 5's in base 7, which means there are $343 - 125 = \\boxed{218}$ integers that include a 4 or a 5.",
    "gpt_response": "To tackle this problem, let's first analyze the base 7 representation of integers. In base 7, the digits range from 0 to 6. Let's consider the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7:\n\n1 = 1\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 4\n5 = 5\n6 = 6\n7 = 10 (base 7)\n8 = 11\n...\n49 = 70\n50 = 71\n...\n\nWe can observe that the only digits involved in representing the numbers from 1 to 49 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 0 (0 appears as the 7th digit).\n\nWhen we go beyond 49, we start to see the digits 1 and 4, as well as 2 and 5, 3 and 6, because these pairs of digits will result from carrying over when adding 1 in base 7. For example:\n\n49 = 70\n50 = 71 (carry-over of 1)\n51 = 72\n...\n342 = 513 (carry-over of 2)\n343 = 514\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the numbers from 1 to 343 in base 7 will have 4 and/or 5 as a digit whenever there is a carry-over. Therefore, all integers from 50 to 343, inclusive, will have 4 and/or 5 as a digit. Since there are 294 such integers in this range, the answer is 294.",
