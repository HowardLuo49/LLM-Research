Let $N=123456789101112\\dots4344$ be the $79$-digit number that is formed by writing the integers from $1$ to $44$ in order, one after the other. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $45$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 9\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 18\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 44$\n",
    "solution": "We will consider this number $\\bmod\\ 5$ and $\\bmod\\ 9$. By looking at the last digit, it is obvious that the number is $\\equiv 4\\bmod\\ 5$. To calculate the number $\\bmod\\ 9$, note that\n\\[123456\\cdots 4344 \\equiv 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+(1+0)+(1+1)+\\cdots+(4+3)+(4+4) \\equiv 1+2+\\cdots+44 \\bmod\\ 9,\\]\nso it is equivalent to\n\\[\\frac{44\\cdot 45}{2} = 22\\cdot 45 \\equiv 0\\bmod\\ 9.\\]\nLet $x$ be the remainder when this number is divided by $45$. We know that $x\\equiv 0 \\pmod {9}$ and $x\\equiv 4 \\pmod {5}$, so by the Chinese remainder theorem, since $9(-1)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, $x\\equiv 5(0)+9(-1)(4) \\pmod {5\\cdot 9}$, or $x\\equiv -36 \\equiv \\boxed{9} \\pmod {45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $45$, we need to see if $N$ is divisible by $45$. One way to do this is to add up the digits of $N$ and see if the sum is divisible by $45$. \n\nTo find the sum of the digits of $N$, we can first add up the digits from $1$ to $9$ to get $1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45$. Then we can add up the digits from $10$ to $19$ to get $1+0+1+1+1+2+1+3+1+4+1+5+1+6+1+7+1+8+1+9=65$. We can continue this process until we reach the digits $4344$.\n\nAfter adding up all the digits, we find that the sum is $1+2+3+4+...+4+3+4+4=990$. Since $990$ is divisible by $45$, the remainder when $N$ is divided by $45$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1}$.",
