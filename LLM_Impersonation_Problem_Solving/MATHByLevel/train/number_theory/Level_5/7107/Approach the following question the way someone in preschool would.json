Let $N=123456789101112\\dots4344$ be the $79$-digit number that is formed by writing the integers from $1$ to $44$ in order, one after the other. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $45$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 9\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 18\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 44$\n",
    "solution": "We will consider this number $\\bmod\\ 5$ and $\\bmod\\ 9$. By looking at the last digit, it is obvious that the number is $\\equiv 4\\bmod\\ 5$. To calculate the number $\\bmod\\ 9$, note that\n\\[123456\\cdots 4344 \\equiv 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+(1+0)+(1+1)+\\cdots+(4+3)+(4+4) \\equiv 1+2+\\cdots+44 \\bmod\\ 9,\\]\nso it is equivalent to\n\\[\\frac{44\\cdot 45}{2} = 22\\cdot 45 \\equiv 0\\bmod\\ 9.\\]\nLet $x$ be the remainder when this number is divided by $45$. We know that $x\\equiv 0 \\pmod {9}$ and $x\\equiv 4 \\pmod {5}$, so by the Chinese remainder theorem, since $9(-1)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, $x\\equiv 5(0)+9(-1)(4) \\pmod {5\\cdot 9}$, or $x\\equiv -36 \\equiv \\boxed{9} \\pmod {45}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we have a super duper big number $N=123456789101112\\dots4344$ with $79$ digits. Wowzer! We want to know what happens when we divide $N$ by $45$. Hmm... let's think about this. \nWell, when we add up all the digits of $N$, we get $1+2+3+\\cdots+44$. Did someone say addition? Yippee! I love adding big numbers together! Let's see... when we add $1$ to $2$ to $3$ and keep going all the way to $44$, we get a super special answer. Can you tell me what that answer is? \nYep, the answer is $990$. Wow, that's a big number! Now we just need to see what happens when we divide $990$ by $45$. When we do that, we get $22$ with a remainder of $\\boxed{0}$. Woohoo! We did it! Great job!",
