    "solution": "First we note that the four integers are $1,3,5,7$. Then we expand to get \\[(abc+abd+acd+bcd)(abcd)^{-1}=a^{-1}+b^{-1}+c^{-1}+d^{-1}.\\]Finally, we see that (amazingly) each of the four numbers is its own inverse modulo $8$. Thus,  \\[1^{-1}+3^{-1}+5^{-1}+7^{-1}\\equiv 1+3+5+7\\equiv 16\\equiv \\boxed{0} \\pmod 8.\\]",
