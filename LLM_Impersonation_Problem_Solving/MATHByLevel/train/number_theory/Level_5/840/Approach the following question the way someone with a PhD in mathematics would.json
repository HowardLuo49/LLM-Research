    "solution": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest integer $n$ such that $n^{-1}\\pmod{1050}$ is defined, we need to find an integer $n$ such that $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, meaning that $\\gcd(n, 1050) = 1$. \n\nSince $1050 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$, we need to find an integer $n$ that is not divisible by $2, 3, 5$ or $7$. The smallest such integer that is greater than $1$ is $11$, since $\\gcd(11, 1050) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $n$ greater than $1$ such that $n^{-1}\\pmod{1050}$ is defined is $11$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 11?: To determine the smallest integer $n$ such that $n^{-1}\\pmod{1050}$ is defined, we need to find an integer $n$ such that $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, meaning that $\\gcd(n, 1050) = 1$. \n\nSince $1050 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$, we need to find an integer $n$ that is not divisible by $2, 3, 5$ or $7$.
