    "solution": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so first I need to understand what it means for $n^{-1}$ to be defined. In modular arithmetic, $n^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $n$ in a given modulus. This means that $n \\cdot n^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1050}$. So, for $n^{-1}$ to be defined, we need to find an $n$ such that it has a multiplicative inverse modulo 1050.\n\nThe smallest integer greater than 1 that has a multiplicative inverse modulo 1050 is one that is coprime to 1050. This means that it does not share any common factors with 1050 except for 1. The prime factorization of 1050 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$, so our integer $n$ cannot have any of these prime factors.\n\nSo, we need to find the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Looking at this, the smallest integer that fits this criteria is 11. Since 11 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, it is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that $n^{-1}\\pmod{1050}$ is defined. So, $n = 11$.",
