    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y),$ with $y<x\\le 100,$ are both $\\frac xy$ and $\\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ integers?\n",
    "solution": "Since $y|x$, $y+1|x+1$, then $\\text{gcd}\\,(y,x)=y$ (the bars indicate divisibility) and $\\text{gcd}\\,(y+1,x+1)=y+1$. By the Euclidean algorithm, these can be rewritten respectively as $\\text{gcd}\\,(y,x-y)=y$ and $\\text{gcd}\\, (y+1,x-y)=y+1$, which implies that both $y,y+1 | x-y$. Also, as $\\text{gcd}\\,(y,y+1) = 1$, it follows that $y(y+1)|x-y$. [1]\nThus, for a given value of $y$, we need the number of multiples of $y(y+1)$ from $0$ to $100-y$ (as $x \\le 100$). It follows that there are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \\right\\rfloor$ satisfactory positive integers for all integers $y \\le 100$. The answer is\n\\[\\sum_{y=1}^{99} \\left\\lfloor\\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \\right\\rfloor = 49 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{85}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the condition that $\\frac xy$ is an integer. This implies that $x$ is a multiple of $y$. So $x=yk$ for some positive integer $k$. \n\nNow we consider the other condition that $\\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is an integer. This implies that $x+1$ is a multiple of $y+1$. Substituting $x=yk$ into this, we get $yk+1=(y+1)k'$ for some positive integer $k'$.\n\nExpanding this, we get $yk+1=yk+k' \\Rightarrow 1=k'$, which implies that $x=yk$ and $x+1=yk+1$. But $x<y$, so this condition cannot be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{0}$ ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy both conditions.",
