    "solution": "Since $y|x$, $y+1|x+1$, then $\\text{gcd}\\,(y,x)=y$ (the bars indicate divisibility) and $\\text{gcd}\\,(y+1,x+1)=y+1$. By the Euclidean algorithm, these can be rewritten respectively as $\\text{gcd}\\,(y,x-y)=y$ and $\\text{gcd}\\, (y+1,x-y)=y+1$, which implies that both $y,y+1 | x-y$. Also, as $\\text{gcd}\\,(y,y+1) = 1$, it follows that $y(y+1)|x-y$. [1]\nThus, for a given value of $y$, we need the number of multiples of $y(y+1)$ from $0$ to $100-y$ (as $x \\le 100$). It follows that there are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \\right\\rfloor$ satisfactory positive integers for all integers $y \\le 100$. The answer is\n\\[\\sum_{y=1}^{99} \\left\\lfloor\\frac{100-y}{y(y+1)} \\right\\rfloor = 49 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{85}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Let's look at the first fraction, $\\frac{x}{y}$. Since $y$ is smaller than $x$, $x$ must be a multiple of $y$. This means $x$ can be $2y, 3y, 4y, \\dots$ all the way up to $100y$.\n\nNow let's look at the second fraction, $\\frac{x+1}{y+1}$. Since both $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x+1$ must be a multiple of $y+1$. This means $x+1$ can be $(y+1), 2(y+1), 3(y+1), \\dots$ all the way up to $101(y+1)$.\n\nSo, we need to count how many pairs of integers $(x,y)$ satisfy both conditions. \n\nIf $x=2y$, then $x+1 = 2y+1$ is not a multiple of $y+1$.\nIf $x=3y$, then $x+1 = 3y+1$ is not a multiple of $y+1$.\nIf $x=4y$, then $x+1 = 4y+1$ is not a multiple of $y+1$.\n...\nIf $x=99y$, then $x+1 = 99y+1$ is not a multiple of $y+1$.\n\nBut if $x=100y$, then $x+1=100y+1$ is one more than $y+1$ and is a multiple of $y+1$.\n\nTherefore, the only $x$ that works is $x=100y$. Since $y<x\\le 100$, $y$ can be any positive integer less than $100$. So, there are $\\boxed{99}$ ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy both conditions.",
