    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A book has 136 pages. Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it. The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203. How many words are on each page?",
    "solution": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many words are on each page, we need to divide the total number of words in the book (136) by the number of pages. Since each page has the same number of words, we can represent the number of words on each page as x.\n\nSo we have the equation:\n\n136 = x * number of pages\n\nTo find the number of pages, we need to figure out what 136 is congruent to modulo 203. This means we need to find a number n such that:\n\n136 \u2261 n (mod 203)\n\nBy trial and error, we find that n = 184 satisfies this equation.\n\nNow we can solve for the number of pages by dividing 136 by n:\n\n136 = x * n\n\n136 = x * 184\n\nx = 136 / 184\n\nx = 0.7391\n\nSince each page cannot have a fraction of a word, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
