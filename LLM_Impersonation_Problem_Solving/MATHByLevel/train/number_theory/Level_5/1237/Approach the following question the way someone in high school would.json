    "solution": "By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \\times 2n, n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n, n - 1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4, n -1) \\le \\boxed{4}.\\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$.",
    "gpt_response": "When I first saw this question, I was a bit confused because I wasn't sure what the triangular number was. But then I remembered that it's just the sum of all the numbers up to $n$. So $T_n = 1+2+3+ \\cdots + n$.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor of $4T_n$ and $n-1$. First, let's find $4T_n$. Since $T_n = 1+2+3+ \\cdots + n$, we can rewrite it as $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. So $4T_n = 2n(n+1)$. \n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor of $2n(n+1)$ and $n-1$. This is where it gets a bit tricky. One thing we can do is try out some values of $n$ and see if we notice a pattern. For example, when $n=3$, $4T_3 = 24$ and $n-1 = 2$. The greatest common divisor of $24$ and $2$ is $2$.\n\nLet's try another value. When $n=5$, $4T_5 = 40$ and $n-1 = 4$. The greatest common divisor of $40$ and $4$ is also $4$. \n\nFrom these examples, it seems like the greatest common divisor is always either $2$ or $4$. But we need to find the greatest possible value. We notice that for any $n$, $2n(n+1)$ is always divisible by $4$. So the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{4}$.",
