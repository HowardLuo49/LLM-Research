    "solution": "By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \\times 2n, n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n, n - 1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4, n -1) \\le \\boxed{4}.\\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so a triangular number is like when you add up all the numbers from 1 to a certain number. So like for the 4th triangular number, you add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 to get 10. \n\nSo for this problem, we want to find the greatest common divisor of 4 times a triangular number and that number minus 1. \n\nLet's do an example with the 4th triangular number. 4 times the 4th triangular number is 4 times 10 which is 40. And 4 minus 1 is 3. The greatest common divisor of 40 and 3 is 1. \n\nSo we want to find the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor for any triangular number. \n\nI think if we look at the pattern and try some different numbers, we might figure it out!
