    "solution": "By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \\times 2n, n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n, n - 1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4, n -1) \\le \\boxed{4}.\\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so a triangular number is when you add all the numbers from 1 to another number. So for example, the 4th triangular number would be 1+2+3+4, which equals 10. \n\nThe greatest common divisor is the biggest number that can divide evenly into two numbers. So for example, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18 would be 6 because both 12 and 18 can be divided by 6.\n\nWe want to find the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of 4 times a triangular number and (n-1). \n\nLet's first find 4 times a triangular number. Let's say n is 4, so the 4th triangular number is 10. 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow let's find (n-1). If n is 4, then (n-1) would be 3.\n\nSo we want to find the greatest common divisor of 40 and 3.
