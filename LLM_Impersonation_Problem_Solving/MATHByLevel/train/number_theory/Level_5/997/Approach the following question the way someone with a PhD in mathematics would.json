    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine for which integer values of n between 1 and 349 inclusive does the decimal representation of n/350 terminate, we need to consider the prime factorization of the denominator 350.\n\nThe prime factorization of 350 is $2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For a fraction to have a terminating decimal representation, its denominator must be expressible as a product of the form $2^m \\cdot 5^n$, where m and n are non-negative integers.\n\nSince the prime factorization of 350 has a factor of 7 which is not a factor of 2 or 5, the decimal representation of n/350 will terminate only if n is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the integer values of n between 1 and 349 inclusive for which the decimal representation of n/350 terminates are those which are divisible by 7. The number of such integer values can be determined by calculating the floor of 349/7, which is 49.\n\nHence, there are 49 integer values of n between 1 and 349 inclusive for which the decimal representation of n/350 terminates.",
