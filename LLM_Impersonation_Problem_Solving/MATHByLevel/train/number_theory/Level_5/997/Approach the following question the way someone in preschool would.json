    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminate?",
    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 make the decimal stop. If we look at the denominator, 350 is the same as 2 x 5 x 7 x 5. That means as long as the only prime factors in the denominator are 2 and 5, the decimal will stop. So, let's see which numbers between 1 and 349 only have 2 and 5 as their prime factors. That would be numbers that can be written as $2^a \\times 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers. Then, count how many of those numbers we have. Um, let's count...umm...1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, 100, 125, 128, 160, 200, 250, 320,...umm...I think that's 21 numbers. So, there are 21 integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 that make the decimal terminate. Yay!",
