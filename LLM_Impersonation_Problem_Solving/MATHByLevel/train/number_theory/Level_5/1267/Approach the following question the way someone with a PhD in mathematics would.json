    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct, natural-number factors does $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ have?",
    "solution": "We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^4$. A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4. There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$. In total, there are $9\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{135}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of factors, we must first prime factorize the given number. \n$4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4$\n\nTo find the total number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent and multiply them together:\n(8 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1) = 9 * 3 * 5 = 135\n\nTherefore, the given number has 135 distinct, natural-number factors.",
