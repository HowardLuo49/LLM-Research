    "solution": "Note that, modulo 6, $35 \\equiv -1$ and $16 \\equiv 4$. Therefore, $35^{1723} - 16^{1723} \\equiv (-1)^{1723} - 4^{1723} \\equiv -1 - 4^{1723}$. Note that $4^2 \\equiv 4$ modulo 6, so $-1 - 4^{1723} \\equiv -1 - 4 \\equiv -5 \\equiv \\boxed{1}$ modulo 6.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's start by finding the remainders when 35 and 16 are divided by 6. \n\n35 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 5 since 35 = 6 x 5 + 5.\n16 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4 since 16 = 6 x 2 + 4.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as (5^{1723} - 4^{1723}) modulo 6.\n\nSince 5 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 5 and 4 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4, we have:\n\n(5^{1723} - 4^{1723}) = (5 - 4) = 1 modulo 6.\n\nSo, the answer is 1.",
