    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of $150,280$:\n\\begin{align*}\n150{,}280 &= 2^3\\cdot18{,}785 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot3757 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot289 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot17^2.\n\\end{align*}Thus the sum of the different prime factors of 150,280 is $2+5+13+17=\\boxed{37}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the prime factors of 150280, we need to first break it down into its prime factors: \n\n$150280 = 2^3 \\times 5 \\times 3757$\n\nThe prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 3757.\n\nAdding these prime factors together, we get:\n\n$2 + 3 + 5 + 3757 = 3767$\n\nSo, the sum of the different prime factors of $150280$ is $3767$.",
