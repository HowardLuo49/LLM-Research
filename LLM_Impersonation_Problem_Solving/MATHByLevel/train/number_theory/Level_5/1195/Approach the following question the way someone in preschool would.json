Some examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nNow, let's find the prime factors of the number 150280. We can start by dividing 150280 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n150280 \u00f7 2 = 75140\n\nNow we keep dividing by 2 until we can't anymore:\n\n75140 \u00f7 2 = 37570\n37570 \u00f7 2 = 18785\n\nNow, let's check if 18785 is divisible by any other prime numbers.\n\n18785 is not divisible by 2, so let's try 3.\n\n18785 \u00f7 3 = 6261\n\nNow let's try 6261 divided by 3:\n\n6261 \u00f7 3 = 2087\n\nNow, 2087 is a prime number, so we can stop here.\n\nThe prime factors of 150280 are 2, 2, 5, 3, and 2087.\n\nTo find the sum of the different prime factors, we add them all up:\n\n2 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 2087 = 2099\n\nSo, the sum of the different prime factors of 150280 is 2099.",
