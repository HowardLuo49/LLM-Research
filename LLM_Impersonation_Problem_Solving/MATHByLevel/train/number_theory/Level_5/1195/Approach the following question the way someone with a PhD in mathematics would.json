    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of $150,280$:\n\\begin{align*}\n150{,}280 &= 2^3\\cdot18{,}785 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot3757 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot289 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot17^2.\n\\end{align*}Thus the sum of the different prime factors of 150,280 is $2+5+13+17=\\boxed{37}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the different prime factors of a number, we first need to factorize the number. \n\nThe prime factorization of $150280$ is: \n$2^3 \\times 5 \\times 3767$\n\nThe prime factors are $2, 5,$ and $3767$, so the sum of the different prime factors is $2 + 5 + 3767 = 3774$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the different prime factors of $150280$ is $3774$.",
