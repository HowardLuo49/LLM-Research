    "solution": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $4,1,6$, and $9$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$. Therefore, we want to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,((3x+4)(7x+1)(13x+6)(2x+9),x) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9, x)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(216,x)\n\\end{align*}Since $15336$ is a multiple of $216$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{216}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's see what we know about $x$. Since $x$ is a multiple of $15336$ and $15336=3\\cdot7\\cdot13\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot11$, we know that $x$ must have the factors $3, 7, 13, 2,$ and $11$ in order to be a multiple of $15336$. \n\nNext, we look at the expression $f(x)=(3x+4)(7x+1)(13x+6)(2x+9)$. Since $x$ already has the factors $3, 7, 13, 2,$ and $11$, we can see that the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ will be these common factors. \n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $3\\cdot7\\cdot13\\cdot2\\cdot11 = 6006$.",
