    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In base $b$, there are exactly one hundred three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct. (That's \"one hundred\" in the ordinary sense, $100_{10}$.)\n\nWhat is $b$?",
    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so in base $b$, there are exactly 100 three-digit numbers where all the digits are distinct. So, that means we have to find out what base $b$ is. \n\nLet's break it down. In base $b$, a three-digit number can be represented as $ab$ where $a$ is the hundreds digit, $b$ is the tens digit, and $c$ is the units digit. Since all the digits are distinct, the hundreds digit can be any number from 1 to $b-1$, the tens digit can be any number from 0 to $b-1$ excluding the hundreds digit, and the units digit can be any number from 0 to $b-1$ excluding the hundreds and tens digit.\n\nSo, to find the number of three-digit numbers where all the digits are distinct, we can calculate the total number of ways to choose each digit.\n\nWe have $(b-1)$ choices for the hundreds digit, $(b-1)$ choices for the tens digit (since we can't choose the same digit as the hundreds digit), and $(b-2)$ choices for the units digit (since we can't choose the same digit as the hundreds or tens digit).\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit numbers where all the digits are distinct is $(b-1)(b-1)(b-2) = 100$.\n\nSolving for $b$ from this equation would give us the base we're looking for. But we may need to plug in values for $b$ to see which one works.",
