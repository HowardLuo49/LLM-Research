    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $b$, we need to determine the possible values of $b$ for which there are exactly 100 distinct three-digit numbers in base $b$. \n\nIn base $b$, a three-digit number will have a hundreds digit, a tens digit, and a units digit, each of which can range from 0 to $b-1$. Since the digits must be distinct, we have $b-2$ choices for the hundreds digit (since 0 cannot be chosen), $b-1$ choices for the tens digit (since we can't repeat the hundreds digit), and $b-2$ choices for the units digit (since it must be distinct from the other two digits). \n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct three-digit numbers in base $b$ is $(b-2)(b-1)(b-2)$. We want this number to be equal to 100. \n\nTherefore, we have the equation: \n\n$(b-2)(b-1)(b-2) = 100$\n\nExpanding and solving this equation will give us the possible values of $b$.
