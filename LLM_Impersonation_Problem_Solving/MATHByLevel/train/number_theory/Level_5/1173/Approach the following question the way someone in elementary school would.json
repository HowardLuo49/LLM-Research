    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 11. In the next column, we see that $9_{a}+6_{a}=13_{a}$. This tells us that $a$ goes into 15 once, leaving a remainder of 3. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's add 293 and 468 using base $a$. \n\nStarting from the right, let's add the digits. In base $a$, we know that when the sum is equal to or greater than $a$, we have to carry over a digit. \n\nSo, 3+8 = 11, which is equal to B in base $a$ when $B_{a}=11_{10}$. So we write down B and carry over 1. \n\nNext, 9+6+1(carry over)=16, which is equal to 10 in base $a$. So we write down 0 and carry over 1. \n\nFinally, 2+4+1(carry over)=7. So we write down 7.\n\nTherefore, $293_{a}+468_{a}=7B0_{a}$.\n\nNow we know that $73B_{a}=7B0_{a}$, given that $B_{a}=11_{10}$. \n\nThis implies that 7 in base $a$ is equal to 7 and B in base $a$ is equal to 11. \n\nSo, $a$ must be equal to 13 in order for $293_{13}+468_{13}=730_{13}$ to be true.",
