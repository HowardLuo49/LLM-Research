    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. \"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x<m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nThe graphs of $$y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$$and $$y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$$on modulo $16$ graph paper have some points in common. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of those points?",
    "solution": "We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $y\\equiv 5x+2$ and $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. Thus, the $x$-coordinates in all such pairs satisfy $$5x+2 \\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}.$$Subtracting $5x+2$ from both sides of this congruence, we have $$0 \\equiv 6x+10\\pmod{16},$$which is equivalent to $$0 \\equiv 6x-6\\pmod{16}$$(since $10\\equiv -6\\pmod{16}$).\n\nThus the solutions we seek are values $x$ in the range $0\\le x<16$ such that $16$ divides $6(x-1)$. The solutions are $x=1,$ $x=9,$ so the sum of $x$-coordinates is $1+9=\\boxed{10}$.\n\n(As a check, note that the pairs $(1,7)$ and $(9,15)$ satisfy both of the original congruences, so these are the points shared by the two graphs.)",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have a special kind of paper called \"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" with lots of little points on it. Each point has two numbers, like $(x,y)$. We can draw lines on this paper to show when two numbers are the same when divided by some other number. \n\nLet's draw a line on the paper for $y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$. This line will pass through some points. And then let's draw another line for $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. This line will also pass through some points.\n\nWe need to find the points where both lines pass through. These are the points that are part of both lines. We want to add up the $x$-coordinates of these points.\n\nSo we look at all the points where both lines cross each other, and we add up the $x$-coordinates of those points. That will give us the answer to the question.",
