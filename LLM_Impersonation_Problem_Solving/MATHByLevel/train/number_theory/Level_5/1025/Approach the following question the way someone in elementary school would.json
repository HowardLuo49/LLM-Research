If $S$, $H$, and $E$ are all distinct non-zero digits less than $5$ and the following is true, find the sum of the three values $S$, $H$, and $E$, expressing your answer in base $5$. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &S&H&E_5\\\\ &+&H&E_5\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &S&E&S_5\\\\ \\end{array}$$",
    "solution": "Starting with the the rightmost column would be the easiest (we'll call it the first, the second rightmost column the second, and so on). Let's consider the possible values for $E$ first.\n\nSince the values must be non-zero, we'll start with $1$. If $E$ is $1$, then $S$ would be $2$ and nothing would carry over. However, since $H+H$ must equal $E$ if nothing carries over and $H$ must be an integer, $E$ can not equal $1$.\n\nIf $E$ equals $2$, then $S$ must equal $4$. $H$ would then equal $1$. This satisfies our original equation as shown: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &4&1&2_5\\\\ &+&1&2_5\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &4&2&4_5\\\\ \\end{array}$$Thus, $S+H+E=4+1+2=7$. In base $5$, the sum is then $\\boxed{12_5}$.\n\nNote: The other possible values for $E$ can also be checked. If $E$ equaled $3$, the residue $S$ would then equal $1$ and $1$ would be carried over. Since nothing carries over into the third column, $1+H+H$ would then have to equal $3$. However, $H$ can not equal $1$ because the digits must be distinct.\n\nIf $E$ equaled $4$, the residue $S$ would then equal $3$ and $1$ would be carried over. $1+H+H$ would then have to equal $4$, but $H$ can not be a decimal. Therefore, the above solution is the only possible one.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at the columns. In the ones column, we have $E + E = S$, which means $E$ must be $2$ since it is less than $5$ and distinct from $S$. \n\nNow we move to the tens column, where we have $H + H = E$. Since $E = 2$, this means $H$ must be $1$ since it is different from $E$.\n\nFinally, in the hundreds column, we have $S + H = S$. Since $H = 1$, this means $S$ must be $4$.\n\nTherefore, $S = 4$, $H = 1$, and $E = 2$, so the sum $S + H + E$ expressed in base $5$ is $4 + 1 + 2 = 7$, which is $12$ in base $5$.",
