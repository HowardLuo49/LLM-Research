    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A relatively prime date is a date for which the number of the month and the number of the day are relatively prime. For example, June 17 is a relatively prime date because the greatest common factor of 6 and 17 is 1. How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates?",
    "solution": "Since exactly 1 in every $n$ consecutive dates is divisible by $n$, the month with the fewest relatively prime days is the month with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors. This reasoning gives us June ($6=2\\cdot3$) and December ($12=2^2\\cdot3$). December, however, has one more relatively prime day, namely December 31, than does June, which has only 30 days. Therefore, June has the fewest relatively prime days. To count how many relatively prime days June has, we must count the number of days that are divisible neither by 2 nor by 3. Out of its 30 days, $\\frac{30}{2}=15$ are divisible by 2 and $\\frac{30}{3}=10$ are divisible by 3. We are double counting the number of days that are divisible by 6, $\\frac{30}{6}=5$ days. Thus, June has $30-(15+10-5)=30-20=\\boxed{10}$ relatively prime days.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the month with the fewest relatively prime dates, we need to check how many relatively prime dates each month has.\n\nLet's start with January. January has 31 days, so we need to count how many of those days are relatively prime. \n\nWe can do that by taking each day of the month and checking if its number and the number of the month are relatively prime. If they are, we count that as a relatively prime date. \n\nOnce we have counted all the relatively prime dates for January, we can move on to the next month and repeat the process.\n\nWe keep doing this for each month until we have checked all of them. The month with the fewest relatively prime dates is the answer to the question. \n\nNow, let's count the relatively prime dates for each month and see which month has the fewest.",
