    "solution": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N \\equiv x \\pmod{10000}$, where $0 \\leq x \\leq 9999$. Then \n\\begin{align*}\nN^2 &\\equiv x^2 \\pmod{10000}\n\\end{align*} \n\nSince $N^2$ and $N$ end in the same four digits $abcd$, we have \n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 &\\equiv x \\pmod{10000} \\\\\nx^2 - x &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000} \\\\\nx(x-1) &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, $x(x-1)$ must be divisible by $10000$. It follows that $x$ or $x-1$ must be divisible by $5000$ and $x$ or $x-1$ must be divisible by $125$. \n\nConsidering that $0 \\leq x \\leq 9999$, we can conclude that $x = 0$ or $x = 1$ is the only possible solution. \n\nTherefore, the three-digit number $abc$ is $\\boxed{001}$.",
