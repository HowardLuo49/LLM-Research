    "solution": "A number in decimal notation ends in a zero for each power of ten which divides it. Thus, we need to count both the number of 5s and the number of 2s dividing into our given expression. Since there are clearly more 2s than 5s, it is sufficient to count the number of 5s.\nOne way to do this is as follows: $96$ of the numbers $1!,\\ 2!,\\ 3!,\\ 100!$ have a factor of $5$. $91$ have a factor of $10$. $86$ have a factor of $15$. And so on. This gives us an initial count of $96 + 91 + 86 + \\ldots + 1$. Summing this arithmetic series of $20$ terms, we get $970$. However, we have neglected some powers of $5$ - every $n!$ term for $n\\geq25$ has an additional power of $5$ dividing it, for $76$ extra; every n! for $n\\geq 50$ has one more in addition to that, for a total of $51$ extra; and similarly there are $26$ extra from those larger than $75$ and $1$ extra from $100$. Thus, our final total is $970 + 76 + 51 + 26 + 1 = 1124$, and the answer is $\\boxed{124}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So we want to find the number of zeros at the end of the decimal representation of $1!2!3!4!\\cdots99!100!$. First, we can see that there will be a lot of factors of $5$ in the product, since every multiple of $5$ will contribute a factor of $5$ to the product, which will give us a zero at the end. \n\nTo find the number of factors of $5$ in the product, we can just count the multiples of $5$ in the range $1$ to $100$. There are $20$ multiples of $5$, $4$ of which are also multiples of $25$ (which means they will contribute an extra factor of $5$ to the product, since $25$ has two factors of $5$). There is also $1$ multiple of $125$. Adding all these factors of $5$ together, we get $20 + 4 + 1 = 25$ factors of $5$ in the product.\n\nSince every factor of $5$ also contributes a factor of $2$ (since $10$ has a factor of $2$ and $5$), we just need to find the number of factors of $2$ in the product.
