    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $N$ be the number of consecutive $0$'s at the right end of the decimal representation of the product $1!2!3!4!\\cdots99!100!.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "A number in decimal notation ends in a zero for each power of ten which divides it. Thus, we need to count both the number of 5s and the number of 2s dividing into our given expression. Since there are clearly more 2s than 5s, it is sufficient to count the number of 5s.\nOne way to do this is as follows: $96$ of the numbers $1!,\\ 2!,\\ 3!,\\ 100!$ have a factor of $5$. $91$ have a factor of $10$. $86$ have a factor of $15$. And so on. This gives us an initial count of $96 + 91 + 86 + \\ldots + 1$. Summing this arithmetic series of $20$ terms, we get $970$. However, we have neglected some powers of $5$ - every $n!$ term for $n\\geq25$ has an additional power of $5$ dividing it, for $76$ extra; every n! for $n\\geq 50$ has one more in addition to that, for a total of $51$ extra; and similarly there are $26$ extra from those larger than $75$ and $1$ extra from $100$. Thus, our final total is $970 + 76 + 51 + 26 + 1 = 1124$, and the answer is $\\boxed{124}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find the product of all these factorials. That's 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 and so on up to 100. Then we multiply all those products together. \n\nSo the tricky part is figuring out how many 0's are at the end of this really big number. To do that, we need to figure out how many factors of 5 and 2 are in the product.\n\nThere are definitely more factors of 2 than 5, so we just need to count how many factors of 5 there are. We know every multiple of 5 contributes at least 1 factor of 5, every multiple of 25 contributes at least 2 factors of 5, and every multiple of 125 contributes at least 3 factors of 5.\n\nSo we count 100/5 = 20 factors of 5, 100/25 = 4 factors of 25, and 100/125 = 0 factors of 125. \n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of 5 is 20 + 4 = 24. \n\nSince there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in the product, the total number of factors of 10 (which is 2 times 5) is 24. \n\nTherefore, the number of consecutive $0$'s at the right end of the decimal representation of the product is $24$. \n\nWhen we divide $24$ by $1000$, we get a remainder of $\\boxed{24}$.",
