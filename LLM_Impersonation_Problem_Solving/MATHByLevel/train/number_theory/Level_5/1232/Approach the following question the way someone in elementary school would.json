    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.",
    "solution": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's figure this out together! So we know that there must be at least 2 chairs in every row and column. Since we have 36 chairs in total, let's start by finding all the factors of 36: \n\n1 x 36\n2 x 18\n3 x 12\n4 x 9\n6 x 6\n\nSince we need at least 2 chairs in each row and column, we can eliminate the last one (6 x 6). So we have 4 options left: 1 x 36, 2 x 18, 3 x 12, 4 x 9.\n\nLet's calculate the number of arrays for each option:\n1 x 36: There is only 1 way to arrange the chairs\n2 x 18: There are 2 ways to arrange the chairs (2 rows of 18 or 18 rows of 2)\n3 x 12: There are 2 ways to arrange the chairs (3 rows of 12 or 12 rows of 3)\n4 x 9: There are 2 ways to arrange the chairs (4 rows of 9 or 9 rows of 4)\n\nSo, in total, there are 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 possible arrays for a classroom containing 36 chairs.",
