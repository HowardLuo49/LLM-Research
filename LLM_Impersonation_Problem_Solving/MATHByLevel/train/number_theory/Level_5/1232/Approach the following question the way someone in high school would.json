A rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.",
    "solution": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of possible arrays in a classroom containing 36 chairs, we need to first factor 36 to see all the possible ways we can arrange the chairs.\n\nThe factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36\n\nNow, we need to find the combinations of factors that satisfy the conditions given in the question. We need to have at least two chairs in every row and column.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n1. 2 rows of 18 chairs\n2. 3 rows of 12 chairs\n3. 4 rows of 9 chairs\n4. 6 rows of 6 chairs\n5. 9 rows of 4 chairs\n6. 12 rows of 3 chairs\n7. 18 rows of 2 chairs\n\nTherefore, there are 7 possible arrays in a classroom containing 36 chairs.",
