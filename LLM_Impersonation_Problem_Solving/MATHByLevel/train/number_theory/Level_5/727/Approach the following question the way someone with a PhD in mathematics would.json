    "solution": "Notice that the question is essentially asking us for the greatest common divisor of $2002$ and $44444$: any number that can be written in the given form must be divisible by the greatest common divisor of $2002$ and $44444$. Conversely, we can find the values of $m$ and $n$ through repeated applications of the Euclidean algorithm. In particular, \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(2002, 44444) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\,(2002, 44444 - 22 \\cdot 2002)\\\\&\\qquad = \\text{gcd}\\,(2002, 400) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\,(2002 - 5 \\cdot (44444 - 22 \\cdot 2002), 400) \\\\&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\,(2, 400) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\boxed{2}.\n\\end{align*}Notice that \\begin{align*}\n&2002 - 5 \\cdot (44444 - 22 \\cdot 2002)\\\\ &\\qquad= 2002 - 5 \\cdot 44444 + 110 \\cdot 2002 \\\\ &\\qquad= (111) \\cdot 2002 + (-5) \\cdot 44444 \\\\ &\\qquad= 2,\\end{align*}as desired.",
    "gpt_response": "One way to approach this question is to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2002 and 44444. By applying the Euclidean algorithm, we can find that the GCD of 2002 and 44444 is 2.\n\nSince 2 is a common divisor of both 2002 and 44444, any integer that can be written in the form $2002m + 44444n$ must be a multiple of 2. Therefore, the smallest positive integer that can be written in this form is 2.\n\nIn general, for any two integers $a$ and $b$, the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form $am + bn$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, is equal to the GCD of $a$ and $b$.",
