    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.",

We know that a fraction in lowest terms terminates if and only if the denominator can be written in the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ for nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nSince $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$ is not of this form, the fraction $\\frac{n}{120}$ will terminate if and only if $n$ has a prime factorization that only consists of 2's and 5's.\n\nThe prime factorization of each number from 1 to 120 is as follows:\n\n- 1: $1 = 2^0 \\cdot 5^0$\n- 2: $2 = 2^1 \\cdot 5^0$\n- 3: $3 = 3 \\cdot 5^0$\n- 4: $4 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^0$\n- 5: $5 = 2^0 \\cdot 5^1$\n- 6: $6 = 2^1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^0$\n- ...\n- 120: $120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^1$\n\nSo, the integers between 1 and 120 inclusive with prime factorizations that consist of only 2's and 5's are powers of 2 and 5, which are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{7}$ integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminates.",
