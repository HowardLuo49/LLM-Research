    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which values of $n$ result in the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminating, we need to consider the prime factorization of the denominator $120=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5$. \n\nFor the decimal expansion of a fraction to terminate, the denominator must be in the form of $2^m\\cdot5^n$, where $m$ and $n$ are non-negative integers. In this case, $120=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5$, so the only prime factors in the denominator are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nTherefore, in order for the decimal expansion of $\\frac{n}{120}$ to terminate, the prime factorization of $n$ must contain only the primes 2, 3, and 5. This means that $n$ must be of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot5^c$ for non-negative integers $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nSince $n$ ranges from 1 to 120, we need to find the number of ways in which $n$ can be expressed in this form within this range. This involves considering all possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot5^c\\leq120$.\n\nBy systematically considering the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can determine how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive result in the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminating.",
