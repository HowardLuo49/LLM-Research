    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see... So we have to count how many numbers between 1 and 120 can be written as a fraction that ends in a decimal point. Well, if the denominator of the fraction is divisible by 2 or 5, then the decimal representation will terminate. \n\nLet's start counting! First, we can list out the numbers between 1 and 120 that are divisible only by 2 or 5. \n\nNumbers divisible by 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...\nNumbers divisible by 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...\n\nNow let's find the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 5:\nNumbers divisible by 2 and 5 (which means divisible by 10): 10, 20, 30, ...\n\nSo, if we add up all the numbers we counted before, we will find out how many fractions have a decimal representation that terminates.
