    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 make the decimal form of $\\frac{n}{120}$ end, we need to see what the prime factorization of 120 is. This is $2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5$. \n\nFor the decimal form of a fraction to end, the denominator has to be a product of only the prime factors 2 and 5. Since 120 has the factor of 3, the decimal form of $\\frac{n}{120}$ will not end for any value of $n$ between 1 and 120. \n\nSo the answer is 0 integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 make the fraction $\\frac{n}{120}$ have a terminating decimal form.",
