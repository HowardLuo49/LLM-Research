    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. How many integers $N$ less than $1000$ can be written as the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers from exactly 5 values of $j\\ge 1$?\n",
    "solution": "Let the first odd integer be $2n+1$, $n\\geq 0$. Then the final odd integer is $2n+1 + 2(j-1) = 2(n+j) - 1$. The odd integers form an arithmetic sequence with sum $N = j\\left(\\frac{(2n+1) + (2(n+j)-1)}{2}\\right) = j(2n+j)$. Thus, $j$ is a factor of $N$.\nSince $n\\geq 0$, it follows that $2n+j \\geq j$ and $j\\leq \\sqrt{N}$.\nSince there are exactly $5$ values of $j$ that satisfy the equation, there must be either $9$ or $10$ factors of $N$. This means $N=p_1^2p_2^2$ or $N=p_1p_2^4$. Unfortunately, we cannot simply observe prime factorizations of $N$ because the factor $(2n+j)$ does not cover all integers for any given value of $j$.\nInstead we do some casework:\nIf $N$ is odd, then $j$ must also be odd. For every odd value of $j$, $2n+j$ is also odd, making this case valid for all odd $j$. Looking at the forms above and the bound of $1000$, $N$ must be\n\\[(3^2\\cdot5^2),\\ (3^2\\cdot7^2),\\ (3^4\\cdot5),\\ (3^4\\cdot7),\\ (3^4\\cdot 11)\\]\nThose give $5$ possibilities for odd $N$.\nIf $N$ is even, then $j$ must also be even. Substituting $j=2k$, we get\n\\[N = 4k(n+k) \\Longrightarrow \\frac{N}{4} = k(n+k)\\]\nNow we can just look at all the prime factorizations since $(n+k)$ cover the integers for any $k$. Note that our upper bound is now $250$:\n\\[\\frac{N}{4} = (2^2\\cdot3^2),(2^2\\cdot5^2),(2^2\\cdot7^2), (3^2\\cdot5^2), (2^4\\cdot3), (2^4\\cdot5), (2^4\\cdot7), (2^4\\cdot11), (2^4\\cdot13), (3^4\\cdot2)\\]\nThose give $10$ possibilities for even $N$.\nThe total number of integers $N$ is $5 + 10 = \\boxed{15}$.",
