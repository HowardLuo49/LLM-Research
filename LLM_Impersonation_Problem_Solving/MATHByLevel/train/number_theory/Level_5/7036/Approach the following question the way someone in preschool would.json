    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Each of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is $25.$ One marble is taken out of each box randomly. The probability that both marbles are black is $27/50,$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n$?\n",
    "solution": "If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.\nLet $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$. Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$. It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.\nCase 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second. Then, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.\nCase 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both. Thus, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{1}{25}$. $m + n = 26$.\nThus, $m + n = \\boxed{26}$.",

Together, there are 25 marbles. \n\nWhen we pick one marble from each box, we want to find the probability that both marbles are black. In our game, the probability is 27/50. \n\nWe also want to find the probability that both marbles are white. Let's call this probability m/n. \n\nTo find m/n, we can first think about the total possible outcomes. Since each box has black and white marbles, there are 2 choices for each box. So in total, there are 2 * 2 = 4 possible outcomes. \n\nSince the probability of getting 2 black marbles is 27/50, that means there are 27 favorable outcomes out of a total of 50 outcomes. \n\nSince there are 4 total outcomes, that leaves 50 - 27 = 23 outcomes for getting 2 white marbles. \n\nSo the probability of getting 2 white marbles is 23/50. \n\nSince m and n need to be relatively prime, that means the greatest common divisor of m and n is 1. \n\nSo m = 23 and n = 50. \n\nTherefore, m + n = 23 + 50 = 73. \n\nSo the answer is 73. \n\nYay, we did it!
