    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Each of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is $25.$ One marble is taken out of each box randomly. The probability that both marbles are black is $27/50,$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n$?\n",
    "solution": "If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.\nLet $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$. Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$. It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.\nCase 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second. Then, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.\nCase 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both. Thus, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{1}{25}$. $m + n = 26$.\nThus, $m + n = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that each box has black and white marbles, and when we pick one marble from each box, the probability of getting two black marbles is $27/50$. That means the probability of getting two white marbles is the remainder, which is $1 - 27/50 = 23/50$.\n\nNow, let's say there are $x$ black marbles in the first box and $y$ black marbles in the second box. Since the total number of marbles in both boxes is 25, the number of white marbles in the first box would be $25 - x$ and the number of white marbles in the second box would be $25 - y$.\n\nSo, the probability of getting two black marbles would be: \n\\[\\frac{x}{25} \\cdot \\frac{y}{25} = \\frac{27}{50}\\]\n\nAnd the probability of getting two white marbles would be:\n\\[\\frac{25-x}{25} \\cdot \\frac{25-y}{25} = \\frac{23}{50}\\]\n\nSolve these two equations to find $x$ and $y$, and then plug those values into the probability of two white marbles equation. Simplify and find $m$ and $n$, then add them together. That's your final answer!",
