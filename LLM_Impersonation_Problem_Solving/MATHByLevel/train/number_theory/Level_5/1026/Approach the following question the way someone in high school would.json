    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Lucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. That Wednesday was the first day of her life. Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life. On which day of the week was the party?",
    "solution": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out which day of the week Lucy's party was held on her 1000th day, we need to divide $1000$ by $7$ to see how many weeks have passed. \n\n$1000 \\div 7 = 142$ with a remainder of $6$. \n\nThis means that after $142$ weeks, there were $6$ days remaining until Lucy's 1000th day. Since Lucy was born on a Wednesday, counting $6$ days from Wednesday brings us to Tuesday. \n\nTherefore, Lucy's party was held on a Tuesday.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\text{Monday?: To find out which day of the week Lucy's party was held on her 1000th day, we need to divide $1000$ by $7$ to see how many weeks have passed. \n\n$1000 \\div 7 = 142$ with a remainder of $6$. \n\nThis means that after $142$ weeks, there were $6$ days remaining until Lucy's 1000th day.
