    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Lucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. That Wednesday was the first day of her life. Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life. On which day of the week was the party?",
    "solution": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week on which Lucy's party was held, we first need to establish the day of the week on which she was born. \n\nWe know that December 1st, 2004 fell on a Wednesday, and since Lucy was born on that day, her $1000$th day of life can be calculated by adding $1000$ days to December 1st, 2004. \n\nSince $1000 = 2 \\times 7 + 6$, this means that the $1000$th day falls exactly $2$ full weeks plus $6$ days after Lucy's birth. Therefore, since a week consists of $7$ days, we can determine that the $1000$th day of Lucy's life falls on the same day of the week as December 7th, 2004. \n\nDecember 7th, 2004 was a Tuesday, so the party for Lucy's $1000$th day of life was held on a Tuesday.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\text{Monday?: To determine the day of the week on which Lucy's party was held, we first need to establish the day of the week on which she was born. \n\nWe know that December 1st, 2004 fell on a Wednesday, and since Lucy was born on that day, her $1000$th day of life can be calculated by adding $1000$ days to December 1st, 2004. \n\nSince $1000 = 2 \\times 7 + 6$, this means that the $1000$th day falls exactly $2$ full weeks plus $6$ days after Lucy's birth.
