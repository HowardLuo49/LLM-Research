    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find a number that is divisible by eleven, we need to make sure that the difference between the sum of the odd-placed digits (A and B) and the sum of the even-placed digits (C) is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nTo maximize the number, we want to make A as big as possible. Let's start by trying A = 9. We have 9B, C9 which is equal to 90B + C + 9. To make it divisible by 11, we need to make 90B + C a multiple of 11. The largest values we can choose for B and C while maintaining the condition that A, B, and C are distinct digits are: B = 8 and C = 7. \n\nSo, our number is 98,787 which is the greatest possible value of AB, CBA that is divisible by eleven.
