    "solution": "The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$. Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5. Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot2005=401$ end in 5. The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\\cdot1+802\\cdot9+401\\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \\boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers, we can first consider the units digit of each square and then add them all together.\n\nThe units digit of the square of an odd integer will always end in 1, 5, or 9. Let's look at the units digit of the squares of the first few odd integers:\n\n1^2 = 1 (units digit: 1)\n3^2 = 9 (units digit: 9)\n5^2 = 25 (units digit: 5)\n7^2 = 49 (units digit: 9)\n9^2 = 81 (units digit: 1)\n\nWe can see a pattern that the units digit of the squares of odd integers repeat every four values: 1, 9, 5, 9, 1. Since we have 2007 odd integers, we can divide 2007 by 4 to find the remainder. In this case, 2007 divided by 4 has a remainder of 3.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 3 odd integers: 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2.\n\n1^2 = 1\n3^2 = 9\n5^2 = 5\n\nAdding these together, we get 1 + 9 + 5 = 15.\n\nThe units digit of 15 is 5, so the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is 5.",
