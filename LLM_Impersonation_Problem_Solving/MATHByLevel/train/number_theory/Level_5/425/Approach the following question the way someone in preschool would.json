Well, if we look at $64 = 8^2$, then maybe we can do something similar! So maybe $64^{-1} = (8^2)^{-1}$. And we know that $8^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}$. So maybe $(8^2)^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}$. And $8^2 = 64$, so that means $64^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}$! Yay, we did it! So $64^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}$.",
