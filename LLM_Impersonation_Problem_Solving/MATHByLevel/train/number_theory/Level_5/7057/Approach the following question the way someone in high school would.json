    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
    "solution": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so the first thing we need to do is figure out how many members are in the band. If we arrange them in a square formation, we have 5 members left over. This means that the total number of members is 5 more than a perfect square. Let's call the number of members x.\n\nSo, we can write this as x = n^2 + 5, where n is the number of rows and columns in the square formation.\n\nNext, the director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. This means that the total number of members is a multiple of (n+7) because there are no left over members.\n\nSo, we can write this as x = m(n+7), where m is a positive integer.\n\nNow, we have two equations: x = n^2 + 5 and x = m(n+7). We can substitute the first equation into the second to solve for x.\n\nn^2 + 5 = m(n+7)\nn^2 + 5 = mn + 7m\nn^2 - mn = 7m - 5\nn(n-m) = 7m - 5\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of members this band can have, so we need to find the largest value of x that satisfies these equations. We can try different values for n and m to find the maximum value of x.\n\nSo, the maximum number of members in the marching band is 72.",
