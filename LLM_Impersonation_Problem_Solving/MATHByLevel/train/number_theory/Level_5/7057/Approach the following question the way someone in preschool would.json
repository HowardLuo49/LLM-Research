    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
    "solution": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's play with blocks to help us figure this out! Let's start by pretending that each block is a member of the band.\n\nFirst, let's try making a square formation with the blocks. We know that there are 5 members left over, so we need to have a total number of blocks that is 5 more than a perfect square number. Let's try adding blocks until we get to a perfect square number + 5. We find that 25 (5x5) is the closest perfect square number before 30 (25 + 5). So, we have 30 blocks in total. \n\nNow, let's try making a formation with 7 more rows than columns. Let's start by making a formation with 1 row and 7 columns. This means we have 7 blocks. Then, we can keep adding rows, with each row having 7 more blocks than the previous one, until we reach a total of 30 blocks. We find that we can have 4 rows with 7 columns each. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of members this band can have is 30.",
