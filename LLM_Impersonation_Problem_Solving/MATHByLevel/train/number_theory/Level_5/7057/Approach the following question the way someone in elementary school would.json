    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
    "solution": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the marching band needs to be arranged in a way that every member has a spot and there are no extra spaces. First, let's figure out how many members are in the band.\n\nIf we arrange them in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. This means that the number of members in the band is 5 more than a perfect square number. \n\nNext, if we arrange them in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. This means that the number of members in the band is a multiple of the total number of rows and columns.\n\nTo find the maximum number of members in the band, we need to find a number that meets both criteria. The largest perfect square number that is 5 less than the number of members is 25 (5 x 5). Then, the number of members must be a multiple of (7 rows + 7 columns), which means the number of members in the band can be 25, 49, 81, 121, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of members this band can have is 49.",
