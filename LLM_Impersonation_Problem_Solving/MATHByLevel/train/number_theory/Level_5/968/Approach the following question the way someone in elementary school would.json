    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding the number of factors of each number $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\nFor a number to have exactly three factors, it must be a square of a prime number. That means $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all squares of prime numbers.\n\nThe first few squares of prime numbers are 4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, ...\n\nNow, let's find the number of factors of $x^{2}$, $y^{3}$, and $z^{4}$.\n\nFor $x^{2}$, since $x$ is a square of a prime number, $x^{2}$ will have $(2+1) = 3$ factors (1, $x$, $x^{2}$).\n\nFor $y^{3}$, since $y$ is a square of a prime number, $y^{3}$ will have $(3+1) = 4$ factors (1, $y$, $y^{2}$, $y^{3}$).\n\nFor $z^{4}$, since $z$ is a square of a prime number, $z^{4}$ will have $(4+1) = 5$ factors (1, $z$, $z^{2}$, $z^{3}$, $z^{4}$).\n\nNow, to find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we just need to multiply the number of factors of each number.\n\nSo, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ has $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$ factors.\n\nTherefore, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ has 60 factors.",
