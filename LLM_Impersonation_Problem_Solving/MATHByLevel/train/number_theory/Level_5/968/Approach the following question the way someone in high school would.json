    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we first need to find the prime factorization of each number. Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ each have exactly three factors, they must be perfect squares.\n\nLet's say $x = a^{2}$, $y = b^{2}$, and $z = c^{2}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are prime numbers.\n\nSo, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = (a^{2})^{2}(b^{2})^{3}(c^{2})^{4} = a^{4}b^{6}c^{8}$.\n\nTo find the total number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent and multiply them together. So, the number of factors will be $(4 + 1)(6 + 1)(8 + 1) = 5 * 7 * 9 = 315$.\n\nTherefore, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ has 315 factors.",
