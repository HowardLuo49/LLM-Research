    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4$, we first need to determine the prime factorization of each of the given numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$. \n\nSince each of $x$, $y$, and $z$ has exactly three natural number factors, they must be of the form $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number.\n\nLet's denote $x = p^2$, $y = q^2$, and $z = r^2$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, $x^2y^3z^4 = (p^2)^2(q^2)^3(r^2)^4 = p^4q^6r^8$. \n\nNow, to find the total number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4 = p^4q^6r^8$, we add 1 to each of the exponents of the prime factors, and then multiply these incremented exponents together. \n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of $x^2y^3z^4 = p^4q^6r^8$ is $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5*7*9 = 315$. \n\nSo, $x^2y^3z^4= p^4q^6r^8$ has 315 factors.",
