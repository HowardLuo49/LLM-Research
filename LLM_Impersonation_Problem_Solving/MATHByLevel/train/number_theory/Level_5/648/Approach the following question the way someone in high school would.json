    "solution": "We want to find the units digit of the quotient \\[\\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}5.\\]We list the final two digits of  $2^n$ and $3^n$ in the next table. We also compute the units digit of the quotient whenever $2^n+3^n$ is divisible by $5.$\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n$n$&$2^n$&$3^n$&$2^n+3^n$&$\\frac{2^n+3^n}5$\\\\\n\\hline\n0&01&01&02&\\\\\n1&02&03&05&1\\\\\n2&04&09&13&\\\\\n3&08&27&35&7\\\\\n4&16&81&97&\\\\\n5&32&43&75&5\\\\\n6&64&29&93&\\\\\n7&28&87&15&3\\\\\n8&56&61&17&\\\\\n9&12&83&95&9\\\\\n10&24&49&73&\\\\\n11&48&47&95&9\\\\\n12&96&41&37&\\\\\n13&92&23&15&3\\\\\n14&84&69&53&\\\\\n15&68&07&75&5\\\\\n16&36&21&57&\\\\\n17&72&63&35&7\\\\\n18&44&89&33&\\\\\n19&88&67&55&1\\\\\n20&76&01&77&\\\\\n21&52&03&55&1\\\\\n22&04&09&13&\\\\\n23&08&27&35&7\\\\\n24&16&81&97&\\\\\n25&32&43&75&5\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}We notice that after the first pair, the sequence repeats every $20.$ Therefore \\[{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}\\equiv {2^{13}+3^{13}}\\equiv15\\pmod{100}.\\]So, the units digit of the quotient $\\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}5$ is $\\boxed{3}.$\n\n(Note: \"mod 100\" essentially means \"remainder when the number is divided by 100\".  So, $2^{1993} + 3^{1993} \\equiv 15 \\pmod{100}$ means that $2^{1993} + 3^{1993}$ is 15 more than a multiple of 100.)",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's determine if $2^{1993}+3^{1993}$ is a multiple of 5. Since the units digit of a number is determined by the last digit, we only need to look at the last digit of $2^{1993}$ and $3^{1993}$.\nThe units digit of $2^1$ is 2, the units digit of $2^2$ is 4, the units digit of $2^3$ is 8, the units digit of $2^4$ is 6, and the pattern repeats every 4th power. So the units digit of $2^{1993}$ is the same as that of $2^1$, which is 2.\nThe units digit of $3^1$ is 3, the units digit of $3^2$ is 9, the units digit of $3^3$ is 7, the units digit of $3^4$ is 1, and the pattern repeats every 4th power. So the units digit of $3^{1993}$ is the same as that of $3^1$, which is 3.\nTherefore, the units digit of $2^{1993}+3^{1993}$ is $2+3=5$, which means it is a multiple of 5.\nNext, we find the units digit of the quotient $\\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}{5}$. Since the units digit is calculated by dividing the units digit of the dividend by the divisor, the units digit of the quotient would be the same as the units digit of $5$, which is 5.\nTherefore, the units digit of the quotient $\\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}{5}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
