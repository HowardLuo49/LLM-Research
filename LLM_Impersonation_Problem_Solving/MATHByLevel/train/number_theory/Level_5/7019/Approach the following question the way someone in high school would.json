    "solution": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \\cdot 5^2} = 16 \\cdot 27 = \\boxed{432}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that $75=3\\times5^{2}$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $75$, that means $n=75k$ for some positive integer $k$. \n\nTo find the number of positive integral divisors of $n$, we can use the formula that if $n=p_{1}^{a_{1}}\\times p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\times...\\times p_{k}^{a_{k}}$, where $p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{k}$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k}$ are positive integers, then the number of positive integral divisors of $n$ is $(a_{1}+1)(a_{2}+1)...(a_{k}+1)$.\n\nSince $n=75k=3\\times5^{2}\\times k$, the number of positive integral divisors of $n$ is $(1+1)(2+1)(1+1)=2\\times3\\times2=12$. But we need $75$ divisors, and $75=3\\times5^{2}$. That means we need to add factors of $3$ and $5$ to reach $75$ divisors.\n\nSo, we need to add $(3-2)\\times(2)=2$ factors of $3$ and $(3-1)\\times(1)=2$ factors of $5$ to $n$. This means that $\\frac{n}{75}=3^{2}\\times5^{2}=225$. \n\nTherefore, $\\frac{n}{75}=225$.",
