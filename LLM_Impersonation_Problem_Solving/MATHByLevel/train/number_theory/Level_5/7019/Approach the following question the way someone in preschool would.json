    "solution": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \\cdot 5^2} = 16 \\cdot 27 = \\boxed{432}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find the smallest number that is a multiple of $75$. First, let's list out some multiples of $75$: 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450, 525, 600, 675, 750...\n\nNow let's count how many positive integral divisors each of these numbers has. For example, $75$ has divisors 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75. Let's continue this process for the other multiples of $75$.\n\nHmm, it looks like the number $600$ has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, which is the smallest number that satisfies the conditions.
