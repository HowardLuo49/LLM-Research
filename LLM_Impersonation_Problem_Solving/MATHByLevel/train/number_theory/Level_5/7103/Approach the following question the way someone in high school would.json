    "solution": "The GCD information tells us that $24$ divides $a$, both $24$ and $36$ divide $b$, both $36$ and $54$ divide $c$, and $54$ divides $d$. Note that we have the prime factorizations:\\begin{align*} 24 &= 2^3\\cdot 3,\\\\ 36 &= 2^2\\cdot 3^2,\\\\ 54 &= 2\\cdot 3^3. \\end{align*}\nHence we have\\begin{align*} a &= 2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot w\\\\ b &= 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot x\\\\ c &= 2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot y\\\\ d &= 2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot z \\end{align*}for some positive integers $w,x,y,z$. Now if $3$ divdes $w$, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be at least $2^3\\cdot 3^2$ which is too large, hence $3$ does not divide $w$. Similarly, if $2$ divides $z$, then $\\gcd(c,d)$ would be at least $2^2\\cdot 3^3$ which is too large, so $2$ does not divide $z$. Therefore,\\[\\gcd(a,d)=2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\gcd(w,z)\\]where neither $2$ nor $3$ divide $\\gcd(w,z)$. In other words, $\\gcd(w,z)$ is divisible only by primes that are at least $5$. The only possible value of $\\gcd(a,d)$ between $70$ and $100$ and which fits this criterion is $78=2\\cdot3\\cdot13$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well let's see. We know that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is 24, the greatest common divisor of $b$ and $c$ is 36, and the greatest common divisor of $c$ and $d$ is 54. Also, the greatest common divisor of $d$ and $a$ is between 70 and 100. \n\nSince the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $24$, $a$ must be divisible by 24. Since the greatest common divisor of $b$ and $c$ is $36$, $b$ must be divisible by 36. Since the greatest common divisor of $c$ and $d$ is $54$, $c$ must be divisible by 54. Therefore, $d$ must be divisible by 54 as well based on $c$ and $d$.\n\nFrom this information, since $a$ is divisible by 24 and $d$ is divisible by 54, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $d$ must be divisible by both 24 and 54. The only common multiple of 24 and 54 between 70 and 100 is 72. So, $a$ must be divisible by 72. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 13}$.",
