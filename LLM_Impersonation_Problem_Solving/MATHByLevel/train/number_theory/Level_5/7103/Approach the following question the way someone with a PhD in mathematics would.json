Let $a, b, c,$ and $d$ be positive integers such that $\\gcd(a, b)=24$, $\\gcd(b, c)=36$, $\\gcd(c, d)=54$, and $70<\\gcd(d, a)<100$. Which of the following must be a divisor of $a$?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 5} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 7} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 11} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 13} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 17}$\n",
    "solution": "The GCD information tells us that $24$ divides $a$, both $24$ and $36$ divide $b$, both $36$ and $54$ divide $c$, and $54$ divides $d$. Note that we have the prime factorizations:\\begin{align*} 24 &= 2^3\\cdot 3,\\\\ 36 &= 2^2\\cdot 3^2,\\\\ 54 &= 2\\cdot 3^3. \\end{align*}\nHence we have\\begin{align*} a &= 2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot w\\\\ b &= 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot x\\\\ c &= 2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot y\\\\ d &= 2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot z \\end{align*}for some positive integers $w,x,y,z$. Now if $3$ divdes $w$, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be at least $2^3\\cdot 3^2$ which is too large, hence $3$ does not divide $w$. Similarly, if $2$ divides $z$, then $\\gcd(c,d)$ would be at least $2^2\\cdot 3^3$ which is too large, so $2$ does not divide $z$. Therefore,\\[\\gcd(a,d)=2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\gcd(w,z)\\]where neither $2$ nor $3$ divide $\\gcd(w,z)$. In other words, $\\gcd(w,z)$ is divisible only by primes that are at least $5$. The only possible value of $\\gcd(a,d)$ between $70$ and $100$ and which fits this criterion is $78=2\\cdot3\\cdot13$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $\\gcd(a, b) = 24$, $\\gcd(b, c) = 36$, $\\gcd(c, d) = 54$, and $70 < \\gcd(d, a) < 100$, we can prime factorize $a, b, c, d$ as follows:\n\\[a = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot p, \\quad b = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot q, \\quad c = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot r, \\quad d = 2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot s\\]\nwhere $p, q, r, s$ are integers not divisible by $2$ or $3$. From here, we know that $\\gcd(d,a)=6s+p$. Since $6s+p$ must be in the interval $(70, 100)$, $6s+p$ is a multiple of $11$. Therefore, $a=2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot p$ is divisible by $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 11}$.",
