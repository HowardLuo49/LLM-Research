Let $a, b, c,$ and $d$ be positive integers such that $\\gcd(a, b)=24$, $\\gcd(b, c)=36$, $\\gcd(c, d)=54$, and $70<\\gcd(d, a)<100$.

    "solution": "The GCD information tells us that $24$ divides $a$, both $24$ and $36$ divide $b$, both $36$ and $54$ divide $c$, and $54$ divides $d$. Note that we have the prime factorizations:\\begin{align*} 24 &= 2^3\\cdot 3,\\\\ 36 &= 2^2\\cdot 3^2,\\\\ 54 &= 2\\cdot 3^3. \\end{align*}\nHence we have\\begin{align*} a &= 2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot w\\\\ b &= 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot x\\\\ c &= 2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot y\\\\ d &= 2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot z \\end{align*}for some positive integers $w,x,y,z$. Now if $3$ divdes $w$, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be at least $2^3\\cdot 3^2$ which is too large, hence $3$ does not divide $w$. Similarly, if $2$ divides $z$, then $\\gcd(c,d)$ would be at least $2^2\\cdot 3^3$ which is too large, so $2$ does not divide $z$. Therefore,\\[\\gcd(a,d)=2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\gcd(w,z)\\]where neither $2$ nor $3$ divide $\\gcd(w,z)$. In other words, $\\gcd(w,z)$ is divisible only by primes that are at least $5$. The only possible value of $\\gcd(a,d)$ between $70$ and $100$ and which fits this criterion is $78=2\\cdot3\\cdot13$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If we look at the problem, we see that the greatest common divisor between $a$ and $b$ is 24, the greatest common divisor between $b$ and $c$ is 36, the greatest common divisor between $c$ and $d$ is 54, and the greatest common divisor between $d$ and $a$ is greater than 70, but less than 100. Let's break the problem down.\n\nSince the greatest common divisor between $a$ and $b$ is 24, that means any other number that shares a factor with $a$ must also be divisible by 24. Since 24 can be broken down into $2^3 \\cdot 3$, $a$ must have these factors to satisfy the greatest common divisor condition. \n\nNext, the greatest common divisor between $b$ and $c$ is 36, which means $b$ must be divisibly by a factor of 3 more than $a$. This implies that $b$ must have a factor of $2^2 \\cdot 3^2$.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the greatest common divisor between $c$ and $d$ is 54, which forces $c$ to have a factor of $2 \\cdot 3^3$.\n\nLastly, the greatest common divisor between $a$ and $d$ must be greater than 70 but less than 100. Using this information, we can deduce that the greatest common divisor between $a$ and $d$ can be $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$, $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13$, or $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 17$.\n\nThis means that $a$ must have a factor of $2^3 \\cdot 3$, $b$ must have a factor of $2^2 \\cdot 3^2$, $c$ must have a factor of $3^3 \\cdot 2$, and $d$ must have a factor of $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7, 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13$, or $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 17$. \n\nSince a factor common to all of these numbers is 3, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }11}$.",
