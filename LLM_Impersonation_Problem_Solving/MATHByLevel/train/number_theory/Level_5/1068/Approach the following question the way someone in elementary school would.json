    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find out what $11^4$ is in base 10. To do this, we can calculate $11^4$ which equals $14641$ in base 10.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $14641$ do not add up to $16=2^4$. \n\nTo do this, we can convert the number $14641$ to base $b$ by dividing $14641$ by $b$ repeatedly and finding the remainders. Then we add up the digits to see if they equal $16$.\n\nLet's try some bases starting from the largest base possible and working our way down.\n\nIf we try base $16$, we break down $14641$ into base $16$ by continuously dividing by $16$ and find that it equals $1A21$ in base $16$. Adding up the digits $1+A+2+1$ gives us $10+10+2+1=23$, which is not equal to $16$.\n\nTherefore, the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $14641$ do not add up to $16$ is base $\\boxed{16}$.",
