    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first let's figure out what $11^4$ is in base $b$. That means we need to convert $11$ to base $b$ first. Since $11$ is equal to $b + 1$ in base $b$, $11^4$ will be $(b+1)^4$. \n\nExpanding $(b+1)^4$ gives us $b^4 + 4b^3 + 6b^2 + 4b + 1$. \n\nNow we need to find the largest base $b$ such that the digits of this number do not add up to $2^4$. Let's add up the digits of $b^4 + 4b^3 + 6b^2 + 4b + 1$ and see what we get.\n\nAdding up the digits, we get $1 + b + b^2 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = b^2 + b + 16$. We want this sum to not equal $2^4$, which is $16$. \n\nSo, the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$ is $b = 1$.",
