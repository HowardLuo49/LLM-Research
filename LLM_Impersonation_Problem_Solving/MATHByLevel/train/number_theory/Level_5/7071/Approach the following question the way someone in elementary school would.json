    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates. Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates. Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, while Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour. Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.\n",
    "solution": "Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.\nWe have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$. Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$. Mod 4, we need $s\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$.",

Let's solve it in an elementary school way: \n\nFirst, let's solve for one variable in terms of the others. Let's solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ and $z$ by subtracting the second equation from four times the first equation:\n\n$(2x + 3y + 4z) -4(4z + 2x + 3y) = 74 - 4(91)$\n\nSimplifying that gives us $-2x = -270$ or $x = 135$.\n\nNow that we know $x = 135$, we can substitute that back into one of the equations to solve for the other variables. Substituting into the second equation gives $4z + 270 + 3y = 91$ or $3y + 4z = -179$.\n\nSimilarly, we can solve for $z$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$(2x + 3y + 4z) - 2(4z + 2x + 3y) = 74 - 2(91)$\n\nThis simplifies to $5z = -108$ or $z = -21.6$. \n\nSince we were looking for whole numbers, it seems we made a mistake in our calculations.
