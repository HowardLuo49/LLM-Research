    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates. Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates. Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, while Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour. Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.\n",
    "solution": "Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.\nWe have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$. Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$. Mod 4, we need $s\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's say Ed bikes at a rate of $x$ km/hr, jogs at a rate of $y$ km/hr, and swims at a rate of $z$ km/hr. Since Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, we can create the equation $2x + 3y + 4z = 74$.\n\nSimilarly, Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Let's say Sue's rates are $a$ km/hr for biking, $b$ km/hr for jogging, and $c$ km/hr for swimming. Then we have the equation $4a + 2b + 3c = 91$.\n\nSince Ed and Sue bike, jog, and swim at equal rates, we can set $x=a$, $y=b$, and $z=c$. Therefore, we have the system of equations:\n$2x + 3y + 4z = 74$\n$4x + 2y + 3z = 91$\n\nSubstitute $y=x$ and $z=x$ into the equations:\n$2x + 3x + 4x = 74$\n$4x + 2x + 3x = 91$\n\nSolving these equations, we find that $x=11$, $y=11$, $z=11$.\n\nTherefore, Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates are $11$ km/hr each. The sum of the squares of these rates is $11^2 + 11^2 + 11^2 = \\boxed{363}$.",
