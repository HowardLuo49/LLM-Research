Define a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\n",
    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "In order for a number to be a factorial tail, we need to find a number $m$ such that $m!$ ends in exactly $n$ zeros. To do this, we need to find how many times the factors $5$ and $2$ appear in the prime factorization of $m!$. The number of zeros at the end of $m!$ will be equal to the smaller of the number of factors of $5$ and $2$.\n\nFor example, let's find how many zeros are at the end of $5!$. The factors of $5!$ are $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. So there is one factor of $5$ and three factors of $2$, which means there is one zero at the end.\n\nNow, let's find all the positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails. We can start by finding the numbers that do have a factorial tail. We know that any number with a factor of $5$ and a factor of $2$ will have at least one zero at the end. \n\nFirst, let's find how many numbers less than $1992$ have at least one factor of $5$. We divide $1992$ by $5$ to get $398$ as an upper bound on the number of numbers with at least one factor of $5$.\n\nNext, let's find how many numbers less than $1992$ have at least two factors of $5$. We divide $1992$ by $5^2$ to get $79$ as an upper bound on the number of numbers with at least two factors of $5$.\n\nRepeating this process for higher powers of $5$, we find that the total number of numbers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails is $1992 - 398 - 79 - 15 - 3 - 0 = 1597$.\n\nTherefore, there are $1597$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
