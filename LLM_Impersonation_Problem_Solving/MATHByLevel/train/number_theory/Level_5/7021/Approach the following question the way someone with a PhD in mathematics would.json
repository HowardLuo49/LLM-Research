Define a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\n",
    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "We can approach this problem by considering the prime factorization of $m!$. The number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of $m!$ is determined by the number of factors of $5$ in the prime factorization of $m!$, since every factor of $5$ and $2$ will contribute to a factor of $10$ and hence a trailing zero. It is known that the number of factors of $5$ in the prime factorization of an integer $m$ is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor +  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor +  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\n\nIn order for $m!$ to end in exactly $n$ zeroes, the number of factors of $5$ in the prime factorization of $m!$ must be equal to $n$. This means that $m$ must be chosen such that $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor +  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor +  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots = n$.\n\nWe can now proceed to count the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails by determining the positive integers less than $1992$ whose prime factorizations do not contain the appropriate number of factors of $5$. This can be achieved by considering the various powers of $5$ less than $1992$ and subtracting those that do not fulfill the criterion.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails can be determined by subtracting the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that end in $1$ zero, $2$ zeroes, $3$ zeroes, and so forth, until the maximum number of zeroes possible. This would give the final result as the number of integers $m$ less than $1992$ such that $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor +  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor +  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\neq n, n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ up to the maximum possible trailing zeroes.",
