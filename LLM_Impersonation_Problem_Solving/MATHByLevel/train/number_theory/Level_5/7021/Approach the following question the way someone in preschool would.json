Define a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\n",
    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's play a fun game with numbers! A factorial is when you multiply a number by all the numbers smaller than it. For example, 5! (read as \"5 factorial\") is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. \n\nNow, a factorial tail is when the decimal representation of the factorial ends with a certain number of zeroes. We want to find how many positive integers less than 1992 are not factorial tails. So, let's think about this together!\n\nHmm, well, let's start from the smallest number and work our way up. If we try 1! (which is just 1), we see that it doesn't end in any zeroes. Same with 2! (which is 2), 3! (which is 6), and 4! (which is 24). They all don't end in any zeroes. \n\nNow, when we get to 5! (which is 120), we see that it ends in exactly 1 zero. So, 5 would be a factorial tail. Let's keep going and see if we can find any more factorial tails.\n\nAs we keep going, we find that when we get to 10! (which is 3,628,800), it ends in exactly 2 zeroes. So, 10 is also a factorial tail. \n\nNow, we want to know how many positive integers less than 1992 are NOT factorial tails. So let's keep checking each number until we get to 1991. \n\nLet's keep counting and figuring out which numbers are NOT factorial tails. It might take some time, but together we can figure it out!
