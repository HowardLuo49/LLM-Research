    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A right rectangular prism $P$ (i.e., a rectangular parallelpiped) has sides of integral length $a, b, c,$ with $a\\le b\\le c.$ A plane parallel to one of the faces of $P$ cuts $P$ into two prisms, one of which is similar to $P,$ and both of which have nonzero volume. Given that $b=1995,$ for how many ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ does such a plane exist?\n",
    "solution": "Let $P'$ be the prism similar to $P$, and let the sides of $P'$ be of length $x,y,z$, such that $x \\le y \\le z$. Then\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{y}{b} = \\frac zc < 1.\\]\nNote that if the ratio of similarity was equal to $1$, we would have a prism with zero volume. As one face of $P'$ is a face of $P$, it follows that $P$ and $P'$ share at least two side lengths in common. Since $x < a, y < b, z < c$, it follows that the only possibility is $y=a,z=b=1995$. Then,\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{a}{1995} = \\frac{1995}{c} \\Longrightarrow ac = 1995^2 = 3^25^27^219^2.\\]\nThe number of factors of $3^25^27^219^2$ is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 81$. Only in $\\left\\lfloor \\frac {81}2 \\right\\rfloor = 40$ of these cases is $a < c$ (for $a=c$, we end with a prism of zero volume). We can easily verify that these will yield nondegenerate prisms, so the answer is $\\boxed{40}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok so we have a rectangular prism with sides $a,b,c$ where $a\\le b\\le c.$ We want to find how many ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ such that a plane parallel to one of the faces of $P$ cuts $P$ into two prisms, one of which is similar to $P,$ and both of which have nonzero volume. \n\nSince the two prisms are similar, this means the ratio of the sides of the two prisms are all equal. Let the ratio of similarity be $k.$ Then we have $a/k = b/1995 = c/k.$ Since $b=1995,$ we have $k=1995.$ \n\nSo now we have $a/1995 = c/1995.$ This simplifies to $a=c.$ Therefore, the dimensions of the prism after the cut are $a,b,a.$ Since the volume of a prism is given by $abc,$ the volume of the original prism is $ab^2.$ The volume of the smaller prism is $(1995)(b)(1995)=1995^2b.$\n\nSince both volumes are non-zero, we have $ab^2>0$ and $1995^2b>0.$ This means $a,b>0.$\n\nSince $b=1995,$ we have $a,c$ must be positive integers such that $a\\le1995\\le c.$ Since $a=c,$ we have $a=1995$ as well. Therefore, the ordered triple is $(1995,1995,1995).$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$ ordered triple.",
