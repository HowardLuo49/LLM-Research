    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, let's start by listing out some possible numbers.\n\nThe four-digit numbers start at 1000 and go up to 9999. Since the number has two even and two odd digits, the even digits can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, while the odd digits can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\nLet's think about what combinations of numbers can work. Since the number has to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9.\n\nOne possible combination that works is 5184. This number has two odd digits (1 and 5) and two even digits (8 and 4), and its digits sum up to 18, which is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the smallest four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits is 5184.",
