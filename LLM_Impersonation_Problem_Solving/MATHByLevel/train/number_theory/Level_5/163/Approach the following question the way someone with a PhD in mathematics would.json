    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, we can start by considering the divisibility rule for 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9.\n\nLet the four-digit number be represented as ABCD, where A, B, C, and D are the digits. Since the number is divisible by 9, we know that A + B + C + D is divisible by 9. Additionally, we know that two of the digits are even and two are odd.\n\nSince the number must be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. A, B, C, and D can take values from 0 to 9.\n\nLet's consider the values of A, B, C, and D that satisfy these conditions:\n\n1. A and C must be even, and B and D must be odd.\n2. A + B + C + D must be divisible by 9.\n3. A, B, C, and D must be distinct.\n\nStarting with the smallest even digit, which is 0, we can find the smallest possible number that satisfies these conditions by iterating through the possible values. After considering all possible combinations, we find that the smallest positive four-digit number that meets these criteria is 1089. \n\nSo, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits is 1089.",
