    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest 4-digit number that is divisible by 9 and has two even and two odd digits, we can start by thinking about the rules for determining if a number is divisible by 9. \n\nOne of the rules is that the sum of the digits of a number must be a multiple of 9 in order for the number itself to be divisible by 9. So, in our case, the sum of the digits of the 4-digit number we are looking for must be a multiple of 9. \n\nNext, we need to think about the two even and two odd digits. The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, while the odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. \n\nSince our number is 4 digits and must have 2 even and 2 odd digits, let's try to find the smallest possible number that fits these conditions. \n\nThe number we're looking for is 4812. \n\nTo check if this number is divisible by 9, we can add up the digits:\n4 + 8 + 1 + 2 = 15\n\n15 is not divisible by 9, but if we keep going, we see that 15 + 9 = 24, which is divisible by 9. This means that 4812 is divisible by 9. \n\nSo, the smallest positive 4-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits is 4812.",
