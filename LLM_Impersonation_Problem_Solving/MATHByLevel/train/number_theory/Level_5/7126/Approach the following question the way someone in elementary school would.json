    "solution": "Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$. Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\cdots 5^{2003}\\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \\boxed{604}$.",
