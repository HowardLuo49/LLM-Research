    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $S = \\{5^k | k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 0 \\le k \\le 2004 \\}$. Given that $5^{2004} = 5443 \\cdots 0625$ has $1401$ digits, how many elements of $S$ begin with the digit $1$?\n",
    "solution": "Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$. Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\cdots 5^{2003}\\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \\boxed{604}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's look at some numbers in $S$. We start with $5^0 = 1$, which begins with a digit $1$. Then we have $5^1 = 5$, which doesn't start with a digit $1$. The next number in $S$ is $5^2 = 25$, which also doesn't start with a digit $1$. \n\nHmm, let's look at some more numbers. We see that $5^3 = 125$, which does start with a digit $1$. And $5^4 = 625$ doesn't start with a digit $1. \n\nSo it looks like every time the power of $5$ in $S$ is a multiple of $3$, the number begins with a digit $1$. That's because raising $5$ to a power of $3$ means we multiply by $5$ three times, which gives us a number that starts with a digit $1$.\n\nTherefore, to find out how many elements of $S$ begin with the digit $1$, we can count how many multiples of $3$ are between $0$ and $2004$. There are $669$ multiples of $3$ in that range ($0, 3, 6, 9, ..., 2004$), so there are $669$ elements in $S$ that begin with the digit $1$. \n\nYay, we did it!",
