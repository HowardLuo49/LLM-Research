    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer $N$ such that its square has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9, we can start by considering the smallest possible number whose square has $3$ digits in base 9. In base 9, the smallest three-digit number is $100_9$, which is equivalent to $81$ in base 10.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of $81$ in base 10, which is $9$. The square of $9$ in base 10 is $81$, which has $3$ digits. Thus, the largest integer $N$ whose square has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9 is $8$.\n\nTherefore, $N$ is equal to $8$ in base 9.",
