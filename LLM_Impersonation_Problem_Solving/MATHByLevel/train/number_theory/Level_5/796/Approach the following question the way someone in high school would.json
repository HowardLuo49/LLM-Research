    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer $N$ whose square has exactly 3 digits in base 9, we need to look for the largest integer $N$ such that $N^2$ is less than $9^3$ (since $9^3 = 729$ in base 10 or 1000 in base 9).\n\nSince $27^2 = 729$ in base 10, the largest integer $N$ whose square has exactly 3 digits in base 9 is $N = 27$.\n\nTherefore, $N = \\boxed{30_9}$ in base 9.",
