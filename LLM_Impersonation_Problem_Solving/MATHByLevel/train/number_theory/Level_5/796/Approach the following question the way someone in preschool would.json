    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If we have the largest integer $N$ whose square has exactly 3 digits when written in base 9, then we need to start by finding the largest 3-digit number in base 9. \n\nThe largest 3-digit number in base 9 is $8 \\cdot 9^2 + 8 \\cdot 9^1 + 8 \\cdot 9^0 = 728$.\n\nSo $N$ is the largest integer whose square is less than 728. \n\nSince $26^2 = 676$ and $27^2 = 729$, the largest integer whose square has exactly 3 digits is $26$. \n\nTherefore, $N = 26$ in base 9.",
