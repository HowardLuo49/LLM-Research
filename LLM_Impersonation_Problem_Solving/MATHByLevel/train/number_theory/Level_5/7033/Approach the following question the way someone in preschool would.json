    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer. The closest such fraction to $r$ is $\\frac 27.$ What is the number of possible values for $r$?\n",
    "solution": "The nearest fractions to $\\frac 27$ with numerator $1$ are $\\frac 13, \\frac 14$; and with numerator $2$ are $\\frac 26, \\frac 28 = \\frac 13, \\frac 14$ anyway. For $\\frac 27$ to be the best approximation for $r$, the decimal must be closer to $\\frac 27 \\approx .28571$ than to $\\frac 13 \\approx .33333$ or $\\frac 14 \\approx .25$.\nThus $r$ can range between $\\frac{\\frac 14 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .267857$ and $\\frac{\\frac 13 + \\frac{2}{7}}{2} \\approx .309523$. At $r = .2679, .3095$, it becomes closer to the other fractions, so $.2679 \\le r \\le .3095$ and the number of values of $r$ is $3095 - 2679 + 1 = \\boxed{417}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find r! We know that r is between 0.27 and 0.28 because 0.27 is less than r, and 0.28 is greater than r. \n\nSince a, b, c, and d can be any digit from 0 through 9, there are 10 choices for each of them. This means that there are 10 choices for a, 10 choices for b, 10 choices for c, and 10 choices for d, for a total of $10^4 = 10000$ possible values for r.\n\nSo, the number of possible values for r is 10000.
