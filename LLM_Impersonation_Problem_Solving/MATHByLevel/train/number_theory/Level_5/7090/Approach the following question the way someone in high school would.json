    "solution": "Writing out the recursive statement for $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_{10}$ and summing them gives\\[a_n+\\dots+a_{10}=100(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+n+\\dots+10\\]Which simplifies to\\[a_n=99(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)\\]Therefore, $a_n$ is divisible by 99 if and only if $\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)$ is divisible by 99, so $(n+10)(n-9)$ needs to be divisible by 9 and 11. Assume that $n+10$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=12, 23, 34, 45$, we see that $n=45$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. Next, assume that $n-9$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=20, 31, 42, 53$, we see that $n=53$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. The smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\nNote that we can also construct the solution using CRT by assuming either $11$ divides $n+10$ and $9$ divides $n-9$, or $9$ divides $n+10$ and $11$ divides $n-9$, and taking the smaller solution.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first I need to find out what $a_{11}$ is. Using the formula, I get $a_{11}=100a_{10}+11=100(10)+11=1011$. \n\nNow, I need to find $a_{12}$. Using the formula again, I get $a_{12}=100a_{11}+12=100(1011)+12=101112$. \n\nContinuing this pattern, I find that $a_{13}=10111213$, $a_{14}=1011121314$, and $a_{15}=101112131415$. \n\nBut wait, none of these are multiples of $99$. Let me try a different approach. \n\nSince $99=9 \\times 11$, I know that $a_n$ must be divisible by both $9$ and $11$ in order to be a multiple of $99$. \n\nBut if I look at the pattern of the digits in $a_n$, I see that the digits form a concatenation of the numbers from $10$ to $n$. \n\nSince $99$ is divisible by both $9$ and $11$, this means that the sum of the digits from $10$ to $n$ must also be divisible by $9$ and $11$ for $a_n$ to be divisible by $99$. \n\nAnd since the sum of the digits from $10$ to $15$ is $1+0+1+1+1+2+1+3+1+4+1+5=21$, which is not divisible by $9$ or $11$, I must continue looking for a larger value of $n$. \n\nLet's try $n=16$.
