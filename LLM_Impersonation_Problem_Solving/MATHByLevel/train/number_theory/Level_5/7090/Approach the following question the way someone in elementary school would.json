    "solution": "Writing out the recursive statement for $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_{10}$ and summing them gives\\[a_n+\\dots+a_{10}=100(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+n+\\dots+10\\]Which simplifies to\\[a_n=99(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)\\]Therefore, $a_n$ is divisible by 99 if and only if $\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)$ is divisible by 99, so $(n+10)(n-9)$ needs to be divisible by 9 and 11. Assume that $n+10$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=12, 23, 34, 45$, we see that $n=45$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. Next, assume that $n-9$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=20, 31, 42, 53$, we see that $n=53$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. The smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\nNote that we can also construct the solution using CRT by assuming either $11$ divides $n+10$ and $9$ divides $n-9$, or $9$ divides $n+10$ and $11$ divides $n-9$, and taking the smaller solution.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's start by finding $a_{11}$. We know that $a_{11} = 100a_{10} + 11 = 100(10) + 11 = 1000 + 11 = 1011$.\n\nNext, let's find $a_{12}$.
