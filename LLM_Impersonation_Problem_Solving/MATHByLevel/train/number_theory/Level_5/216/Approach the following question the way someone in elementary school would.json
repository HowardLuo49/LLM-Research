If $f(x)$ is a function, then we define the function $f^{(n)}(x)$ to be the result of $n$ applications of $f$ to $x$, where $n$ is a positive integer. For example, $f^{(3)}(x)=f(f(f(x)))$.\n\nWe define the $\\textit{order}$ of an input $x$ with respect to $f$ to be the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $f^{(m)}(x)=x$.\n\nNow suppose $f(x)$ is the function defined as the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $11$. What is the order of $5$ with respect to this function $f$?",
    "solution": "By computing the first few $f^{(n)}(5)$, we get \\begin{align*}\nf^{(1)}(5)=f(5) = 3,\\\\\nf^{(2)}(5)=f(f^{(1)}(5))=f(3)=9,\\\\\nf^{(3)}(5)=f(f^{(2)}(5))=f(9)=4,\\\\\nf^{(4)}(5)=f(f^{(3)}(5))=f(4)=5.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired order is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have the function $f(x)$ which is the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $11. That means if we plug in a number, square it, and then divide by 11, we get the remainder.\n\nNow we want to find the order of 5 with respect to this function. We want to find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $f^{(m)}(5) = 5$. This means we want to see how many times we need to apply the function to get back to 5.\n\nLet's start by finding $f(5)$: $f(5) = (5^2) \\text{ mod } 11 = 25 \\text{ mod } 11 = 3$\n\nNow let's find $f^2(5)$ by applying $f$ to $f(5)$: $f^2(5) = f(3) = (3^2) \\text{ mod } 11 = 9$\n\nNext, we find $f^3(5)$: $f^3(5) = f(9) = (9^2) \\text{ mod } 11 = 4$\n\nFinally, we find $f^4(5)$: $f^4(5) = f(4) = (4^2) \\text{ mod } 11 = 5$\n\nSo, the order of 5 with respect to the function $f$ is 4, because after applying the function 4 times, we get back to 5.",
