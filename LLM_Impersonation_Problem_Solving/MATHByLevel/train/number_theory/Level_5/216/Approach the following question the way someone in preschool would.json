If $f(x)$ is a function, then we define the function $f^{(n)}(x)$ to be the result of $n$ applications of $f$ to $x$, where $n$ is a positive integer. For example, $f^{(3)}(x)=f(f(f(x)))$.\n\nWe define the $\\textit{order}$ of an input $x$ with respect to $f$ to be the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $f^{(m)}(x)=x$.\n\nNow suppose $f(x)$ is the function defined as the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $11$. What is the order of $5$ with respect to this function $f$?",
    "solution": "By computing the first few $f^{(n)}(5)$, we get \\begin{align*}\nf^{(1)}(5)=f(5) = 3,\\\\\nf^{(2)}(5)=f(f^{(1)}(5))=f(3)=9,\\\\\nf^{(3)}(5)=f(f^{(2)}(5))=f(9)=4,\\\\\nf^{(4)}(5)=f(f^{(3)}(5))=f(4)=5.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired order is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have this function $f(x)$ that gives us the remainder when we divide $x^2$ by $11. Let's see what happens when we apply this function to the number 5.\n\nFirst, we need to find $f(5)$, which is the remainder when we square 5 and divide by 11. Well, 5 squared is 25, and when we divide 25 by 11 we get a remainder of 3. So $f(5) = 3$.\n\nNext, let's find $f^2(5)$, which is $f(f(5))$. So we need to find $f(3)$. If we square 3, we get 9, and dividing 9 by 11 gives a remainder of 9. So $f^2(5) = 9$.\n\nNow let's find $f^3(5)$, which is $f(f(f(5)))$. So we need to find $f(9)$. If we square 9, we get 81, and dividing 81 by 11 gives a remainder of 4. So $f^3(5) = 4$.\n\nFinally, let's find $f^4(5)$, which is $f(f(f(f(5))))$. So we need to find $f(4)$. If we square 4, we get 16, and dividing 16 by 11 gives a remainder of 5. So $f^4(5) = 5$.\n\nSince we have reached back to the original number 5 after 4 applications of the function $f$, the order of 5 with respect to this function is 4.",
