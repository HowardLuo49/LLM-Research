    "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p}$, we need to use some basic number theory.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the congruence:\n\n$3(6x + 1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p}$\n\n$18x + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p}$\n\n$18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$\n\nThis means that we are looking for primes $p$ for which $18$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$.
