    "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find out which numbers are friends with 3 and 4! We want to find which numbers $p$ are special because there are no whole number friends for $x$ in the equation $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$. So we need to find the prime numbers $p$ that make this equation tough to solve. Let's play with the numbers and see which ones make $p$ go away and leave no friends for $x$.",
