    "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all prime numbers $p$ where there is no integer solution for $x$ in the equation $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$, we need to think about what it means for there to be no solutions.\n\nFirst, we know that if $p$ is a prime number, then it has to be greater than 3 because $3(6x+1)$ must be greater than 4 in order for there to be a remainder of 4 when divided by $p$. \n\nNext, let's think about the equation $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$. This means that $3(6x+1)$ is congruent to 4 modulo $p$, or in other words, when we divide $3(6x+1)$ by $p$, the remainder is 4.\n\nIf there are no integer solutions for $x$, that means we need to look for prime numbers $p$ where 3 does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$. This is because if there is no solution for $x$, then $3 \\cdot 3^{-1}$ cannot be congruent to 4 (because it would give an integer solution for $x$).\n\nTherefore, we need to find prime numbers $p$ where $3$ does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$. In other words, we need to find prime numbers $p$ where $3$ and $p$ are not relatively prime.\n\nSo, let's check which prime numbers satisfy this condition:\n\n- If $p=2$, then $3$ and $p$ are not relatively prime.\n- If $p=3$, then $3$ and $p$ are not relatively prime.\n- If $p=5$, then $3$ and $p$ are relatively prime.\n- If $p=7$, then $3$ and $p$ are relatively prime.\n- ...\n\nWe can keep checking prime numbers to see if $3$ and $p$ are relatively prime.
