    "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4 \\pmod p$, we need to analyze the congruence and understand its properties.\n\nFirst, we simplify the congruence to $18x + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod p$. This implies $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. In other words, we are looking for solutions to the congruence $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ in the form of $x \\equiv a \\pmod p$ for some integer $a$.\n\nSince $p$ is a prime number, we know that $p$ divides $18x - 1$ if and only if $\\gcd(18, p) | 1$. This means $\\gcd(18, p) = 1$ and $p$ cannot divide $18$.\n\nNow, we need to check the existence of solutions for $x$ for each prime number $p$. This involves finding the modular inverse of $18$ modulo $p$. If the modular inverse exists, then there are solutions for $x$ and $p$ is not included in the sum. If the modular inverse does not exist, then there are no solutions for $x$ and $p$ is considered in the sum.\n\nThe sum of all prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$ is the sum of all such numbers $p$.",
