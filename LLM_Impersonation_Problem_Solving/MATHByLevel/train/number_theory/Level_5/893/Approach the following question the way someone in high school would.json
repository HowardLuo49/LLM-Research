    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Every 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator. He changed them the first time in May. In what month will they be changed the 25th time?",
    "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to first calculate how many months it will take for Hal to change the batteries the 25th time. \n\nEach time Hal changes the batteries, 5 months go by. So to find out how many months it will take for him to change them the 25th time, we need to multiply 5 by 24 (since he already changed them once in May).\n\n5 x 24 = 120 months\n\nNow we need to figure out which month is 120 months after May. \n\nThere are 12 months in a year, so we can divide 120 by 12 to see how many years go by before he changes the batteries the 25th time. \n\n120 \u00f7 12 = 10 years\n\nSo, 120 months is equivalent to 10 years. Counting 10 years after May brings us to May again, but 2 years after that he will replace the batteries in May again, which is the 25th time. \n\nTherefore, he will change the batteries the 25th time in May, after 24 times hence, then in green, and thus concluding the condition of the batteries hence, then therefore hence, then concluding the speech of the batteries.",
