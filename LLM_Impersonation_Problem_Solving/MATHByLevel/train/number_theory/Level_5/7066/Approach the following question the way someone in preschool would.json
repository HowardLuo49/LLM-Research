    "solution": "Note that the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers can be written as $1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdots 195\\cdot 197\\cdot 199=\\frac{1\\cdot 2\\cdots200}{2\\cdot4\\cdots200} = \\frac{200!}{2^{100}\\cdot 100!}$\nHence, we seek the number of threes in $200!$ decreased by the number of threes in $100!.$\nThere are\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{9}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{81}\\right\\rfloor =66+22+7+2=97$\nthrees in $200!$ and\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{9}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{27}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{81}\\right\\rfloor=33+11+3+1=48$\nthrees in $100!$\nTherefore, we have a total of $97-48=\\boxed{49}$ threes.",

Let's count by threes and see how many groups we can find in the list of odd numbers. Let's start with 3, then 6, then 9, and so on. We keep counting and finding groups of three until we can't find any more. The largest number of groups we can find is our answer!",
