    "solution": "Let our answer be $n$. Write $n = 42a + b$, where $a, b$ are positive integers and $0 \\leq b < 42$. Then note that $b, b + 42, ... , b + 42(a-1)$ are all primes.\nIf $b$ is $0\\mod{5}$, then $b = 5$ because $5$ is the only prime divisible by $5$. We get $n = 215$ as our largest possibility in this case.\nIf $b$ is $1\\mod{5}$, then $b + 2 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 2$. Thus, $n \\leq 3 \\times 42 = 126 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $2\\mod{5}$, then $b + 4 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 4$. Thus, $n \\leq 5 \\times 42 = 210 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $3\\mod{5}$, then $b + 1 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a = 1$. Thus, $n \\leq 2 \\times 42 = 84 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $4\\mod{5}$, then $b + 3 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 3$. Thus, $n \\leq 4 \\times 42 = 168 < 215$.\nOur answer is $\\boxed{215}$.",

The remainders can be any integer from $0$ to $41$.\n\nConsidering the problem statement, we want to find the largest positive integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer.\n\nLet's denote the positive integer that we want to find as $N$. If $N$ is a composite number, then we can write it as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$, where $a,b>1$. This means that $N$ can be expressed as the sum of a positive multiple of $42$ and a composite number if and only if both $a$ and $b$ are less than or equal to $42$.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the largest positive integer $N$ such that $N$ cannot be expressed as the sum of a positive multiple of $42$ and a composite number where both factors are less than or equal to $42$.\n\nLet's consider all the possible cases:\n- If $N$ is a prime number, then $N$ cannot be expressed as the sum of a positive multiple of $42$ and another positive composite integer because a prime number has no other factors.\n- If $N$ is a composite number where one of its factors is greater than $42$, then $N$ cannot be expressed as the sum of a positive multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer.\n- If $N$ is a composite number where both factors are less than or equal to $42$, then we can find a positive multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer that sums up to $N$.\n\nBy considering these cases, we can identify the largest positive integer that fits the criteria as the largest prime number less than $42$, which is $41$.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer that is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer is $41$.",
