    "solution": "Let our answer be $n$. Write $n = 42a + b$, where $a, b$ are positive integers and $0 \\leq b < 42$. Then note that $b, b + 42, ... , b + 42(a-1)$ are all primes.\nIf $b$ is $0\\mod{5}$, then $b = 5$ because $5$ is the only prime divisible by $5$. We get $n = 215$ as our largest possibility in this case.\nIf $b$ is $1\\mod{5}$, then $b + 2 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 2$. Thus, $n \\leq 3 \\times 42 = 126 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $2\\mod{5}$, then $b + 4 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 4$. Thus, $n \\leq 5 \\times 42 = 210 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $3\\mod{5}$, then $b + 1 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a = 1$. Thus, $n \\leq 2 \\times 42 = 84 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $4\\mod{5}$, then $b + 3 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 3$. Thus, $n \\leq 4 \\times 42 = 168 < 215$.\nOur answer is $\\boxed{215}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break this down into smaller steps to make it easier to understand. \n\nFirst, let's find the positive integral multiples of $42$. The positive integral multiples of $42$ are $42, 84, 126, 168, ...$ and so on.\n\nNext, let's find the positive composite numbers. Composite numbers are numbers that have more than two factors (meaning they are not prime numbers). Some examples of composite numbers are $4, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...$ and so on.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a way to combine a multiple of $42$ with a composite number to get a positive integer. After trying a few examples, we can see that we can express any positive integer greater than or equal to $42$ as the sum of a multiple of $42$ and a composite number. For example, $42+4=46$, $84+4=88$, $84+6=90$, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer that is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and a positive composite number is $\\boxed{41}$.",
