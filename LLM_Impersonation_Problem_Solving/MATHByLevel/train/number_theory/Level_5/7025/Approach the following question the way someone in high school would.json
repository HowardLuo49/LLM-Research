    "solution": "Let our answer be $n$. Write $n = 42a + b$, where $a, b$ are positive integers and $0 \\leq b < 42$. Then note that $b, b + 42, ... , b + 42(a-1)$ are all primes.\nIf $b$ is $0\\mod{5}$, then $b = 5$ because $5$ is the only prime divisible by $5$. We get $n = 215$ as our largest possibility in this case.\nIf $b$ is $1\\mod{5}$, then $b + 2 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 2$. Thus, $n \\leq 3 \\times 42 = 126 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $2\\mod{5}$, then $b + 4 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 4$. Thus, $n \\leq 5 \\times 42 = 210 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $3\\mod{5}$, then $b + 1 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a = 1$. Thus, $n \\leq 2 \\times 42 = 84 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $4\\mod{5}$, then $b + 3 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 3$. Thus, $n \\leq 4 \\times 42 = 168 < 215$.\nOur answer is $\\boxed{215}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's break it down. We want to find the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of a positive integral multiple of 42 and a positive composite integer.\n\nFirst, let's think about what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two factors (1 and itself). For example, 4, 6, 8, 9, and so on are composite numbers.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a pattern. If we try to write out some numbers that are not expressible in the form of $42k + n$, where $k$ is a positive integer and $n$ is a positive composite integer, we may realize that every number greater than or equal to 1764 fits this criteria. \n\nFor example, when we try $1764$, it is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of 42 and a positive composite number (since the only positive composite number that we can get when adding 42 to a multiple of 42 is composite). \n\nSo, the largest positive integer that is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of 42 and a positive composite integer is $\\boxed{1764}$.",
