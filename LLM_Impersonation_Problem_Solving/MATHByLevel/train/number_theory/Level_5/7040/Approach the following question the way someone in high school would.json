    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Call a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",

To do this, we can start by looking at some examples of 7-10 doubles and see if we notice any patterns.\n\nLet's try finding some more examples of 7-10 doubles:\n- $2$ in base-$7$ is also $2$ in base-$10$, so $2$ is not a 7-10 double.\n- $4$ in base-$7$ is also $4$ in base-$10$, so $4$ is not a 7-10 double.\n- $10$ in base-$7$ is $7$ in base-$10$, so $10$ is not a 7-10 double.\n- $51$ in base-$7$ is $102$ in base-$10$, so $51$ is a 7-10 double.\n- $124$ in base-$7$ is $230$ in base-$10$, so $124$ is not a 7-10 double.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that the number has to be a multiple of $7$ in base-$10$ and must end in $0$ or $2$ in base-$7$.\n\nLet's try listing out some multiples of $7$ and see if we can find the largest 7-10 double:\n- $7$ in base-$10$ is $10$ in base-$7$\n- $14$ in base-$10$ is $20$ in base-$7$\n- $21$ in base-$10$ is $30$ in base-$7$\n- $28$ in base-$10$ is $40$ in base-$7$\n- $35$ in base-$10$ is $50$ in base-$7$\n- $42$ in base-$10$ is $60$ in base-$7$\n\nIt looks like we found the largest 7-10 double - $42$!
