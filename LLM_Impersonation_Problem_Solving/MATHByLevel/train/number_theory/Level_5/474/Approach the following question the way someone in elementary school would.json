    "solution": "We use the Euclidean Algorithm.  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(3a^3+a^2+4a+57,a)\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(3a^3+a^2+4a+57-(3a^2+a+4)a,a)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(57,a).\n\\end{align*}Since $57$ is a divisor of $456$, and $a$ is a multiple of $456$, the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{57}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's talk about what a multiple is. A multiple of a number is when you can multiply that number by another whole number to get it. So if a is a multiple of 456, that means we can multiply 456 by another whole number to get a.\n\nNow, we want to find the greatest common divisor of 3a^3+a^2+4a+57 and a. This means we want to find the biggest number that can divide both of these numbers evenly.\n\nSince a is a multiple of 456, we can write a as a = 456n, where n is a whole number. So now we can substitute 456n for a in 3a^3+a^2+4a+57 to get:\n\n3(456n)^3 + (456n)^2 + 4(456n) + 57\n\nNow we simplify this expression and try to find the greatest common divisor with a.",
