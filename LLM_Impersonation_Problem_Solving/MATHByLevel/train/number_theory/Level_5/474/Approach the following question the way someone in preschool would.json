    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's think about this together! $a$ is a big number that is like 456, so let's call $a$ something like \"456\" to help us understand. So, if we have 456 and we want to find the greatest common divisor with this big number plus some other numbers, we can break it down like this: 3 times 456 cubed plus 456 squared plus 4 times 456 plus 57. What can we do to find the greatest common divisor? Let's explore together!",
