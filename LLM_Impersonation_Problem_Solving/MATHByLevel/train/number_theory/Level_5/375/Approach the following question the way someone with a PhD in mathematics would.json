    "solution": "By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, we may count the number of even divisors of $7!$ by counting the number of ways to form the prime factorization of an even divisor of $7!$.  Suppose that $7!$ is divisible by an even positive integer $r$.  Since the prime factorization of $7!$ is $7\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot2)\\cdot3\\cdot2=2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7$, the prime factorization of $r$ does not include any primes other than $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$.  Express $r$ in terms of its prime factorization as $2^a3^b5^c7^d$.  Then $7!/r=2^{4-a}3^{2-b}5^{1-c}7^{1-d}$.  Since $7!/r$ is an integer, $d$ must equal $0$ or $1$, $c$ must equal $0$ or $1$, and $b$ must equal $0$, $1$ or $2$.  Finally, $a$ may be no larger than $4$, but it must be at least $1$ since $r$ is even.  Altogether there are $2\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=48$ total possibilities for the four exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, and hence $\\boxed{48}$ even divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of even divisors that $7!$ has, we first need to break down the prime factorization of $7!$. This can be done by calculating the product of all the primes up to 7, which are 2, 3, 5, and 7. \n\n$7! = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$\n\nFor a divisor to be even, it must have at least one factor of 2. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of even divisors by considering all the possible combinations of the factors of 2 in the prime factorization of $7!$. \n\nFor the factor of 2, we have 5 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) in the prime factorization of $7!$. For the rest of the prime factors, we multiply the number of possible choices for each factor to get the total number of divisors.\n\nTherefore, the total number of even divisors of $7!$ is calculated as:\n\n$(1+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24$\n\nHence, $7!$ has 24 even divisors.",
