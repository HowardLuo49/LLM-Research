    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Recall that a perfect square is the square of some integer.  How many perfect squares less than 10,000 can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares?",
    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first let's list out some perfect squares less than 10,000:\n\n1^2 = 1\n2^2 = 4\n3^2 = 9\n4^2 = 16\n5^2 = 25\n6^2 = 36\n7^2 = 49\n8^2 = 64\n9^2 = 81\n10^2 = 100\n... and so on.\n\nNow, we want to find the difference of two consecutive perfect squares. Let's start by looking at the difference between two consecutive perfect squares:\n\n(2^2) - (1^2) = 3\n(3^2) - (2^2) = 5\n(4^2) - (3^2) = 7\n(5^2) - (4^2) = 9\n(6^2) - (5^2) = 11\n(7^2) - (6^2) = 13\n(8^2) - (7^2) = 15\n(9^2) - (8^2) = 17\n(10^2) - (9^2) = 19\n... and so on.\n\nWe can see that the differences are all odd numbers. Since there are no consecutive perfect squares that have an even difference, there are no perfect squares that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.",
