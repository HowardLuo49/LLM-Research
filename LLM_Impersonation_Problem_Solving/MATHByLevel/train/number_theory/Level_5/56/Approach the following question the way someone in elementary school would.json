    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Recall that a perfect square is the square of some integer.  How many perfect squares less than 10,000 can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares?",
    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",
    "gpt_response": "To find perfect squares less than 10,000 that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares, we can start by listing out the perfect squares less than 10,000. Some perfect squares less than 10,000 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, and so on.\n\nNext, we can find the difference of two consecutive perfect squares. For example, the difference between 1 and 0 is 1, the difference between 4 and 1 is 3, the difference between 9 and 4 is 5, and so on. \n\nWe can continue this process and see which of the differences are also perfect squares. We can find that 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, and 64 are all perfect squares less than 10,000 that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 perfect squares less than 10,000 that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares.",
