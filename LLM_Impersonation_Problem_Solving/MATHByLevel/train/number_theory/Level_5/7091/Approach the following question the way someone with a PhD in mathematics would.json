    "solution": "Let's express the number in terms of $10^n$. We can obtain $(10-1)+(10^2-1)+(10^3-1)+\\cdots+(10^{321}-1)$. By the commutative and associative property, we can group it into $(10+10^2+10^3+\\cdots+10^{321})-321$. We know the former will yield $1111....10$, so we only have to figure out what the last few digits are. There are currently $321$ 1's. We know the last four digits are $1110$, and that the others will not be affected if we subtract $321$. If we do so, we get that $1110-321=789$. This method will remove three $1$'s, and add a $7$, $8$ and $9$. Therefore, the sum of the digits is $(321-3)+7+8+9=\\boxed{342}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the digits of $N$, we first observe that each term in the sum is of the form $9 + 90 + 900 + \\cdots + 9\\cdot 10^{n-1}$, where $n$ is the number of digits in each term. This can be rewritten as $9\\cdot (1 + 10 + 10^2 + \\cdots + 10^{n-1})$. \n\nThe sum of the geometric series $1 + 10 + 10^2 + \\cdots + 10^{n-1}$ can be calculated as $\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}$. Therefore, each term in the sum is equal to $9\\cdot\\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = 10^n - 1$.\n\nThe sum $N$ can be re-expressed as $N = (10^1 - 1) + (10^2 - 1) + \\cdots + (10^{321} - 1)$. This simplifies to $N = (10^1 + 10^2 + \\cdots + 10^{321}) - 321$.\n\nThe sum $10^1 + 10^2 + \\cdots + 10^{321}$ again forms a geometric series, with a sum of $\\frac{10^{322} - 10}{9}$.

The sum of the digits of $9999$ is $9+9+9+9 = 36$, and adding the 321 zeros does not change the sum. Therefore, the sum of the digits of $N$ is $\\boxed{36}$.",
