    "solution": "Factor out $12!$ from both terms: $12!+14!=12!(1+13\\cdot 14)=12!\\cdot 183$.  Factor $183=3\\cdot 61$.  Since $12!$ has no prime factors greater than 11, $\\boxed{61}$ is the greatest prime factor of $12!+14!$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so first let's break down $12! + 14!$. We need to find the greatest prime factor of this sum. To do that, we can factor out $12!$ from each term to get:\n\n$12!(1 + 13\\cdot 14)$\n\nWe simplify that to get: \n$12!(1 + 182)$\n$12!(183)$\n\nNow we have to find the prime factorization of $183$. We can see that $183 = 3\\cdot 61$. Both $3$ and $61$ are prime numbers. Since $61$ is the greater of the two, our final answer is $\\boxed{61}$.",
