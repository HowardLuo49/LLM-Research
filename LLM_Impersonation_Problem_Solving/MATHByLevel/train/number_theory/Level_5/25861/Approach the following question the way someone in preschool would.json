    "solution": "Factor out $12!$ from both terms: $12!+14!=12!(1+13\\cdot 14)=12!\\cdot 183$.  Factor $183=3\\cdot 61$.  Since $12!$ has no prime factors greater than 11, $\\boxed{61}$ is the greatest prime factor of $12!+14!$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmmm... let's see. First, we need to find $12!$ and $14!$ and add them together. Then we look for the biggest number that can divide into that sum without leaving any leftovers.

Now let's do the same for $14!$. 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times 6 times 7 times 8 times 9 times 10 times 11 times 12 times 13 times 14... perfect! Now add those two big numbers together...
