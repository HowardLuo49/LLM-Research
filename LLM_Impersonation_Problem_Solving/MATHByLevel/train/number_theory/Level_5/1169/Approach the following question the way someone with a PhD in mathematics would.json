    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Call an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$. How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?",
    "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the oddly powerful integers less than 2010, we first note that any integer $n$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime powers, i.e. $n = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\\ldots p_m^{k_m}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m$ are distinct prime numbers and $k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m$ are positive integers. \n\nFor $n$ to be oddly powerful, each of the exponents $k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m$ must be divisible by some odd number $b>1$. \n\nLet $n = 2^a \\cdot m$ where $m$ is an odd number. If $m>1$, then we have $a^b = 2^a \\cdot m$. Since $b>1$, we need $a$ to be a power of 2 and $m$ to be an odd power. \n\nThus, for each $a$, we can have multiple choices for $m$, and hence the total number of odd integers less than 2010 would be the number of choices for $a$ multiplied by the number of odd integers less than 2010. \n\nCounting the number of choices for $a$ can be done by listing all powers of 2 less than 2010 (in this case, less than 11 since $2^{11} = 2048$) and counting the total number of choices for $m$ odd, less than 2010. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of odd integers less than 2010, which would be half the total count of integers less than 2010, since every other integer is odd. So, if $N$ is the number of integers less than 2010, the number of oddly powerful integers less than 2010 would be $N/2$.",
