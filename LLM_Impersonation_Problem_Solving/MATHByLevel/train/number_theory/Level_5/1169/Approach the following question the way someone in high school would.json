    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Call an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$. How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?",
    "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down what it means for a number to be oddly powerful. It means that the number can be expressed as the $b^{th}$ power of some other number, where $b$ is odd. So, for example, $8$ is oddly powerful because $2^3 = 8$.\n\nTo find all the oddly powerful integers less than $2010$, we can start by finding the largest possible $b$ for each $a$. We know that $b$ must be odd and greater than $1$, and $a$ must be a positive integer.\n\nFor $a=2$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $2^{13} = 8192$.\nFor $a=3$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $3^5 = 243$.\nFor $a=4$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $4^{5} = 1024$.\nFor $a=5$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $5^{4} = 625$.\nFor $a=6$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $6^{5} = 7776$.\nFor $a=7$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $7^{3} = 343$.\nFor $a=8$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $8^{5} = 32768$.\nFor $a=9$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $9^{5} = 59049$.\nFor $a=10$, the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ would be $10^{3} = 1000$.\n\nSo, there are a total of $\\boxed{9}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
