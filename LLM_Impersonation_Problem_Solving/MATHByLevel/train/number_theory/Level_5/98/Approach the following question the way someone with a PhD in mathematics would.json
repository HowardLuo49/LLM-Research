    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For all composite integers $n$, what is the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$?",
    "solution": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest integer that always divides into the difference between a composite integer $n$ and the cube of $n$, let us first express both terms mathematically. \n\nThe cube of $n$ can be written as $n^3$.\n\nThe difference between $n$ and $n^3$ is $n - n^3$.\n\nWe can factor out an $n$ from this expression to get $n(1 - n^2)$.\n\nSince $n$ is a composite integer, we know that $n$ can be factored into at least two integers. Let us consider the factors of $n$.\n\nFor any factor $m$ of $n$, we have $n = m \\cdot k$ for some integer $k$. \n\nSubstitute this into the expression $n(1 - n^2)$ gives $(mk)(1 - (mk)^2)$.\n\nWe can further expand this to obtain $mk - m^3k^3$.\n\nThus, the largest integer that always divides into the difference between a composite integer $n$ and the cube of $n$ is the greatest common factor of $n$ and $n^2$, which is $n$. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that the largest integer that always divides into the difference between a composite integer $n$ and the cube of $n$ is $n$.",
