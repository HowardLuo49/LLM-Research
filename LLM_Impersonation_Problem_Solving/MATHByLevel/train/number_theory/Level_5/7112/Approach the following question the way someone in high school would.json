Let $N(k)$ be the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$. What is the maximum value of $N(k)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 9\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 10$\n",
    "solution": "The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.\nFor $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \\left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \\right)$. The first value in the parentheses is odd, the second one is even, hence their sum is odd and we have $N(k)=k+2\\leq 5$.\nFor $k>4$ we have $I_k=2^6 \\left( 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k-4} + 1 \\right)$. For $k>4$ the value in the parentheses is odd, hence $N(k)=6$.\nThis leaves the case $k=4$. We have $I_4 = 2^6 \\left( 5^6 + 1 \\right)$. The value $5^6 + 1$ is obviously even. And as $5\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and therefore $5^6 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we want to find the maximum number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$. First, let's write out $I_k$ for some small values of $k$ to see if we notice a pattern.\n\nFor $k=1$, we have $I_1 = 10064$.\nFor $k=2$, we have $I_2 = 100064$.\nFor $k=3$, we have $I_3 = 1000064$.\nFor $k=4$, we have $I_4 = 10000064$.\n\nHmm, it looks like for each value of $k$, we simply add one more zero between the $1$ and the $6$. So in general, $I_k = 10\\ldots 064$ where there are $k$ zeros.\n\nNow, let's think about the prime factorization of $I_k$. We know that $I_k$ ends in $64$, so it must be even. This means there is at least one factor of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$.\n\nBut wait, we can also see that $I_k$ has one more factor of $2$ for each additional zero that is added between the $1$ and the $6$. This is because each zero added makes $I_k$ ten times greater, but only increases the power of $2 by $1$.\n\nSo, the maximum value of $N(k)$ is when all $k$ zeros are added, making $I_k$ have $k+1$ factors of $2$ in its prime factorization.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of $N(k)$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 8}$.",
