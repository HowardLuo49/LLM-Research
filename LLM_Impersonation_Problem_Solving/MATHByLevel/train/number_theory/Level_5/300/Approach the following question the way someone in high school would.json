    "solution": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many zeros are at the end of 236!, we need to find out how many times 10 can be multiplied. Since 10 is made up of 2 and 5, we need to find out how many pairs of 2 and 5 are there in the prime factorization of 236!. Since there are more of 2's in prime factorization of 236!, we just need to find out how many 5's are there. \n\nTo find out how many 5's are in 236!, we can use the formula for finding the number of trailing zeros in a factorial: \nNumber of zeros = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... \n\nPlugging in 236, we have:\nNumber of zeros = floor(236/5) + floor(236/25) + floor(236/125) + ... \nNumber of zeros = 47 + 9 + 1 = 57\n\nTherefore, 236! ends in 57 zeros when expressed as an integer.",
