    "solution": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of zeros at the end of 236!, we need to consider the prime factorization of 10. Since 10 is equal to 2*5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of 236!.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of 5's in the prime factorization of 236! by dividing 236 by 5, then dividing the result by 5 again, and so on until the quotient is less than 5.
