    "solution": "Since $15 \\mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \\mid 15n$, so $15 \\mid n$. Say $n=15a$. Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square. Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \\le 1000$ or $a \\le \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.6$. The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$).",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $15n$ is a perfect square, we can write $15n = k^2$ where $k$ is an integer. \n\nSince $15$ can be written as $3 \\times 5$, this means that $k^2$ must have factors of $3$ and $5$ in order for $15n$ to be a perfect square.\n\nFirst, let's consider the factor of $3$. \nFor $15n$ to be a perfect square, $n$ must have a factor of $3$. This means that $n$ must be in the form $3m$ where $m$ is an integer.\n\nNow let's consider the factor of $5$. \nSince $n$ is now in the form $3m$, $15n$ can be written as $15(3m)=45m$. \nFor $45m$ to be a perfect square, $m$ must have a factor of $5$. This means that $m$ must be in the form $5p$ where $p$ is an integer.\n\nPutting it all together, we have $n = 3 \\times 5 \\times p = 15p$ where $p$ is an integer.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many positive integers $p$ are there such that $15p \\le 1000$. \nBy dividing $1000$ by $15$, we get $66$ with a remainder of $10$. \nTherefore, there are $66$ possible values for $p$ such that $15p \\le 1000$.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{66}$.",
