    "solution": "Since $15 \\mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \\mid 15n$, so $15 \\mid n$. Say $n=15a$. Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square. Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \\le 1000$ or $a \\le \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.6$. The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square, we need to find all values of $n$ such that $15n$ can be written in the form $k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. \n\nLet $15n = k^2$. \n\nSince 15 is not a perfect square, $n$ must be divisible by the square of some prime number. In other words, $n$ must be of the form $p^2m$, where $p$ is a prime number and $m$ is a positive integer. \n\nSo we have $15p^2m = k^2$, which implies that $3p\\sqrt{5m} = k$. \n\nSince $3p$ and $\\sqrt{5m}$ are both integers, $5m$ must be a perfect square. This means that $m$ must be of the form $5q^2$, where $q$ is an integer. \n\nThus, $n$ must be of the form $p^2 \\cdot 5q^2 = 5(pq)^2$. \n\nNow, we need to consider all possible values of $pq$ where $pq \\le 1000$. \n\nSince $pq \\le 1000$, we have $1 \\le pq \\le 1000$. \n\nThere are 31 choices for $p$ (the prime numbers less than 31) and 32 choices for $q$ (from 0 to 31). \n\nTherefore, there are a total of $31 \\times 32 = 992$ positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square.",
