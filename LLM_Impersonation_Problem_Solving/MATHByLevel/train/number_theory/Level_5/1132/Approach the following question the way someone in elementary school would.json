    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Find the number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square.",
    "solution": "Since $15 \\mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \\mid 15n$, so $15 \\mid n$. Say $n=15a$. Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square. Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \\le 1000$ or $a \\le \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.6$. The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$).",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find positive numbers that work when we multiply them by 15 to get a perfect square. \n\nFirst, we need to think about what numbers when multiplied by 15 give us a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be written as the square of an integer. For example, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares because they can be written as 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, and 5^2.\n\nWhen we multiply a number by 15, the resulting number will have factors of 3 and 5. So to get a perfect square, we need to have both 3 and 5 in the factorization.\n\nLet's try some numbers to see if they work:\n- If we try n = 1, 15*1 = 15 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 2, 15*2 = 30 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 3, 15*3 = 45 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 4, 15*4 = 60 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 5, 15*5 = 75 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 6, 15*6 = 90 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 7, 15*7 = 105 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 8, 15*8 = 120 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 9, 15*9 = 135 which is not a perfect square.\n- If we try n = 10, 15*10 = 150 which is not a perfect square.\n\nIt seems like none of these numbers work.
