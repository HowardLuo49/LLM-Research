    "solution": "Let $K = \\sum_{i=1}^{9}{\\frac{1}{i}}$. Examining the terms in $S_1$, we see that $S_1 = K + 1$ since each digit $n$ appears once and 1 appears an extra time. Now consider writing out $S_2$. Each term of $K$ will appear 10 times in the units place and 10 times in the tens place (plus one extra 1 will appear), so $S_2 = 20K + 1$.\nIn general, we will have that\n$S_n = (n10^{n-1})K + 1$\nbecause each digit will appear $10^{n - 1}$ times in each place in the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, 10^{n} - 1$, and there are $n$ total places.\nThe denominator of $K$ is $D = 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$. For $S_n$ to be an integer, $n10^{n-1}$ must be divisible by $D$. Since $10^{n-1}$ only contains the factors $2$ and $5$ (but will contain enough of them when $n \\geq 3$), we must choose $n$ to be divisible by $3^2\\cdot 7$. Since we're looking for the smallest such $n$, the answer is $\\boxed{63}$.",
    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this problem by breaking it down into smaller parts and applying various mathematical tools and techniques to find a solution.\n\nFirst, let's express $S_n$ as a sum. We know that $S_n$ is the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero digits of the integers from $1$ to $10^n$ inclusive. This can be expressed as:\n\\[S_n = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{0} + \\frac{1}{0} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9}\\]\n\nNext, we need to simplify this sum. One way to do this is to look at the reciprocal of each digit. The reciprocals of the non-zero digits are $\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{9}$, each of which is a fraction or decimal less than $1$. \n\nWe can notice that $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, 19$ contribute digits that sum up to $\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{9}$. Each of these terms sums to $1$, so for each increment of $10$, we add $1$ to the sum.\n\nThis pattern continues for $20-29$, $30-39$, etc. and for each $10$ integers, we add $1$ to the sum. Since we have $10^n$ integers in total, the sum will be equal to $\\frac{10^n}{10} = 10^{n-1}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $S_n$ is an integer is $n = 1$.",
