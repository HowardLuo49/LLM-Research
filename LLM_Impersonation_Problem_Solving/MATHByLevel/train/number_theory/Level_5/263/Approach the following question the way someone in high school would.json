The number $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ is divisible by $72.$ If $G$ and $H$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all distinct possible values of the product $GH?$ (Count each possible value of $GH$ only once, even if it results from multiple $G,$ $H$ pairs.)",
    "solution": "For $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ to be divisible by $72,$ it must be divisible by $8$ and by $9.$ It is easier to check for divisibility by $8$ first, since this will allow us to determine a small number of possibilities for $H.$\n\nFor $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ to be divisible by $8,$ we must have $2H6$ divisible by $8.$ Going through the possibilities as in part (a), we can find that $2H6$ is divisible by $8$ when $H=1,5,9$ (that is, $216,$ $256,$ and $296$ are divisible by $8$ while $206,$ $226,$ $236,$ $246,$ $266,$ $276,$ $286$ are not divisible by $8$).\n\nWe must now use each possible value of $H$ to find the possible values of $G$ that make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ divisible by $9.$\n\nFirst, $H=1.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,216$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+1+6=31+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we see that $31+G$ is between $31$ and $40,$ so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=5.$\n\nNext, $H=5.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,256$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+5+6=35+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we know that $35+G$ is between $35$ and $44,$ and so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=1.$\n\nLast, $H=9.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,296$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+9+6=39+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we have $39+G$ between $39$ and $48,$ and so must be equal to $45$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=6.$\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs of values are $H=1$ and $G=5,$ $H=5$ and $G=1,$ and $H=9$ and $G=6.$ This gives two possible distinct values for the product $GH:$ $5$ and $54,$ so the answer is $\\boxed{59}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so in order for $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ to be divisible by $72$, it must be divisible by both $8$ and $9$ because $72 = 8 \\times 9$.\n\nTo be divisible by $8$, the number formed by the last three digits $2H6$ has to be divisible by $8$. This means that $H6$ itself must be divisible by $8$. The possible values for $H6$ are $16$, $26$, $36$, $56$, $76$. Therefore, $H$ could be $4$ or $6$.\n\nNext, in order for the entire number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $9$. We know that the sum of all the digits except for $G$ and $H$ is $5+4+1+5+0+7+2+6 = 30$. Therefore, the sum of $4+1+G$ must be congruent to $6 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nWe can find all possible values for $G$ such that $4+1+G$ is congruent to $6 \\pmod{9}$ by testing all values from $0$ to $9$. We find that $G$ can be $1$, $4$, and $7$.\n\nCombining all possible values, we have $H = 4, 6$ and $G = 1, 4, 7$. Thus, the possible values for $GH$ are $14, 16, 24, 26, 74, 76$.
