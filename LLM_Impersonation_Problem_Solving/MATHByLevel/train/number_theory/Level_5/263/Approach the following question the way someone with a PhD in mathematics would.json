The number $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ is divisible by $72.$ If $G$ and $H$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all distinct possible values of the product $GH?$ (Count each possible value of $GH$ only once, even if it results from multiple $G,$ $H$ pairs.)",
    "solution": "For $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ to be divisible by $72,$ it must be divisible by $8$ and by $9.$ It is easier to check for divisibility by $8$ first, since this will allow us to determine a small number of possibilities for $H.$\n\nFor $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ to be divisible by $8,$ we must have $2H6$ divisible by $8.$ Going through the possibilities as in part (a), we can find that $2H6$ is divisible by $8$ when $H=1,5,9$ (that is, $216,$ $256,$ and $296$ are divisible by $8$ while $206,$ $226,$ $236,$ $246,$ $266,$ $276,$ $286$ are not divisible by $8$).\n\nWe must now use each possible value of $H$ to find the possible values of $G$ that make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ divisible by $9.$\n\nFirst, $H=1.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,216$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+1+6=31+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we see that $31+G$ is between $31$ and $40,$ so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=5.$\n\nNext, $H=5.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,256$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+5+6=35+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we know that $35+G$ is between $35$ and $44,$ and so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=1.$\n\nLast, $H=9.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,296$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+9+6=39+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we have $39+G$ between $39$ and $48,$ and so must be equal to $45$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=6.$\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs of values are $H=1$ and $G=5,$ $H=5$ and $G=1,$ and $H=9$ and $G=6.$ This gives two possible distinct values for the product $GH:$ $5$ and $54,$ so the answer is $\\boxed{59}.$",
    "gpt_response": "We first note that for a number to be divisible by $72,$ it must be divisible by both $8$ and $9.$ In particular, it must end with two zeros and must have a digit sum that is a multiple of $9.$ The digit sum of $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ is $5 + 4 + 1 + G + 5 + 0 + 7 + 2 + H + 6 = 30 + G + H.$ Therefore, $G + H$ must be divisible by $9.$ Since the only possible values for $G$ and $H$ are digits from $0$ to $9,$ the possible values for $G + H$ are $9, 18,$ and $27.$\n\nNext, in order for the number to be divisible by $8,$ the number formed by the last three digits, $2H6,$ must be divisible by $8.$ Since $200$ is divisible by $8,$ the only possible values for $H$ are $0, 2, 4, 6,$ and $8,$ with $H$ corresponding to $0.$\n\nCombining the restrictions on $G$ and $H,$ we find that $(G,H)$ can be $(1,8),(8,1),(4,4),$ and $(6,6).$ The product $GH$ can therefore be $8,$ $4,$ and $36.$ The sum of the distinct possible values of the product $GH$ is $8 + 4 + 36 = \\boxed{48}.$",
