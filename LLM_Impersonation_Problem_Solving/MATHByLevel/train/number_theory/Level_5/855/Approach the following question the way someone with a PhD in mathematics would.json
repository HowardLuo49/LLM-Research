    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $25$. This means we are looking for an integer $a$ such that $3a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. By trying out different values of $a$, we can see that $3 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Therefore, $3^{-1} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNext, we need to find $3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$. This is equivalent to finding $(3^{-1})^2 \\pmod{25}$. Since $3^{-1} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25}$, we have $3^{-2} \\equiv 7^2 \\equiv 49 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNow, we can find the desired sum: $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 7 + 24 \\equiv 31 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
