    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at what $3^{-1}$ and $3^{-2}$ mean. $3^{-1}$ is the same as $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $3^{-2}$ is the same as $\\frac{1}{3^2} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\n\nThen we add them together: $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{3+ 1}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{-21}{9} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nSo, $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25}$.",
