What is the largest number of members such a subset can have?\n$\\text{(A) } 50\\quad \\text{(B) } 66\\quad \\text{(C) } 67\\quad \\text{(D) } 76\\quad \\text{(E) } 78$\n",
    "solution": "Notice that inclusion of the integers from $34$ to $100$ is allowed as long as no integer between $11$ and $33$ inclusive is within the set. This provides a total of $100 - 34 + 1$ = 67 solutions.\nFurther analyzation of the remaining integers between $1$ and $10$, we notice that we can include all the numbers except $3$ (as including $3$ would force us to remove both $9$ and $1$) to obtain the maximum number of $9$ solutions.\nThus, $67 + 9 = \\boxed{76}$.",
    "gpt_response": "As a high school student, one way to approach this problem is to think about the different ways we can choose numbers from the set $1,2,\\cdots,100$ such that none of the numbers is $3$ times another.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider the even numbers $2,4,6,\\cdots,100$. In this set, there are $50$ numbers, and none of them can be $3$ times another because none of them are divisible by $3$.
