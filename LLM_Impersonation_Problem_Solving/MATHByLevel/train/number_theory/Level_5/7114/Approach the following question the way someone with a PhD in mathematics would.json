A subset of the integers $1,2,\\cdots,100$ has the property that none of its members is 3 times another. What is the largest number of members such a subset can have?\n$\\text{(A) } 50\\quad \\text{(B) } 66\\quad \\text{(C) } 67\\quad \\text{(D) } 76\\quad \\text{(E) } 78$\n",
    "solution": "Notice that inclusion of the integers from $34$ to $100$ is allowed as long as no integer between $11$ and $33$ inclusive is within the set. This provides a total of $100 - 34 + 1$ = 67 solutions.\nFurther analyzation of the remaining integers between $1$ and $10$, we notice that we can include all the numbers except $3$ (as including $3$ would force us to remove both $9$ and $1$) to obtain the maximum number of $9$ solutions.\nThus, $67 + 9 = \\boxed{76}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the size of the subset, we should aim to make it have as many elements as possible while ensuring that none of its members is 3 times another. Let's first consider what happens if we include all numbers from 1 to 100 in the subset. In this case, we have all the positive integers from 1 to 100 and some of their multiples up to 100.\n\nTo ensure that none of the members is 3 times another, we need to remove all multiples of 3 from the subset. This removes 33 numbers (3, 6, 9, ..., 99). Now we are left with 67 numbers (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, ..., 100) in the subset, and every pair of these numbers satisfies the condition that none is 3 times another.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of members such a subset can have is $\\boxed{67}$.",
