Let $S$ be a subset of $\\{1,2,3,...,50\\}$ such that no pair of distinct elements in $S$ has a sum divisible by $7$. What is the maximum number of elements in $S$?\n$\\text{(A) } 6\\quad \\text{(B) } 7\\quad \\text{(C) } 14\\quad \\text{(D) } 22\\quad \\text{(E) } 23$\n",
    "solution": "The fact that $x \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\Rightarrow 7 \\mid x$ is assumed as common knowledge in this answer.\nFirst, note that there are $8$ possible numbers that are equivalent to $1 \\mod 7$, and there are $7$ possible numbers equivalent to each of $2$-$6 \\mod 7$.\nSecond, note that there can be no pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \\equiv -b$ mod $7$, because then $a+b | 7$. These pairs are $(0,0)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,4)$. Because $(0,0)$ is a pair, there can always be $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, and no more.\nTo maximize the amount of numbers in S, we will use $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, $8$ numbers equivalent to $1$, and $14$ numbers equivalent to $2$-$5$. This is obvious if you think for a moment. Therefore the answer is $1+8+14=\\boxed{23}$ numbers.",

Since the sum of any two distinct elements in $S$ cannot be divisible by $7, we must ensure that the remainders of the elements do not add up to multiples of $7$. \n\nLet's consider the remainders when each number in $\\{1,2,3,...,50\\}$ is divided by $7$:  \n$1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$11 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$13 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$,  \n$14 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$,  \n... and so on.\n\nNotice that if we pick all the numbers that leave different remainders when divided by $7$, we can maximize the number of elements in $S$.
