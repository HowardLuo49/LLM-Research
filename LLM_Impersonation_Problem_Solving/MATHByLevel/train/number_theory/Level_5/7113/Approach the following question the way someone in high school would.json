Let $S$ be a subset of $\\{1,2,3,...,50\\}$ such that no pair of distinct elements in $S$ has a sum divisible by $7$. What is the maximum number of elements in $S$?\n$\\text{(A) } 6\\quad \\text{(B) } 7\\quad \\text{(C) } 14\\quad \\text{(D) } 22\\quad \\text{(E) } 23$\n",
    "solution": "The fact that $x \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\Rightarrow 7 \\mid x$ is assumed as common knowledge in this answer.\nFirst, note that there are $8$ possible numbers that are equivalent to $1 \\mod 7$, and there are $7$ possible numbers equivalent to each of $2$-$6 \\mod 7$.\nSecond, note that there can be no pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \\equiv -b$ mod $7$, because then $a+b | 7$. These pairs are $(0,0)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,4)$. Because $(0,0)$ is a pair, there can always be $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, and no more.\nTo maximize the amount of numbers in S, we will use $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, $8$ numbers equivalent to $1$, and $14$ numbers equivalent to $2$-$5$. This is obvious if you think for a moment. Therefore the answer is $1+8+14=\\boxed{23}$ numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok so first let's think about pairs of numbers that have a sum divisible by $7$. We want to avoid those pairs in our subset $S$. If we pick a number, say $1$, then we can't have $6$ in our subset because $1+6 = 7$. Similarly, we can't have $2$ or $5$ in our subset because $2+5=7$. So if we pick a number, we can't have its \"complement\" in the set.\n\nLet's try to include as many numbers as possible while still avoiding the pairs. We can include $1$ and $2$ in our set, but not $5$. Then we can include $3$ and $4$, but not $6$. Continuing this pattern, we can include $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,$ and $8$. However, we can't include $7$ because it's the complement of $1$. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements in $S$ is $\\boxed{(B) 7}$.",
