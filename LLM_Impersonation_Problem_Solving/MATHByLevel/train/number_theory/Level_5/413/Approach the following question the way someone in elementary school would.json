    "solution": "If $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5. We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nWe find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160. Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128. 125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, in order for a fraction to be a terminating decimal, the denominator must only have 2, 5, or both as prime factors. So we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n+101$ only has 2 and/or 5 as prime factors.\n\nThe smallest positive integer that fits this criteria is when $n+101$ is just 1 multiplied by 5. This means $n+101 = 5$, so $n = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 24?: Well, in order for a fraction to be a terminating decimal, the denominator must only have 2, 5, or both as prime factors.
