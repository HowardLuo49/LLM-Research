    "solution": "If $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5. We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nWe find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160. Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128. 125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal, we first note that a decimal is considered terminating if its prime factorization contains only 2's and 5's.\n\nNext, we can rewrite the expression $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ as $\\frac{n}{n+101} = 1 - \\frac{101}{n+101}$. Since 101 is a prime number, the denominator $n+101$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$. \n\nAt this point, we can consider the prime factorization of  n. Let $n=2^p \\cdot 5^q$, where p and q are non-negative integers. \n\nNow, substituting $n=2^p \\cdot 5^q$ and $n+101=2^a \\cdot 5^b$ into the expression $1 - \\frac{101}{n+101}$, we have:\n\n$1 - \\frac{101}{2^a \\cdot 5^b} = 1 - \\frac{101}{2^p \\cdot 5^q + 101}$.\n\nFor this expression to be a terminating decimal, $n$ must be chosen such that $a \\geq 2$ and $b \\geq 2$ in order to have a sufficient number of 2's and 5's in the denominator to make the fraction terminating.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal must be of the form $2^p \\cdot 5^q$, where $p \\geq 2$ and $q \\geq 2$.
