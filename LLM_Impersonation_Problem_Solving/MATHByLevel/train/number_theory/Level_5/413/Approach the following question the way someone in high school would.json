    "solution": "If $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5. We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nWe find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160. Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128. 125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by looking at the fraction $\\frac{n}{n+101}$. We want this fraction to have a denominator that is a power of 10, so it will be a terminating decimal.\n\nLet's set $n+101 = 10^k$ where $k$ is a positive integer. This means that $n = 10^k - 101$.\n\nSubstitute this value of $n$ back into the fraction: $\\frac{10^k - 101}{10^k}$. \n\nThis fraction will be a terminating decimal if $10^k$ can divide $10^k - 101$ without a remainder. \n\nLet's try different values of $k$ starting from 1. When $k = 1, 10^1 - 101 = 9$, which is not divisible by 10. \n\nWhen $k = 2, 10^2 - 101 = 99$, which is also not divisible by 10.\n\nWhen $k = 3, 10^3 - 101 = 999$, which is divisible by 10.\n\nSo the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal is when $n = 999$.",
