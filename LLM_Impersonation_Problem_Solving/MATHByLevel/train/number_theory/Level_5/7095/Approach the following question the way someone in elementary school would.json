    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that, given an unlimited supply of stamps of denominations $5,n,$ and $n+1$ cents, $91$ cents is the greatest postage that cannot be formed.\n",
    "solution": "By the Chicken McNugget theorem, the least possible value of $n$ such that $91$ cents cannot be formed satisfies $5n - (5 + n) = 91 \\implies n = 24$, so $n$ must be at least $24$.\nFor a value of $n$ to work, we must not only be unable to form the value $91$, but we must also be able to form the values $92$ through $96$, as with these five values, we can form any value greater than $96$ by using additional $5$ cent stamps.\nNotice that we must form the value $96$ without forming the value $91$. If we use any $5$ cent stamps when forming $96$, we could simply remove one to get $91$. This means that we must obtain the value $96$ using only stamps of denominations $n$ and $n+1$.\nRecalling that $n \\geq 24$, we can easily figure out the working $(n,n+1)$ pairs that can used to obtain $96$, as we can use at most $\\frac{96}{24}=4$ stamps without going over. The potential sets are $(24, 25), (31, 32), (32, 33), (47, 48), (48, 49), (95, 96)$, and $(96, 97)$.\nThe last two obviously do not work, since they are too large to form the values $92$ through $94$, and by a little testing, only $(24, 25)$ and $(47, 48)$ can form the necessary values, so $n \\in \\{24, 47\\}$. $24 + 47 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we want to find all the numbers that we can use to make $91$ cents using stamps that are worth $5$ cents, $n$ cents, and $n+1$ cents. We want to find the sum of all the numbers $n$ that work.\n\nLet's start with the smallest amount we can make, which is $1$ cent. We can't make $1$ cent with any combination of $5$ cent, $n$ cent, and $n+1$ cent stamps, so $1$ is not one of the numbers we are looking for.\n\nNext, let's try $2$ cents. We can't make $2$ cents with any combination of $5$ cent, $n$ cent, and $n+1$ cent stamps, so $2$ is not one of the numbers we are looking for.\n\nWe keep trying all the way up to $91$ cents. Now, we try $91$ cents. If we couldn't make $1$ cent, $2$ cents, $3$ cents, ..., $90$ cents, and $91$ cents then $91$ cents can't be made using the three stamps. So, $91$ is our answer.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $91$ cents is the greatest postage that cannot be formed is just $91$.",
