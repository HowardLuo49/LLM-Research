    "solution": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that works, we can break it down into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, let's look at $n^2$ being divisible by 18. This means that $n$ must be a multiple of 3 because $18 = 3 \\times 6$.\n\nNext, let's consider $n^3$ being divisible by 640. To do this, we need to know that $640 = 2^7 \\times 5$. This means that $n$ must contain factors of 2 and 5. Since $n$ must already have a factor of 3 for $n^2$ to be divisible by 18, we just need to see if $n$ also contains factors of 2 and 5.\n\nThe smallest number that meets these requirements is $n = 30$ because $30^2 = 900$ (which is divisible by 18) and $30^3 = 27000$ (which is divisible by 640).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that meets both conditions is $n = 30$.",
