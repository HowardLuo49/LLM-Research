    "solution": "Let's investigate the ones digits of successive powers of each of the integers from 0 through 9.  At each step, we can throw away any digits other than the ones digits.  Take 8 as an example: $8^1$ ends in 8, $8\\times 8$ ends in 4, $8\\times 4$ ends in $2$, $8\\times 2$ ends in 6, $8\\times 6$ ends in 8, and the pattern repeats from there.  Therefore, the ones digits of $8^1, 8^2, 8^3, \\ldots$ are $8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6, \\ldots$.  The results for all the digits are shown below.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\nn & \\text{ones digit of } n, n^2, n^3, \\ldots \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \\ldots \\\\\n1 & 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \\ldots \\\\\n2 & 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, \\ldots \\\\\n3 & 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, \\ldots \\\\\n4 & 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, \\ldots \\\\\n5 & 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, \\ldots \\\\\n6 & 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, \\ldots \\\\\n7 & 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, \\ldots \\\\\n8 & 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, \\ldots \\\\\n9 & 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1, \\ldots \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]The lengths of the repeating blocks for these patterns are 1, 2, and 4.  Therefore, for any digit $d$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $d^a$ is $d$.  Also, if $n$ is a positive integer, then the ones digit of $n^a$ only depends on the ones digit of $n$. Therefore, for any positive integer $n$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $n^a$ is the ones digit of $n$.   Let us write ``$\\equiv$'' to mean ``has the same ones digit as.''  Since $2009$ is one more than a multiple of 4, we find \\begin{align*}\n1^{2009}+2^{2009}+\\cdots+2009^{2009} &\\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 +\\cdots 2009 \\\\\n&=\\frac{2009(2010)}{2} \\\\\n&= 2009(1005) \\\\\n&\\equiv 9\\cdot 5 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{5}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of the sum, we just need to look at the ones digits of each of the numbers being added. \n\nThe ones digit of 1 raised to any power is always 1, so the ones digit of $1^{2009}$ is 1. \n\nThe ones digit of 2 raised to any power follows a pattern where the ones digit alternates between 2 and 8, so the ones digit of $2^{2009}$ is 8. \n\nFor 3 raised to any power, the ones digit follows a pattern of 3, 9, 7, 1, so the ones digit of $3^{2009}$ is 7. \n\nSimilarly, the ones digit of 4 raised to any power follows a pattern of 4, 6, so the ones digit of $4^{2009}$ is 6. \n\nContinuing this pattern for each number up to 2009, we can see that every 4 numbers will cycle through 1, 6, 1, 6, and the sum of the ones digits of each set of 4 numbers will be 1+6+1+6 = 14, which has a ones digit of 4. \n\nSince there are 2009 numbers being added and 2009 is equivalent to 2008+1 which can be expressed as 4(502) + 1, the sum of all the numbers will be 4(502) sets of 14 (with a total of 2008) plus 1 more number with a ones digit of 1. \n\nWhen adding up all the ones digits, 2008 numbers will result in a ones digit of 4, and adding 1 gives a total ones digit of 4+1 = 5. \n\nTherefore, the ones digit of the entire sum $1^{2009} + 2^{2009} + 3^{2009} + \\cdots + 2009^{2009}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
