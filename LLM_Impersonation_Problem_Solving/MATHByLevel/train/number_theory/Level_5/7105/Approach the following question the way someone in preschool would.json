    "solution": "We write\\[\\frac{3^{100}+2^{100}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}=\\frac{3^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot\\frac{3^{100}}{3^{96}}+\\frac{2^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot\\frac{2^{100}}{2^{96}}=\\frac{3^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot 81+\\frac{2^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot 16.\\]Hence we see that our number is a weighted average of 81 and 16, extremely heavily weighted toward 81. Hence the number is ever so slightly less than 81, so the answer is $\\boxed{80}$.",
