What is the greatest integer less than or equal to\\[\\frac{3^{100}+2^{100}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}?\\]\n$\\textbf{(A) }80\\qquad \\textbf{(B) }81 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }96 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) }97 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) }625\\qquad$\n",
    "solution": "We write\\[\\frac{3^{100}+2^{100}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}=\\frac{3^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot\\frac{3^{100}}{3^{96}}+\\frac{2^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot\\frac{2^{100}}{2^{96}}=\\frac{3^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot 81+\\frac{2^{96}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}\\cdot 16.\\]Hence we see that our number is a weighted average of 81 and 16, extremely heavily weighted toward 81. Hence the number is ever so slightly less than 81, so the answer is $\\boxed{80}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's try plugging in some smaller numbers to see if we notice a pattern. Let's start with a much easier problem: what is the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{3^2 + 2^2}{3^1 + 2^1}$?\n\nWe can simplify this fraction to get $\\frac{9+4}{3+2} = \\frac{13}{5}$. The greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{13}{5}$ is $2$.\n\nNow, let's try plugging in larger numbers and see if we can spot any patterns. Try plugging in $3$ for the exponents.\n\nSo we get $\\frac{3^{3}+2^{3}}{3^{2}+2^{2}} = \\frac{27+8}{9+4} = \\frac{35}{13}$. The greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{35}{13}$ is $2$.\n\nLet's try one more: what is the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{3^{4}+2^{4}}{3^{3}+2^{3}}$? \n\nWe get $\\frac{81+16}{27+8} = \\frac{97}{35}$. The greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{97}{35}$ is $2$.\n\nSo it looks like no matter what exponent we use, the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\frac{3^{100}+2^{100}}{3^{96}+2^{96}}$ will be $2$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }81}$.",
