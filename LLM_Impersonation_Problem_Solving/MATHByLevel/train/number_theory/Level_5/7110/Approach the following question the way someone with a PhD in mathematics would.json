    "solution": "By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.\nBecause the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$. Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields\\[(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.\\]Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and\\[((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.\\]Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \\dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \\dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$. Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$. These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the sum of the roots of a quadratic function in the form of $ax^2 + bx + c$ is $-b/a$. In this case, the sum of the roots of $f(x)$ would be $a$. Since we are given that the zeroes of $f(x)$ are integers, this means that both zeroes of $f(x)$ must be integers. \n\nLet the roots of $f(x)$ be $m$ and $n$. Using Vieta's formulas, we know that $m n = 2a$ and $ m + n = a$. Since $m$ and $n$ are integers, this means that $a$ must be a factor of $2a$. The factors of $2a$ are $1, 2, a, 2a, -1, -2, -a, -2a$. \n\nIf we try to find the sum of the possible values for $a$, we get $1+2+2+(-1)+(-2)+(-2)+(-a)+(-a) = 0$. However, we must remember that we are looking for the sum of the possible values of $a$, not the sum of the possible values for $m$ and $n$. Thus, the possible values for $m$ and $n$ can be $1$ and $2$ OR $-1$ and $-2$, with the corresponding values for $a$ being $3$ and $-3$ respectively. \n\nThe sum of the possible values of $a$ is $3 + (-3) = 0$. However, we learned that the sum needs to be a factor of $2a$. The only possible factor of $2a$ that is equal to $0$ is $0$ itself. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible values of $a$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",
