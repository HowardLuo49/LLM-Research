    "solution": "Let the given sum be $S$. By inspection, we find that $2^6 \\equiv 64 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$, so $2^{-6} \\equiv (-1)^{-1} \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}$. It follows that $2^{-5} \\equiv 2 \\cdot 2^{-6} \\equiv 2 \\cdot -1 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{13}$, and that $2^{-4} \\equiv -4 \\pmod{13}$, and so forth. Thus, $$S \\equiv -2^5 - 2^4 - 2^3 - 2^2 - 2 - 1 \\equiv -63 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{13}$$",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we need to add up some numbers that are fractions with 2 in the denominator and then find the answer modulo 13. Let's see, if we write them all out, we get:\n$$2^{-1} + 2^{-2} + 2^{-3} + 2^{-4} + 2^{-5} + 2^{-6} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{64}.$$\nAdding those up, we get $\\frac{63}{64}$.\n\nThen, let's find the fraction before we reduce the fraction. $\\frac{63}{64}$ is equal to $12 \\frac{15}{16}$. The fraction will now be $15$ since $12 \\% 13$ is $12$ so we have $15 \\pmod{13}$, which equals $\\boxed{2}$. Yay!",
