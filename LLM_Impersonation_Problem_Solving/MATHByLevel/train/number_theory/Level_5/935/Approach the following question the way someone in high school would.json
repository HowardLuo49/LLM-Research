    "solution": "First, we simplify $1356 \\pmod{22}$ to $1356 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$. Therefore, we have $$3n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$$This means that $3n$ can be written in the form $22a+14$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $3n=22a+14$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{22a+14}{3}=n$ is an integer, which we can easily find to be $1$. Therefore, $n=\\frac{22+14}{3}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by 3 and then divided by 22, leaves a remainder of 1356.\n\nI can start by trying different values of $n$:\n- If I try $n = 1$, then $3 \\cdot 1 = 3$. But when I divide 3 by 22, I get a remainder of 3, not 1356.\n- If I try $n = 2$, then $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.

When I divide 9 by 22, I get a remainder of 9.\n- Continuing the pattern, if I try $n = 4$, then $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$. When I divide 12 by 22, I get a remainder of 12.\n- Trying $n = 5$, then $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$. When I divide 15 by 22, I get a remainder of 15.\n- Trying $n = 6$, $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$. When I divide 18 by 22, I get a remainder of 18.\n- Trying $n = 7$, $3 \\cdot 7 = 21$. When I divide 21 by 22, I get a remainder of 21.\n- Trying $n = 8$, $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$.
