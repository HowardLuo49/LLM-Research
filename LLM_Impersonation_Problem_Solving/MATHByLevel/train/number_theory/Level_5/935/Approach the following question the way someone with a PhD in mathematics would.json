    "solution": "First, we simplify $1356 \\pmod{22}$ to $1356 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$. Therefore, we have $$3n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$$This means that $3n$ can be written in the form $22a+14$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $3n=22a+14$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{22a+14}{3}=n$ is an integer, which we can easily find to be $1$. Therefore, $n=\\frac{22+14}{3}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$, we first need to simplify the congruence equation. \n\nWe know that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$ is equivalent to $3n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{22}$ (since 1356 is congruent to 10 modulo 22).\n\nNext, we can find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 22. This is equivalent to finding an integer $a$ such that $3a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{22}$. By calculating the values of $3a$ for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, we find that $a = 15$ is the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 22, as $3 \\times 15 = 45 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{22}$.\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the congruence equation by 15 to isolate $n$:\n$$3n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{22}$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 15 \\times 3n \\equiv 15 \\times 10 \\pmod{22}$$\n$$\\Rightarrow n \\equiv 150 \\pmod{22}$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the congruence $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$ is n = 150.",
