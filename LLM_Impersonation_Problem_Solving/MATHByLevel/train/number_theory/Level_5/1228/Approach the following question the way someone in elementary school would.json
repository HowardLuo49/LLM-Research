Specifically \\[9A=999999\\]and \\[7B=999999.\\]Taken modulo 1,000,000 these equations read \\begin{align*}\n9A&\\equiv-1\\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\\\\n7B&\\equiv-1\\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\\\\n\\end{align*}We are set if we multiply these equations: \\[(9A)(7B)\\equiv1\\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\]so $N=9\\cdot7=\\boxed{63}$ is the multiplicative inverse to $AB$ modulo 1,000,000.",
