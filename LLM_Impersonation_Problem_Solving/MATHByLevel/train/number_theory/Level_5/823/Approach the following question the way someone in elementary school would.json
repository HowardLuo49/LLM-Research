Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to find all the clever integers that are divisible by 27. To do this, we need to find all the even integers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add up to 9. \n\nHere are the clever integers: 39, 48, 57, 66, 75, 84, 93, 102, 111.\n\nNow, let's see how many of these are divisible by 27. We see that 111 is divisible by 27.\n\nSo, 1 out of the 9 clever integers is divisible by 27.\n\nSo, the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{2?: Ok, so first we need to find all the clever integers that are divisible by 27.
