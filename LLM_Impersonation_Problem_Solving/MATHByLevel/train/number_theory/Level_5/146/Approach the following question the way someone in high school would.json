    "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.",

The sequence consists of positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. \n\nLooking at the first few terms, we see that the multiples of 3 are continuously increasing by 3. The terms that contain at least one digit that is a 1 seem to be alternating between multiples of 3 and numbers where the tens digit is 1 (like 12, 18, 21, 51, 81).\n\nTo find the 50th term, we need to find the next term in the pattern. The 50th term would be the next multiple of 3 that contains at least one digit that is a 1.\n\nThe multiples of 3 are 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102.\n\nFrom this list, we can see that the 50th term is 102.",
