    "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $50^{th}$ term of the sequence, we must first analyze the pattern of the sequence.\n\nThe sequence consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. This implies that the next term in the sequence will be a multiple of 3 that contains at least one digit that is a 1.\n\nLooking at the first few terms of the sequence: 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, we can observe that the terms are increasing and the number of digits in the term is also increasing. Moreover, the presence of the digit 1 is not consistent in terms of its position in the number.\n\nWe can divide the sequence into two parts: terms with one digit containing 1 and terms with two digits containing 1. In the first part, each term starts with 1 and is followed by another digit. In the second part, the digit 1 appears later in the number.\n\nSince the $50^{th}$ term will have to be in the first part of the sequence (since the sequence is increasing and we are looking for the $50^{th}$ term), we need to determine the pattern that will continue generating terms of this form.\n\nAfter examining the first terms, we observe the following pattern:\n\n1st term: 12 (1 followed by another digit)\n2nd term: 15 (1 followed by another digit)\n3rd term: 18 (1 followed by another digit)\n4th term: 21 (2 followed by a 1)\n5th term: 51 (5 followed by a 1)\n6th term: 81 (8 followed by a 1)\n\nFrom this pattern, we can infer that the terms are generated by looping through values 1, 2, 3, 4, ... and appending those values to 1. This means that the $n^{th}$ term is obtained by concatenating the $n^{th}$ value obtained from this looping process to 1.\n\nTo find the $50^{th}$ term, we need to calculate the remainder of 50 divided by 9 (since the looping pattern of values 1, 2, 3, 4, ... repeats every 9 terms), which is 5. Therefore, the $50^{th}$ term is obtained by concatenating the 5th value from the looping process to 1, which is 5. \n\nHence, the $50^{th}$ term of the sequence is 51.",
