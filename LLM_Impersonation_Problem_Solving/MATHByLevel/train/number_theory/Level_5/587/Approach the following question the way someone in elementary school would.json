    "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's pick an even number for $n$, like 2. Then we can find the value of $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$.\n\nPlug in $n=2$, we get $(2+1)(2+3)(2+5)(2+7)(2+9) = 3*5*7*9*11 = 10395$.\n\nNow we need to find the largest integer that is a divisor of 10395. To find this, we need to break down 10395 into its prime factors. \n\nFactorizing 10395, we get $10395 = 3*5*7*11*7$. The largest integer that is a divisor of 10395 is the product of all prime factors, which is $3*5*7*11 = 1155$.\n\nSo, for any positive even integer $n$, the largest integer that is a divisor of $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ is 1155.",
