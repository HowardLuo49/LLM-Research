    "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first expand the expression and collect like terms:\n\n\\[(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9) = n^5 + 25n^4 + 199n^3 + 779n^2 + 1525n + 945\\]\n\nThis expression can also be written as a product of two binomials:\n\n\\[(n+1)(n+9) = n^2 + 10n + 9\\]\n\n\\[(n+3)(n+7) = n^2 + 10n + 21\\]\n\n\\[(n+5) = n + 5\\]\n\nIf we multiply all the integers together, the largest integer that divides each of the factors is $\\boxed{9}$.",
