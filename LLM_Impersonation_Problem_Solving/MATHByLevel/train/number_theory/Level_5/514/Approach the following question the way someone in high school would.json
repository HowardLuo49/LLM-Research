    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 180$.  The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 3^q \\cdot 5^r$ and $b = 2^s \\cdot 3^t \\cdot 5^u$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, $t$, and $u$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + s} \\cdot 3^{q + t} \\cdot 5^{r + u}$.  But $ab = 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, so $p + s = 2$, $q + t = 2$, and $r + u = 1$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,s\\}} \\cdot 3^{\\min\\{q,t\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{r,u\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,t)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,t\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(r,u)$ are $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, so the only possible value of $\\min\\{r,u\\}$ is 0.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 3^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 3^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 3^1 = 3$, and $2^1 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.",
