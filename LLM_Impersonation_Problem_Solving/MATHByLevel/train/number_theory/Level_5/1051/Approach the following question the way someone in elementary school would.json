    "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to understand what $1001_n$ means. The subscript $n$ tells us that the number is written in base $n$. \n\nIn base $n$, the number $1001_n$ would be equal to $n^3 + n^0$, which is equal to $n^3 + 1$.\n\nTo find how many positive integers $n$ make $n^3 + 1$ a prime number, we can start testing values for $n$. \n\nIf we plug in $n=2$, we get $2^3 + 1 = 9$ which is not a prime number. \n\nIf we plug in $n=3$, we get $3^3 + 1 = 28$ which is not a prime number. \n\nIf we plug in $n=4$, we get $4^3 + 1 = 65$ which is not a prime number. \n\nIf we plug in $n=5$, we get $5^3 + 1 = 126$ which is not a prime number. \n\nIf we plug in $n=6$, we get $6^3 + 1 = 217$ which is a prime number. \n\nSo, the only positive integer $n\\geq 2$ that makes $1001_n$ a prime number is $n=6$.",
