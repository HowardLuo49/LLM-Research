    "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if $1001_n$ is prime, we must first convert the number to base 10. \n\nNote that in base $n$, the number $1001_n$ is equivalent to $n^3 + n^0 = n^3 + 1$.\n\nNow, we need to consider the primality of $n^3 + 1$ for various values of $n \\geq 2$. \n\nIf $n$ is even, then $n^3$ will also be even, making $n^3 + 1$ odd. Thus, $n^3 + 1$ will have factors of 2 and itself, making it composite. \n\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n^3$ will also be odd, making $n^3 + 1$ even. However, since $n \\geq 2$, $n^3 + 1$ will be greater than 2, and thus it cannot be prime.\n\nTherefore, there are no positive integers $n \\geq 2$ such that $1001_n$ is a prime number.",
