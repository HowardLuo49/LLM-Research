There are $20n$ members in the Trumpington marching band, and when they line up in rows of 26, there are 4 band members left over. If $n$ is an integer and there are fewer than 1000 band members, what is the maximum number of people that could be in the Trumpington marching band?",
    "solution": "Since there are 4 band members left over when they line up in rows of 26, we have $20n \\equiv 4\\pmod{26}$. We divide both sides of the congruence by 4, remembering that we have to divide 26 by the greatest common divisor of 4 and 26. The original congruence is equivalent to \\[\n5n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]So we would like to find a multiple of 13 which is one less than a multiple of 5. Noticing that $13\\cdot 3$ has a units digit of 9, we identify $(13\\cdot 3 + 1)/5 =8$ as the inverse of 5 (mod 13). Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 gives \\[\nn \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]We have found that $n$ satisfies the conditions given in the problem if $n=8+13k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $20n<1000$. Rewriting the inequality $20n<1000$ as $n<50$, we solve $8+13k < 50$ to find that the maximum solution is $k=\\lfloor 42/13\\rfloor = 3$. When $k=3$, the number of band members is $20(8+13(3))=\\boxed{940}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum number of people in the Trumpington marching band, we need to consider the different possibilities for the number of band members.\n\nFirst, let's look at the condition that when they line up in rows of 26, there are 4 band members left over. This means that the total number of band members must be of the form $26k + 4$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. \n\nSince we know there are $20n$ members in the band, we can write $20n = 26k + 4$. \n\nTo find the maximum number of people in the band, we want to find the largest possible value for $k$ given the constraint that $20n < 1000$. \n\nLet's start by looking at the largest possible value for $n$, which is 49 (since $20 \\cdot 49 = 980$). If $n = 49$, then $20n = 980$. \n\nNow, we need to find the largest possible value for $k$ that satisfies $20n = 26k + 4$. This means $980 = 26k + 4$.
