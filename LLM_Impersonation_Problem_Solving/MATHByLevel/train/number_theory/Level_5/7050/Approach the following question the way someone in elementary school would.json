    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$, we need to think about which combinations of four consecutive integers can make up the digits of the number. \n\nSince the digits are in decreasing order, the units digit must be the smallest digit. So, let's start with the smallest digit being $a$.\nThen, the digits of $n$ would be $a(a-1)(a-2)(a-3)$.\n\nLet's try some examples:\nIf the units digit is 4, then the number would be 4321. When we divide this number by 37, the remainder is 1.\nIf the units digit is 5, then the number would be 5432. When we divide this number by 37, the remainder is 12.\nAnd so on...\n\nWe can continue this pattern and find all the possible remainders for different unit digits.\n\nThen, we can add up all the possible remainders to find the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by 37. \n\nRemember, in the beginning $a$ can be any number between 4 and 9 because the digits must be positive integers and consecutive.",
