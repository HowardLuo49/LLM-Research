    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hi there! Let's see if we can solve this together. Since the digits of $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order, that means the number must look like 4321, or 5432, or 6543, etc. The sum of the digits in each number is always equal to 10. Now, let's find the possible remainders when these numbers are divided by 37. \n\nTo start, let's try 4321. When we divide 4321 by 37, we get a remainder of 26. \n\nNext, let's try 5432. When we divide 5432 by 37, we get a remainder of 9.\n\nWe can continue this pattern for all the possible numbers that fit the criteria. Then, we can add up all the remainders we find to get the final answer. \n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",
