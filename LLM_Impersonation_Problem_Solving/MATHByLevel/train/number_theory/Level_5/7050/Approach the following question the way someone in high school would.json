    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this down. We know that the digits of the positive integer $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right. This means that $n$ could be in the form of $4321, 3210, 2109$, and so on.\n\nNow we want to find the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$. When we divide $n$ by $37$, we get a quotient and a remainder. We want to find all the possible remainders that $n$ can have when divided by $37, and then sum them up.\n\nTo do this, we can start by finding the remainders when each of the possible values of $n$ is divided by $37$. For example, if $n=4321$, then $n$ divided by $37$ leaves a remainder of $1$. Similarly, if $n=3210$, then $n$ divided by $37$ leaves a remainder of $20$. We can continue this process for all the possible values of $n$.\n\nOnce we have found all the possible remainders, we can sum them up to get our final answer. This is a fun problem that challenges us to think about divisibility and remainders in a creative way. Let's calculate those remainders and find the sum!",
