    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n = abc(d)$, where $a>b>c>d$ are the digits of $n$. Then the number formed by the digits of $n$ is $1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 37k + r$, where $k$ is an integer and $r$ is the remainder when $n$ is divided by $37$.\n\nWe have $1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 37k + r$.\n\nSince the digits are in decreasing order, we have $a = b + 1 = c + 2 = d + 3$. \n\nSubstituting these into the first equation, we get $1000(b + 1) + 100b + 10(b-1) + b-2 = 1121b - 991 = 37k + r$.\n\nHence, $r = 1121b - 991 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{37}$.\n\nSolving this congruence, we find that $b \\equiv 14 \\pmod{37}$. Therefore, the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$ are the solutions to $r = 1121 \\cdot 14 - 991 = 14653$, $r = 14653 \\% 37$ or $r = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible remainders is $2$.",
