    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The number $1000!$ has a long tail of zeroes. How many zeroes are there?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
    "solution": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nTo count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.\n\nNext, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.\n\nNext, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.\n\nFinally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.\n\nThis gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many zeroes are at the end of $1000!$, we need to figure out how many times $1000!$ can be divided by 10. Since 10 is made up of 2 and 5, we need to consider the prime factorization of $1000!$. \n\nThe number of 5's in the prime factorization of $1000!$ will determine how many zeroes are at the end of it because there will always be more 2's than 5's.\n\nTo find the number of 5's in the prime factorization of $1000!$, we can use the formula: \\[\\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5}}\\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5^2}}\\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5^3}}\\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5^4}}\\right \\rfloor.\\]\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[\\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5}}\\right \\rfloor = 200, \\] \n\\[\\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5^2}}\\right \\rfloor = 40, \\] \n\\[\\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5^3}}\\right \\rfloor = 8, \\] \n\\[\\left \\lfloor{\\frac{1000}{5^4}}\\right \\rfloor = 1.\\]\n\nAdding these up gives us $200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249$.\n\nTherefore, there are 249 zeroes at the end of $1000!$.",
