    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The number $1000!$ has a long tail of zeroes. How many zeroes are there?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
    "solution": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nTo count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.\n\nNext, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.\n\nNext, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.\n\nFinally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.\n\nThis gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so to figure out how many zeroes are at the end of $1000!$, we need to look at the factors of $1000!$. We know that a zero at the end of a number comes from when there is a factor of 10, which is the same as having factors of 2 and 5 in the number.\n\nIn $1000!$, there are many more factors of 2 than factors of 5. So, to find how many zeroes are at the end of $1000!$, we need to see how many factors of 5 are in $1000!$. \n\nLet's count the factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 1000. We have 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... up to 1000. To make it easier, we can count how many multiples of 5 there are - and we get 200 multiples of 5. \n\nHowever, some numbers in $1000!$ have more than one factor of 5. For example, 25 has two factors of 5. So we need to count those as well. \n\nIn $1000!$, there are also multiples of 25 - like 25, 50, 75, 100, ... up to 1000. We already counted the multiples of 5 in those numbers earlier, so we don't need to count them again. But we do need to count the multiples of 25. There are 40 multiples of 25 in $1000!$.\n\nNow, let's look at multiples of 125. There are 8 multiples of 125 in $1000!$.\n\nAnd lastly, multiples of 625. There is only 1 multiple of 625 in $1000!$. \n\nAdding all these up gives us $200 + 40 + 8 + 1 = 249$. So, there are 249 zeroes at the end of $1000!$.",
