    "solution": "\\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \\cdot 5^6\\]\nNote that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even. We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$. We have $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ left. Since there are $7 \\cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\\cdot2=\\boxed{98}$ lattice points.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many lattice points are on the hyperbola! A lattice point is a point where both the x and y coordinates are whole numbers. \n\nLet's start by plugging in some values for x and solving for y. Since the equation is $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$, let's start with x = 0. When x = 0, y^2 = 2000^2 and y is a whole number. This means there is a lattice point at (0, 2000).\n\nNext, let's try x = 1. When x = 1, y^2 = 2000^2 + 1. Since 2000^2 is a very big number, y will not be a whole number. So there are no lattice points when x = 1.\n\nWe can continue this process for different values of x, but it seems like there is only one lattice point on the hyperbola at (0, 2000). So the answer is just one lattice point on the hyperbola.",
