    "solution": "\\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \\cdot 5^6\\]\nNote that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even. We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$. We have $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ left. Since there are $7 \\cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\\cdot2=\\boxed{98}$ lattice points.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of lattice points that lie on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$, we can start by rewriting the equation as $(x - y)(x + y) = 2000^2$. \n\nSince the coordinates of the lattice points are integers, both $x-y$ and $x+y$ must be integers. Additionally, $x-y < x+y$ for two integers $x$ and $y$. \n\nLet $x-y = a$, and $x+y = b$. Then we have $a*b = 2000^2$ where $a$ and $b$ are both integers. \n\nWe can factorize $2000^2 = 2^8 * 5^6$.
