    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
    "solution": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we can think of it in terms of linear Diophantine equations. Let $x$ be the number of pigs and $y$ be the number of goats needed to pay off a debt of $d$. The value of the debt in terms of pigs and goats can be expressed as $300x + 210y = d$. \n\nWe are looking to find the smallest positive solution to this equation. By doing some algebraic manipulations, we can rewrite the equation as $6x + 7y = \\frac{d}{10}$. This shows that the value of the debt must be divisible by 10 in order for it to be resolved. \n\nIn order to find the smallest positive solution, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 6 and 7. The gcd of 6 and 7 is 1, which means that there are infinitely many solutions to the equation. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way is $\\$30$. This can be achieved by paying 2 pigs for a total of $\\$600$ and receiving 1 goat in change ($600 - 210 = 390$).",
