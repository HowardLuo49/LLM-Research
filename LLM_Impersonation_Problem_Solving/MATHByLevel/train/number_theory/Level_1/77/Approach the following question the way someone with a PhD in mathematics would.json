    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The integer $m$ is between $30$ and $80$ and is a multiple of $6$. When $m$ is divided by $8,$ the remainder is $2$. Similarly, when $m$ is divided by $5,$ the remainder is $2$. What is the value of $m$?",
    "solution": "According to the problem statement, we have the system of linear congruences \\begin{align*}\nm &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*} It follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{40}$. The only number that satisfies this criterion for $30 \\le m \\le 80$ is $m = \\boxed{42}$, which is indeed divisible by $6$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $m$ be an integer between $30$ and $80$, such that $m$ is a multiple of $6$. We are given that when $m$ is divided by $8$, the remainder is $2$, and when $m$ is divided by $5$, the remainder is $2$.\n\nFrom the first condition, we have that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$. This implies that $m = 8k + 2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nFrom the second condition, we have that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. This implies that $m = 5l + 2$ for some integer $l$.\n\nSince $m$ is a multiple of $6$, we can express $m$ as a multiple of $6$ in terms of $k$ or $l$. Equating the two expressions for $m$ in terms of $k$ and $l$, we have:\n\n$8k + 2 = 5l + 2$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$8k = 5l$\n\nSince $m$ is an integer between $30$ and $80$, we can test different values of $k$ to find the appropriate value that satisfies the conditions given. \n\nWe find that $k = 15$ and $l = 24$ satisfy the equations above. Therefore, $m = 8(15) + 2 = 120 + 2 = 122$.\n\nThus, the value of $m$ that satisfies all the conditions is $122$.",
