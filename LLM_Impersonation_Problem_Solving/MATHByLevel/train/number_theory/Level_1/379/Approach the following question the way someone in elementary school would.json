    "solution": "We can start from 9 and keeping adding 10 until we reach an integer divisible by 7. It turns out that 9, 19, 29, and 39 are all not divisible by 7, but 49 is divisible by 7. Therefore, $\\boxed{49}$ is the smallest integer that ends in a 9 and is divisible by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7, we can start by listing out some numbers that end in 9: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99. \n\nNow, we need to see which of these numbers are divisible by 7. We can do this by dividing each number by 7 and checking if the remainder is 0. \n\nLet's try dividing 49 by 7:\n\n49 \u00f7 7 = 7\n\nSince the remainder is 0, we know that 49 is divisible by 7. And since it also ends in 9, the smallest positive integer that meets both conditions is 49. \n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7 is 49.",
