    "solution": "We can start from 9 and keeping adding 10 until we reach an integer divisible by 7. It turns out that 9, 19, 29, and 39 are all not divisible by 7, but 49 is divisible by 7. Therefore, $\\boxed{49}$ is the smallest integer that ends in a 9 and is divisible by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7, we can start by listing out numbers that end in 9 and see which one is divisible by 7.\n\nWe can see that numbers ending in 9 and their multiples are: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99.\n\nOut of these numbers, 49 is the smallest number that is divisible by 7. Thus, the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7 is 49.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 49?: To find the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7, we can start by listing out numbers that end in 9 and see which one is divisible by 7.\n\nWe can see that numbers ending in 9 and their multiples are: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99.\n\nOut of these numbers, 49 is the smallest number that is divisible by 7. Thus, the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7 is 49.",
