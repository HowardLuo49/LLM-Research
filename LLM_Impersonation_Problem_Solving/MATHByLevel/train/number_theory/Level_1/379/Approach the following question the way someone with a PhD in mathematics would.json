    "solution": "We can start from 9 and keeping adding 10 until we reach an integer divisible by 7. It turns out that 9, 19, 29, and 39 are all not divisible by 7, but 49 is divisible by 7. Therefore, $\\boxed{49}$ is the smallest integer that ends in a 9 and is divisible by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7, we can set up the equation:\n\nLet x be the integer we are looking for.\n\nx \u2261 9 (mod 10) \nx \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find a solution for x satisfying both congruences. Since x is congruent to 9 modulo 10, it must be of the form 10k + 9 for some integer k, and since x is divisible by 7, we have:\n\n10k + 9 \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n3k + 2 \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n3k \u2261 5 (mod 7)\n\nSolving the above congruence, we find that k \u2261 4 (mod 7). Therefore, the smallest positive integer ending in 9 and divisible by 7 can be written as:\n\nx = 10(7m + 4) + 9 = 70m + 49\n\nwhere m is a non-negative integer. Thus, the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7 is 49.",
