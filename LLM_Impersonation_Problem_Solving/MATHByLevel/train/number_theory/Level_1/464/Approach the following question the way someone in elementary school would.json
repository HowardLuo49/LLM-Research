    "solution": "Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5. There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100. One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5, we can start by counting by 5's. \n\n5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95\n\nSo there are 9 positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 and have a units digit of 5.",
