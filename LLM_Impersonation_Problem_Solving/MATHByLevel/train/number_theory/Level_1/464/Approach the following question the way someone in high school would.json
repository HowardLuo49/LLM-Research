    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5?",
    "solution": "Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5. There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100. One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive multiples of 5 less than 100 with a units digit of 5, we can start by listing out the first few multiples of 5 that have a units digit of 5, such as 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95. \n\nWe can see that there are 10 multiples of 5 less than 100 with a units digit of 5.
