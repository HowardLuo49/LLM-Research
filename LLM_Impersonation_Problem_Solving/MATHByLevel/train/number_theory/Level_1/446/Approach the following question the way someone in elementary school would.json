    "gpt_response": "Hi there! To figure out what the base three number $12012_3$ is in base ten, we need to look at each digit in the number and multiply it by the appropriate power of three. \n\nLet's break it down:\n- The rightmost digit is 2, so that's just 2 times 3 to the power of 0 (which is just 1), so that's 2.\n- The next digit to the left is 1, so that's 1 times 3 to the power of 1 (which is 3), so that's 3.\n- The next digit to the left is also 0, so that's 0 times 3 to the power of 2 (which is 9), so that's 0.\n- The next digit to the left is 2, so that's 2 times 3 to the power of 3 (which is 27), so that's 54.\n- The leftmost digit is 1, so that's 1 times 3 to the power of 4 (which is 81), so that's 81.\n\nNow let's add all of those results together: 2 + 3 + 0 + 54 + 81 = 140. \n\nSo the base three number $12012_3$ is equal to 140 in base ten. \n\nI hope that helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.",
