    "solution": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use our math skills to help Bryan figure this out! To make 33 cents using only 3 cent and 4 cent stamps, Bryan can use 11 of the 3 cent stamps. If he uses any more 3 cent stamps, the total will be more than 33 cents. Bryan can combine 11 of the 3 cent stamps and 2 of the 4 cent stamps to make 33 cents. That's the least number of stamps he can use! Great job helping Bryan with his stamp problem!",
