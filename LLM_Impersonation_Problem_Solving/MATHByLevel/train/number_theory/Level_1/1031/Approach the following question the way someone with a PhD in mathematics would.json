    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Bryan has some 3 cent stamps and some 4 cent stamps. What is the least number of stamps he can combine so the value of the stamps is 33 cents?",
    "solution": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can formulate it as a linear Diophantine equation. Let x denote the number of 3 cent stamps and y denote the number of 4 cent stamps. \n\nThus, we have the equation 3x + 4y = 33. This is a linear Diophantine equation in two variables, which can be solved using methods from number theory. \n\nFirst, we find one particular solution to the equation. One possible solution is x = 3 and y = 6. \n\nNext, we find the general solution to the equation. This can be done using the formula x = x0 + bt and y = y0 - at, where x0 and y0 are particular solutions, and a and b are integers such that gcd(a,b) = 1.\n\nUsing the particular solution x = 3 and y = 6, we have x = 3 + 4t and y = 6 - 3t. \n\nTo find the least number of stamps, we need to minimize the value of x + y. Plugging in the equations for x and y, we get x + y = 3 + 4t + 6 - 3t = 9 + t.\n\nHence, the least number of stamps Bryan can combine to get 33 cents is 9 (3 cent stamps) and 6 (4 cent stamps).",
