    "solution": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together to find out. If Bryan has all 3 cent stamps, he could use 11 of them to make 33 cents. Or if he has all 4 cent stamps, he could use 8 of them to make 32 cents. \n\nSo, the least number of stamps he can combine is 8 (4 cent stamps) and 1 (3 cent stamp) to make 33 cents. Yay, we did it!",
