    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Bryan has some 3 cent stamps and some 4 cent stamps. What is the least number of stamps he can combine so the value of the stamps is 33 cents?",
    "solution": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to use a little math and logic. Since we want to combine the stamps to get to 33 cents, we need to think about what combinations of 3 cent and 4 cent stamps could add up to that amount.\n\nLet's start by thinking about using the most 4 cent stamps possible. If Bryan used all 4 cent stamps, he would need 8 of them to reach 32 cents. Then he would need just one more 3 cent stamp to reach 33 cents. So he would need a total of 9 stamps.\n\nTherefore, the least number of stamps Bryan can combine to make 33 cents is 9.",
