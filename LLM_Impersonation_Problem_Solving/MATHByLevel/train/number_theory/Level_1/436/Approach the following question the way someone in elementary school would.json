    "solution": "Since 25 divides evenly into 2000 and 2007 is 7 more than 2000, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25, we first have to see how many times 25 goes into 2007. When we divide 2007 by 25, we get 80 with a remainder of 7. So, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is 7.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 7?: To find the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25, we first have to see how many times 25 goes into 2007. When we divide 2007 by 25, we get 80 with a remainder of 7. So, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is 7.",
