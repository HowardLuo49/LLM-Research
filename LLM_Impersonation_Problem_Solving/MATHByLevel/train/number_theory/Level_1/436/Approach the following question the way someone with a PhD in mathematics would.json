    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25?",
    "solution": "Since 25 divides evenly into 2000 and 2007 is 7 more than 2000, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25, we can use the Division Algorithm which states that any integer a can be divided by a positive integer b to get a quotient q and a remainder r such that a = bq + r, where 0 \u2264 r < b.\n\nSo in this case, we have 2007 divided by 25 which can be expressed as 2007 = 25q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. \n\nTo find q, we can divide 2007 by 25:\n\n2007 \u00f7 25 = 80 with a remainder of 7.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is 7.",
