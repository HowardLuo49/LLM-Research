    "solution": "Since $100=33\\cdot3+1$, the first $100$ letters are $33$ copies of the $3$ letters $ABC$ followed by an $A$.  The $100$th letter is $\\boxed{A}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th letter in the pattern ABCABCABC..., we need to think about how the pattern repeats. \n\nThe pattern starts with ABC and then repeats. So, every three letters, we get back to A. \n\nTo find the 100th letter, we can divide 100 by 3 to see how many times the pattern repeats within the first 100 letters. \n\n100 \u00f7 3 = 33 with a remainder of 1. \n\nThis means that after 33 sets of ABC, we have one letter left. \n\nSo, the 100th letter is the first letter of the pattern, which is A.",
