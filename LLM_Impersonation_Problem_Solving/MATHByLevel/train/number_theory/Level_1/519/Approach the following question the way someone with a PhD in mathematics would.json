    "solution": "We can use the Division Theorem ($a=bq+r$).  $74 \\div 7 = 10 R 4$, so $74 = 10 \\times 7 + 4$.  We subtract 1 to get a remainder of 3, so 74 - 1 = $\\boxed{73}$ is the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. We can represent this as: \n\nx = 7n + 3 \n\nwhere n is an integer. Now we want to find the largest integer possible for x, which is less than 74. To do this, we need to find the largest possible value for n.\n\nThe largest value for n such that 7n + 3 is less than 74 can be found by setting 7n + 3 less than or equal to 74:\n7n + 3 \u2264 74\n7n \u2264 71\nn \u2264 71/7\nn \u2264 10\n\nSo the largest integer n can be is 10. Substituting n = 10 into our equation for x, we get:\n\nx = 7(10) + 3\nx = 70 + 3 \nx = 73\n\nTherefore, the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 is 73.",
