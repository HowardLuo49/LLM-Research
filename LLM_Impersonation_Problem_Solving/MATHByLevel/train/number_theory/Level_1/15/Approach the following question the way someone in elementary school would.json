    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Abigail, Beatrice, and Carson combine their eggs to sell them at the market. If Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs, and if eggs can only be sold in cartons of 12, how many eggs will be left over if all cartons are sold?",
    "solution": "The remainder when $37+49+14$ is divided by $12$ is the same as the remainder when the congruences of each number mod 12 are summed and then divided by 12. In other words, since we have \\begin{align*}\n37 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}\\\\\n49 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12} \\\\\n14 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{12}\n\\end{align*}then therefore, $37+49+14 \\equiv1+1+2 \\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many eggs will be left over, we need to add up all the eggs first. Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs. \n\n37 + 49 + 14 = 100\n\nSo, they have a total of 100 eggs. Now, we need to see how many cartons we can make with these eggs. Each carton has 12 eggs, so we need to divide 100 by 12.\n\n100 \u00f7 12 = 8 with a remainder of 4\n\nSo, they can sell 8 cartons of eggs and there will be 4 eggs left over.",
