    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Abigail, Beatrice, and Carson combine their eggs to sell them at the market. If Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs, and if eggs can only be sold in cartons of 12, how many eggs will be left over if all cartons are sold?",
    "solution": "The remainder when $37+49+14$ is divided by $12$ is the same as the remainder when the congruences of each number mod 12 are summed and then divided by 12. In other words, since we have \\begin{align*}\n37 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}\\\\\n49 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12} \\\\\n14 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{12}\n\\end{align*}then therefore, $37+49+14 \\equiv1+1+2 \\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to add up all the eggs and then see how many full cartons of 12 we can make.\n\nAbigail has 37 eggs,\nBeatrice has 49 eggs,\nCarson has 14 eggs.\n\nAdding all the eggs together:\n37 + 49 + 14 = 100 eggs in total.\n\nNow, we need to see how many full cartons of 12 eggs we can make:\n100 \u00f7 12 = 8 full cartons.\n\nSince we can only sell the eggs in full cartons, we need to find out how many eggs will be left over:\n100 - (8 x 12) = 100 - 96 = 4 eggs left over.\n\nTherefore, there will be 4 eggs left over if all cartons are sold.",
