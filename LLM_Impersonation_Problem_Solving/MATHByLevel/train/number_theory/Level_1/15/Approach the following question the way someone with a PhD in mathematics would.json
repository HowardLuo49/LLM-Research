    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Abigail, Beatrice, and Carson combine their eggs to sell them at the market. If Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs, and if eggs can only be sold in cartons of 12, how many eggs will be left over if all cartons are sold?",
    "solution": "The remainder when $37+49+14$ is divided by $12$ is the same as the remainder when the congruences of each number mod 12 are summed and then divided by 12. In other words, since we have \\begin{align*}\n37 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}\\\\\n49 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12} \\\\\n14 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{12}\n\\end{align*}then therefore, $37+49+14 \\equiv1+1+2 \\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first calculate the total number of eggs the three have combined. Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs they have is:\n\nTotal eggs = 37 + 49 + 14\nTotal eggs = 100\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cartons of 12 eggs can be made from the total number of eggs. We can do this by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:\n\nNumber of cartons = Total eggs / 12\nNumber of cartons = 100 / 12\nNumber of cartons = 8 cartons\n\nSince cartons can only be sold in whole numbers, they can sell 8 cartons of 12 eggs each. To find out how many eggs will be left over, we need to subtract the total number of eggs in the cartons from the total number of eggs:\n\nEggs left over = Total eggs - (Number of cartons * 12)\nEggs left over = 100 - (8 * 12)\nEggs left over = 100 - 96\nEggs left over = 4 eggs\n\nTherefore, if all cartons are sold, there will be 4 eggs left over.",
