    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of $n$?",
    "solution": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first note that the remainder when dividing $n$ by 8 is 5. This can be represented as $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. Since $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30, we can consider the prime numbers in this range: 23 and 29.\n\nWe can check if either of these numbers satisfy the condition $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. For 23, when divided by 8, the remainder is 7, not 5. Therefore, 23 does not satisfy the given condition.\n\nFor 29, when divided by 8, the remainder is 5. Hence, the prime number $n$ that satisfies the condition is $n = 29$.",
