    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Cory made a complete list of the prime numbers between 1 and 25. What is the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on his list?",
    "solution": "Between 1 and 25, the smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. Thus the sum is $2+23=\\boxed{25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest prime number, we start from 2 and keep checking if any number after that is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. So, the smallest prime number on Cory's list is 2. \nTo find the largest prime number, we start from 25 and keep checking if any number before that is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. So, the largest prime number on Cory's list is 23. \n\nTo find the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number, we add 2 and 23 together. \n2 + 23 = 25\n\nSo, the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on Cory's list is 25.",
