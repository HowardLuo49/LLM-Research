    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Cory made a complete list of the prime numbers between 1 and 25. What is the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on his list?",
    "solution": "Between 1 and 25, the smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. Thus the sum is $2+23=\\boxed{25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the smallest and largest prime numbers on Cory's list, we first need to determine the prime numbers between 1 and 25. \n\nThe prime numbers between 1 and 25 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. \n\nTherefore, the smallest prime number on Cory's list is 2 and the largest prime number on his list is 23. \n\nTo find the sum of the smallest and largest prime numbers on his list, we add 2 and 23 together: \n\n2 + 23 = 25. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on Cory's list is 25.",
