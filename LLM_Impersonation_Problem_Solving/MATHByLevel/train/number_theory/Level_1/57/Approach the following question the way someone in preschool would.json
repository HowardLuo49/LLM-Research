    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we have three numbers that when divided by 24, give us remainders of 10, 4, and 12. Let's pretend we have three cookies, and when we share them with 24 friends, we have 10 pieces left, then 4 pieces left, and finally 12 pieces left.\n\nNow, when we add up all three numbers (or cookies!), we get a new number. If we divide this new number by 24, we want to find the remainder. So, we need to add up 10 cookies, 4 cookies, and 12 cookies to see how many we have in total, and then we'll divide that total number by 24 to find out how many pieces are left.\n\nLet's do some counting: 10 + 4 + 12 = 26. So, we have a total of 26 cookies. Now, if we divide 26 by 24, we will have 2 leftover. Yay! We have 2 leftover cookies when we share them with 24 friends. So, the remainder is 2. Hooray!",
