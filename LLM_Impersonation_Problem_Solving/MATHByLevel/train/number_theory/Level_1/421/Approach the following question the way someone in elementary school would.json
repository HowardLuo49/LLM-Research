    "solution": "If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3. Clearly, 369,963 is not divisible by 2. However, it is divisible by 3. Thus, the remainder after dividing by 6 is an odd, non-negative multiple of 3 that is less than 6. The only number such number is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6, we need to divide 369,963 by 6. Let's do it step by step:\n\nFirst, we divide 36 by 6 which is equal to 6 with no remainder.\n\nNext, we bring down the next digit 9 to the right of the remainder which gives us 69.\n\nThen, we divide 69 by 6 which is equal to 11 with a remainder of 3.\n\nNext, we bring down the next digit 6 to the right of the remainder which gives us 36.\n\nThen, we divide 36 by 6 which is equal to 6 with no remainder.\n\nFinally, we bring down the last digit 3 to the right of the remainder which gives us 33.\n\nThen, we divide 33 by 6 which is equal to 5 with a remainder of 3.\n\nTherefore, when 369,963 is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.",
