    "solution": "If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3. Clearly, 369,963 is not divisible by 2. However, it is divisible by 3. Thus, the remainder after dividing by 6 is an odd, non-negative multiple of 3 that is less than 6. The only number such number is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count! If we take 369,963 and share it with 6 friends, we can give each friend 6 tens and some left over. So, the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6 is 3. Yay, we did it!",
