    "solution": "We can call the four integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ $c$, and $d$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 2\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 6\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nd &\\equiv 8\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &\\equiv 2+4+6+8 \\\\\n&\\equiv 20\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c+d$ has the same remainder as $20$ upon division by $11$. This remainder is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the property that the remainder when a number is divided by $11$ is the same as the remainder when the sum of its digits alternatingly added and subtracted is divided by $11$. This property can be seen from the fact that $10 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nGiven the remainders $2, 4, 6,$ and $8$ when the four positive integers are divided by $11$, we can express these numbers as $11a + 2, 11b + 4, 11c + 6,$ and $11d + 8$, where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are integers.\n\nThe sum of the four integers is $(11a + 2) + (11b + 4) + (11c + 6) + (11d + 8) = 11(a + b + c + d) + 20$. \n\nWe want to find the remainder when this sum is divided by $11$, so we can express the sum as $11(a + b + c + d) + 11 + 9$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the four integers is divided by $11$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",
