    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. In 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.  What is the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again?",
    "solution": "The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1. So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so in 2010, the sum of the digits is 3 (2+0+1+0 = 3). To find the next year where the sum of the digits is 3 again, we just need to look at the years following 2010 and see which one adds up to 3.
