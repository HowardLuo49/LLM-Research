    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.  What is the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again?",
    "solution": "The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1. So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the year we are looking for be represented by \\(1000a + 100b + 10c + d\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are digits. We want to find the smallest such year that satisfies the condition that the sum of the digits is 3. \n\nThus, we have the equation \\(a + b + c + d = 3\\). Since the sum of the digits of the year 2010 is 3, we also have the equation \\(2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3\\), which can be rewritten as \\(a + 2b = 3\\). \n\nNext, we want to find the smallest values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) that satisfy these conditions. Since we are looking for the next year after 2010, we can start with the year 2011. In this case, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 0\\) satisfies the conditions. \n\nTherefore, the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again is 2011.",
