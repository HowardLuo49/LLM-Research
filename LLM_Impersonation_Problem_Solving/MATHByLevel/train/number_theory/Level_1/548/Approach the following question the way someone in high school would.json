    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.  What is the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again?",
    "solution": "The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1. So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a year after 2010 where the sum of the digits is 3. \n\nLet's break down the numbers in the year 2010:\n2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3\n\nThe next year after 2010 is 2011.\nLet's break down the numbers in the year 2011:\n2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4\n\nThe sum of the digits in 2011 is 4, so it's not the year we're looking for.\n\nThe next year after 2011 is 2012.\nLet's break down the numbers in the year 2012:\n2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 5\n\nThe sum of the digits in 2012 is 5, so it's not the year we're looking for.\n\nWe can continue this process by checking the sum of the digits for each subsequent year after 2010 until we find the first year where the sum of the digits is 3 again.",
