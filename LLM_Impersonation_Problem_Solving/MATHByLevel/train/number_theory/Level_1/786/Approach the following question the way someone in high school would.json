    "solution": "We see that $(7 - n) + (n + 3) = 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7,$ hence the remainder of the sum when divided by $7$ is $\\boxed{3}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to simplify the sum of $7 - n$ and $n + 3$. We can do this by combining like terms: $7 - n + n + 3 = 10$. \n\nNow we need to find the remainder when $10$ is divided by $7$. We can do this by dividing $10$ by $7$ to get: $10 \\div 7 = 1$ with a remainder of $3$. \n\nSo, the remainder when the sum of $7 - n$ and $n + 3$ is divided by $7$ is $3$.",
