    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. When $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given. What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?",
    "solution": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about it like a fun puzzle! So, if we have a number $n$ and we divide it by 6, we get a remainder of 1. That means when we have $n+2010$, the remainder when we divide it by 6 will be the same. \n\nLet's use our counting skills to figure it out. If $n$ divided by 6 gives a remainder of 1, it means $n$ could be 1, 7, 13, 19, or any number more than that that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. So, $n+2010$ would be 2011, 2017, 2023, 2029, or any number more than that. \n\nWhen we divide these numbers by 6, we see that the remainder is 1 in each case. So, the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6 will also be 1. Yay, we solved the puzzle!",
