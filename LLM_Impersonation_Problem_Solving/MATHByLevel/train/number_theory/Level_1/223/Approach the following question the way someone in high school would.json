    "solution": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can first consider some examples to see if we can find a pattern. \n\nLet's say n is 1, we would have n divided by 6 equals 0 with a remainder of 1. \n\nIf n is 7, then n divided by 6 equals 1 with a remainder of 1. \n\nWe can see that as n increases by a multiple of 6, the remainder stays the same. \n\nSo if n is divided by 6 with a remainder of 1, n could be in the form n = 6k + 1, where k is an integer. \n\nNow we want to find the remainder when n+2010 is divided by 6. \n\nLet's substitute n = 6k + 1 into n + 2010:\n\nn + 2010 = 6k + 1 + 2010 = 6k + 2011\n\nNow we want to find the remainder when 6k + 2011 is divided by 6. \n\nWhen we divide 2011 by 6, we get a quotient of 335 and a remainder of 1, so 2011 divided by 6 equals 335 with a remainder of 1. \n\nSo, the remainder when n+2010 is divided by 6 is 1.",
