    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given. What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?",
    "solution": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6, first we need to find a number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. Let's say that number is 7, because 7 divided by 6 has a remainder of 1.\n\nNow, if we add 2010 to 7, we get 2017. We need to find the remainder when 2017 is divided by 6. Well, when 2017 is divided by 6, we get a remainder of 1. \n\nSo, the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6 is also 1.",
