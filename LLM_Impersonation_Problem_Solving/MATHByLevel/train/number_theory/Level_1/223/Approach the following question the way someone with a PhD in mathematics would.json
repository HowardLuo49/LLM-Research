    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given. What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?",
    "solution": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n = 6k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer. We want to find the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6.\n\nSubstitute $n = 6k + 1$ into $n + 2010$:\n\n$n + 2010 = (6k + 1) + 2010 = 6k + 2011 = 6k + 3(670) + 1$\n\nSince $3(670)$ is divisible by 6, the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6 is 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.",
