    "solution": "Notice that when we divide (99)(101) by 9, we get $\\frac{99\\cdot101}{9}=11\\cdot101$. The quotient is an integer and there is no remainder, so (99)(101) is a multiple of 9 and the remainder is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe notice that $99\\cdot101=99\\cdot100+99=9999$. We can easily see that 9999 is divisible by 9, as the division results in 1111 with a remainder of 0. Alternatively, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. In this case, the sum of the digits in 36, a multiple of 9, so 9999 is a also a multiple of 9. That means the remainder when it is divided by 9 is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, we need to multiply 99 by 101 first. Let's do it together!\n\n9\nx\n9\n__\n81  <--- this is 9 times 9, which is 81\n+\n9\n9  <--- this is 9 times 1, which is 9\n\nNow we add these two numbers together: 81 + 9 = 90\n\nSo, when we multiply 99 by 101, we get 9999. \n\nNow, we need to divide 9999 by 9 to find the remainder. Let's count together! \n\n9999 divided by 9 equals 1111 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the remainder when (99)(101) is divided by 9 is 0. Great job!",
