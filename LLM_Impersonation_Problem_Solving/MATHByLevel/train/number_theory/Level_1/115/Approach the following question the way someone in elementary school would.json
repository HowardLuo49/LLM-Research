    "solution": "Notice that when we divide (99)(101) by 9, we get $\\frac{99\\cdot101}{9}=11\\cdot101$. The quotient is an integer and there is no remainder, so (99)(101) is a multiple of 9 and the remainder is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe notice that $99\\cdot101=99\\cdot100+99=9999$. We can easily see that 9999 is divisible by 9, as the division results in 1111 with a remainder of 0. Alternatively, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. In this case, the sum of the digits in 36, a multiple of 9, so 9999 is a also a multiple of 9. That means the remainder when it is divided by 9 is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the reminder when (99)(101) is divided by 9, we can multiply 99 by 101 to get 9999. \n\nThen we need to see if 9999 can be divided evenly by 9. \n\nIf we add up the digits of 9999 (9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36) we get 36, and 36 is divisible by 9 because 36 \u00f7 9 = 4. \n\nSo, when we divide (99)(101) by 9, the remainder is 0.",
