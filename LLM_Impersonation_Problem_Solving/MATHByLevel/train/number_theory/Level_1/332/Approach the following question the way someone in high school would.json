    "solution": "Since 1001 is $7\\cdot11\\cdot13$, we know that 1001 is a multiple of 13.  The greatest 3-digit multiple of 13 is therefore \\[1001-13=\\boxed{988}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13, we can start by finding the largest multiple of 13 that is less than 1000. \n\nDividing 1000 by 13 gives us a quotient of 76 with a remainder of 12. This means that the largest multiple of 13 that is less than 1000 is 13 * 76 = 988. \n\nTherefore, the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13 is 988.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 988?: To find the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13, we can start by finding the largest multiple of 13 that is less than 1000. \n\nDividing 1000 by 13 gives us a quotient of 76 with a remainder of 12.
