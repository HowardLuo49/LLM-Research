    "solution": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to think about what numbers are multiples of 3. The first few multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on. If we add 1 to 412, we get 413. That is not a multiple of 3. But if we add 2 to 412, we get 414, which is a multiple of 3. So the least positive integer we can add to 412 to yield a multiple of 3 is 2.",
