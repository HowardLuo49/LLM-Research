Maybe we can try counting by 3s and see which number comes next after 412. Let's try! 415...418...421! Oh no, 421 is more than a multiple of 3. Let's try counting backwards from 412 by 1 to see if we can find the answer. 411...410...409. Yay, I found it! The least positive integer that can be added to 412 to make it a multiple of 3 is 1.
