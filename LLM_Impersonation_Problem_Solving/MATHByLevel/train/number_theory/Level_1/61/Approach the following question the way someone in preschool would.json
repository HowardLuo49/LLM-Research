So, n = 3k + 2, where k is a whole number.\n\nNow, let's see how many cookies we have when we have 5n cookies. That's like having 5 groups of n cookies each. So, when we divide 5n by 3, we will still have 2 cookies left over because we have the same amount of cookies in each group.\n\nSo, the remainder when 5n is divided by 3 is also 2. Yay!",
