    "solution": "Since $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If $n$ is divided by 3 and the remainder is 2, that means $n$ can be written as $3a + 2$, where $a$ is a whole number. Now we need to find the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3. \n\n$5n = 5(3a + 2) = 15a + 10$\n\nWhen we divide $15a + 10$ by 3, the remainder will be the same as when we divide 10 by 3. \n\n10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. \n\nSo, the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3 is 1.",
