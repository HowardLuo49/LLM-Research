    "solution": "Since $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so when $n$ is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. That means $n$ is of the form $3k + 2$, where $k$ is an integer. Now we want to find the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3. \n\nSubstitute $n = 3k + 2$ into $5n$:\n\n$5(3k + 2) = 15k + 10 = 3(5k + 3) + 1$\n\nSo when $5n$ is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.",
