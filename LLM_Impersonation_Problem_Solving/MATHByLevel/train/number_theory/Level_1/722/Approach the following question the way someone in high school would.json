    "solution": "We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number. The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime. The value of $q$ is $\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, let's first think about what the statement is telling us. It says that one more than eleven times a certain prime number $p$ is another prime number $q$. \n\nSo, we can write this as an equation: $11p + 1 = q$. Now, we want to find the value of $q$ when $p$ is a prime number.\n\nLet's start by trying some prime numbers for $p$. The first prime number is $2$, so if we plug this into the equation, we get $11(2) + 1 = 23$, which is a prime number.\n\nLet's try the next prime number, which is $3$. Plugging this into the equation gives us $11(3) + 1 = 34$, but $34$ is not a prime number.\n\nNext, let's try $5$. Plugging this into the equation gives us $11(5) + 1 = 56$, but again, $56$ is not a prime number.\n\nSo it looks like $p = 2$ is the prime number that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the value of $q$ is $23$.",
