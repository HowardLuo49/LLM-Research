    "solution": "We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number. The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime. The value of $q$ is $\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding one more than $11$ times a certain prime number $p$. \n\n$11$ times $p$ is $11p$. \n\nOne more than $11p$ means we need to add $1$ to $11p$. So, $11p + 1$.\n\nNow, it says that this new number $11p + 1$ is another prime number $q$. Therefore, $q = 11p + 1$.\n\nSince $p$ is a prime number, let's try some prime numbers for $p$ and see if $11p + 1$ is also a prime number:\n\nIf $p=2$, then $11(2) + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23$, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, when $p=2$, $q = 23$.\n\nSo, the value of $q$ is $23$.",
