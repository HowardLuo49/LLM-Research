    "solution": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... A number that is even and a multiple of 11. That means it has to be 22, 44, 66, 88, or 110. \n\nNow, let's think about the product of the digits being a perfect cube. The only number that fits that is 44, because 4 times 4 equals 16, and 16 is a perfect square.\n\nSo, the two-digit number is 44! Yay, we figured it out!",
