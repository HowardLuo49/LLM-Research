    "solution": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a and b are the digits. Since the number is even and a multiple of 11, the possible numbers are 22, 44, 66, 88. \n\nWe can check each of these numbers for the condition that the product of its digits is a perfect cube.\n\nFor 22: 2*2 = 4 (not a perfect cube)\nFor 44: 4*4 = 16 (not a perfect cube)\nFor 66: 6*6 = 36 (not a perfect cube)\nFor 88: 8*8 = 64 (not a perfect cube)\n\nTherefore, there is no two-digit number that satisfies all the given conditions.",
