    "solution": "The least common multiple of these integers is $4\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$. Thus, a positive integer that is one more than a multiple of all the given integers is $60+1=\\boxed{61}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find a two-digit positive integer that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we can approach this problem by considering the least common multiple of these numbers. The least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is the smallest number that is divisible by all of these integers simultaneously.\n\nThe prime factorization of these numbers is as follows:\n- 2 = 2\n- 3 = 3\n- 4 = 2^2\n- 5 = 5\n- 6 = 2 * 3\n\nWe can now find the least common multiple by taking the highest power for each prime factor:\nLCM(2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60\n\nTherefore, the number we are looking for must be one more than a multiple of 60. Since it is a two-digit number, the smallest two-digit number that satisfies this condition is 61. Thus, the two-digit positive integer that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 61.",
