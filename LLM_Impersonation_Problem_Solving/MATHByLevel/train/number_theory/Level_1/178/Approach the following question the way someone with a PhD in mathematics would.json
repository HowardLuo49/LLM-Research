Grady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags such that every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, but some candy was left over. What is the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over?",
    "solution": "Grady distributes his candy in groups of 9 until he no longer has any groups left.  The largest number of possible pieces left is $\\boxed{8},$ since if he has more than 8 he can distribute another group of 9.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over, we need to consider the concept of the remainder when dividing by 9. \n\nIf each bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, then the number of pieces of candy distributed must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy distributed can be expressed as 9k for some integer k. \n\nNow, we need to find the largest remainder when dividing by 9. This remainder represents the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over. The largest remainder when dividing by 9 is 8, which occurs when the original number of pieces is 9k + 8 for some integer k. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over is 8.",
