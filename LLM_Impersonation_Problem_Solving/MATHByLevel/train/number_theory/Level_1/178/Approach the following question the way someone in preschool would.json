Grady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags such that every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, but some candy was left over. What is the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over?",
    "solution": "Grady distributes his candy in groups of 9 until he no longer has any groups left.  The largest number of possible pieces left is $\\boxed{8},$ since if he has more than 8 he can distribute another group of 9.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's pretend we have a big bag of candy and we want to put them into nine smaller bags. We want to give out the most candy possible to each smaller bag. Since we can't divide the candy perfectly evenly, we will have some left over.\n\nLet's say we have 10 pieces of candy. If we divide them evenly among the nine smaller bags, each bag would get 1 piece of candy and we would have 1 piece left over.\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over is 1.",
