    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $10$ are $2,3,5,7$, so the sum is $2+3+5+7=\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of prime numbers less than 10, we first identify the prime numbers in the given range, which are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Then, we simply add these prime numbers together to obtain the sum:\n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17\n\nTherefore, the sum of prime numbers less than 10 is 17.",
