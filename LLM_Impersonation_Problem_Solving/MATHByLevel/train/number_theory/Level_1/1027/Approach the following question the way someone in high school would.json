    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $10$ are $2,3,5,7$, so the sum is $2+3+5+7=\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so first we need to figure out which numbers are prime. Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. So, the prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nNow, we just need to add them all together to get the sum. \n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17\n\nSo, the sum of the prime numbers less than 10 is 17.",
