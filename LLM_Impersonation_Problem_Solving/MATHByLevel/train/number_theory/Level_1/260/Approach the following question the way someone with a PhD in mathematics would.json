    "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, the problem amounts to finding the greatest multiple of $3\\cdot4=12$ less than 500. Since $500\\div12=41R8$, our answer is $12\\cdot41=\\boxed{492}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than 500 and is also a multiple of 4, we need to find the greatest common multiple of 3 and 4 that is less than 500.\n\nThe greatest common multiple of 3 and 4 is their least common multiple (LCM), which is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 3 and 4. The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nTo find the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than 500 and is also a multiple of 4, we need to find the largest multiple of 12 that is less than 500.
