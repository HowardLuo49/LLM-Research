    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For what value of $n$ is the four-digit number $712n$, with units digit $n$, divisible by 18?",
    "solution": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the divisibility of a number by 18, we first note that a number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 9 and 2. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. \n\nIn this case, the four-digit number is $712n$. We know that the sum of the digits $(7+1+2+n)$ must be divisible by 9. Thus, we have $10+n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$, which simplifies to $n \\equiv -1 \\equiv 8 \\pmod 9$. \n\nTherefore, the units digit $n$ must be 8 in order for the four-digit number $712n$ to be divisible by 18.",
