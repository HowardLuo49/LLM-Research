    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. For what value of $n$ is the four-digit number $712n$, with units digit $n$, divisible by 18?",
    "solution": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out what value of $n$ makes the number $712n$ divisible by 18, we have to think about what it means to be divisible by 18. \n\nA number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. So first, we need to find out if $712n$ is divisible by 2. Since the units digit of $712n$ is $n$, it is divisible by 2 if $n$ is even. \n\nNext, we need to find out if $712n$ is divisible by 9. To do this, we need to add up all the digits of $712n$ and see if the sum is divisible by 9. Since we know the digits of $712n$ are 7, 1, 2, and $n$, the sum of these digits is $7+1+2+n$. So, for $712n$ to be divisible by 9, the sum $10+n$ must be divisible by 9.\n\nPutting it all together, we know that $n$ must be even and the sum $10+n$ must be divisible by 9. The only even number that makes $10+n$ divisible by 9 is $n=8$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ that makes the four-digit number $712n$ divisible by 18 is $n=8$.",
