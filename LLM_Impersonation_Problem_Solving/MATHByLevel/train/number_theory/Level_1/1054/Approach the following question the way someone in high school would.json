    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For what value of $n$ is the four-digit number $712n$, with units digit $n$, divisible by 18?",
    "solution": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To check if a number is divisible by 18, we need to check if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.\n\nFirst, let's check if $712n$ is divisible by 2. Since the units digit is $n$, we just need to check if $n$ is even. If $n$ is even, then $712n$ is divisible by 2.\n\nNext, let's check if $712n$ is divisible by 9. To do this, we need to find the sum of the digits of $712n$ and see if that sum is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of $712n$ is equal to $7+1+2+n = 10+n$. For $10+n$ to be divisible by 9, $n$ must be equal to 8, since $10+8=18$ is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the four-digit number $7128$ is the only number where $n=8$ and $712n$ is divisible by 18.",
