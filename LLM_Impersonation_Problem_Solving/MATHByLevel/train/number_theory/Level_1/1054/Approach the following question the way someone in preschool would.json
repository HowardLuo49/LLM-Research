    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. For what value of $n$ is the four-digit number $712n$, with units digit $n$, divisible by 18?",
    "solution": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie, let's see! To find out if the number is divisible by 18, we need to check if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. For it to be divisible by 2, the units digit (the last number) must be even. So for $712n$ to be divisible by 2, $n$ must be even! \n\nNow, to check if it's divisible by 9, we add up all the digits in $712n$. We know the digits are 7, 1, 2, and $n$. So the sum is $7 + 1 + 2 + n = 10 + n$. To be divisible by 9, the sum must be a multiple of 9. So, $10 + n$ must be a multiple of 9.\n\nIf we try plugging in values for $n$ starting from 0, we find that when $n = 8$, we get $10 + 8 = 18$, which is a multiple of 9! So, the value of $n$ that makes the number $712n$ divisible by 18 is 8! Yay!",
