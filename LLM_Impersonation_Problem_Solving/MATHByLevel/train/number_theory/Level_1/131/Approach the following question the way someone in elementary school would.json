    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "To share the candy equally with his $3$ sisters, Daniel needs to divide the total number of candies by $4$ (for himself and his $3$ sisters). Since $20$ is already divisible by $4$, Daniel does not need to take any candy away to distribute them equally. Each person, including Daniel, would get $5$ pieces of candy.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2 \\text{ pieces?: To share the candy equally with his $3$ sisters, Daniel needs to divide the total number of candies by $4$ (for himself and his $3$ sisters). Since $20$ is already divisible by $4$, Daniel does not need to take any candy away to distribute them equally. Each person, including Daniel, would get $5$ pieces of candy.",
