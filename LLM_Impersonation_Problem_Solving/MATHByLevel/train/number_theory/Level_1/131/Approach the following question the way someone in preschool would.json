    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "To share the candy equally with his sisters, Daniel needs to make sure he has the same amount of candy left over after he gives some to each of them. Since $20$ can't be divided equally into $3$ parts, Daniel should take away $2$ pieces of candy so that he can share the remaining $18$ pieces equally among his $3$ sisters.",
