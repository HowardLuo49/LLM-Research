    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "To divide the candy equally among his $3$ sisters, Daniel needs to make sure he has a multiple of $3$ pieces of candy. In this case, the closest multiple of $3$ less than $20$ is $18$. \n\nSince $20 - 18 = 2$, Daniel should take away $2$ pieces of candy so that he can distribute the remaining $18$ pieces equally among his $3$ sisters.",
