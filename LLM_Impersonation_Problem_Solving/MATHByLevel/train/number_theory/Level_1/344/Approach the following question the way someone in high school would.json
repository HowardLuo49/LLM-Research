    "solution": "Since 19 is close to 20 and $20\\cdot50=1000$, we consider \\[19\\cdot50=950.\\] From here we skip-count by 19s: \\[950,969,988,1007,\\ldots\\] The largest three-digit multiple of 19 is $\\boxed{988}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit multiple of 19, we can start by dividing the largest three-digit number, 999, by 19. \n\n999 \u00f7 19 = 52 remainder 7\n\nSo the largest three-digit multiple of 19 is 52 times 19, which equals 988. Therefore, the greatest three-digit multiple of 19 is 988.",
