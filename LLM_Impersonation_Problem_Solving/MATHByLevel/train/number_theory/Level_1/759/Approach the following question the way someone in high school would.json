    "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $3\\cdot4=12$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 30 and 40 is 120.  Since $\\boxed{120}$ is not divisible by 16, it is the smallest common multiple of 30 and 40 which is not divisible by 16.\n\nNote: Every common multiple of two integers is a multiple of their least common multiple.  Therefore, it is not possible that the least common multiple is divisible by 16 but some other common multiple is not.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 40 first.\n\nThe prime factorization of 30 is 2 x 3 x 5, and the prime factorization of 40 is 2 x 2 x 2 x 5. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number: 2^3 x 3 x 5 = 120.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 is 120. \n\nTo determine if it is not a multiple of 16, we divide 120 by 16. Since 120 divided by 16 equals 7 with a remainder of 8, 120 is not a multiple of 16.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16 is 120.",
