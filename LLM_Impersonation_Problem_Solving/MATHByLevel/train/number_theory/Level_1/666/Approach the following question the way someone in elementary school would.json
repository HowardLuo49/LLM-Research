Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. \n\nSo, the first five prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Since 11 is the fifth prime number, we need to find the next five prime numbers to get to the tenth prime number. \n\nThe next prime numbers after 11 are 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.
