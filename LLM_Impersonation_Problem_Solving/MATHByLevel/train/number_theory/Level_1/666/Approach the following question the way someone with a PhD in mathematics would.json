    "solution": "The five primes after 11 are 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. The tenth prime number is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the tenth prime number, we must understand the concept of prime numbers and their distribution. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and so on.\n\nSince 11 is the fifth prime number, we can deduce that the tenth prime number is greater than 11. To find the tenth prime number, we must continue identifying prime numbers in sequence until we reach the tenth one.\n\nBy using the Sieve of Eratosthenes or another method for identifying prime numbers, we can determine that the tenth prime number is 29. Therefore, the tenth prime number is 29.",
