    "solution": "A number is congruent to the sum of its own digits modulo 9.  (In other words, if you have a number $n$, and the sum of its digits is $m$, then $n$ and $m$ leave the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n\nThe sum of the digits of 5462 is $5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 17$, and the sum of the digits of 17 is $1 + 7 = 8$.  Therefore, the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9 is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9, we first divide 5462 by 9. \n\n5 divided by 9 is 0 with a remainder of 5.\nNext, we bring down the 4. So, we have 54 divided by 9.\n\n54 divided by 9 is 6 with no remainder.\nNext, we bring down the 6. So, we have 62 divided by 9.\n\n62 divided by 9 is 6 with a remainder of 8.\nSo, the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9 is 8.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: To find the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9, we first divide 5462 by 9. \n\n5 divided by 9 is 0 with a remainder of 5.\nNext, we bring down the 4.
