    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and divisible by 6?",
    "solution": "The number must be even and divisible by 3. Counting down from 999, the first number that satisfies both these properties is $\\boxed{996}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and 6, we need to find the highest common factor of 3 and 6. The highest common factor of 3 and 6 is 6. To find the greatest three-digit number that is divisible by 6, we need to find the highest three-digit number that is a multiple of 6. The highest three-digit number that is a multiple of 6 is 996. So, the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and 6 is 996.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 996?: To find the greatest three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and 6, we need to find the highest common factor of 3 and 6. The highest common factor of 3 and 6 is 6. To find the greatest three-digit number that is divisible by 6, we need to find the highest three-digit number that is a multiple of 6. The highest three-digit number that is a multiple of 6 is 996. So, the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and 6 is 996.",
