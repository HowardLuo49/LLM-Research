    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. What is the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by 3 and divisible by 6?",
    "solution": "The number must be even and divisible by 3. Counting down from 999, the first number that satisfies both these properties is $\\boxed{996}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... Let's see, I know that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So for a three-digit number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nNow, to be divisible by 6, the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Since it's already divisible by 3, we just need to check if it's also divisible by 2.\n\nThe greatest possible three-digit number where the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 is 993 (9 + 9 + 3 = 21, which is divisible by 3). \n\nNow, let's see if 993 is also divisible by 2. Since 993 is an odd number, it's not divisible by 2. \n\nSo, I made a mistake. The correct answer to the question is 996. Because both the sum of its digits (9 + 9 + 6 = 24, which is divisible by 3) and it's divisible by 2 (last digit is even), and therefore it's the greatest three-digit number divisible by both 3 and 6.",
