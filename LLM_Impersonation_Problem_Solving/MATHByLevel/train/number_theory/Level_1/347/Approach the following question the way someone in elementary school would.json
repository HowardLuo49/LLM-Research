    "solution": "The number must be even and divisible by 3. Counting down from 999, the first number that satisfies both these properties is $\\boxed{996}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find a three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6, we need to find the smallest three-digit number that is divisible by the least common multiple of 3 and 6, which is 6. \n\nThe greatest three-digit number that is divisible by 6 is 996. \n\nSo, the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6 is 996.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 996?: To find a three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6, we need to find the smallest three-digit number that is divisible by the least common multiple of 3 and 6, which is 6. \n\nThe greatest three-digit number that is divisible by 6 is 996. \n\nSo, the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6 is 996.",
