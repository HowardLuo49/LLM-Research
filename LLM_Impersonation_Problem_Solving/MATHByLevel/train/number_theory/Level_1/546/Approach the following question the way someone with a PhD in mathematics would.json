    "solution": "If we remember that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, then we know that $.\\overline{2}=\\frac29$. The reciprocal is $\\boxed{\\frac92}$.\n\nIf we didn't know that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, we let $x=.\\overline{2}$. That means $10x=2.\\overline{2}$ and $9x=2.\\overline{2}-.\\overline{2}=2$. So $x=\\frac29$ and the reciprocal is $\\frac92$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the reciprocal of the common fraction form of $.\\overline{2}$, we first need to express the repeating decimal as a rational number.\n\nLet $x = 0.\\overline{2}$. Multiplying both sides by 10, we get $10x = 2.\\overline{2}$. Subtracting the original equation from this new equation, we have:\n\\[10x - x = 2.\\overline{2} - 0.\\overline{2}\\]\n\\[9x = 2\\]\n\\[x = \\frac{2}{9}\\]\n\nTherefore, the common fraction form of $.\\overline{2}$ is $\\frac{2}{9}$. The reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{9}$ is simply the fraction $\\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{9}}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{9}{2}$. Therefore, the reciprocal of the common fraction form of $.\\overline{2}$ is $\\frac{9}{2}$.",
