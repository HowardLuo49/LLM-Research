    "solution": "If we remember that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, then we know that $.\\overline{2}=\\frac29$. The reciprocal is $\\boxed{\\frac92}$.\n\nIf we didn't know that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, we let $x=.\\overline{2}$. That means $10x=2.\\overline{2}$ and $9x=2.\\overline{2}-.\\overline{2}=2$. So $x=\\frac29$ and the reciprocal is $\\frac92$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the reciprocal of $.\\overline{2}$, which is a repeating decimal that keeps going on forever, we first need to turn it into a fraction. Since $.\\overline{2}$ means that the 2 keeps repeating, we can write it as 0.222... where the 2 repeats forever.\n\nTo turn this into a fraction, we can let x = 0.222... Then, 10x = 2.222... Subtracting the two equations gives us:\n\n$10x - x = 2.222... - 0.222...$\n\n$9x = 2$\n\n$x = \\frac{2}{9}$\n\nNow, the reciprocal of a fraction is just flipping it upside down. So the reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{9}$ is $\\frac{9}{2}$. So, the reciprocal of $.\\overline{2}$ in common fraction form is $\\frac{9}{2}$.",
