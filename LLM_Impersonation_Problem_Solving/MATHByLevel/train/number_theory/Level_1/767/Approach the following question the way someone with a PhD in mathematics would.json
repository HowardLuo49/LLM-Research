    "gpt_response": "To determine the greatest number of Sundays that can occur in the first $49$ days of a year, we need to consider the fact that every month has at least one Sunday. There are $7$ days in a week, so there are $7$ days in a week. Therefore, there can be at most $7$ Sundays in a $49$-day period.\n\nIf we start the year on a Sunday, then every subsequent week will also start on a Sunday. In this case, there will be $7$ Sundays in the first $49$ days of the year.\n\nHowever, if we start the year on any other day, there will be $6$ Sundays in the first $49$ days of the year as the last day might not be a Sunday. Therefore, the greatest number of Sundays that can occur in the first $49$ days of a year is $7$.",
