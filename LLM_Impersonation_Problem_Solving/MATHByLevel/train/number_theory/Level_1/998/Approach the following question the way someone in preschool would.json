    "solution": "Notice that we can pair many of these terms: \\[1+7=2+6=3+5=8,\\]so the remainder we want is the same as the remainder when $4+9+10$ is divided by 8.  We also see that this is the remainder when  \\[4+1+2=7\\]is divided by 8, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when we add up all the numbers from 1 to 10 and divide by 8, we first need to add all the numbers together. \n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55\n\nNow, we need to divide 55 by 8. \n\n55 \u00f7 8 = 6 with a remainder of 7.\n\nSo, the remainder when we divide the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 by 8 is 7.
