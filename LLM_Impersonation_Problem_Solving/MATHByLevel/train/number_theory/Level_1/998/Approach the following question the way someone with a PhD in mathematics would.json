    "solution": "Notice that we can pair many of these terms: \\[1+7=2+6=3+5=8,\\]so the remainder we want is the same as the remainder when $4+9+10$ is divided by 8.  We also see that this is the remainder when  \\[4+1+2=7\\]is divided by 8, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8, we can first simplify the sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula $S_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. \n\nThus, the sum of the first 10 positive integers is $S_{10} = \\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 11}{2} = 5 \\times 11 = 55$. \n\nNow, to find the remainder when 55 is divided by 8, we can rewrite 55 as $55 = 8 \\times 6 + 7$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8 is 7.",
