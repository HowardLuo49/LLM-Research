    "solution": "Notice that we can pair many of these terms: \\[1+7=2+6=3+5=8,\\]so the remainder we want is the same as the remainder when $4+9+10$ is divided by 8.  We also see that this is the remainder when  \\[4+1+2=7\\]is divided by 8, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8, first add up all the numbers. \n$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55$\n\nNow, divide 55 by 8. \n\n$55 \\div 8 = 6$ with a remainder of $7$\n\nSo the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8 is 7.",
