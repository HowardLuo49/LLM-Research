    "solution": "The product of the three integers is equivalent in modulo 5 to the product of the modulo 5 residues of the three integers.  We multiply these residues to find the remainder: $$ 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have three numbers: 1, 2, and 3. When we divide these numbers by 5, we get remainders of 1, 2, and 3. Now we need to find the remainder when we multiply these three numbers together and divide by 5.\n\nLet's multiply 1, 2, and 3 together. 1 x 2 x 3 = 6. Now we need to divide 6 by 5 to find the remainder.\n\nWhen we divide 6 by 5, we get a remainder of 1. So, the remainder when the product of these three numbers is divided by 5 is 1.",
