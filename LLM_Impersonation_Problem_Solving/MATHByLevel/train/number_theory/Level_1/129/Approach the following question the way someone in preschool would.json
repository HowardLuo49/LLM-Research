    "solution": "The product of the three integers is equivalent in modulo 5 to the product of the modulo 5 residues of the three integers.  We multiply these residues to find the remainder: $$ 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}. $$",

Alice has 1 sticker left after sharing with her friends, Bob has 2 stickers left, and Charlie has 3 stickers left. When they put all their stickers together and multiply them, we need to figure out how many stickers are left when we divide by 5. \n\nLet's count together: 1 x 2 x 3 = 6. \nNow, let's see how many stickers are left when we divide by 5. \n\n6 \u00f7 5 = 1 remainder 1. \n\nSo, when we divide the product of their stickers by 5, the remainder is 1.
