    "solution": "The product of the three integers is equivalent in modulo 5 to the product of the modulo 5 residues of the three integers.  We multiply these residues to find the remainder: $$ 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that when we divide each of the three positive integers by 5, we get remainders of 1, 2, and 3. Let's call the three integers a, b, and c.\n\nSo, we have:\na \u2261 1 (mod 5)\nb \u2261 2 (mod 5)\nc \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n\nTo find the remainder when their product is divided by 5, we can multiply the remainders of each integer when divided by 5:\na * b * c \u2261 1 * 2 * 3 \u2261 6 \u2261 1 (mod 5)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product of the three positive integers is divided by 5 is 1.",
