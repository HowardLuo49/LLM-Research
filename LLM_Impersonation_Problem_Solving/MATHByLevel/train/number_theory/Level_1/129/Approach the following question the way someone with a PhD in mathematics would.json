    "solution": "The product of the three integers is equivalent in modulo 5 to the product of the modulo 5 residues of the three integers.  We multiply these residues to find the remainder: $$ 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "To start, let's denote the three positive integers as A, B, and C. Given the information that the remainders when these integers are divided by 5 are 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we can express this as:\n\nA \u2261 1 (mod 5)\nB \u2261 2 (mod 5)\nC \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n\nNext, we are asked to find the remainder when the product of these integers (ABC) is divided by 5. In modular arithmetic, we know that the remainder of a product is the product of the remainders. Therefore, we can write:\n\nABC \u2261 (A*B*C) (mod 5)\nABC \u2261 (1*2*3) (mod 5)\nABC \u2261 6 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 6 is divided by 5. This is equivalent to finding the number x such that 6 = 5x + remainder, where x is an integer and the remainder is our desired result. Solving this equation, we find:\n\n6 = 5*1 + 1\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product of these three integers is divided by 5 is 1.",
