The first five are gray, followed by four white, followed by three black, followed by five gray, followed by four white, followed by three black,.... If this pattern continues, what is the color of the 158th marble in this line?",
    "solution": "We notice that the marbles appear in strings of 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black.  These strings have 12 marbles each.  Since  \\[158=13\\cdot12+2,\\]there are 13 full strings of marbles and 2 extras.  Since the first 5 marbles in any group are gray, the two extra marbles must be $\\boxed{\\text{gray}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok! So let's count by groups of 5 for each color. The pattern goes gray, white, black, gray, white, black, and so on. \n\nSo for every 12 marbles, we have 5 gray, 4 white, and 3 black. We need to find out which color the 158th marble will be.\n\n158 divided by 12 is about 13, with a remainder of 2. This means we have completed 13 cycles of the pattern, and we are on the 2nd marble of the next cycle.\n\nSince the pattern starts with gray, white, black, the 158th marble will be white!\n\nSo the 158th marble in the line will be white.",
