    "solution": "The greatest product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number is $(10^4-1)(10^3-1)=10^7-10^4-10^3+1=10^7-(10^4+10^3-1)$. $10^7$ has 8 digits and $10^4+10^3-1=11,000-1=10,999$ has 5 digits. Clearly, their difference (10,000,000-10,999) has $8-1=\\boxed{7}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest number of digits in the product of a 4-digit number and a 3-digit number, we need to consider the maximum possible product when multiplying the largest 4-digit number (9999) by the largest 3-digit number (999).\n\nThe product of 9999 and 999 is 9999001, which has 7 digits. Therefore, the greatest possible number of digits in the product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number is 7.",
