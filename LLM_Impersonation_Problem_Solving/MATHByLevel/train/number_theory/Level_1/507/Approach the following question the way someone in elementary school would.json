    "solution": "The greatest product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number is $(10^4-1)(10^3-1)=10^7-10^4-10^3+1=10^7-(10^4+10^3-1)$. $10^7$ has 8 digits and $10^4+10^3-1=11,000-1=10,999$ has 5 digits. Clearly, their difference (10,000,000-10,999) has $8-1=\\boxed{7}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible number of digits in the product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number, we need to multiply the highest 4-digit number (9999) by the highest 3-digit number (999).\n\n9999 x 999 = 9,989,001\n\nSo, the product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number can have up to 7 digits.",
