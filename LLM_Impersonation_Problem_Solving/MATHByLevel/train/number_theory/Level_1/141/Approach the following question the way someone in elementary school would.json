    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A math class has fewer than $40$ students. When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. How many students are in this class?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use the information that we have in order to find out how many students are in the math class. \n\nFirst, we know there are fewer than 40 students in the class. This means there could be any number of students less than 40, like 39, 38, 37, and so on.\n\nWe also know that when the students try to sit in rows of 7, 3 students sit in the last row. This means that the total number of students is 3 more than a multiple of 7 since 3 students are left.\nPossible numbers of students could be 10, 17, 24, 31.\n\nSimilarly, when the students try to sit in rows of 5, 1 student is left in the last row. This means that the total number of students is 1 more than a multiple of 5, since 1 student is left.\nPossible numbers of students could be 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31.\n\nThe only number that is common to both sets of possible numbers is 31.
