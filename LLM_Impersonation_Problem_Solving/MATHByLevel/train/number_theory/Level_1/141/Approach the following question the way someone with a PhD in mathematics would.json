    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A math class has fewer than $40$ students. When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. How many students are in this class?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the number of students in the class be denoted by $n$. \n\nWhen the students try to sit in rows of $7$, we have $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. \nWhen the students try to sit in rows of $5$, we have $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. \n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as $n = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $7k + 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. \nThis simplifies to $2k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. \nTherefore, we have $k = 4 + 5m$ for some integer $m$. \n\nSubstituting this back into $n = 7k + 3$ gives $n = 7(4 + 5m) + 3 = 28 + 35m + 3 = 31 + 35m$.\n\nSince $n$ must be less than $40$, we have $31+35m < 40$. \nSolving this inequality gives $m = 0$. \n\nTherefore, the number of students in the class is $31$.",
