    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 25\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 20\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 3\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 25+20+3 \\\\\n&= 48\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$. This remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the three integers, we can simply add the remainders together. So, $25 + 20 + 3 = 48$. \n\nWhen we divide 48 by 47, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 47 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
