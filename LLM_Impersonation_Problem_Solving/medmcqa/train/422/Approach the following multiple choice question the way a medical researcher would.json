Pseudomonas aeruginosa is isolated from a pulmonary abscess. CBC shows an acute effect characterized by marked leukocytosis (50,000/mL) and the differential count reveals shift to left in granulocytes. Which of the following terms best describes these hematologic findings?\n1: Leukemoid reaction\n2: Leukopenia\n3: Myeloid metaplasia\n4: Neutrophilia",

    "gpt_response": "A medical researcher would approach this question by analyzing the provided information and linking it to possible explanations based on their knowledge of hematologic disorders.\n\nThe correct answer is 1: Leukemoid reaction.\n\nA leukemoid reaction is a benign condition characterized by a marked increase in white blood cells, specifically granulocytes, in response to a severe infection or inflammation. In this case, the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a pulmonary abscess is likely causing the leukemoid reaction, leading to the marked leukocytosis and left shift in granulocytes seen in the CBC results.\n\nLeukopenia refers to a decrease in white blood cells, which is not consistent with the findings in this case. Myeloid metaplasia is a disorder of the bone marrow where abnormal cells are produced, and neutrophilia refers specifically to an increase in neutrophils, whereas leukemoid reaction involves an increase in overall white blood cells.",
