Pseudomonas aeruginosa is isolated from a pulmonary abscess. CBC shows an acute effect characterized by marked leukocytosis (50,000/mL) and the differential count reveals shift to left in granulocytes. Which of the following terms best describes these hematologic findings?\n1: Leukemoid reaction\n2: Leukopenia\n3: Myeloid metaplasia\n4: Neutrophilia",

Leukemoid reaction is a benign condition characterized by a significant increase in white blood cell count, often due to a severe infection or inflammation. It is important to consider this differential diagnosis in the context of the patient's clinical presentation.",
