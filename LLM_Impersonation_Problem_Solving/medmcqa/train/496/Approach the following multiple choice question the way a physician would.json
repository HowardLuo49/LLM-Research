A biopsy of this mass is diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Workup reveals that no bone metastases are present, but laboratory examination reveals that the man's serum calcium levels are 11.5 mg/dL. This patient's paraneoplastic syndrome is most likely the result of ectopic production of\n1: Parathyroid hormone\n2: Calcitonin\n3: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide\n4: Calcitonin-related peptide",

    "gpt_response": "The patient's elevated serum calcium levels in the setting of a lung mass and squamous cell carcinoma suggest the presence of hypercalcemia of malignancy. The most likely cause of this paraneoplastic syndrome in this patient is the ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Therefore, the correct answer is 3: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide.",
