A biopsy of this mass is diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Workup reveals that no bone metastases are present, but laboratory examination reveals that the man's serum calcium levels are 11.5 mg/dL. This patient's paraneoplastic syndrome is most likely the result of ectopic production of\n1: Parathyroid hormone\n2: Calcitonin\n3: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide\n4: Calcitonin-related peptide",
    "solution": 3,
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to consider the elevated serum calcium levels in the context of the lung mass. The normal serum calcium levels range from 8.5-10.5 mg/dL. Therefore, the elevated level of 11.5 mg/dL suggests hypercalcemia, which is often seen in patients with certain types of cancer, including lung cancer.\n\nGiven the biopsy results of squamous cell carcinoma, paraneoplastic syndromes associated with lung cancer must be considered. One common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lung cancer is hypercalcemia, which can result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by tumor cells. PTHrP shares structural and functional similarities with parathyroid hormone (PTH), and it can lead to increased calcium levels by enhancing bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for the elevated serum calcium levels in this patient with lung cancer is the ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Thus, the correct answer is:\n3: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide",
