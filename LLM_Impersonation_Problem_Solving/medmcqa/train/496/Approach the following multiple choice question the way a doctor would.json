A biopsy of this mass is diagnosed as a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Workup reveals that no bone metastases are present, but laboratory examination reveals that the man's serum calcium levels are 11.5 mg/dL. This patient's paraneoplastic syndrome is most likely the result of ectopic production of\n1: Parathyroid hormone\n2: Calcitonin\n3: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide\n4: Calcitonin-related peptide",

    "gpt_response": "The paraneoplastic syndrome in this patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and elevated serum calcium levels is most likely due to ectopic production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (choice 3). This peptide can mimic the action of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypercalcemia in cancer patients.",
