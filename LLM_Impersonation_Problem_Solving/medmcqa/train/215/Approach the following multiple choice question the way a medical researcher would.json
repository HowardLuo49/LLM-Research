Among the options provided:\n1. Cryptococcus and Candida are both yeast-like fungi known to reproduce by budding.\n2. Rhizopus is a filamentous fungus that reproduces through spore formation, not budding.\n3. Mucor is another filamentous fungus that reproduces through spore formation, not budding.\n4. Histoplasma is a dimorphic fungus that reproduces through budding in its yeast phase, but the primary form of reproduction in this organism is through the formation of spores as well.\n\nBased on this information, option 1 (Cryptococcus, candida) would be the correct answer as both organisms exhibit budding reproduction in tissue.",
