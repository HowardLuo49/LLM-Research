    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "The appropriate management for a patient with cornea verticillata while on amiodarone would be to stop the drug. Amiodarone is known to cause cornea verticillata, which is a reversible side effect of the medication. It is important to discontinue the drug to prevent further progression of the corneal side effects. Penetrating keratoplasty or lamellar keratoplasty would be unnecessary in this case as the corneal changes are related to the medication and should improve upon discontinuation. Observation may be needed to monitor for resolution of the corneal changes after stopping the drug.",
