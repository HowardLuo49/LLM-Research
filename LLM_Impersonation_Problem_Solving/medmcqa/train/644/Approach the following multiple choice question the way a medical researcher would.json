Serologic tests reveal negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and positive antibody to surface antigen. Which of the following conditions does this serologic pattern best fit with?\n1: previous hepatitis B infection\n2: chronic active hepatitis\n3: acute hepatitis B infection\n4: poor prognosis",

    "gpt_response": "The serologic pattern described in the question (negative HBsAg and positive antibody to surface antigen) typically indicates immunity to hepatitis B virus due to previous infection or vaccination. Option 1, previous hepatitis B infection, is the most likely condition that fits this serologic pattern. Option 3, acute hepatitis B infection, would typically show positive HBsAg. Option 2, chronic active hepatitis, would show positive HBsAg as well. Option 4, poor prognosis, is not a specific condition related to this serologic pattern.",
