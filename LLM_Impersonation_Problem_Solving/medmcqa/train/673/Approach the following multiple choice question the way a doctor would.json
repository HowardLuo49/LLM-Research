    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by first understanding the pathophysiology behind hypotension in acute spinal injury. In this scenario, hypotension is typically due to the loss of sympathetic tone. The sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure by regulating vasoconstriction and heart rate. Therefore, the correct answer is 1: Loss of sympathetic tone.",
