    "solution": 3,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the most important indication for Strassman's Metroplasty in the context of a bicornuate uterus would be repeated early pregnancy losses. This is because a bicornuate uterus can lead to a higher risk of miscarriages due to the abnormal shape of the uterus affecting implantation and development of the fetus. Improving the structure of the uterus through Metroplasty can potentially increase the chances of successful pregnancies and reduce the risk of early pregnancy losses. Infertility, menorrhagia, and associated vaginal atresia may also be factors to consider in the decision-making process, but preventing repeated early pregnancy losses would likely be the primary goal in this scenario.",
