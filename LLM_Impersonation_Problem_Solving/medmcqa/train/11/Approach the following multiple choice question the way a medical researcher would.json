Nagler's reaction is a test used to differentiate between Clostridium perfringens and other Clostridium species based on their ability to produce the enzyme lecithinase. From prior understanding, it can be inferred that Nagler's reaction is shown by:\n\n3: Clostridium perfringens\n\nThis inference is supported by the fact that the Nagler's reaction test specifically involves the detection of lecithinase, which is a characteristic of Clostridium perfringens.",
