    "gpt_response": "First, I would review my knowledge of the anatomy of the inner ear and the endolymphatic duct. The endolymphatic duct is a small canal that connects the endolymphatic sac to the vestibular aqueduct. \n\nBased on this knowledge, I would rule out options 1 and 2, as the endolymphatic duct does not drain into the subdural space or external space. Option 4, \"Succulus,\" does not appear to be a known anatomical structure.\n\nThe correct answer is likely option 3, \"Subarachnoid space.\" This is the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater in the brain and spinal cord where cerebrospinal fluid flows. I would choose this answer because it is the most likely anatomical location for drainage of the endolymphatic duct. \n\nTo confirm my answer, I would consult medical textbooks or research articles on the anatomy of the inner ear and the drainage pathways of the endolymphatic duct. I may also discuss this question with colleagues or experts in the field to get their insights.",
