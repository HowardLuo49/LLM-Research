    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "In the treatment of hyperkalemia, the most rapid onset of action is typically seen with intravenous calcium gluconate. This is because calcium has the ability to stabilize cell membranes in situations of hyperkalemia, leading to a rapid decrease in potassium-induced cardiac toxicity. Hemodialysis is also effective but may take longer to set up and perform. Sodium bicarbonate infusion and insulin and glucose infusion work by shifting potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, but their onset of action is not as rapid as intravenous calcium gluconate.",
