    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when considering the process of exocytosis, it is important to understand the cellular mechanisms involved. Exocytosis is a process by which cells release molecules or substances by fusing vesicles with the plasma membrane. In this process, calcium ions (Ca) play a crucial role in triggering the fusion of vesicles with the cell membrane and subsequent release of their contents. Therefore, the correct answer is 1: Ca. Mg, Na, and K are not typically involved in exocytosis.",
