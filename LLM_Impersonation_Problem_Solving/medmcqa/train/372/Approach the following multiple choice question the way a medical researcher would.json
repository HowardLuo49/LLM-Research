    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a medical researcher, we would first need to understand what Cicatrial Alopecia is. Cicatrial alopecia refers to a type of scarring hair loss that occurs when inflammation or trauma to the hair follicles leads to scar tissue formation and permanent hair loss. \n\nNext, we need to evaluate the different options given in the question and determine which conditions are associated with Cicatrial Alopecia:\n\n1: Tenia Capitis - Tinea capitis, also known as ringworm of the scalp, is a fungal infection that can cause hair loss, but it typically does not result in scarring alopecia.\n\n2: Psoriasis - Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can affect the scalp and cause hair loss, but it does not typically lead to scarring alopecia.\n\n3: DLE (Discoid Lupus Erythematosus) - DLE is a type of lupus that can affect the skin and cause scarring hair loss, making it a likely candidate for Cicatrial Alopecia.\n\n4: Alopecia Areata - Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that causes non-scarring hair loss in round patches on the scalp, but it does not lead to scarring alopecia.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely correct answer is 3: DLE.",
