    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this multiple choice question by considering the clinical presentation and characteristics of each option. Cicatricial alopecia refers to a group of hair loss disorders characterized by irreversible destruction of hair follicles and replacement with scar tissue. \n\n1: Tenia Capitis, also known as ringworm of the scalp, typically presents with hair loss and scaly patches on the scalp. However, it is not typically associated with cicatricial alopecia.\n\n2: Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. While it can affect the scalp and lead to temporary hair loss, it is not typically associated with cicatricial alopecia.\n\n3: DLE, or discoid lupus erythematosus, is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder that can lead to inflammation and scarring of the skin, including the scalp. DLE can be associated with cicatricial alopecia.\n\n4: Alopecia Areata is an autoimmune condition that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp. It is not typically associated with cicatricial alopecia.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge as a doctor, I would choose option 3: DLE as the condition associated with cicatricial alopecia.",
