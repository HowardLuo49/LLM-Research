Cortisol releasing hormone is actually released from the hypothalamus, but does not directly come from the hypothalamus itself. Neuropeptide is a broad category of signaling molecules that includes many different substances, some of which are released from the hypothalamus. Ghrelin is a hormone primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract, but it can also interact with the hypothalamus to regulate appetite and energy balance.\n\nBased on current knowledge, the most accurate answer to the question would be:\n1: Orexin",
