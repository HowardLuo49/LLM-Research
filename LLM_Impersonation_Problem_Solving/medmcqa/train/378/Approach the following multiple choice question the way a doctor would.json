ADH is released by the pituitary gland in response to changes in blood volume, blood pressure, and osmolarity.\n\n1: Hypervolemia (increased blood volume) typically results in suppression of ADH secretion, as the body does not need to conserve water.\n2: Hypertension (high blood pressure) may trigger a release of ADH to help regulate blood pressure, but it is not a direct stimulus for ADH secretion.\n3: Hypovolemia (decreased blood volume) is a common trigger for ADH secretion, as the body attempts to conserve water to increase blood volume.\n4: Decreased osmolarity (low solute concentration) can also stimulate ADH secretion, as the body tries to retain water to increase blood osmolarity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: 3.
