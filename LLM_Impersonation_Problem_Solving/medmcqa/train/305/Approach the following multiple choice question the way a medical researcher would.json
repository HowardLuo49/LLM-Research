It is the correct answer to the question.\n\nThe quadriceps femoris are responsible for extending the knee joint.\n\nThe semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles are both part of the hamstring muscle group, which are responsible for flexing the knee joint and extending the hip joint.\n\nTherefore, based on the functions of each muscle, the correct answer to the question is 1: Popliteus.",
