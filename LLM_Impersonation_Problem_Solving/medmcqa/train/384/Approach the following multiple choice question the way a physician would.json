Since the mean hemoglobin level is 10.3 gm% and the standard deviation is 2 gm%, we can calculate the value of hemoglobin below which 5% of the population falls.\n\nUsing the z-score formula: \nZ = (X - mean) / SD\n\nWe can calculate the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile:\nZ = (X - 10.3) / 2\nZ = -1.65\n\nFrom the z-table or statistical software, we can find the corresponding value for a z-score of -1.65, which is approximately 6.67 gm%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1: 6.67.",
