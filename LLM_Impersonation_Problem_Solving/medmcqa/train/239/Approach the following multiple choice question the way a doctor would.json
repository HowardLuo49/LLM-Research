Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive and effective method for assessing blood flow in the carotid arteries, allowing for the evaluation of stenosis or narrowing of the vessels. It is commonly used in clinical practice for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of carotid artery disease. Options 1 (USG), 2 (CT), and 3 (MRI) may also provide valuable information, but for the specific purpose of screening for carotid artery stenosis in vivo, Doppler ultrasound is the preferred choice.",
