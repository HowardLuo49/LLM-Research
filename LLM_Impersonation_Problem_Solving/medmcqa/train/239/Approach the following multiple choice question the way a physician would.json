    "gpt_response": "Based on the options provided, the most appropriate choice for screening carotid artery stenosis in vivo would be option 4: Doppler. Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique commonly used to evaluate blood flow in the carotid arteries and is often the preferred method for screening for stenosis in these arteries. It is safe, widely available, and does not involve exposure to radiation or contrast agents.",
