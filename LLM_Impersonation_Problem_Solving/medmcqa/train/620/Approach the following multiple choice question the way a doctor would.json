In this case, the question is asking about the relationship of mean height between two groups of children. \n\nTo study the relationship between the mean height of two groups of children, we would need to compare the means of the two groups. This kind of comparison is best done using statistical tests that specifically assess differences in means.\n\nOf the options provided, the most appropriate test to use in this scenario would be Student's t-test. This test is specifically designed to compare the means of two groups and determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. Linear regression, Chi-square test, and Test of proportions are not suitable for comparing means of two groups in this context.\n\nTherefore, as a doctor, my recommendation would be to use Student's t-test to study the relationship of mean height between the two groups of children.",
