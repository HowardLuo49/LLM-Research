    "gpt_response": "To address this question as a medical researcher, one would typically review existing literature and studies on conduct disorder in girls to determine the least commonly seen behavior. In this case, the researcher would likely look for statistical data or clinical observations to determine the frequency of each behavior listed in the answer choices among girls with conduct disorder. \n\nBased on current research and clinical knowledge, physical aggression is commonly seen in conduct disorder in both boys and girls. Therefore, the least commonly seen behavior in conduct disorder seen in girls would likely be emotional bullying. Emotional bullying is a form of psychological aggression that may not always be as overt or easily identified as physical aggression or high-risk sexual behavior. Additionally, research suggests that emotional bullying may be more commonly associated with other disorders such as depression or anxiety in girls, rather than conduct disorder specifically. \n\nIn conclusion, the least commonly seen behavior in conduct disorder seen in girls is likely emotional bullying.",
