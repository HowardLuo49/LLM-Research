Hypersecretory glaucoma is a form of glaucoma characterized by abnormally high production of aqueous humor, the fluid in the eye that helps maintain intraocular pressure.\n\nNext, the researcher would analyze the possible options provided and consider which conditions are known to be associated with increased aqueous humor production. From the options provided, Marfan's syndrome is known to be associated with hypersecretory glaucoma. Marfan's syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue and can lead to various ophthalmic complications, including hypersecretory glaucoma.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 2: Marfan's syndrome.",
