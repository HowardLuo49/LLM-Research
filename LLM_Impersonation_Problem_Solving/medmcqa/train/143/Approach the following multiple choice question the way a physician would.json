    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is:\n\n1: Proptosis\n\nGrave's ophthalmopathy most commonly presents with proptosis, which is the protrusion of the eyeball from the orbit. This is due to inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the eye, causing the eyeball to be pushed forward. Other common symptoms include lid lag, gritty sensation in the eyes, and double vision. Ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, is less commonly associated with Grave's ophthalmopathy. Reduced intraocular tension and increased power of convergence are not typically seen in this condition.",
