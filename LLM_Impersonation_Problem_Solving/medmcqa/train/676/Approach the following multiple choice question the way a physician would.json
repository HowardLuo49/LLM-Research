B12 deficiency can present with a variety of neurological symptoms including posterior column dysfunction, which can manifest as loss of vibration and position sense. Additionally, B12 deficiency can also lead to megaloblastic anaemia. The other options such as B1-deficit, SSPE, and multiple sclerosis do not typically present with both anaemia and posterior column dysfunction in the same patient.",
