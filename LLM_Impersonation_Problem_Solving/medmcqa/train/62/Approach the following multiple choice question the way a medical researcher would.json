S2 is the second heart sound, which is produced by the closure of the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary valves). The normal auscultatory area for best appreciating S2 is the 2nd right intercostal space, as this is the location where the aortic valve is best heard. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2: 2nd right intercostal space",
