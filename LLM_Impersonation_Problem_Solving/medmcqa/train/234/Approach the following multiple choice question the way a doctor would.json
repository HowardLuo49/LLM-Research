    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by considering the characteristics of each of the listed diseases in order to determine which one is the most common widespread zoonotic disease in the world.\n\n1. Rabies is a viral disease that is primarily spread through the bite of an infected animal, particularly wild animals such as bats and raccoons. While rabies is a serious and often fatal disease, it is not as common worldwide as some other zoonotic diseases.\n\n2. Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that is spread through contact with water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, particularly rodents. Leptospirosis is relatively common in certain regions, but it is not as widespread as some other zoonotic diseases.\n\n3. Brucella is a bacterial disease that is primarily spread through contact with infected animals or their products, such as unpasteurized dairy products. While brucellosis can be found worldwide, it is not as common as some other zoonotic diseases.\n\n4. Anthrax is a bacterial disease that is primarily spread through contact with infected animals or their products, particularly in agricultural settings. While anthrax is a serious disease, it is not as common as some other zoonotic diseases.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most common widespread zoonotic disease in the world is Leptospirosis.",
