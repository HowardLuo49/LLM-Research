This is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that results in excessive production of adrenal androgens due to a deficiency in the enzyme 11 \u03b2 hydroxylase. This leads to virilization in females and hypertension due to mineralocorticoid excess. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2: 11 \u03b2 hydroxylase deficiency",
