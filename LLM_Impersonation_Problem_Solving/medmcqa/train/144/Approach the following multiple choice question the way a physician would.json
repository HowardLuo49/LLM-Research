Atherosclerosis typically begins with the formation of fatty streaks, which are composed of lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells within the intima of the artery. Intimal thickening and plaque formation are later stages in the development of atherosclerosis. Fibrinoid necrosis is not typically associated with the early stages of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the correct answer is 1: Fatty streaks.",
