    "gpt_response": "To calculate the daily water requirement in a child, we need to consider various factors such as weight, height, and body surface area. In this case, the child weighs 30 kgs, has a height of 123 cm, and a body surface area of 1 m2.\n\nA commonly used formula to estimate daily water requirement in children is the Holliday-Segar method, which calculates it based on weight. According to this method, a child's daily water requirement is typically around 100 ml/kg for the first 10 kgs, 50 ml/kg for the next 10 kgs, and 20 ml/kg for each additional kg.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the daily water requirement for a 30 kg child:\n\n10 kg x 100 ml/kg = 1000 ml\n10 kg x 50 ml/kg = 500 ml\n10 kg x 20 ml/kg = 200 ml\n\nAdding these together, the total daily water requirement for a 30 kg child would be 1700 ml (1000 ml + 500 ml + 200 ml).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n2: 1700 ml.",
