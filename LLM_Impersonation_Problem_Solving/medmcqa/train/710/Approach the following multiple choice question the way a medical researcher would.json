    "gpt_response": "To determine the daily water requirement for a child weighing 30 kgs, with a height of 123 cm and a body surface area of 1 m2, a medical researcher would typically consider factors such as the child's metabolic rate, activity level, and overall health status.\n\nOne common formula used to calculate baseline fluid requirements is the Holliday-Segar method, which recommends a daily fluid intake of 100 ml/kg for the first 10 kg of body weight, 50 ml/kg for the next 10 kg, and 20 ml/kg for each additional kg.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the daily water requirement for a child weighing 30 kgs:\n- For the first 10 kg: 10 kg x 100 ml/kg = 1000 ml\n- For the next 10 kg: 10 kg x 50 ml/kg = 500 ml\n- For the remaining 10 kg: 10 kg x 20 ml/kg = 200 ml\n\nTotal daily water requirement = 1000 ml + 500 ml + 200 ml = 1700 ml\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n2: 1700 ml",
