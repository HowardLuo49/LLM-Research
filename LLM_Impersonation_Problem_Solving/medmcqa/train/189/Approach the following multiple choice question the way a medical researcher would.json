    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by reviewing the current literature on mediastinal lymph node calcification. I would consider each of the provided options (metastatic neoplasm, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis) and their known associations with mediastinal lymph node calcification. I would also consider any known risk factors or patterns of calcification seen in each condition.\n\nBased on my research, I would determine that sarcoidosis is most commonly associated with mediastinal lymph node calcification. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that often affects the lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs. Calcification of mediastinal lymph nodes is a characteristic finding in sarcoidosis, and is seen in up to 40% of cases.\n\nTherefore, as a medical researcher, I would select option 3: Sarcoidosis as the most likely answer to the question regarding mediastinal lymph node calcification.",
