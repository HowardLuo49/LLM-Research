Therefore, option 3, renal clearance, would likely be a significant factor in the pharmacokinetic changes occurring in geriatric patients.\n\nLiver metabolism can also be affected in the geriatric population due to changes in liver function, so option 2 could also play a role in pharmacokinetic changes.\n\nGastric absorption may also be affected in the geriatric population due to changes in gastrointestinal motility and pH, but this may be less pronounced compared to renal and liver function changes.\n\nHypersensitivity, on the other hand, is not a pharmacokinetic change but rather a potential side effect of medications that can occur in any patient population.\n\nTherefore, based on the physiological changes typically seen in geriatric patients, options 2 and 3 would be the most likely choices for the pharmokinetic change occurring in geriatric patients.",
