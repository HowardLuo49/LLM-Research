Geriatric patients often experience changes in drug absorption, metabolism, distribution, and elimination due to alterations in organ function and physiological processes with aging.\n\nIn this case, looking at the options provided:\n1: Gastric absorption - This is one of the factors that can affect drug absorption in geriatric patients as there may be changes in gastric pH, motility, and surface area for absorption.\n2: Liver metabolism - This is also a significant factor as liver function can decline with age, leading to reduced metabolism of drugs and potential for drug accumulation.\n3: Renal clearance - This is another important consideration as renal function typically decreases with age, affecting drug elimination and potentially leading to drug accumulation and toxicity.\n4: Hypersensitivity - This option is not related to pharmacokinetic changes in geriatric patients and is likely not the correct answer in this context.\n\nBased on the information provided, I would choose option 2: Liver metabolism, as one of the key pharmacokinetic changes occurring in geriatric patients is alterations in drug metabolism due to age-related changes in liver function.",
