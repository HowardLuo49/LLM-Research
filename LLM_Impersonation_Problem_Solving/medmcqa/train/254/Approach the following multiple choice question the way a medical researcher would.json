Mefloquine is also not recommended as a first-line treatment due to concerns about drug resistance and side effects. \n\nArtemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is currently recommended as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria by the World Health Organization and other international health organizations. These combinations typically include an artemisinin derivative and another anti-malarial drug to improve efficacy and reduce the risk of resistance. \n\nProguanil is not typically used as a first-line treatment for Falciparum Malaria and is often combined with other anti-malarial drugs for prevention or treatment of other types of malaria. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the drug of choice for Falciparum Malaria is 3: ACT.",
