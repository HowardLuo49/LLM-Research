    "gpt_response": "To determine the daily maintenance fluid for a child weighing 24 kg, we can use the Holliday-Segar method. \n\nAccording to the formula, the daily maintenance fluid requirement for a child weighing 24 kg is calculated as follows: \n- 100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg\n- 50 mL/kg for the second 10 kg\n- 20 mL/kg for every additional kg \n\nSo, for a child weighing 24 kg: \n- 10 kg x 100 mL = 1000 mL\n- 10 kg x 50 mL = 500 mL\n- 4 kg x 20 mL = 80 mL\n\nAdding these together, the total daily maintenance fluid requirement is 1000 mL + 500 mL + 80 mL = 1580 mL\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 4: 1580 mL/day.",
