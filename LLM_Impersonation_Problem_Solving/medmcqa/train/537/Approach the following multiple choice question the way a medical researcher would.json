    "gpt_response": "To determine the appropriate daily maintenance fluid for a child weighing 24 kg, a medical researcher would first calculate the fluid requirements based on the child's weight. \n\nThe most commonly used formula for calculating maintenance fluid requirements in pediatric patients is the Holliday-Segar method. According to this method, the daily maintenance fluid requirement for a child weighing 24 kg would be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst 10 kg: 100 mL/kg/day\nNext 10 kg: 50 mL/kg/day\nRemaining kg: 20 mL/kg/day\n\nFor a 24 kg child:\n(10 kg x 100 mL/kg/day) + (10 kg x 50 mL/kg/day) + (4 kg x 20 mL/kg/day) = 1000 mL/day + 500 mL/day + 80 mL/day = 1580 mL/day\n\nTherefore, the appropriate daily maintenance fluid for a child weighing 24 kg would be 1580 mL/day, which corresponds to option 4.",
