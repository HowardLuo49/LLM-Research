This statement is true, as Remifentanyl is rapidly metabolized by plasma esterases in the blood.\n\nb) Remifentanyl has a short half-life. This statement is true, as Remifentanyl has a very short half-life of only a few minutes.\n\nc) Remifentanyl is more potent than Alfentanil. This statement is true, as Remifentanyl is considered to be more potent than Alfentanil.\n\nd) Dose of Remifentanyl is reduced in hepatic and renal disease. This statement is true, as Remifentanyl is primarily eliminated by metabolism in the liver and excretion in the kidneys, so the dose needs to be reduced in patients with hepatic and renal impairment.\n\ne) Duration of action of Remifentanyl is more than Alfentanil. This statement is false, as Remifentanyl has a shorter duration of action compared to Alfentanil.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each statement, the correct answer would be option 3: abc.",
