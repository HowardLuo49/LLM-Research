This would involve looking at studies that have measured umbilical cord length in various populations and conducting a meta-analysis to determine the range of typical umbilical cord lengths.\n\nBased on the available research, the most accurate answer to the question would likely be option 3: 30-100 cms. This range encompasses the typical lengths reported in the literature and reflects the variation that can be observed in umbilical cord length among different individuals.",
