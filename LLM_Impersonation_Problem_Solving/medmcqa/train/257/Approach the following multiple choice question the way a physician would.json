    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 1: Hepato-pulmonary syndrome. Platypnea refers to dyspnea that worsens in the upright position and improves when lying down. It is commonly seen in patients with hepato-pulmonary syndrome, a condition characterized by liver disease, pulmonary vascular dilatations, and gas exchange abnormalities leading to hypoxemia. Hepato-renal syndrome is associated with renal dysfunction in patients with advanced liver disease, renal artery stenosis is a narrowing of the renal arteries, and kyphoscoliosis is a deformity of the spine and ribcage.",
