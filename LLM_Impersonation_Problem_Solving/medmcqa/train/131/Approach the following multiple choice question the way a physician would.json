PCR can detect even very small amounts of the bacteria's genetic material, making it a reliable method for diagnosis. Direct fluorescent antibody test and enzyme immunoassay can also be used, but may not be as sensitive as PCR. Culture on irradiated McConkey cells may not be as sensitive or specific for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis infection compared to molecular methods like PCR.",
