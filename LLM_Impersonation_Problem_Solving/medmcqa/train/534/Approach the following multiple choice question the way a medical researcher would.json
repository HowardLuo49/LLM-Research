    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the ideal method to prevent aspiration pneumonia would be the use of a cuffed endotracheal tube. This is because a cuffed endotracheal tube helps to seal off the airway, preventing the aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs. Inhalational anesthesia, increased intra-abdominal pressure, and a full stomach can all potentially increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.",
