A spinal anaesthetic works by blocking the transmission of nerve signals in the spinal cord, leading to loss of sensation and muscle function in the lower extremities. \n\nOption 1: Motor and sensory only - This is not correct as a spinal anaesthetic block also affects autonomic nerves which control involuntary functions such as blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nOption 2: Sensory and autonomic nerves only - This is also not correct as motor nerves are also affected by a spinal anaesthetic block.\n\nOption 3: Sensory nerves only - This is partially correct as sensory nerves are definitely affected by a spinal anaesthetic block, leading to loss of sensation in the lower extremities.\n\nOption 4: Sensory, autonomic and motor nerves - This is the most correct option as all three types of nerves are affected by a spinal anaesthetic block.
