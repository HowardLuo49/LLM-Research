    "gpt_response": "In assessing the structural elements of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), it is important to consider the anatomy and function of each component. The TMJ is a complex joint that allows for movement of the jaw for activities such as chewing and speaking. \n\nWhen considering the options provided, it is important to note that all of the structures listed play a role in the function of the TMJ. The sigmoid notch is a groove in the temporal bone that articulates with the mandibular condyle. The articular disc is a fibrous cartilage structure that helps cushion and stabilize the joint. The capsular ligament surrounds and supports the joint, providing stability. \n\nThe structure listed that is not a direct structural element of the TMJ is joint cavities. Joint cavities are not specific anatomical structures within the TMJ. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4: Joint cavities",
