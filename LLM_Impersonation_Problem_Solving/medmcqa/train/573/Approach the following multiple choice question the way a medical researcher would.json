The TMJ is a synovial joint that allows for movement of the mandible, and its structural elements include the articular disc, capsular ligament, and joint cavities. The sigmoid notch is not typically considered a structural element of the TMJ, as it is a feature of the mandibular condyle rather than a component of the actual joint. Therefore, the correct answer is 1: Sigmoid notch.",
