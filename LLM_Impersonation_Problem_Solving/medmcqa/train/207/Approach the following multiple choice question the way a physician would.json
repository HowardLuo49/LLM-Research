In this case, calcium silicate based materials are commonly used in dental procedures. \n\n1: MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) is a commonly used calcium silicate based material in endodontic procedures, as it is biocompatible and promotes healing. It is often used for root canal treatments and as a retrofilling material. \n\n2: Geristore is a resin modified glass ionomer material, not a calcium silicate based material.\n\n3: Dieket is not a known material in the context of dental procedures.\n\n4: Retroplast is a retrofilling material used in endodontic procedures, but is not specifically known as a calcium silicate based material.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge, I would confidently select option 1: MTA as the correct answer.",
