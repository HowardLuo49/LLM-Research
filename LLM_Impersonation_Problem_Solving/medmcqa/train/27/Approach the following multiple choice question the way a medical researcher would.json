    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by considering the most likely causative agent based on the known epidemiology and pathophysiology of recurrent meningitis due to CSF leaks. In this case, the most common agent associated with recurrent meningitis due to CSF leaks is actually S. pneumoniae, or pneumococci. This bacterium is known to cause recurrent meningitis in individuals with CSF leaks, particularly those with underlying conditions such as skull base fractures or prior surgical procedures. Therefore, I would select option 2: Pneumococci as the correct answer.",
