    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when approaching this multiple choice question, it is important to consider the principles of surgical classifications based on the level of microbial contamination.\n\nA hemicolectomy for carcinoma colon surgery is typically considered a clean-contaminated procedure. This is because although the colon contains bacteria, efforts are made to maintain aseptic conditions and minimize the risk of infection during the surgery. Thus, the most appropriate answer choice for this scenario would be:\n\n2: Clean contaminated\n\nThis classification acknowledges that some level of contamination is expected during the procedure, but precautions are taken to minimize the risk of surgical site infection.",
