    "gpt_response": "A medical researcher would approach this question by considering the risk of surgical site infection based on the classification of the surgery. In this case, elective hemicolectomy for carcinoma colon would typically be classified as clean contaminated due to the presence of malignant tissue in the colon. This classification indicates that there is a higher risk of infection compared to clean surgeries, but lower than dirty or contaminated surgeries. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be:\n2: Clean contaminated.",
