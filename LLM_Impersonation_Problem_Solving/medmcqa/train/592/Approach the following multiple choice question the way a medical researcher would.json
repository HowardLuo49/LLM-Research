Generally, it is recommended to fill the crown slightly less than full to prevent the formation of bubbles and ensure proper adhesion.\n\nTherefore, in this case, option 1: 3/4th filled slightly upto the margin would likely be the most appropriate choice for an accurate and effective cementation of the crown.",
