    "gpt_response": "From a medical perspective, the correct answer would be option 1: 3/4th filled slightly up to the margin. This amount of luting agent is sufficient for proper cementation of the crown while minimizing the risk of bubbles forming. It is important to follow precise measurements and techniques in order to achieve optimal results in dental procedures.",
