Therefore, the medical researcher may investigate each of the options in detail to determine which one does not have a strong association with vocal cord palsy.\n\nAfter conducting a thorough review and analysis, the medical researcher may conclude that Left atrial enlargement is not typically associated with vocal cord palsy, making it the likely correct answer to the multiple choice question.",
