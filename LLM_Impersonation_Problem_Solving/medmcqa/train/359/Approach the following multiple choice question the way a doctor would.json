Vocal cord palsy is often caused by damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, typically as a result of compression or injury. The most common causes of vocal cord palsy include trauma, surgery, neurological conditions, and tumors.\n\nGiven this information, I would eliminate options that are commonly associated with conditions that could potentially cause vocal cord palsy. Vertebral secondaries, left atrial enlargement, and secondaries in the mediastinum are all related to cancer and tumors, which are known to potentially compress the recurrent laryngeal nerve and lead to vocal cord palsy. On the other hand, bronchogenic carcinoma specifically refers to lung cancer, which has a known association with vocal cord palsy.\n\nTherefore, as a doctor, I would conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n3: Bronchogenic carcinoma",
