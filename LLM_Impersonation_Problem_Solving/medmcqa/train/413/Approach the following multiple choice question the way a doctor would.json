    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, it is important to select the appropriate agent for storing tissue during an autopsy for virology study in order to ensure accurate results and preservation of the tissue samples. In this case, the most suitable option would be 50% glycerine. Glycerine is commonly used for tissue preservation as it helps prevent tissue dehydration and degradation, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the tissue samples for virology studies. Therefore, option 4: 50% glycerine would be the correct choice in this scenario.",
