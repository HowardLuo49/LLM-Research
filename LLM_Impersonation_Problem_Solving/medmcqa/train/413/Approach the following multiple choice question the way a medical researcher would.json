    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher interested in virology studies, it is important to consider the best agent for storing tissue during autopsy to preserve the integrity of the viral particles for analysis. Out of the options provided, 50% glycerine would be the most appropriate choice for storing tissue. Glycerine is a widely used agent for tissue preservation due to its ability to prevent tissue degradation and maintain the structure of the tissue samples, including viral particles. Sodium chloride, alcohol, and rectified spirit may not be as effective in preserving tissue for virology studies.",
