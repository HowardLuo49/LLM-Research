    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when approaching this multiple-choice question regarding inherited hyperammonemia, it is important to recall the key enzymes of the Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle and their functions. In this case, inherited hyperammonemia typically results from a deficiency of N-acetyl glutamate synthetase, which is responsible for activating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, an important enzyme in the urea cycle. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:\n\n3: N-acetyl glutamate synthetase",
