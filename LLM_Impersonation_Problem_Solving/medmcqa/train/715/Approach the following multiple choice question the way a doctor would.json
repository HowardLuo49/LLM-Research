Based on my knowledge, the correct answer is 11. Wilm's tumor is associated with a genetic defect on chromosome 11, specifically within the WT1 gene. This gene plays a crucial role in kidney development and is often mutated in patients with Wilm's tumor. Therefore, the correct answer is option 1: 11.",
