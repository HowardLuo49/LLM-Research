Patient gives a history of road traffic accident 5 hours ago and had a lacerated wound on lower back region. General physical examination reveals-\nBlood pressure-80/60mmHg.\nJuglar venous pressure- low.\nPulsus paradoxus- present.\nCardiac output- Increased.\nThe patient is in which type of shock?\n1: Neurogenic\n2: Obstructive\n3: Distributive\n4: Hypovolemic",
    "solution": 3,
    "gpt_response": "The patient is experiencing hypovolemic shock. This is evident by the history of road traffic accident leading to blood loss from the lacerated wound on the lower back region, along with the low blood pressure, increased cardiac output, and presence of pulsus paradoxus. These findings are consistent with hypovolemic shock, which is characterized by a decrease in circulating blood volume leading to inadequate tissue perfusion.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 3?: The patient is experiencing hypovolemic shock. This is evident by the history of road traffic accident leading to blood loss from the lacerated wound on the lower back region, along with the low blood pressure, increased cardiac output, and presence of pulsus paradoxus. These findings are consistent with hypovolemic shock, which is characterized by a decrease in circulating blood volume leading to inadequate tissue perfusion.",
