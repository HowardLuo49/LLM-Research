    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by analyzing each component in relation to the transport system within a biological context.\n\n1: Receptor activation - Receptor activation is a crucial component in cell signaling and communication, but it is not typically considered a component of a transport system. Receptor activation is involved in signaling pathways and response to extracellular stimuli.\n\n2: Selective gate - Selective gates are often involved in transport systems, specifically in regulating the passage of molecules or ions through a membrane. Selective gates help control the movement of substances in and out of cells.\n\n3: Non-selective channel - Non-selective channels are also important components of transport systems, as they allow for the passive movement of molecules or ions down their concentration gradient through a channel in a membrane.\n\n4: Energy coupling system - Energy coupling systems are essential in many transport processes, as they provide the energy necessary for active transport mechanisms. Energy coupling systems are involved in processes such as the pumping of ions against their concentration gradient.\n\nBased on this analysis, the component that is not typically considered a component of a transport system in a biological context is:\n1: Receptor activation\n\nTherefore, the answer to the multiple choice question is:\n1: Receptor activation",
