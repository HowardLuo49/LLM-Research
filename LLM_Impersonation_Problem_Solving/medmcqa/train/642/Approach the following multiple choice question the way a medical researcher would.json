Option 1 and 2 are expressed in decimal form, which is not a standard way to represent concentrations of drugs in medical research. Option 3 and 4 are both expressed in ratios, with option 4 being more diluted than option 3. Based on typical concentrations used in medical procedures, a concentration of 1:200,000 is more commonly seen when using adrenaline with lidocaine. Therefore, the correct answer is 4: 1:200,000.",
