In this case, an absolute contraindication for prescribing oral contraceptive pills in a young female of reproductive age would be impaired liver function. This is because oral contraceptives are metabolized in the liver and can potentially exacerbate existing liver conditions or lead to further complications. It is important to assess liver function tests before prescribing oral contraceptives in this scenario. Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are not absolute contraindications for oral contraceptive pills, but may require closer monitoring and consideration of potential risks and benefits.",
