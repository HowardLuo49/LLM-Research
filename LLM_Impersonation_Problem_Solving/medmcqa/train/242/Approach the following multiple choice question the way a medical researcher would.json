Neurogenic shock is characterized by a loss of sympathetic tone, leading to peripheral vasodilation. This vasodilation results in decreased peripheral resistance, which in turn can lead to a decrease in cardiac output.\n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer would be:\n\n1: \u2191Peripheral resistance \u2193 cardiac output\n\nThis is because an increase in peripheral resistance would typically lead to an increase in cardiac output to overcome the resistance, while a decrease in peripheral resistance would result in a decrease in cardiac output.
