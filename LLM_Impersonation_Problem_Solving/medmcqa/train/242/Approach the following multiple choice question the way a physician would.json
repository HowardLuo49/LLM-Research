Neurogenic shock is a type of distributive shock that typically results from damage to the nervous system, leading to a loss of sympathetic tone and vasomotor tone, which can cause a decrease in systemic vascular resistance.\n\nBased on this understanding, I would eliminate options 2 and 4, as they suggest an increase in cardiac output, which is not typically seen in neurogenic shock. \n\nI would then focus on options 1 and 3, which both mention a decrease in peripheral resistance. In neurogenic shock, there is often a decrease in peripheral resistance due to vasodilation, which can lead to a decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to this question would be option 1: \u2191Peripheral resistance \u2193 cardiac output.",
