I would then consider the physiological mechanisms involved in neurogenic shock, focusing on the relationship between peripheral resistance, cardiac output, venous return, and venoconstriction.\n\nBased on my medical knowledge, the correct answer would be:\n\n1: \u2191Peripheral resistance \u2193 cardiac output\n\nThis is because in neurogenic shock, there is a loss of sympathetic tone leading to peripheral vasodilation and decreased peripheral resistance. This results in a decrease in cardiac output due to decreased venous return. Venoconstriction may help to increase venous return and cardiac output in this situation.",
