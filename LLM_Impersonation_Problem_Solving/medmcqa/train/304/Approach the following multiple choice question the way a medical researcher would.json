    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this multiple choice question by recognizing that symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are unique compared to other anxiety disorders. In order to differentiate PTSD from other anxiety disorders, I would focus on specific symptoms that are characteristic of PTSD.\n\nOut of the four options provided, both nightmares and hypervigilance are symptoms commonly associated with PTSD. However, the re-living of a past adverse event is a hallmark symptom of PTSD known as \"intrusive thoughts\" or \"flashbacks\". Avoidance is also a key symptom of PTSD, where individuals may go to great lengths to avoid reminders of the traumatic event.\n\nTherefore, as a medical researcher, I would choose option 2: Re-living of past adverse event as the symptom that helps differentiate PTSD from other anxiety disorders.",
