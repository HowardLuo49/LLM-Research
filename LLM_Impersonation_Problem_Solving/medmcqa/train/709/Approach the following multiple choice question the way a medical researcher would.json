Within 5 minutes, he developed genralised urticaria, swelling of lips, hypotension and bronchospasm. The first choice of treatment is to administer:\n1: chlorphenitramine inj.\n2: Epinephrine inj.\n3: High dose hydrocortisone tablet\n4: nebulised salbutamol",

    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the first step in approaching this question would be to assess the symptoms presented by the patient. The development of generalised urticaria, swelling of lips, hypotension, and bronchospasm following the administration of penicillin intravenously suggests an immediate allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.\n\nIn cases of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, the first-line treatment is typically epinephrine injection. Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) acts quickly to reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis by constricting blood vessels, increasing heart rate, and opening airways.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice of treatment for this patient would be:\n\n2: Epinephrine injection\n\nIt is important to administer epinephrine promptly to prevent the progression of the allergic reaction to a life-threatening situation. Additional treatments such as antihistamines (such as chlorpheniramine), corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone), and bronchodilators (such as salbutamol) may be administered as needed, but epinephrine is the most critical initial intervention.",
