Broken teeth and excessive resorption of the ridge can affect the fit and function of the denture, making relining necessary.\n\nOption 3, on the other hand, suggests a scenario where the vertical dimension of the denture is excessively reduced and needs to be changed. This is a valid reason for relining a complete denture to ensure proper alignment and function.\n\nOption 4, stating that centric relation does not coincide with centric occlusion, is also a valid reason for relining a complete denture. This discrepancy can lead to issues with the patient's bite and overall oral health.\n\nTherefore, based on clinical reasoning, the answer is not indicated when the denture contains broken teeth (option 1) or there is excessive resorption of the ridge (option 2).",
