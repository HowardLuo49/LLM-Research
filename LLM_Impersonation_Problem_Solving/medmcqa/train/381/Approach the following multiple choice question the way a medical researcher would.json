    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by first considering the properties of magaldrate and how it interacts with gastric acid in the stomach. Magaldrate is a compound that is commonly used as an antacid to help neutralize stomach acid.\n\nIn this case, magaldrate is known to react with gastric acid to form magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide. Therefore, based on this information, I would select option 3: Magnesium hydroxide and Aluminium hydroxide as the correct answer.",
