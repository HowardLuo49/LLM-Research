Fibrous joints are joints where adjacent bones are united by collagen fibers, providing minimal movement. \n\nNext, I would carefully read each option and identify which joints are fibrous joints based on my medical knowledge. \n\n1: Pubic symphysis - This is a fibrous joint located between the pubic bones in the pelvis, allowing for limited movement during childbirth. \n2: Fronto parietal suture - This is a fibrous joint found between the frontal and parietal bones of the skull, allowing for growth during childhood. \n3: Manubrio sternal joint - This is a cartilaginous joint between the manubrium and the sternum, not a fibrous joint. \n4: Inf. radio ulnar joint - This is a synovial joint between the radius and ulna in the forearm, not a fibrous joint. \n\nBased on my knowledge, I would select options 1 and 2 as the correct answers for fibrous joints.",
