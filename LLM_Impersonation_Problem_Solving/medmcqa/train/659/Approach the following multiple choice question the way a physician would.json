There is no h/o burning micturition or pyuria. Urine routine examination demonstrated no pus cells and urine culture was sterile. Serum C3 levels were normal. What is the most probable diagnosis-\n1: Wilm's tumour\n2: IgA nephropathy\n3: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis\n4: Urinaiy tract infection",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would consider IgA nephropathy as the most probable diagnosis in this case. IgA nephropathy is a condition where the antibody immunoglobulin A lodges in the kidneys, leading to inflammation and recurrent episodes of hematuria. The normal serum C3 levels and sterile urine culture suggest that this is not a bacterial infection, ruling out urinary tract infection. Wilm's tumor is a type of kidney cancer that is rare in infants and young children, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis typically occurs after a streptococcal infection, which is not mentioned in this case. Therefore, IgA nephropathy is the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided.",
