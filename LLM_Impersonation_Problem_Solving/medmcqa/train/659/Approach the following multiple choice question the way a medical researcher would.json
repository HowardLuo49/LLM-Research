There is no h/o burning micturition or pyuria. Urine routine examination demonstrated no pus cells and urine culture was sterile. Serum C3 levels were normal. What is the most probable diagnosis-\n1: Wilm's tumour\n2: IgA nephropathy\n3: Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis\n4: Urinaiy tract infection",

    "gpt_response": "When approaching this multiple choice question as a medical researcher, the first step would be to consider the clinical presentation of the patient. In this case, the six year old male baby has been experiencing recurrent gross hematuria for 2 years without any other symptoms such as burning micturition or pyuria. \n\nNext, it is important to consider the findings from the urine routine examination and serum C3 levels. The absence of pus cells in the urine and normal serum C3 levels make a urinary tract infection less likely. Additionally, the sterile urine culture also does not support a diagnosis of urinary tract infection.\n\nGiven the history of recurrent gross hematuria and the normal serum C3 levels, IgA nephropathy is a more likely diagnosis. IgA nephropathy is a condition characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomeruli of the kidneys, leading to inflammation and eventually hematuria. \n\nTherefore, the most probable diagnosis in this case would be 2: IgA nephropathy.",
