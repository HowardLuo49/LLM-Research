    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would choose option 2: Atracurium. Muscle relaxants such as Atracurium are commonly used in patients with renal failure as they are metabolized through Hofmann elimination and do not rely on renal excretion for clearance. This makes them a safer option compared to other muscle relaxants such as Pancuronium, which is dependent on renal clearance and may accumulate in patients with renal failure. Additionally, options 1 (Ketamine) and 4 (Fentanyl) are not muscle relaxants and are not typically used in renal failure for this purpose.",
