Atracurium is metabolized by Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis, independent of renal function, making it a safer choice in patients with impaired kidney function. \n\nKetamine, Pancuronium, and Fentanyl are not ideal choices for muscle relaxation in patients with renal failure due to their renal elimination and potential for accumulation in the body.",
