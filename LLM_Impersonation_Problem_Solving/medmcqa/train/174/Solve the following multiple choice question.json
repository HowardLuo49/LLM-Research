In a patient with a type of familial dyslipidemias he presented with palmar Xanthomas and he ias at increased risk of atherosclerosis and CAD.In Lipid profile there was elevation of triacylglycerols and cholesterol.And the IDL and chylomicrons were elevated.What is the pathophysiology of the condition?\n1: LDL deficiency\n2: VLDL overproduction\n3: Apo C-2 deficiency\n4: Apo E deficiency",
    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "4: Apo E deficiency\n\nApo E deficiency is a type of familial dyslipidemia that can result in elevated levels of triacylglycerols and cholesterol, as well as increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. This condition is characterized by the inability of the body to properly clear chylomicron remnants, which leads to the accumulation of these particles in the blood. This can result in the formation of xanthomas, particularly on the palms, as well as other symptoms associated with dyslipidemia.",
