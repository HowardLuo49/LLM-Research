A patient with cushinoid features presents with hemoptysis; he shows no response to dexamethasone suppression test; most likely diagnosis here is:\n1: Adrenal hyperplasia\n2: Adrenal adenoma\n3: Ca lung with ectopic ACTH production\n4: Pituitary microadenoma",

    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we have a patient with Cushingoid features presenting with hemoptysis, along with a lack of response to the dexamethasone suppression test. Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis would be ectopic ACTH production, commonly associated with lung cancer. Therefore, the correct answer is 3: Ca lung with ectopic ACTH production. \n\nTo further confirm this diagnosis, further tests such as high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, CRH stimulation test, and imaging studies would be recommended. Treatment would involve addressing the underlying lung cancer and managing the hormone excess with medications or surgical intervention as needed.",
