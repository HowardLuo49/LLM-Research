    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by first identifying the topic, which is the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex. This reflex helps maintain stable vision during head movements by coordinating eye movements with input from the vestibular system. \n\nNext, I would recall the anatomy involved in this reflex. The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex is mediated primarily by the flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum, which is involved in coordinating eye movements. \n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge as a doctor, the correct answer to this multiple choice question would be:\n1: Flocculonodular Lobe.",
