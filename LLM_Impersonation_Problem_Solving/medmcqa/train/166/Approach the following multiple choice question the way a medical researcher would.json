    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would carefully analyze each option in the context of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is responsible for stabilizing our vision during head movements by coordinating eye movements with head movements. \n\nThe correct answer for the part of the brain that mediates the VOR is the flocculonodular lobe. This area of the cerebellum plays a crucial role in integrating information from the vestibular system and coordinating eye movements to maintain visual stability.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge as a medical researcher, I would confidently choose option 1: Flocculonodular Lobe as the part of the brain that mediates the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex.",
