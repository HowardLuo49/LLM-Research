    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a medical researcher, we would first need to understand the characteristics of each potential diagnosis and how they relate to the provided information.\n\n1: Capillary hemangioma - Capillary hemangiomas are common vascular tumors typically found in infancy or early childhood. They are usually not well-defined and do not typically present with slowly progressive proptosis. Therefore, this is unlikely to be the correct diagnosis based on the characteristics provided.\n\n2: Cavernous hemangioma - Cavernous hemangiomas are vascular tumors that can occur at any age but are most commonly found in middle-aged adults. They are well-defined, slowly growing tumors that can cause proptosis. Given the retrobulbar location and age range mentioned in the question, this could be a possible diagnosis.\n\n3: Lymphangioma - Lymphangiomas are benign tumors of lymphatic vessels that are most commonly found in children. They are typically not well-defined and do not usually present with proptosis. Therefore, this is unlikely to be the correct diagnosis based on the characteristics provided.\n\n4: Hemangiopericytoma - Hemangiopericytomas are rare vascular tumors that typically occur in adults and are more commonly found in extracranial locations. They do not typically present with slowly progressive proptosis in the retrobulbar location. Therefore, this is unlikely to be the correct diagnosis based on the characteristics provided.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is 2: Cavernous hemangioma.
