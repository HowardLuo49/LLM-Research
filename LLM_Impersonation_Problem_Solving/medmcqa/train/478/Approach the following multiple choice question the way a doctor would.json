The retrobulbar location within the muscle cone, well defined capsule, slowly progressive proptosis, and occurrence in the 2nd to 4th decade are all important clinical features to consider.\n\nBased on these characteristics, the most likely diagnosis is 2: Cavernous hemangioma.Cavernous hemangiomas are slow-growing benign vascular tumors that commonly present in the retrobulbar space, have well-defined capsules, and typically occur in young to middle-aged adults. They are usually easily resectable and can cause proptosis due to their location within the orbit.",
