    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by looking at the accuracy, reliability, and practicality of each option in determining sex. \n\nIn terms of sex determination, the pelvis is the most useful bone. The pelvis has specific features that differ between males and females, such as the shape of the pelvic inlet, the width of the subpubic angle, and the overall size of the pelvis. These differences are indicative of the biological sex of an individual and are commonly used in forensic and archaeological contexts for sex determination.\n\nWhile the skull, femur, and tibia can also provide some information about sex, they are generally considered less reliable and accurate compared to the pelvis. The skull, for example, can be affected by environmental factors and cultural practices that may alter its features, making it less reliable for sex determination. The femur and tibia can also show some differences between males and females, but these differences are less pronounced and more variable compared to the pelvic bones.\n\nTherefore, the most useful bone for sex determination is the pelvis.",
