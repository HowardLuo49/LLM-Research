    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is: 1: Glutamate\n\nMedical researchers would approach this question by recalling their knowledge of vitamin K's role in the posttranslational modification of proteins. Vitamin K is essential for the conversion of glutamate residues on certain proteins to gamma-carboxyglutamate residues, which is important for their proper functioning in a variety of physiological processes. Therefore, the correct answer is glutamate.",
