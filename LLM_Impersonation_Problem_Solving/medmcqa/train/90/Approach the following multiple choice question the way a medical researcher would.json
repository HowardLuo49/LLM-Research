The most appropriate test for the diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis in this case would be CSF PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. This test is highly sensitive and specific for identifying DNA or RNA from bacteria causing meningitis in the CSF sample. CSF examination can also be helpful in identifying specific markers of inflammation. Widal test is typically used for diagnosing typhoid fever, while a PET scan is more commonly used for imaging purposes and may not be specific for diagnosing pyogenic meningitis.",
