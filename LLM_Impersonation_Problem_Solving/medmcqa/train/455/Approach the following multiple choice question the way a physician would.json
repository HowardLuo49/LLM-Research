In this case, the baby exhibits signs of respiratory distress including expiratory grunting and synchronized upper chest movement. However, the absence of chest or xiphoid retractions suggests that the respiratory distress is not as severe. Based on this information, I would assign a Silverman score of 2 to this preterm baby.",
