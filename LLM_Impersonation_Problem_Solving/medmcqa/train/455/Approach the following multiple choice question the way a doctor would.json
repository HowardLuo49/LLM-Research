The absence of chest or xiphoid retractions suggests a less severe form of respiratory distress. The presence of synchronised upper chest movement, minimal nasal flare, and expiratory grunting indicate increased work of breathing.\n\nBased on the Silverman score criteria, a score of 3 would be most appropriate in this case.
