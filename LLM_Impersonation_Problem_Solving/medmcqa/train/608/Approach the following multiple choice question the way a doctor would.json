One of the three children has deafness with similar facial features. The mother is normal. Which one of the following is most likely pattern of inheritance in this case?\n1: Autosomal dominant\n2: Autosomal recessive\n3: X-linked dominant\n4: X-linked recessive",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "Based on the symptoms presented in the family members described, the most likely pattern of inheritance in this case is X-linked recessive. The presence of deafness and facial features in the father and one of the children suggest an X-linked trait, as deafness is often associated with X-linked inheritance. The fact that the mother is normal also supports the likelihood of X-linked recessive inheritance, as females would typically be carriers of the trait but not exhibit symptoms themselves.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: Based on the symptoms presented in the family members described, the most likely pattern of inheritance in this case is X-linked recessive. The presence of deafness and facial features in the father and one of the children suggest an X-linked trait, as deafness is often associated with X-linked inheritance.
