    "gpt_response": "As a physician, when presented with a family history of widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair, deafness in the father and one of the children, and a normal mother, I would consider the most likely pattern of inheritance in this case. Given the presence of similar facial features and deafness in both the father and one of the children, this suggests a genetic condition that may be inherited. \n\nBased on the presentation of the symptoms, the most likely pattern of inheritance in this case would be X-linked recessive. X-linked recessive conditions are more likely to affect males as they only have one X chromosome, and if a male inherits a recessive allele for a condition located on the X chromosome, they will display symptoms. In this case, the father and one of the children (presumably a son) have deafness and facial features, while the mother, who is normal, would be a carrier of the recessive allele.\n\nTherefore, the most likely pattern of inheritance in this case would be X-linked recessive.",
