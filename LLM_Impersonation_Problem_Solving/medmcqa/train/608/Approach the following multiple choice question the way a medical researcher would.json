One of the three children has deafness with similar facial features. The mother is normal. Which one of the following is most likely pattern of inheritance in this case?\n1: Autosomal dominant\n2: Autosomal recessive\n3: X-linked dominant\n4: X-linked recessive",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would analyze the symptoms presented in the family to determine the most likely pattern of inheritance. Since the father has characteristics such as widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair, and deafness, it is possible that he may have a genetic disorder that is being passed down to his children. The fact that one of the children has deafness with similar facial features suggests that the condition is present in at least two generations of the family.\n\nBased on the symptoms and the pattern of inheritance, the most likely option in this case would be autosomal dominant inheritance. This is because an autosomal dominant condition only requires one copy of the abnormal gene to be expressed and can be passed down from one affected parent to their children.\n\nX-linked dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance are less likely in this case given that the mother is normal and these patterns of inheritance typically involve the X chromosome. Autosomal recessive inheritance would also be less likely as both parents would need to be carriers of the abnormal gene in order for it to be passed down to their children.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, autosomal dominant inheritance is the most likely pattern in this family.",
