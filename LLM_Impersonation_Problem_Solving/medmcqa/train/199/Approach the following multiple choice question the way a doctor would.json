    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when considering the gene involved in Cowden syndrome, it is important to have a strong understanding of the genetic basis of the condition. Cowden syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is associated with mutations in the PTEN gene. Therefore, the correct answer to this multiple choice question would be option 2: PTEN. This gene plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and division, and mutations in PTEN can lead to the development of tumors, which are characteristic of Cowden syndrome. It is important for healthcare providers to be familiar with the genetic basis of genetic conditions in order to provide accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment options for their patients.",
