    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the first step in approaching this question would be to review the available literature and studies on Cowden syndrome to understand the genetic basis of the condition. \n\nCowden syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple noncancerous, tumor-like growths called hamartomas and an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers. \n\nFrom the literature, we know that Cowden syndrome is caused by mutations in the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) gene, which acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in the PTEN gene lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division, which can result in the development of tumors and cancer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the multiple choice question is:\n2: PTEN",
