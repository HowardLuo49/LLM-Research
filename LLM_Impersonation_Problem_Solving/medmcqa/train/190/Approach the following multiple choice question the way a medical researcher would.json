Candle-wax spots, also known as cotton wool spots, are indicative of retinal microinfarcts or focal ischemia. In the context of infectious diseases, candle-wax spots are not typically associated with toxoplasmosis, syphilis, or tuberculosis. Instead, candle-wax spots are commonly seen in patients with sarcoidosis, which is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes. Therefore, the most likely answer to this question would be option 1: Sarcoidosis.",
