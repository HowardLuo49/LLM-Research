    "gpt_response": "The bone marrow finding in myelofibrosis typically includes a dry tap, which is described as hypocellular bone marrow. This is because the bone marrow is replaced by fibrous tissue, leading to difficulty in obtaining a sample during aspiration. Megaloblastic cells, microcytic cells, and thrombocytosis are not typically seen in myelofibrosis.",
