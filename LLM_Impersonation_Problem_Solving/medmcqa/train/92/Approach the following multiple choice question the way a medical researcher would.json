The direction of the nystagmus indicates the function of the vestibular system in the inner ear.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer would be:\n2: Opposite side \n\nThis is because cold water stimulation typically causes horizontal nystagmus towards the opposite side of the ear being irrigated.",
