    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the phase of minimum motion of the heart during cardiac imaging is an important consideration for accurate interpretation of images. In this case, the correct answer would be 3: Late diastole. This is because during late diastole, the heart is in a relatively quiet phase with minimal motion, allowing for more clear and detailed imaging of the structures within the heart. Understanding the timing of cardiac motion is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable imaging results.",
