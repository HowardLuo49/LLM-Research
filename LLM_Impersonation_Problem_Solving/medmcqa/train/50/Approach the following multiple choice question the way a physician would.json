    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by considering the recommended daily intake of iodine for optimal thyroid function and overall health. The recommended daily intake of iodine varies but is generally around 150-250 micrograms per day for adults. \n\nIodized salt is a common source of iodine in the diet and plays an important role in preventing iodine deficiency, particularly in populations where iodine-rich foods are scarce. \n\nBased on the iodine programme and the daily recommended intake of iodine, it is important to ensure that an adequate amount of iodine reaches the consumer level through iodized salt. Therefore, the minimum level of iodine in iodized salt should be sufficient to meet the daily iodine requirements.\n\nGiven the options provided, I would choose option 3: 15 ppm as it falls within a reasonable range to ensure an adequate level of iodine reaches the consumer level through iodized salt.",
