The minimum level of iodine should be sufficient to meet the iodine requirements of the population and prevent iodine deficiency disorders.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends a minimum level of iodine content in iodized salt of 15 ppm to prevent iodine deficiency. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the multiple choice question would be:\n3: 15 ppm",
