    "gpt_response": "Based on the information provided, I would first take note that the patient is a primi gravida, meaning this is her first pregnancy. Given that she has a height less than 150 cm, I would need to consider the potential impact of her height on her pregnancy and delivery. \n\nDuring the prenatal care appointments, I would monitor the patient closely for any signs of complications related to her height, such as increased risk of preterm labor or intrauterine growth restriction. I would also discuss with the patient the importance of proper nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy to support the developing fetus.\n\nIn terms of the multiple choice question, I would select option 3: 150 cm, as this is the highest height listed and therefore the most likely to be above the patient's actual height.",
