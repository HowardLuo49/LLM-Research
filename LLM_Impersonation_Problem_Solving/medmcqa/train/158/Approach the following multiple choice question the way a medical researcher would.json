    "gpt_response": "To address this question as a medical researcher, we would first need to understand the relevance of the height of a primigravida (a woman who is pregnant for the first time) in relation to her pregnancy. \n\nResearch studies have shown that maternal height can be a significant factor in predicting pregnancy outcomes, such as the risk of complications during childbirth or the likelihood of delivering a low birth weight baby. Shorter statured women may have a higher risk of certain complications due to the dimensions of their pelvis or other physiological factors.\n\nTo determine which height range is considered \"less than\" for a primigravida, we would need to consult medical literature or guidelines that provide specific cutoffs or thresholds for height in relation to pregnancy. These references may vary depending on the population being studied or the specific medical context.\n\nGiven the options provided in the question:\n1: 140 cm\n2: 145 cm\n3: 150 cm\n4: 135 cm\n\nWithout a definitive standard or guideline to refer to, we would need to consider the average height of women in the general population, as well as any known associations between height and pregnancy outcomes, to make an educated guess. For example, if the average height of primigravidas is around 160 cm in a particular population, we might consider 145 cm or 140 cm as being \"less than\" the typical height for a primigravida.\n\nUltimately, without more specific information or a clear reference point, we may not be able to definitively answer this question from a medical research perspective. Additional context or data would be needed to provide a more informed response.",
