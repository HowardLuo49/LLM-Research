They would likely refer to anatomical textbooks or scientific research articles for accurate information on the lymphatic drainage pathways in this area. Based on their knowledge, they would eliminate options that are not relevant to the lymphatic drainage of the posterior 1/3rd of the tongue. They may also consider any previous studies or research that has been conducted on this specific topic. Ultimately, the researcher would select the most appropriate answer based on their understanding of lymphatic anatomy and drainage patterns in the tongue.",
