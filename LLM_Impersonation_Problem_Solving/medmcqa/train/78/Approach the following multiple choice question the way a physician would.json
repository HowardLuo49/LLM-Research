This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, as well as cardiac issues. Becker muscular dystrophy typically presents with progressive muscle weakness in the legs and pelvis, limb-girdle dystrophy primarily affects the muscles of the shoulders and hips, and scapulofaciohumeral dystrophy involves weakness in the face, shoulder, and upper arm muscles.",
