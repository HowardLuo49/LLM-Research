There is h/o similar illness in father and brother but less severe. Her CPK level is also raised (500IU/L).

    "gpt_response": "A medical researcher would approach this question by considering the symptoms presented by the 14-year-old girl, her family history, and the raised CPK level. Based on the symptoms of quadriparesis, facial palsy, winging of scapula, and ptosis, as well as the family history of a similar illness in the father and brother, the researcher would likely suspect a form of muscular dystrophy. \n\nGiven the combination of symptoms and family history, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy would be the most likely diagnosis. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, specifically affecting the muscles of the shoulders, upper arms, and lower legs. Additionally, the raised CPK level is consistent with muscle damage seen in muscular dystrophies.\n\nTherefore, the researcher would likely choose option 1: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy as the most probable diagnosis for the 14-year-old girl.",
