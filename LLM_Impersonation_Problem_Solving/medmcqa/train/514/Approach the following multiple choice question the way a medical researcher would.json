    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the following is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids, a medical researcher would analyze the known pharmacological effects of opioids. \n\n1: Cough suppression - Opioids are known to act on the central nervous system and can suppress cough reflexes, making this a pharmacological action of opioids. \n\n2: Anti-emesis - Opioids can also exert antiemetic effects by acting on certain receptors in the brain, such as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This is a known pharmacological action of opioids. \n\n3: Miosis - Opioids commonly cause miosis, or constriction of the pupil, as a side effect. This is a well-known pharmacological action of opioids. \n\n4: Truncal rigidity - Truncal rigidity, or stiffness in the trunk of the body, is not typically associated with the pharmacological actions of opioids. Therefore, this would be the correct answer as the action that is NOT associated with opioids. \n\nIn conclusion, a medical researcher would determine that truncal rigidity is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids based on their knowledge of opioid effects.",
