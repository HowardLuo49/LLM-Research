    "gpt_response": "Based on my knowledge of toxicology and common cattle poisoning causes, I would eliminate options 1, 2, and 3 as they are not typically associated with linseed plant ingestion. Linseed plant poisoning in cattle is commonly caused by the presence of hydrocyanic acid, so I would choose option 4 as the correct answer. Additionally, I would consider symptoms such as difficulty breathing, muscle tremors, and ultimately death in cattle affected by this type of poisoning.",
