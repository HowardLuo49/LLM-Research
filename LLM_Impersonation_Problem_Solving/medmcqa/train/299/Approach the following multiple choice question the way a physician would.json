Nephrotoxicity is a known side effect of aminoglycosides, characterized by kidney damage. In this case, I would assess the nephrotoxicity potential of each aminoglycoside listed.\n\nBased on my understanding of aminoglycosides, I know that neomycin is associated with the highest nephrotoxicity among the options provided. Therefore, I would select option 4: Neomycin as the aminoglycoside with the highest nephrotoxicity.\n\nIt is important to consider the unique patient factors and clinical context when prescribing aminoglycosides to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity in individual patients.",
