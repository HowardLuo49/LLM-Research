In congenital tuberculosis, the primary infection typically occurs in the lungs, although it can also involve other sites such as the liver, lymph nodes, and skin. However, lung involvement is considered the most common site for primary complex in congenital tuberculosis cases. Therefore, the most likely answer would be:\n\n1: Lungs.",
