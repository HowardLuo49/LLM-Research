    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this multiple choice question by first understanding the condition of a Bicornuate Uterus. A Bicornuate Uterus is a congenital uterine malformation where the uterus is divided into two horns, potentially leading to reproductive issues such as infertility, miscarriages, and pregnancy complications.\n\nGiven this understanding, the most important indication for surgical repair of a Bicornuate Uterus would likely be option 4: Recurrent abortions. Repairing a Bicornuate Uterus can help reduce the risk of miscarriages and improve the chances of a successful pregnancy for women with this condition. Infertility may also be a concern, but recurrent abortions directly address the potential complications associated with the structural abnormality of the uterus.",
