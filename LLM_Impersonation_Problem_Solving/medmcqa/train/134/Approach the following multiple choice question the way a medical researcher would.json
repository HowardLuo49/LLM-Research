    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the best approach to this multiple choice question would be to critically analyze each option based on current research and evidence-based practices for treating congenital hydrocele.\n\n1: Eversion of sac - Eversion of the sac is a technique that involves turning the hydrocele sac inside out and leaving it in place. While this may have been a treatment option in the past, more current research suggests that it is not the most effective or recommended treatment for congenital hydrocele.\n\n2: Excision of sac - Excision of the hydrocele sac is a surgical procedure that involves removing the sac entirely. This is a common treatment option for congenital hydrocele, especially in cases where the hydrocele is large or causing symptoms.\n\n3: Lord's procedure - Lord's procedure is a technique that involves aspirating the fluid from the hydrocele sac and then injecting a sclerosing agent to cause the sac to close off and collapse. While this may be effective in some cases, it is not considered the first-line treatment for congenital hydrocele.\n\n4: Herniotomy - Herniotomy is a surgical procedure to repair a hernia, which is different from treating a hydrocele. While a hydrocele can sometimes be associated with a hernia, herniotomy is not typically the treatment of choice for isolated congenital hydroceles.\n\nBased on current research and evidence-based practices, the most appropriate treatment for congenital hydrocele would be option 2: Excision of sac. This surgical procedure is effective in removing the hydrocele sac and preventing recurrence in most cases.",
