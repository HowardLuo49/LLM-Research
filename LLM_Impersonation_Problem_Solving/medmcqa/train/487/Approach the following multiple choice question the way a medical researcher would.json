    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by considering the physiological response to burns in the body. During a burn injury, there is typically an increase in inflammatory response and tissue damage, leading to the release of various enzymes.\n\nIn this scenario, the enzyme that is most likely to be increased in the burn area is acid phosphatase. Acid phosphatase is an enzyme that is involved in cellular metabolism and is released during tissue damage. It is commonly used as a marker for tissue injury and inflammation. \n\nTherefore, option 3: Acid phosphatase is the most likely answer in this case.",
