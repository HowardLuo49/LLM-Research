    "solution": 2,
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is: 2: Flexion, adduction & internal rotation\n\nIn a posterior dislocation of the hip, the limb typically assumes a position of flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. This position is due to the displacement of the femoral head posteriorly out of the acetabulum. It is important for doctors to be able to accurately assess the position of the limb in order to provide appropriate treatment for the dislocation.",
