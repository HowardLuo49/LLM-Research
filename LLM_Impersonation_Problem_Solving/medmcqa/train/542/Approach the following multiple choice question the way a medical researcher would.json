    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by first understanding the role of intrinsic factor in the human body. Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein produced by the gastric parietal cells, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.\n\nGiven this knowledge, the correct answer would be option 2: Parietal cells. These cells are responsible for secreting intrinsic factor in the gastric glands. This information is important in understanding the mechanism of vitamin B12 absorption and potential deficiencies that can occur if intrinsic factor production is impaired.",
