Factors such as chemical structure, mechanism of action, dosage, and frequency of administration would also be considered. \n\nBased on current medical knowledge and research, the NSAID that is least likely to cause gastric irritation is acetaminophen (option 2). Acetaminophen is not considered a traditional NSAID and does not possess strong anti-inflammatory properties like other NSAIDs. Therefore, it is generally associated with a lower risk of causing gastrointestinal side effects such as ulcers or bleeding compared to NSAIDs like diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen.",
