A 7 years old boy presented with painful boggy swelling of scalp, multiple sinuses with purulent discharge, easily pluckable hairs and lymph nodes enlarged in occipital region. Which one of the following would be most helpful for diagnostic evaluation?\n1: Bacterial culture\n2: Biopsy\n3: KOH mount\n4: Patch test",
    "solution": 3,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the most helpful diagnostic evaluation in this case would be a bacterial culture. This would help identify the specific bacterial species causing the infection in the scalp, sinuses and lymph nodes. Additionally, the culture results can guide treatment decisions such as antibiotic selection. Biopsy may also be considered to further investigate the underlying pathology, but a bacterial culture would be more specific to the presenting symptoms. KOH mount and patch test are less likely to be useful in this case.",
