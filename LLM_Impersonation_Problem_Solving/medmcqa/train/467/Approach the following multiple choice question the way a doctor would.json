    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by considering the mechanism of action of each of the medications listed. \n\n1: Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that works by increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, leading to improved glucose uptake and utilization. This can indirectly lead to an increase in insulin release.\n\n2: Nateglinide is a meglitinide that works by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose levels. \n\n3: Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that also works by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. \n\n4: Tolbutamide is also a sulfonylurea that works in a similar manner as glimepiride to stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1: Rosiglitazone, as it does not directly stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells.",
