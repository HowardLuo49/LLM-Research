    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by evaluating each option in terms of its mechanism of action and how it affects insulin release. \n\n1: Rosiglitazone - This drug belongs to the thiazolidinedione class and works by increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, leading to decreased insulin resistance. It does not directly stimulate insulin release from the pancreas.\n\n2: Nateglinide - This drug belongs to the meglitinide class and acts by stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose levels. It directly causes insulin release.\n\n3: Glimipiride - This drug belongs to the sulfonylurea class and works by binding to ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells, leading to depolarization and subsequent insulin release.\n\n4: Tobutamide - This drug, although not a common medication, also belongs to the sulfonylurea class and works by a similar mechanism as Glimipiride, stimulating insulin release from pancreatic beta cells.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is 1: Rosiglitazone, as it does not cause insulin release.",
