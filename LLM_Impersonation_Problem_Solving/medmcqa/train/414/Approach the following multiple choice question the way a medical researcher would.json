    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, it is important to consider the known literature and studies regarding the protective bacteria in the normal vagina. In this case, the most commonly known protective bacterium in the normal vagina is Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus species are known to produce lactic acid, which helps maintain an acidic environment in the vagina, making it less hospitable to potential pathogens. Therefore, the correct answer to this multiple choice question would be 2: Lactobacillus.",
