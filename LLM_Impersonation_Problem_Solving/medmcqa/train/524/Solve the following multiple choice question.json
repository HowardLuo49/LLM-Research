    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 3: Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter. Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, leading to smaller red blood cells (microcytic). However, in the case of thalassemia minor, the red blood cell diameter may be normal despite the presence of the disorder.",
