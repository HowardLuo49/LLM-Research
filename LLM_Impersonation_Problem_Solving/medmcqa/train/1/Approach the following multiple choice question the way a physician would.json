In this scenario, chronic urethral obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia can lead to obstructive uropathy, which is characterized by hydronephrosis and progressive damage to the kidney parenchyma.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n1: Hyperplasia - This would not be the correct answer, as hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue, which is not typically seen in the setting of chronic urethral obstruction.\n2: Hypertrophy - This would not be the correct answer, as hypertrophy refers to an increase in the size of individual cells, which can occur in response to chronic stress but is not specific to the changes seen in the kidney parenchyma in this scenario.\n3: Atrophy - This would be the most likely correct answer, as chronic urethral obstruction can lead to progressive damage to the kidney parenchyma, leading to atrophy of the renal parenchyma as a result of decreased blood flow and chronic ischemia.\n4: Dysplasia - This would not be the correct answer, as dysplasia refers to the abnormal development or growth of cells, which is not typically associated with the changes seen in the kidney parenchyma in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option 3: Atrophy.",
