This is a common pathogen associated with community-acquired pneumonia in this age group. Other organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less common causes of pneumonia in this population. Therefore, if cultures were taken from the lower lobe of the left lung, Streptococcus pneumoniae would be the most likely organism to be isolated.",
