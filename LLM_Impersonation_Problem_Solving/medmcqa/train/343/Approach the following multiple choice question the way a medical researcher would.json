It is often associated with subacute presentations of the disease.\n\n2: Staphylococcus aureus is a more aggressive pathogen that is known to cause larger, more destructive vegetations on heart valves. It is a common cause of acute infective endocarditis.\n\n3: Candida albicans is a fungal pathogen that can cause infective endocarditis in immunocompromised patients. It is less common than bacterial causes of the disease.\n\n4: Salmonella typhi is not typically associated with infective endocarditis.
