    "gpt_response": "As a physician, when evaluating a patient for renovascular hypertension, the most specific and sensitive screening test would be CT Angiography. It provides detailed imaging of the renal arteries and can accurately detect any stenosis or abnormalities that may be causing the hypertension. Captopril enhanced radionuclide scan can also be useful in certain cases, but it is generally not as specific or sensitive as CT Angiography. Doppler ultrasound of renal arteries can be a good initial screening test, but it may not provide as detailed information as CT Angiography. HRCT may not specifically target the renal arteries and may not be as sensitive in detecting renovascular hypertension.",
