The most appropriate test to diagnose Leptospirosis in this patient would be the Microscopic agglutination test. This test is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of Leptospirosis as it detects specific antibodies produced by the body in response to the bacteria. The Weil Felix test is not accurate for diagnosing Leptospirosis, and the Paul Bunnell and Microimmunofluorescence tests are not relevant for this particular infection.",
