    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when approaching this multiple choice question about amyloidosis of the tongue, it is important to recall the typical pattern of amyloid deposition in tissues. In amyloidosis, amyloid protein aggregates are deposited in various tissues and organs, interfering with their normal function. \n\nIn the case of the tongue, amyloid deposition is most commonly found in the stromal connective tissue rather than the other options provided. Amyloidosis of the tongue typically presents with a thickened, firm, and nodular appearance due to the accumulation of amyloid in the stroma.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this multiple choice question would be:\n1: Stromal connective tissue.",
