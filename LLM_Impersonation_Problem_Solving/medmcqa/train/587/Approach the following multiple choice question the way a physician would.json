    "gpt_response": "As a physician, the recommended investigation of choice in bronchiectasis is HRCT lung (high-resolution computed tomography of the lungs). This imaging modality provides detailed, high-resolution images of the lung structures, which is particularly useful for diagnosing bronchiectasis and assessing the extent of bronchiectatic changes. While bronchoscopy can also be helpful in evaluating bronchiectasis by directly visualizing the airways, HRCT lung is typically the preferred initial imaging test for this condition. MRI thorax and chest x-ray may also show some findings suggestive of bronchiectasis, but HRCT provides the most accurate and detailed information for diagnosis and management.",
