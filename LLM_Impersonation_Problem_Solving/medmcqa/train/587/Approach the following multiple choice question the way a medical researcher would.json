HRCT is the gold standard imaging modality for diagnosing bronchiectasis, as it provides detailed images of the lung parenchyma and airways, allowing for the detection of dilated bronchi and other characteristic features of bronchiectasis. \n\nWhile bronchoscopy can also be used to evaluate bronchiectasis, it is more invasive and may not provide as comprehensive of a view of the airways as HRCT. MRI thorax and chest X-ray are not as sensitive or specific for detecting bronchiectasis compared to HRCT.",
