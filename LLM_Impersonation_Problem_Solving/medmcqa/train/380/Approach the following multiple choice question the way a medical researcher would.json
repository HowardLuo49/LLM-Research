The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, converting Vitamin D to calcidiol. The second hydroxylation takes place in the kidney, converting calcidiol to the biologically active form calcitriol. This final hydroxylation step is crucial for the regulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism in the body.",
