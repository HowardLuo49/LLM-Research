They would analyze the data to determine at what age the majority of infants demonstrate bidextrous grip. They would consider factors such as variations in motor development among individuals and any potential influences on the development of bidextrous grip. The researcher would then draw conclusions based on their findings to determine the most likely age for bidextrous grip to occur.",
