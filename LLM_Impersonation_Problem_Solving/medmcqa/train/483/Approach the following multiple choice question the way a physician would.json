This autoantibody is commonly found in patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, also known as CREST syndrome. Anti-DNA topoisomerase l is typically associated with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, while anti-double-stranded DNA is more commonly found in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-Golgi is not typically associated with CREST syndrome.",
