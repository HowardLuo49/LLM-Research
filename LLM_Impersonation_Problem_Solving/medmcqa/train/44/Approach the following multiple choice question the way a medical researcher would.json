Sudural effusion is a term used to describe the accumulation of fluid between the dura mater and arachnoid mater in the brain. \n\nBased on current knowledge, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the bacterial meningitis most commonly associated with sudural effusion. This bacteria is known to cause a more severe form of meningitis with a higher incidence of complications, including the development of sudural effusion. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the multiple choice question would be:\n3: Streptococcus pneumoniae.",
