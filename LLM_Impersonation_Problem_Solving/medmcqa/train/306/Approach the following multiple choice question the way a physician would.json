Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia can occur when terfenadine(antihistaminic):\n1: Is coadministrator with azithromycin\n2: Is coadministrator with fluconazole\n3: Is given in higher doses\n4: Reduces QT interval",

    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this multiple choice question by first ruling out any obviously incorrect answers. \n\nOption 1: Is coadminister with azithromycin - Azithromycin is known to have potential drug interactions that can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of torsades de pointes. Therefore, this combination could potentially increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\nOption 2: Is coadminister with fluconazole - Fluconazole is also known to prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, this combination could also potentially increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\nOption 3: Is given in higher doses - Higher doses of terfenadine could potentially increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia by further prolonging the QT interval and increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias.\n\nOption 4: Reduces QT interval - This is incorrect. If terfenadine were to reduce the QT interval, it would actually decrease the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. \n\nTherefore, based on a physician's knowledge of drug interactions and potential arrhythmias, options 1, 2, and 3 are more likely to contribute to the occurrence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia when terfenadine is involved.",
