A mutation that results in a value replacement for glutamic acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin 5 hinders normal hemoglobin function and results in sickle-cell anemia when the patient is homozygous for this mutation. This is an example of which of the following types of mutation?\n1: Deletion\n2: Frameshift\n3: Inseion\n4: Missense",
    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "Based on the description provided, the mutation in question involves a substitution of glutamic acid with another amino acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin. This type of mutation is known as a missense mutation, where a single nucleotide change results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein sequence. Therefore, the correct answer is 4: Missense.",
