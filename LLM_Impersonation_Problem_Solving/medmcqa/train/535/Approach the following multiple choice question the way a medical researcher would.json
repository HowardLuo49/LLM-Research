A mutation that results in a value replacement for glutamic acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin 5 hinders normal hemoglobin function and results in sickle-cell anemia when the patient is homozygous for this mutation. This is an example of which of the following types of mutation?\n1: Deletion\n2: Frameshift\n3: Inseion\n4: Missense",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the correct answer, a medical researcher would analyze the given information about the mutation in hemoglobin and the resulting phenotype of sickle-cell anemia. \n\nIn this case, the mutation results in a change in the amino acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin, replacing glutamic acid with another amino acid. This type of mutation is referred to as a missense mutation, as it results in a single amino acid substitution in the protein. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: 4: Missense",
