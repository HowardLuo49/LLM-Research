    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following multiple choice question the way a medical researcher would. A 50 years old lady presented with lump in the left breast, which has developed suddenly in weeks. Perimenstrual symptoms are present. No associated family history. On examination, the lump is well circumscribed, fluctuant, 1.5 cm oval in shape. Most likely diagnosis:\n1: Breast cyst\n2: Galactocele\n3: Fibroadenoma\n4: Breast cancer",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by analyzing the characteristics of the lump presented in the case. Based on the features described - well circumscribed, fluctuant, perimenstrual symptoms present, no associated family history, and sudden development in weeks - the most likely diagnosis would be a Breast Cyst. \n\nBreast cysts are fluid-filled sacs that are common and can develop rapidly. They are often associated with hormonal changes, such as those occurring during the menstrual cycle. The fluctuant and well-circumscribed nature of the lump described in the case is consistent with a breast cyst.\n\nGalactocele is a milk-filled cyst that typically occurs in breastfeeding mothers, and the lack of history of lactation or recent breastfeeding makes this diagnosis less likely. Fibroadenomas are typically firm, rubbery masses and do not typically fluctuate, making this diagnosis less likely. Breast cancer would be less likely in this case due to the sudden onset, well-circumscribed nature, and absence of associated family history in a 50-year-old patient. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the characteristics described in the case, a Breast Cyst is the most likely diagnosis.",
