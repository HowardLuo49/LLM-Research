    "gpt_response": "Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for a 50-year-old lady with a well-circumscribed, fluctuant, 1.5cm oval shaped lump in the left breast that has developed suddenly in weeks and is associated with perimenstrual symptoms, would be a breast cyst. This is supported by the description of the lump as fluctuant, which is characteristic of a fluid-filled cyst. Additionally, the lack of associated family history and the fluctuant nature of the lump make breast cyst the most likely diagnosis in this case. It is important to conduct further investigations, such as imaging and possibly a biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other possibilities, including breast cancer.",
