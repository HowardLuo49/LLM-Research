Perimenstrual symptoms are present. No associated family history. On examination, the lump is well circumscribed, fluctuant, 1.5 cm oval in shape. Most likely diagnosis:\n1: Breast cyst\n2: Galactocele\n3: Fibroadenoma\n4: Breast cancer",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "1: Breast cyst\n\nThe sudden development of a well-circumscribed, fluctuant lump in the breast, especially in the setting of perimenstrual symptoms, is most likely indicative of a breast cyst. Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the breast tissue and are common in women, especially during their reproductive years. Galactoceles are also fluid-filled lumps in the breast, but they typically occur in women who are breastfeeding. Fibroadenomas are solid, rubbery lumps that are usually painless and commonly found in younger women. Breast cancer typically presents as a hard, non-fluctuant lump with irregular borders.",
