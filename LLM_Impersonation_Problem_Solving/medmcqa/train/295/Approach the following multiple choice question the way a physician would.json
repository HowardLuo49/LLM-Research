    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 1: Is more potent in blocking beta-1 receptors\n\nAs a physician, when choosing between Metoprolol and Propranolol in the treatment of conditions such as hypertension, angina, and certain arrhythmias, the preference for Metoprolol over Propranolol is due to its selectivity in blocking beta-1 receptors. This selectivity leads to a decrease in cardiac workload and oxygen demand without significantly affecting beta-2 receptors, which reduces the risk of bronchoconstriction in patients with underlying pulmonary conditions. Additionally, Metoprolol has been shown to be more effective in reducing essential tremors compared to Propranolol. It is important to consider each patient's individual characteristics and medical history when choosing between these beta-blockers.",
