    "gpt_response": "In order to answer this question as a medical researcher, we would first need to understand what the asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR) is and at what age it typically disappears in infants. \n\nThe ATNR is a normal reflex present in newborns that occurs when the baby's head is turned to one side, causing the limbs on that side to extend while the limbs on the other side flex. This reflex is typically present from birth and disappears gradually as the nervous system matures.\n\nBased on current medical literature and research, the asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR) usually disappears at around 6 months of age. Therefore, the correct answer to this multiple choice question would be option 1: 6 months.",
