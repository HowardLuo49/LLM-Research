The mention of \"rigid height\" and \"excessive inter arch space\" suggests that the question pertains to dental or orthodontic classification systems, specifically the Angle classification system.\n\nIn the Angle classification system, Class I malocclusion is characterized by normal occlusion with the mesiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar aligning with the buccal groove of the lower first molar. Class II malocclusion is characterized by the mesiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar being anterior to the buccal groove of the lower first molar and Class III malocclusion is characterized by the mesiobuccal cusp of the upper first molar being posterior to the buccal groove of the lower first molar.\n\nGiven the description of \"excessive inter arch space,\" it is likely that the diagram corresponds to Class II malocclusion, where there is a larger than normal space between the upper and lower teeth.
