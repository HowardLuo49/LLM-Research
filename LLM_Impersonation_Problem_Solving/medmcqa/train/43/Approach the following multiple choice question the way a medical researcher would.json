    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "Based on my knowledge of neuroanatomy and the functions of the left paracentral lobule, I would choose option 1: Right leg and perineus. The left paracentral lobule is part of the primary motor cortex that controls movement of the lower extremity, specifically the leg and perineus muscles. Therefore, injury to this area would likely lead to paresis of the right leg and perineus muscles.",
