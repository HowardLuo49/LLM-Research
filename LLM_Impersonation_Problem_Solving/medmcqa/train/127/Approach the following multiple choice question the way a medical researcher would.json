    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by referring to historical and anatomical sources on judicial hanging. \n\nBased on my knowledge and research, the correct answer is typically option 2: Under the angle of the jaw. This location is chosen in order to cause a quick and humane death by breaking the neck and severing the spinal cord. This method of judicial hanging is designed to cause rapid unconsciousness and death, minimizing the suffering of the individual being executed. \n\nTherefore, the \"knot\" in the neck during judicial hanging is typically placed under the angle of the jaw for optimal results.",
