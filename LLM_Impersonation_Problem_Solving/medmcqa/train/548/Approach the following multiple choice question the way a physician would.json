The correct approach would be to analyze the data and consider factors such as confounders, bias, and potential causation.\n\n1: CA is commoner in zarda pan users than non users\n- This statement suggests an association between zarda pan use and buccal carcinoma. However, it does not imply causation and may be influenced by confounding factors.\n\n2: Zarda pan is a cause of buccal CA\n- This statement implies a causal relationship between zarda pan use and buccal carcinoma. While there may be an association, further evidence and studies are required to establish a causal link.\n\n3: Zarda pan is associated with buccal CA\n- This statement is more cautious and acknowledges an association between zarda pan use and buccal carcinoma. This is a more appropriate interpretation of the data in a case-control study.\n\n4: If use of zarda pan is stopped, number of cases will reduce\n- This statement suggests a potential impact of stopping zarda pan use on reducing the number of buccal carcinoma cases.
