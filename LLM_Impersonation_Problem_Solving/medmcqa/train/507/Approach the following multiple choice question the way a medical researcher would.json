I would also consider clinical experience and expertise in the field of gastrointestinal surgery.\n\nBased on my research and knowledge, the most common type of mesenteric cyst is typically an enterogenous cyst. This type of cyst arises from remnants of embryonic intestinal tissue within the mesentery. Chylolymphatic cysts, omental cysts, and urogenital cysts are less commonly found in the mesentery compared to enterogenous cysts.",
