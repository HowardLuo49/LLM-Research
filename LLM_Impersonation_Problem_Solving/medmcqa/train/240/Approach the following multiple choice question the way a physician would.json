The proposed guideline values for radioactivity in drinking water are typically set by regulatory agencies to ensure public health and safety.\n\nIn this case, the most appropriate answer would be option 1: Gross alpha activity 0.1 Bq/L and Gross beta activity 1.0 Bq/L. These values are commonly used as guideline values for radioactivity in drinking water to protect human health from potential harmful effects of exposure to radioactive substances. It is important to monitor these levels regularly to ensure that drinking water remains safe for consumption.",
