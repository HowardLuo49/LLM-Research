This test is highly specific for syphilis and confirms the presence of antibodies to the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The VDRL test (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) is a screening test for syphilis, but a positive VDRL result must be confirmed with the FTA-ABS test. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) testing can be used to detect the genetic material of the syphilis bacterium, and culture and sensitivity tests may also be used in certain cases. However, for confirmatory testing, the FTA-ABS test is typically the most reliable.",
