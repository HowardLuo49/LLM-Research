    "gpt_response": "Correct answer: 2: Pelizaeus-merzbacher disease\n\nAs a physician, I would approach this question by first ruling out the other options based on their known clinical manifestations and imaging findings. Pantothenate kinase deficiency is associated with neurodegenerative changes in the basal ganglia and cerebellum on MRI, not tigroid white matter. Neuroferritinopathy typically presents with basal ganglia iron accumulation on MRI, not tigroid white matter. Aceruloplasminemia is characterized by iron accumulation in the basal ganglia and other tissues, not tigroid white matter.\n\nPelizaeus-merzbacher disease, on the other hand, is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal myelination of the central nervous system, which can result in tigroid white matter appearance on MRI. Therefore, based on my understanding of these conditions, the correct answer to the question is option 2: Pelizaeus-merzbacher disease.",
