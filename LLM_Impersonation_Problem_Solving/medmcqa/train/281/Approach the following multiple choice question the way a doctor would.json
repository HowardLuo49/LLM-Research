    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by considering the effects of each potential poisoning agent on putrefaction. In this case, the poisoning agent that retards putrefaction is likely to have antimicrobial properties that inhibit the growth of bacteria and other organisms responsible for decomposition. \n\nBased on my medical knowledge, I would rule out lead and copper as they do not typically have properties that would slow putrefaction. Arsenic is also unlikely to have this effect. \n\nAluminium phosphide is a commonly used fumigant and pesticide that has been shown to inhibit the activity of enzymes involved in putrefaction, making it the most likely answer in this scenario. \n\nTherefore, I would choose option 1: Aluminium phosphide as the poisoning agent that retards putrefaction.",
