They would examine the biological plausibility of each potential effect and consider factors such as exposure levels, duration, and route of exposure.\n\nIn this case, vinyl chloride has been well-documented as a risk factor for angiosarcoma of the liver, hepatic angiosarcoma being a rare and aggressive cancer that has been linked to vinyl chloride exposure. Additionally, vinyl chloride exposure has also been associated with hepatomas, a type of liver cancer. Therefore, options 1 and 3 are plausible effects of vinyl chloride exposure based on current scientific evidence.\n\nAngiofibroma of the nose and bladder cancer are not commonly associated with vinyl chloride exposure based on current knowledge, so options 2 and 4 are less likely to be the correct answer in this context.",
