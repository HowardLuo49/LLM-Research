    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by considering the mechanism of action of Metformin. Metformin works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in the muscles. Therefore, it is most effective in patients with type 2 diabetes who have insulin resistance.\n\nBased on this mechanism of action, Metformin would not be effective in lowering blood sugar levels in non diabetics, as they do not have insulin resistance. It may be less effective in obese diabetics, as their insulin resistance may be more severe. Metformin would also not be effective in diabetics who are not responding to sulfonylureas, as these patients likely have a different pathology underlying their diabetes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: 1. Non diabetics",
