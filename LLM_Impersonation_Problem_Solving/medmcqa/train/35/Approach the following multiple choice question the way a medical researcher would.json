This position allows for optimal visualization of air within the peritoneal cavity, which is characteristic of a pneumoperitoneum. The left lateral decubitus view and the right lateral decubitus view may also be helpful in certain cases, but the supine view is generally the best initial choice for this clinical scenario.
