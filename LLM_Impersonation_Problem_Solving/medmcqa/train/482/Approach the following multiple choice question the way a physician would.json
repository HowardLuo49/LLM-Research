    "gpt_response": "When approaching this question as a physician, we would consider the anatomy and function of the tonic neck reflex. The tonic neck reflex, also known as the fencing response, is a normal reflex triggered by turning the head to one side, which results in extension of the arm on the side to which the head is turned and flexion of the contralateral arm.\n\nBased on our knowledge of neuroanatomy, we know that the tonic neck reflex is controlled by the brainstem, specifically the medulla oblongata. Therefore, if the tonic neck reflex is lost, it would suggest a lesion in the medulla. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3: Medulla",
