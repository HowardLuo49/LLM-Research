    "solution": 2,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by considering the physiological process of sebum production in sebaceous glands and its potential outcomes when there is an accumulation of sebum.\n\nSebum is an oily substance produced by sebaceous glands in the skin. When there is an excessive accumulation of sebum, it can lead to blockage of the hair follicle openings, resulting in the formation of different types of skin conditions.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n1: Milia is a condition characterized by small, white bumps on the skin caused by trapped keratin under the surface of the skin. While sebum may contribute to the formation of milia, it is not directly related to the accumulation of sebum in sebaceous glands.\n\n2: Acne is a common skin condition characterized by the formation of pimples, blackheads, and cysts on the skin. The accumulation of sebum in sebaceous glands, along with other factors such as bacteria and inflammation, can contribute to the development of acne.\n\n3: Epidermoid cysts are noncancerous lumps beneath the skin that occur when the skin cells move deeper into the skin and multiply, forming a sac filled with a cheese-like substance. While sebum may contribute to the development of epidermoid cysts, it is not directly related to the accumulation of sebum in sebaceous glands.\n\n4: Miliaria, also known as heat rash, occurs when sweat ducts become blocked and sweat becomes trapped beneath the skin. This condition is not directly related to the accumulation of sebum in sebaceous glands.\n\nTherefore, based on the physiological understanding of sebum production and its potential outcomes, the correct answer would be:\n2: Acne",
