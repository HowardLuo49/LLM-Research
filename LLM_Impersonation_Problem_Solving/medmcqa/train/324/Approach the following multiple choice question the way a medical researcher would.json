Specifically, they would look at the initial response of the body to tissue injury.\n\nIn this context, the most likely enzyme to be released first at the site of a wound would be an enzyme involved in inflammation and immune response, rather than one involved in digestion or cellular metabolism. Aminopeptidase is a type of protease enzyme that is involved in breaking down proteins, which are important in the inflammatory response to injury. Therefore, a medical researcher would likely choose Aminopeptidase as the first enzyme to be released at the site of a wound.",
