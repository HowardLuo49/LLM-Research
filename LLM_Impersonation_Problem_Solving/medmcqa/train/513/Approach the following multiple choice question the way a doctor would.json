    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this multiple choice question by evaluating each statement based on my medical knowledge and experience.\n\n1: Length is the greatest dimension - Incised wounds typically have length as the greatest dimension, as they are caused by a sharp object cutting into the skin or tissue.\n\n2: Width is more than the thickness of the blade - This statement is also accurate for incised wounds, as the width of the wound is often wider than the thickness of the object that caused it.\n\n3: Margins are inverted - This statement is not typically a feature of incised wounds. Inverted margins are more commonly seen in stab wounds.\n\n4: Hesitation cuts are seen in a suicidal attempt - Hesitation cuts are small, superficial cuts that are made before a more serious self-inflicted injury, indicating hesitation or indecision. This can be seen in cases of suicidal attempts involving incised wounds.\n\nBased on my medical knowledge, the statement that does not typically apply to incised wounds is: 3: Margins are inverted.",
