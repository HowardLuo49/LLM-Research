This option appears to be a correct feature of incised wounds. \n\n2: Width is more than the thickness of the blade - This is also a correct feature of incised wounds, as the width of the wound is typically larger than the thickness of the blade that caused it. \n\n3: Margins are inverted - This is not a feature of incised wounds. In fact, the margins of incised wounds are typically straight and not inverted. \n\n4: Hesitation cuts are seen in suicidal attempts - Hesitation cuts are typically seen in self-inflicted wounds, which may be associated with suicidal attempts. This can be a characteristic feature of incised wounds in certain contexts. \n\nIn conclusion, option 3 (Margins are inverted) is not a feature of incised wounds, while the other options appear to accurately describe features of incised wounds.
