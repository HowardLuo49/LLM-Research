Rotavirus is highly contagious and spreads easily through contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces. It is especially common in young children and infants, causing symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. \n\nWhile adenovirus, E coli, and Norwalk virus can also cause gastroenteritis in infants, rotavirus is typically the most prevalent and therefore the most likely cause in a majority of cases.",
