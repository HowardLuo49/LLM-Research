The mandibular nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), primarily supplies motor innervation to the muscles of mastication, as well as sensation to the lower teeth and gums.\n\nBased on this information, I know that the buccinator, masseter, and temporalis muscles are primarily innervated by the mandibular nerve. The tensor tympani muscle, on the other hand, is actually innervated by the mandibular nerve via a branch called the nerve to tensor tympani.\n\nTherefore, as a doctor, my answer to this question would be:\n3: Tensor tympani",
