By analyzing the innervation patterns of the mandibular nerve and comparing them to the muscle supplied by each option, the researcher would be able to identify which muscle is not innervated by the mandibular nerve. \n\nBased on existing knowledge, the mandibular nerve does not supply the Buccinator muscle. The mandibular nerve primarily innervates the muscles of mastication, such as the Masseter, Temporalis, and Tensor tympani, which are involved in jaw movement and chewing. The Buccinator muscle, on the other hand, is primarily innervated by the facial nerve. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option 1: Buccinator.",
