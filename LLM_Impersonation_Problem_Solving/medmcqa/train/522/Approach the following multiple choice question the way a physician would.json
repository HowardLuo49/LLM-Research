When a person changes position from standing to lying down, following change is seen:\n1: Hea rate increases\n2: Venous return to hea increases immediately\n3: Cerebral blood flow increases\n4: Blood flow at apices of lung decreases",
    "solution": 2,
    "gpt_response": "2: Venous return to the heart increases immediately\n\nAs a physician, I would know that when a person changes position from standing to lying down, gravity helps venous blood flow back to the heart more easily, leading to an increase in venous return. This helps to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure when changing positions.",
