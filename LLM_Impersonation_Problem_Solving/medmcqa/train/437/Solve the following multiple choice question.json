    "gpt_response": "2: Atracurium\n\nAtracurium is a muscle relaxant that is commonly used in patients with renal failure, as it is primarily metabolized by Hofmann elimination and does not rely on renal excretion for clearance. This makes it a safer option for patients with impaired kidney function.",
