    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would choose option 2: Atracurium. Atracurium is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant that is preferred in patients with renal failure because it is metabolized by Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis, making it suitable for patients with impaired kidney function. Options 1, 3, and 4 are not commonly used muscle relaxants in the management of patients with renal failure.",
