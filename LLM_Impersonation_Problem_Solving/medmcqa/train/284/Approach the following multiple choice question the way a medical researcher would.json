    "gpt_response": "A medical researcher would approach this multiple choice question by carefully examining the properties and characteristics of dental stone and dental plaster to determine the main difference between the two materials. They would likely consider factors such as the chemical composition, shelf life, shape and size of particles, and solubility in water to make an informed decision.\n\nIn this case, based on the options provided, the most likely main difference between dental stone and dental plaster would be the chemical composition. Dental stone typically contains less water and more of the mineral gypsum compared to dental plaster, resulting in a harder and denser material that is more suitable for applications requiring greater strength and durability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would likely be option 1: Chemical composition.",
