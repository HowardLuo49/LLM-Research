    "gpt_response": "Based on the patient's presentation of a 4 cm breast lump with skin involvement and palpable axillary lymph nodes along with the FNAC showing intraductal carcinoma, the initial management for this patient would be neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. This would help shrink the tumor prior to surgery, making it more likely to achieve complete resection and potentially preserving breast tissue. This approach would also allow for systemic treatment to address any potential metastasis or micrometastasis.",
