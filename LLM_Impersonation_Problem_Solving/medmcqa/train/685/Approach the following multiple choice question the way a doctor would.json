In this scenario, the patient should undergo both a Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test. \n\nWhile the DRE provides valuable information by allowing the physician to physically examine the prostate gland for any abnormalities such as lumps or enlargement, the PSA test measures the levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood, which can indicate the presence of prostate cancer. \n\nIn some cases, additional imaging tests such as an Endorectal coil MRI with T1 and T2 weighted images may be recommended for further evaluation, particularly if there are suspicious findings on the DRE or elevated PSA levels. However, for initial screening purposes, a combination of DRE and PSA is the recommended approach. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the screening test for prostate cancer would be option 3: DRE + PSA.",
