    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the most appropriate screening test for prostate cancer in this case would be option 3: DRE + PSA. Digital rectal examination (DRE) allows for the physical examination of the prostate gland for any abnormalities or lumps, while Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) is a blood test that measures the levels of PSA in the blood, which can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer. Using both DRE and PSA screening tests in combination provides a more comprehensive assessment for detecting prostate cancer compared to using either test alone. The use of an Endorectal coil MRI with T1 and T2 W images may be considered for further evaluation if there are abnormal findings on the initial screening tests.",
