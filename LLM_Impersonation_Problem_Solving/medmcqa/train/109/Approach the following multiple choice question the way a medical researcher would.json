This genetic disorder is characterized by high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, leading to premature cardiovascular disease. \n\nA key factor in regulating LDL cholesterol levels is the LDL receptor, which plays a crucial role in removing LDL from the bloodstream by binding to LDL particles and facilitating their uptake into cells. Therefore, in Familial hypercholesterolemia, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of the LDL receptor, impairing the clearance of LDL from the blood and leading to elevated levels of LDL cholesterol. \n\nBased on this evidence, the correct answer to the multiple choice question is 1: LDL receptor.",
