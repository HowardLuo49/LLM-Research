We would look at factors such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of specific cellular characteristics (e.g. nuclear grade, mitotic rate).\n\n1: Carcinoma breast - We would consider factors such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of features like ductal or lobular differentiation.\n\n2: Carcinoma lung - We would consider factors such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of features like squamous cell or adenocarcinoma differentiation.\n\n3: Carcinoma prostate - We would consider factors such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of features like Gleason score, which grades the cellular characteristics of prostate cancer.\n\n4: Carcinoma ovary - We would consider factors such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of features like histological subtype (e.g. serous, endometrioid).\n\nBased on the Bloom Richardson grading system, we would analyze each type of carcinoma based on these factors to determine the appropriate classification for each type of cancer.",
