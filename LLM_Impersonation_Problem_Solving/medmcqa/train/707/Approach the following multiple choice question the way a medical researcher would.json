    "gpt_response": "To determine the primary method of CO2 transport in the arterial blood, a medical researcher would first review the relevant literature and studies on the topic. The researcher would then design experiments or conduct further research to determine the most effective method of CO2 transport. This may involve measuring the levels of different forms of CO2 in the blood, analyzing the impact of various factors on CO2 transport, and investigating potential mechanisms of CO2 transportation.\n\nBased on current knowledge, the correct answer to the multiple-choice question is 4: Bicarbonate. Bicarbonate is the primary form in which carbon dioxide is transported in the blood. The majority of CO2 combines with water in the blood to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. This bicarbonate ion is a major component in the transport of CO2 from the tissues to the lungs for elimination.",
