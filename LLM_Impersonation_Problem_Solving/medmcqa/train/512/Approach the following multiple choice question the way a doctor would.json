    "gpt_response": "Based on the Antoni A and Antoni B patterns, the most likely answer is option 1: Schwannoma. The Antoni A pattern is characterized by highly cellular areas with interlacing bundles of cells, while the Antoni B pattern consists of less cellular areas with myxoid changes. These patterns are typically seen in Schwannomas, which are benign tumors derived from Schwann cells in peripheral nerves.",
