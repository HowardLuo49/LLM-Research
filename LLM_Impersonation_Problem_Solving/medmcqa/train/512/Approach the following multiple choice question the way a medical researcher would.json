Antoni A areas are densely packed cellular areas with spindle cells, while Antoni B areas are more loosely arranged with a myxoid matrix.\n\nNeurofibromas are another type of tumor derived from Schwann cells, but they typically do not exhibit Antoni A and Antoni B patterns. Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the meninges, and teratomas are germ cell tumors composed of multiple cell types.\n\nBased on this information, I would choose option 1: Schwannoma as the correct answer, as Antoni A and Antoni B patterns are seen in this type of tumor.",
