    "gpt_response": "4: Urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells\n\nIn a chronic smoker with painless gross hematuria, there is a higher likelihood of underlying malignancy such as bladder cancer. Therefore, the investigation of choice to identify malignant cells in the urine would be urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells. Other investigations such as USG and X-ray KUB may be helpful in assessing the urinary tract anatomy, while urine routine may show the presence of blood cells but may not specifically identify malignant cells.",
