Based on my knowledge and experience, the most common cause of emergency department visits related to LSD and its related substances is likely to be option 1: Bad trip. This term refers to a negative or distressing experience that can occur during an LSD trip, leading individuals to seek medical attention for symptoms such as anxiety, paranoia, or panic.
