First-generation Cephalosporins are effective against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria and are commonly used for surgical prophylaxis due to their ability to prevent surgical site infections.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n1. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation Cephalosporin\n2. Cefoxitin is a second-generation Cephalosporin\n3. Cefazolin is a first-generation Cephalosporin\n4.
