Which of the following can occur as a result of nerve injury\n1: Loss of sensation of lateral foot\n2: Loss of sensation of adjacent sides of 1st & 2nd toe\n3: Inversion inability\n4: Loss of dorsiflexion",
    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, the nerve that is likely to be injured is the common fibular nerve (or peroneal nerve). Given the location of the injury and the potential course of the nerve, the most likely symptoms that can occur include loss of sensation of the lateral foot and adjacent sides of the 1st and 2nd toes. In addition, inversion inability may also be present due to the involvement of the peroneal muscles. Loss of dorsiflexion, however, is more likely to result from injury to the deep peroneal nerve, which is less likely in this specific scenario. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\n1: Loss of sensation of lateral foot\n2: Loss of sensation of adjacent sides of 1st & 2nd toe\n3: Inversion inability\n\nIt is important to perform a thorough neurological examination and possibly imaging studies to confirm the extent and location of the nerve injury. Treatment options may include observation, physical therapy, and in severe cases, surgical intervention.",
