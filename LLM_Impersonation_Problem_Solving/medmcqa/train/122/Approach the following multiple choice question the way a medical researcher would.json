    "gpt_response": "Secondary retention for a removable partial denture refers to the resistance to displacement of the denture base away from the underlying tissues during functional movements of the mandible. In this context, both direct and indirect retainers play a crucial role in providing secondary retention. Intimate contact between the denture bases and the underlying tissues may contribute to stability but is not specifically related to retention. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n4: Direct and indirect retainers",
