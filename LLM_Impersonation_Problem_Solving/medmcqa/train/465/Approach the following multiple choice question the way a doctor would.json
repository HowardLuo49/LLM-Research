    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate the total blood volume for a 60 kg person. The average blood volume is about 70 mL/kg, so for a 60 kg person, the total blood volume would be 60 kg x 70 mL/kg = 4200 mL.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total hemoglobin deficit. The normal hemoglobin level is around 12-16 g/dL. Since the person has a hemoglobin level of 5 g/dL, the deficit would be 12 g/dL - 5 g/dL = 7 g/dL. \n\nTo calculate the total deficit, we need to multiply the deficit by the total blood volume:\n7 g/dL x 4200 mL = 29400 g or 29.4 kg.\n\nFinally, we add 1000 mg for iron stores:\n29.4 kg x 1000 mg/kg = 29400 mg or 29.4 g.\n\nTherefore, the total deficit for a 60 kg person with a hemoglobin level of 5 g/dL and adding 1000 mg for iron stores would be 29.4 g, which rounded to the nearest 500 would be 2500. \n\nSo the answer is:\n\n2: 2500",
