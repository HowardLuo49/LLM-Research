    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this multiple choice question by identifying the mechanism of action of each antibiotic listed and determining which one inhibits DNA dependent RNA synthesis. \n\n1: Rifampicin - Rifampicin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in bacteria, thus blocking transcription. This antibiotic does inhibit DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.\n\n2: Ethambutol - Ethambutol is used to treat tuberculosis by blocking the synthesis of mycobacterial cell wall components. It does not inhibit DNA dependent RNA synthesis.\n\n3: Colchicine - Colchicine is a medication used to treat gout and certain other conditions by inhibiting microtubule formation. It does not inhibit DNA dependent RNA synthesis.\n\n4: Chloromycetin - Chloramphenicol works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. It does not inhibit DNA dependent RNA synthesis. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1: Rifampicin.",
