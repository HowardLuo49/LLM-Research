    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a medical researcher's perspective, we would first need to understand the concept of withdrawal symptoms for each substance listed.\n\n1. Cannabis: Withdrawal symptoms from cannabis use can include irritability, insomnia, loss of appetite, and anxiety. While these symptoms are generally mild compared to other substances, some individuals may benefit from symptomatic treatment such as counseling or support groups.\n\n2. Morphine: Withdrawal symptoms from morphine, a powerful opioid pain medication, can be severe and include muscle aches, agitation, nausea, and vomiting. Symptomatic treatment such as medications to alleviate these symptoms (e.g. clonidine, buprenorphine) may be necessary in some cases.\n\n3. Alcohol: Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can range from mild (anxiety, tremors) to severe (delirium tremens, seizures). Symptomatic treatment with medications such as benzodiazepines is often required to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n4. Cocaine: Withdrawal symptoms from cocaine use can include fatigue, depression, anxiety, and intense cravings. While symptomatic treatment is not typically required for physical symptoms, behavioral therapy or counseling may be necessary to address psychological symptoms and prevent relapse.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer to the question would be 1: Cannabis, as symptomatic treatment is generally not required for cannabis withdrawal compared to the other substances listed.",
