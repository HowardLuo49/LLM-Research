    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by considering the specific withdrawal symptoms associated with each substance. \n\n1: Cannabis withdrawal symptoms typically include irritability, mood changes, difficulty sleeping, and loss of appetite. While symptomatic treatment may not be required for severe cases, supportive care such as counseling or therapy may be beneficial for managing these symptoms. \n\n2: Morphine withdrawal symptoms can be severe and may include nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, and cravings. Symptomatic treatment, such as medication to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications, is often necessary in cases of morphine withdrawal.\n\n3: Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening and may include symptoms such as delirium tremens (DTs), seizures, and hallucinations. Symptomatic treatment, including medications to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications, is typically required for alcohol withdrawal.\n\n4: Cocaine withdrawal may involve symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and intense cravings. While symptomatic treatment may not be as necessary for cocaine withdrawal compared to alcohol or morphine withdrawal, supportive care such as counseling or therapy may still be beneficial for managing these symptoms.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the severity of withdrawal symptoms and potential complications associated with alcohol and morphine withdrawal, symptomatic treatment is not required in withdrawal of Cannabis and Cocaine.",
