Therefore, symptomatic treatment is not usually required in cannabis withdrawal.\n\n2: Morphine withdrawal can result in severe symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and muscle aches, which may require symptomatic treatment in some cases.\n\n3: Alcohol withdrawal can lead to potentially life-threatening symptoms such as seizures and delirium tremens, which often require prompt medical intervention and symptomatic treatment.\n\n4: Cocaine withdrawal is associated with symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and intense drug cravings, but these are usually manageable without significant symptomatic treatment.\n\nTherefore, based on the potential severity of withdrawal symptoms and need for symptomatic treatment, the correct answer is 1: Cannabis.",
