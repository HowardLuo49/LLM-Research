Starvation and diabetes mellitus can lead on to ketoacidosis which of the following features is in our of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus.\n1: Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\n2: Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\n3: Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\n4: Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose",

    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, the correct answer to this multiple-choice question would be option 2: Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose.\n\nKetoacidosis in diabetes mellitus is typically caused by a deficiency of insulin, leading to increased free fatty acid breakdown and release of ketone bodies. This results in an increase in blood glucose levels that are not effectively utilized due to the lack of insulin, therefore leading to ketoacidosis. The increase in free fatty acids is a key feature of this metabolic state.",
