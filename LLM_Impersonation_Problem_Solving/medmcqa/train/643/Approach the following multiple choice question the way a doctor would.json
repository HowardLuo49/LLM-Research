    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when a patient on carbidopa + levodopa treatment experiences weaning off effects after 10 years, it may be necessary to add a medication to restore its action. In this case, the most appropriate option would be to consider adding Tolcapone. Tolcapone is a COMT inhibitor that can help improve the effectiveness of carbidopa + levodopa by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Amantadine can also be considered as it can help reduce dyskinesias associated with long-term levodopa use. Rasagiline and Benzhexol may not be as effective in restoring the action of carbidopa + levodopa in this scenario.",
