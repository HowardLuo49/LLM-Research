    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 1: LH surge. \n\nIn the menstrual cycle, ovulation is triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This surge occurs approximately 24-36 hours before ovulation. FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) plays a role in stimulating the growth of ovarian follicles, but it peaks earlier in the cycle. Progesterone and estrogen levels also increase during the menstrual cycle, but they are not directly responsible for triggering ovulation.",
