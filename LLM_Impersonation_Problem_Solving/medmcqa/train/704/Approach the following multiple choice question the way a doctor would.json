In the neonatal period, the most common cause of meningitis is often related to vertical transmission of bacteria from the mother to the newborn during delivery. In this context, E. coli is the most common cause of neonatal meningitis due to its presence in the maternal gastrointestinal tract.\n\nTherefore, I would select option 2: E. coli as the most likely cause of neonatal meningitis in this scenario.",
