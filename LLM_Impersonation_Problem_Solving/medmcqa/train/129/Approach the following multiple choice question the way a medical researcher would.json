    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by reviewing the anatomy and function of each muscle listed to determine which acts as the unlocker of the knee. I would consider factors such as the location of the muscle, its attachment points, and its role in knee movement.\n\nBased on my knowledge, I would eliminate muscles that are not typically involved in knee unlocking, such as the gracilis and biceps femoris. I would then focus on the popliteus and sartorius muscles, which are known to play a role in unlocking the knee.\n\nAfter reviewing the functions of the popliteus and sartorius muscles in knee movement, I would determine that the correct answer is likely the popliteus muscle. The popliteus muscle is a small muscle located at the back of the knee joint that plays a key role in unlocking the knee by rotating the femur on the tibia. This action allows the knee to extend and lock into place during activities such as standing and walking.",
