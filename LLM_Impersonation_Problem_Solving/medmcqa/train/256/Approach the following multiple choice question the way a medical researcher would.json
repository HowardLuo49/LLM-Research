    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by considering the physical properties and characteristics of Type1 inlay wax, as well as the concept of maximum flow at a specific temperature.\n\nIn this case, the temperature specified is 45 degrees. To determine the maximum flow of Type1 inlay wax at this temperature, we need to consider the viscosity of the wax. The viscosity of a material is a measure of its resistance to flow, with lower viscosity indicating easier flow.\n\nBased on typical properties of Type1 inlay wax, it is likely to have a relatively low viscosity compared to other materials. Therefore, the maximum flow of Type1 inlay wax at 45 degrees is likely to be relatively high.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n1: 2%\n2: 3%\n3: 10%\n4: 70%\n\nThe most likely answer would be 4: 70%, as this percentage represents a high degree of flow, which is consistent with the expected properties of Type1 inlay wax.",
