    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by first understanding the context in which the Type1 inlay wax is being used. In dentistry, Type1 inlay wax is used for creating patterns for dental restorations. The maximum flow of the wax at a 45-degree angle would depend on the viscosity of the wax and the specific application it is being used for.\n\nIn general, a lower percentage would indicate a lower flow rate, while a higher percentage would indicate a higher flow rate. Therefore, I would assume that the options listed are percentages representing the flow rate of the Type1 inlay wax at a 45-degree angle.\n\nBased on my knowledge and experience, a flow rate of 70% seems excessively high for Type1 inlay wax. This would likely result in the wax flowing too quickly and not being able to be accurately manipulated for the intended purpose. I would therefore eliminate option 4: 70%.\n\nOptions 1: 2%, 2: 3%, and 3: 10% are more realistic flow rates for Type1 inlay wax at a 45-degree angle. I would consider factors such as the specific properties of the wax and the complexity of the restoration being created to determine the most appropriate flow rate.\n\nI would ultimately choose the flow rate that allows for the most accurate and precise manipulation of the wax in order to create the desired dental restoration.",
