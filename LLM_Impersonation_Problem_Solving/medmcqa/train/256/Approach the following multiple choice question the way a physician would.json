    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by understanding that the maximum flow of Type1 inlay wax at 45 degrees refers to the viscosity or flowability of the wax material. In this case, higher percentages typically indicate a higher flow rate or greater viscosity. Based on my knowledge and experience with dental materials, I would expect the correct answer to be option 4: 70%. This is because a wax with a higher percentage of flow would be more suitable for inlay procedures where precise shaping and molding of the material is necessary.",
