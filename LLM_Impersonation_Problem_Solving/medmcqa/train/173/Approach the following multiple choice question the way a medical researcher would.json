    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by first identifying the characteristics of a black eye. A black eye is typically caused by trauma to the eye area, resulting in bleeding and discoloration around the eye. Based on this information, I would rule out options 1 and 4 (patterned abrasion and friction abrasion) as they do not specifically relate to the characteristics of a black eye.\n\nNext, I would consider options 2 and 3 (ectopic abrasion and ectopic bruise). Ectopic typically refers to something occurring in an abnormal location or out of place. In the context of a black eye, it would not be classified as an ectopic abrasion, as abrasions are typically associated with superficial injuries to the skin. Therefore, the most accurate classification for a black eye would be an ectopic bruise (option 3), as it involves bleeding and discoloration in an abnormal location around the eye.",
