    "gpt_response": "In order to answer this question, a medical researcher would first review the existing scientific literature on the topic of zona pellucida disappearance during fertilization. They would look for studies that have investigated the timing of zona pellucida disappearance in various species and under different experimental conditions.\n\nThey would also consider the biological processes involved in fertilization and early embryonic development. The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte that plays a critical role in fertilization and early embryonic development. It is typically thought to disappear shortly after fertilization to allow the developing embryo to implant in the uterine wall.\n\nBased on the existing knowledge and research findings, the researcher would then carefully analyze each of the answer choices to determine the most accurate and scientifically supported response. They would focus on the specific timing of zona pellucida disappearance in relation to fertilization and early embryonic development to select the correct answer option.",
