    "gpt_response": "The correct answer to the multiple choice question is:\n\n3: Hardening\n\nIn the context of cement, hardening refers to the process in which the cement matrix is strengthened by hydration with oral fluids. This process ultimately leads to a greater mechanical strength of the cement.",
