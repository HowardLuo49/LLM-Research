    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the correct answer to this multiple choice question, a medical researcher would first need to understand the purpose of anterolateral arthroscopy of the knee. This procedure involves inserting a small camera into the knee joint through an incision on the anterolateral side of the knee to visualize the structures inside the joint.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer would be option 3: To see the anterior portion of the lateral meniscus. Anterolateral arthroscopy provides visualization of the anterior and lateral aspects of the knee joint, making it suitable for viewing the anterior portion of the lateral meniscus. This procedure is not typically used to visualize the posterior cruciate ligament (option 2) or the periphery of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (option 4). While it may be possible to observe the patellofemoral articulation (option 1) during anterolateral arthroscopy, the primary purpose of this procedure is to assess the structures in the anterior and lateral compartments of the knee joint.",
