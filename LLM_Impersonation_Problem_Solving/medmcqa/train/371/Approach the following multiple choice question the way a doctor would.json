Therefore, Piperacillin acts against Pseudomonas.\n\n2: Methicillin - Methicillin is a narrow-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that is not effective against Pseudomonas. \n\n3: Nafcillin - Nafcillin is also a narrow-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that is not effective against Pseudomonas.\n\n4: Cloxacillin - Cloxacillin is a narrow-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that is not effective against Pseudomonas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1: Piperacillin, as it acts against Pseudomonas.",
