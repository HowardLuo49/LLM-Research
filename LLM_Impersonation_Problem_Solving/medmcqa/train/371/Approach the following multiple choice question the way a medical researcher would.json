Pseudomonas is a Gram-negative bacterium, so the drug that would be most effective against it would be one with activity against Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nOut of the options provided:\n1. Piperacillin: Piperacillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas.\n2. Methicillin, 3. Nafcillin, and 4. Cloxacillin: These drugs are all beta-lactam antibiotics that are primarily effective against Gram-positive bacteria and are not typically used to treat Pseudomonas infections.\n\nTherefore, the drug that acts against Pseudomonas out of the options provided is Piperacillin.",
