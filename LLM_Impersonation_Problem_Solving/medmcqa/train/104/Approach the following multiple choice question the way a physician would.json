    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this multiple choice question by thinking about the clinical implications of an increase in Pauwel's angle. Pauwel's angle is a radiographic measurement used to assess the risk of femoral neck fractures and the likelihood of displacement of a fracture. \n\nTherefore, an increase in Pauwel's angle would indicate an increase in the angle of the fracture line relative to the longitudinal axis of the femoral neck. This would suggest that there is more chance of displacement of the fracture, as the fracture line is more oblique and less stable. \n\nThus, the correct answer would be:\n3: More chances of displacement",
