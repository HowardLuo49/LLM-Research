Pauwel's angle is an angle used to assess the severity of a hip fracture and predict the risk of displacement of the fracture fragments. \n\nBased on this understanding, an increase in Pauwel's angle would typically indicate a higher risk of displacement of the fracture fragments, leading to option 3: More chances of displacement. This is because a higher Pauwel's angle indicates a more vertical and therefore less stable fracture pattern, which is associated with an increased risk of displacement and poorer outcomes.",
