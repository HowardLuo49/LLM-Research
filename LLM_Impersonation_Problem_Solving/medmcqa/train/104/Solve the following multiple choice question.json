    "gpt_response": "3: More chances of displacement\n\n\nAn increase in Pauwel's angle indicates a higher risk of displacement in cases of femoral neck fractures. A higher Pauwel's angle means that the fracture line is more vertical, which leads to increased shearing forces across the fracture site and a higher likelihood of displacement.",
