    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by recalling my knowledge of cardiac anatomy. The supraventricular crest is a ridge of tissue in the right atrium of the heart. I know that the correct answer is 1: between the pulmonary orifice and atrioventricular orifice. This is because the crest is located between the opening of the pulmonary artery and the opening of the atrioventricular valve, which separates the right atrium from the right ventricle.",
