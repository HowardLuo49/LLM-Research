Schwann cells are a type of glial cell that are responsible for myelinating peripheral nerves. Based on the current understanding of neurodevelopment, Schwann cells are derived from neural crest cells. Therefore, the correct answer is 1: Neural crest cells. This information is crucial for understanding the development and function of Schwann cells in the nervous system.",
