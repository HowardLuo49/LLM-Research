Progressive muscle weakness and blindness ensue, and the patient dies within a year. The brain at autopsy shows swollen neurons that contain numerous lysosomes filled with lipid.

    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "4: Tay-Sachs disease\n\nTay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons. This accumulation results in progressive neurodegeneration, with symptoms typically presenting in infancy. The clinical presentation described in the question (delay in motor development, progressive muscle weakness, blindness, and swollen neurons with lysosomes filled with lipid on autopsy) is characteristic of Tay-Sachs disease.",
