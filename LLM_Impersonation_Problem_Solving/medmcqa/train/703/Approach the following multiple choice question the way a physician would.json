Progressive muscle weakness and blindness ensue, and the patient dies within a year. The brain at autopsy shows swollen neurons that contain numerous lysosomes filled with lipid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n1: AL amyloidosis\n2: Hurler syndrome\n3: Phenylketonuria\n4: Tay-Sachs disease",
    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "4: Tay-Sachs disease\n\nTay-Sachs disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, leading to an accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons. This buildup of lipid in lysosomes causes progressive muscle weakness, blindness, and eventually death. In this case, the symptoms of motor delay, muscle weakness, and blindness in a young child are highly suggestive of Tay-Sachs disease. The presence of swollen neurons with numerous lysosomes filled with lipid at autopsy further supports this diagnosis.",
