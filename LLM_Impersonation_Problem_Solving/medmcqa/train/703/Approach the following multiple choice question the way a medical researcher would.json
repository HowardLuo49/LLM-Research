Progressive muscle weakness and blindness ensue, and the patient dies within a year. The brain at autopsy shows swollen neurons that contain numerous lysosomes filled with lipid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n1: AL amyloidosis\n2: Hurler syndrome\n3: Phenylketonuria\n4: Tay-Sachs disease",

    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would carefully analyze the symptoms described in the case of the 1-year-old boy and the findings at autopsy to determine the most likely diagnosis. \n\nBased on the progressive muscle weakness, blindness, and swollen neurons with numerous lysosomes filled with lipid, the most likely diagnosis is Tay-Sachs disease. \n\nTay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the buildup of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside within cells, particularly in the neurons of the brain. This buildup can lead to progressive neurodegeneration, muscle weakness, blindness, and ultimately death. \n\nTherefore, option 4: Tay-Sachs disease, is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",
