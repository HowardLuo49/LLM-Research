Each of the options listed (Thiopentone, Propofol, Lignocaine, and Sevoflurane) has been studied in regards to their effects on intracranial pressure.\n\nThiopentone is known to increase intracranial pressure, making it a potential candidate for increasing intracranial tension.\n\nPropofol has been shown to decrease intracranial pressure, making it unlikely to increase intracranial tension.\n\nLignocaine is also known to decrease intracranial pressure, making it unlikely to increase intracranial tension.\n\nSevoflurane has mixed effects on intracranial pressure, with some studies suggesting an increase in intracranial pressure, while others suggest a decrease. Further research would be needed to determine the specific effects of Sevoflurane on intracranial tension.\n\nBased on the current research, Thiopentone is the most likely anaesthetic agent to increase intracranial tension among the options provided.",
