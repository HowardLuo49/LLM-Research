    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by first understanding the mechanism of action of theophylline. Theophylline is a methylxanthine compound that is commonly used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD. One of the key ways in which theophylline exerts its effects is through inhibition of adenosine receptors.\n\nTherefore, based on the pharmacological properties of theophylline, the correct answer to the question would be:\n\n3: Adenosine receptors\n\nTheophylline antagonizes adenosine receptors, leading to bronchodilation and other therapeutic effects.",
