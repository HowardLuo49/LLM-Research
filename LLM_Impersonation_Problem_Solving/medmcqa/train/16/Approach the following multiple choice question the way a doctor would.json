    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by first recalling my knowledge of theophylline and its mechanism of action in the body. Theophylline is a medication commonly used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenosine receptor antagonist.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer to the question asking about the receptor with which theophylline has an antagonistic interaction is option 3: Adenosine receptors. Adenosine receptors play a role in bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the airways, and by antagonizing these receptors, theophylline helps to dilate the airways and improve breathing in patients with asthma or COPD.",
