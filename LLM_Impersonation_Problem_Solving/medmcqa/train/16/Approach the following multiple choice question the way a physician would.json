    "gpt_response": "3: Adenosine receptors\n\nTheophylline acts as an antagonist at adenosine receptors, specifically A1 and A2 receptors. This is its primary mechanism of action in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By blocking adenosine receptors, theophylline helps to relax smooth muscles in the airways and improve airflow.",
