    "gpt_response": "To address this question as a medical researcher, one would first need to understand the conditions listed and their relevant symptoms. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints, so it is a likely answer. Rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the joints, particularly the hands and feet, so sacroiliac joint involvement would be less common in this condition. Reiter's syndrome is a type of reactive arthritis that can involve the sacroiliac joints. Osteoarthritis is a condition that primarily affects the joints through wear and tear over time, so sacroiliac joint involvement would also be less common in this condition compared to inflammatory arthritis conditions like ankylosing spondylitis or Reiter's syndrome. Given this information, the most likely correct answer would be 1: Ankylosing spondylitis.",
