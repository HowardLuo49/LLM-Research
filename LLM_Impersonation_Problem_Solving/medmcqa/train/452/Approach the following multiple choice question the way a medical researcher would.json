We would look into studies that have identified and confirmed the specific gene mutations responsible for this disorder. \n\nBased on our knowledge of Marfan's Syndrome, we know that it is primarily caused by a mutation in the Fibrillin 1 gene. This gene is involved in encoding a protein that is essential for the formation of connective tissue, which is affected in individuals with Marfan's Syndrome. \n\nTherefore, our informed choice for the correct answer to this question would be option 1: Fibrillin 1.",
