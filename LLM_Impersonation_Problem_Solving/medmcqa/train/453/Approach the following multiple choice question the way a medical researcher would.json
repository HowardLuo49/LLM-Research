    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, we know that RNA primer is synthesized during DNA replication to provide a starting point for DNA polymerase to begin synthesis. From the options provided, topoisomerase and helicase are enzymes involved in DNA unwinding and manipulation, while DNA ligase is involved in sealing the gaps between Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. \n\nThe correct answer is option 3: DNA primase. DNA primase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing RNA primer on the lagging strand during DNA replication.",
