Additionally, they would need to consider the characteristics of each option provided.\n\nBased on the knowledge that the brain itself does not have pain receptors, the researcher can eliminate option 4: Brain matter. The piamater and pial vessels are the innermost layers of the meninges and do not contain pain-sensitive structures. The duramater, on the other hand, is the outermost layer of the meninges and does contain pain-sensitive fibers. Therefore, the correct answer is option 3: Duramater.",
