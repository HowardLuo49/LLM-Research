Smaller particles are more likely to reach the deeper parts of the lungs and cause more harm. \n\nTherefore, the most dangerous particles causing pneumoconiosis are typically those that are smaller in size. Of the options given, the most dangerous particles would be those that are <1 micron in size (option B). These smaller particles are able to penetrate deeper into the lungs and cause more severe damage.",
