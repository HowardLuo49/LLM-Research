    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this multiple choice question by first considering the known metabolic disorders associated with abnormal odours of urine. In this case, the abnormal mousy/mushy odour of urine is commonly associated with maple syrup urine disease. This disorder affects the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, leading to the characteristic odour. Therefore, based on this knowledge, I would select option 3: Maple syrup urine disease as the correct answer.",
