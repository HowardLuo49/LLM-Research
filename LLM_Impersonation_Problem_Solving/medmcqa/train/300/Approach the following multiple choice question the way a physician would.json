    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 1: AV node. \n\nIn general, conduction velocity varies throughout the cardiac conduction system, with the slowest conduction occurring in the AV node. The AV node serves as a delay mechanism, allowing time for the atria to contract and fill the ventricles before the ventricles are activated. This slow conduction through the AV node is essential for the proper coordination of the heart's pumping function. The Purkinje fibers, Bundle of His, and ventricular myocardial fibers all have faster conduction velocities compared to the AV node.",
