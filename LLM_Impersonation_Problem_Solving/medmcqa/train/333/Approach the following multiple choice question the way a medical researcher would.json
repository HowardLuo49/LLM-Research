    "gpt_response": "In order to approach this question as a medical researcher, one would first need to understand the different layers of the skin. The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis and is composed of dead skin cells. The stratum lucidum is a thin, clear layer found only in areas of thick skin, such as the palms and soles. The stratum spinosum is a layer of the epidermis that contains cells called keratinocytes. The stratum basale, also known as the stratum germinativum, is the deepest layer of the epidermis and is responsible for cell division and replenishing the other layers.\n\nGranules of Eleidin are typically found in the stratum lucidum. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n2: Stratum lucidum",
