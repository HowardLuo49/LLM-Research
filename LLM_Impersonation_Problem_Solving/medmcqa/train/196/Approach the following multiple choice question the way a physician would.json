    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is:\n2: Coracoclavicular ligament\n\nIn a 24 year old man, the weight of the upper limb is primarily transmitted to the axial skeleton by the coracoclavicular ligament. This ligament connects the clavicle to the coracoid process of the scapula and helps stabilize the shoulder joint during movement. The coracoacromial ligament, coracohumeral ligament, and costoclavicular ligament also play roles in shoulder stability, but they are not primarily responsible for transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.",
