    "gpt_response": "In order to answer this question, a medical researcher would first need to understand the anatomy and function of each of the ligaments listed. They would then analyze the biomechanics of the upper limb and axial skeleton to determine which ligament is responsible for transmitting weight from the upper limb to the axial skeleton in a 24-year-old man.\n\nBased on their knowledge of anatomy and biomechanics, a medical researcher would likely choose the coracoclavicular ligament as the correct answer. This ligament connects the clavicle to the coracoid process of the scapula and is responsible for stabilizing the acromioclavicular joint, which is an important connection point between the upper limb and the axial skeleton. The coracoacromial ligament, costoclavicular ligament, and coracohumeral ligament are not directly involved in transmitting the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton in the same way as the coracoclavicular ligament.",
