Therefore, C. immitis is a likely candidate for lung infections through inhalation of spores.\n\n2: S. schenckii - This fungus is associated with causing skin infections rather than lung infections. Therefore, it is less likely to be transmitted through inhalation of spores.\n\n3: C. albicans - This fungus is a common cause of yeast infections, but it is not typically associated with primary lung infections through inhalation of spores.\n\n4: T. tonsurans - This fungus is associated with causing skin infections such as ringworm rather than lung infections.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely organism to be associated with primary lung infections through inhalation of spores is C. immitis.",
