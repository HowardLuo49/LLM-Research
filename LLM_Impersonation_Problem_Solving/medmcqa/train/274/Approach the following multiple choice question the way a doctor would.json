In this scenario, the correct approach would be to rule out options that are not used for iron poisoning.\n\nIn this case, the options that are typically used for iron poisoning include Desferrioxamine and Penicillamine, as these are chelating agents that can help remove excess iron from the body. Magnesium hydroxide is not typically used in the treatment of iron poisoning, as it is more commonly used as an antacid and laxative. Gastric lavage may be considered in some cases of iron poisoning, but it is not as commonly used as chelating agents.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer would be: 1.
