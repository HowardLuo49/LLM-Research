    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by reviewing the properties and uses of each of the listed options in the context of iron poisoning. \n\n1) Magnesium hydroxide: Magnesium hydroxide is commonly used as an antacid and laxative, but it is not typically used for the treatment of iron poisoning. It does not have specific chelating properties for iron. \n\n2) Desferrioxamine: Desferrioxamine is a chelating agent that is specifically used for the treatment of iron poisoning. It works by binding to excess iron in the body and promoting its excretion. \n\n3) Gastric lavage: Gastric lavage involves flushing the stomach with fluids to remove ingested substances. While this may be used in cases of severe iron poisoning to remove unabsorbed iron, it is not a primary treatment for iron toxicity. \n\n4) Penicillamine: Penicillamine is another chelating agent that is used for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning, such as lead and copper, but it is not typically used for iron poisoning. \n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer would be: 2) Desferrioxamine.",
