IgM Anti-HBc is an antibody against the core antigen of the virus, seen in acute infection. HBeAg is another antigen produced by the virus during active replication.\n\nGiven that the patient has all three markers positive, it indicates acute hepatitis B with high infectivity. Acute hepatitis B is characterized by a recent infection with active viral replication, indicated by the presence of HBeAg. The presence of IgM Anti-HBc further supports the acute nature of the infection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n2: Acute hepatitis B with high infectivity",
