Hydralazine: Hydralazine has been known to cause drug-induced lupus, which is a condition similar to SLE but usually resolves after discontinuation of the medication.\n\n2. Rifampicin: Rifampicin is an antibiotic that is not typically associated with causing SLE like reactions.\n\n3. Paracetamol: Paracetamol is not known to cause SLE or SLE like reactions.\n\n4. Furosemide: Furosemide is a diuretic that is not typically associated with causing SLE like reactions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely cause of a SLE like reaction among the options provided would be hydralazine (option 1).",
