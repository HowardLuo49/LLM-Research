In normal circumstances, urine osmolality typically ranges from 300-900 mmol/L. Therefore, in Diabetes insipidus, where there is impaired concentration of urine leading to excessive dilute urine production, the urine osmolality would be expected to be lower than normal.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer would be:\n\n2: <300 mmol/L - as this option falls within the expected lower range of urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus.",
