    "gpt_response": "As a physician, my approach to this multiple choice question would be to first understand the function of the auditory cortex in the brain. The auditory cortex is responsible for processing auditory information and interpreting sounds. \n\nGiven this knowledge, bilateral destruction of the auditory cortex would most likely result in a deficiency in interpretation of sounds, as this is a crucial function of this brain region. Therefore, I would choose option 3: Deficiency in interpretation of sounds as the correct answer. \n\nOptions 1 and 2 are less likely, as total deafness or hearing defect for higher frequency sounds would be more related to damage to the peripheral auditory system, such as the ear or auditory nerve. Option 4, inability for the orientation of sounds, is also less likely as this function is typically associated with other brain regions involved in spatial processing.",
