In a patient with a history of syncope (syncopal attack), tests that evaluate cardiac arrhythmias, autonomic dysfunction, and structural heart abnormalities would be most useful.\n\nElectrophysiological testing and Holter monitoring are typically used to evaluate for cardiac arrhythmias, which can be a common cause of syncope. Tilt Table testing is used to assess autonomic function and can help determine if the patient's symptoms are related to orthostatic hypotension or vasovagal syncope.\n\nOn the other hand, a PET scan is not commonly used in the evaluation of syncope. It is more commonly used in the assessment of brain function and metabolic activity, which may not be directly related to the underlying cause of syncope.\n\nTherefore, the test that is not useful in a patient with a history of syncope would be 3: PET Scan.",
