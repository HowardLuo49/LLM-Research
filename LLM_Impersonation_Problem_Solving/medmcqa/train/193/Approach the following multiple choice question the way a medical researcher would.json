    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by evaluating each test in terms of its relevance to assessing a patient with a history of Syncopal attack. \n\nElectrophysiological testing is a useful test for evaluating the electrical activity of the heart, which can help identify potential arrhythmias that may have contributed to the syncopal episode. Therefore, this test would likely be considered useful in this context.\n\nTilt Table testing is another useful test for assessing patients with syncope, as it can help identify conditions such as vasovagal syncope. This test involves tilting the patient to provoke symptoms and monitor their response, which can be helpful in diagnosing the cause of syncope.\n\nA PET scan, on the other hand, is less likely to be useful in evaluating a patient with a history of syncopal attack. PET scans are typically used to evaluate metabolic activity in tissues, which may not be directly relevant to the evaluation of syncope.\n\nHolter monitoring is a useful test for monitoring the heart's electrical activity over an extended period of time, which can help identify potential arrhythmias that may have contributed to syncope. Therefore, this test would likely be considered useful in this context.\n\nBased on this analysis, the test that is not useful in a patient with a history of syncopal attack is 3: PET Scan.",
