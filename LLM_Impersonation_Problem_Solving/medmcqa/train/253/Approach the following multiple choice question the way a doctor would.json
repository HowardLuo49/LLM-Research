Clostridia are a group of bacteria that are known for their ability to form spores and thrive in anaerobic environments. Examples of Clostridia include Clostridium tetani (causing tetanus) and Clostridium difficile (causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea). While Bacillus Anthracis also falls under the category of spore forming gram positive bacilli, it is more commonly associated with anthrax rather than anaerobic infections. Corynebacterium is a different group of bacteria that are not typically known for spore formation, and Peptostreptococcus are anaerobic gram positive cocci rather than bacilli.",
