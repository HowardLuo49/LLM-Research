Pontiac fever is a milder form of Legionnaires' disease caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila.\n\nNext, I would look at the antigens associated with Legionella pneumophila and their presence in urine during infection. From my knowledge of the bacterium, I know that Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria like Legionella pneumophila.\n\nBased on this information, I would cross-reference the antigens listed in the multiple choice question with what is known about Legionella pneumophila. In this case, the correct answer is likely Lipopolysaccharide-1, as LPS-1 is a common antigen associated with Legionella pneumophila and is known to be detected in urine during infection.",
