    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by looking at the characteristics of each option in relation to antibody production. \n\n- Polysaccharides are known to be difficult to induce antibody production compared to proteins. This is because polysaccharides are generally less immunogenic and do not stimulate a strong immune response. \n\n- Proteins, on the other hand, are highly immunogenic and can easily induce antibody production. Proteins are often used as antigens in vaccines to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies. \n\n- Antigens are substances that can induce an immune response and stimulate the production of antibodies. They can be proteins, polysaccharides, or other molecules that the immune system recognizes as foreign. \n\n- Effector cells, such as B cells and T cells, are not antigens themselves but are involved in the immune response by producing antibodies and coordinating the immune response.\n\nBased on this information, the answer to the question would be:\n\n1: Polysaccharide",
