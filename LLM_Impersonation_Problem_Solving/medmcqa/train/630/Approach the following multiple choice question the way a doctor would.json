Based on the post-coital test results showing non-motile sperms in the cervical smear and motile sperms from the posterior fornix, I would lean towards option 2: Immunological defect.\n\nThis pattern of sperm distribution suggests that there may be an immune reaction occurring in the cervical canal that is preventing the sperm from moving effectively, possibly due to an immunological defect. It is important to further investigate this possibility and consider other factors that may be contributing to the abnormal sperm distribution.\n\nOptions 1, 3, and 4 do not align as well with the information provided in the question and are less likely to be the cause of the observed sperm distribution patterns.",
