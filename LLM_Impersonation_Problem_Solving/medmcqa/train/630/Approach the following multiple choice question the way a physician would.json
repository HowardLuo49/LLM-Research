In this case, the post-coital test showing non-motile sperms in the cervical smear and motile sperms from the posterior fornix would suggest a potential immunological defect. This is because non-motile sperms in the cervical smear could indicate a problem with sperm/cervical mucus interaction, while motile sperms from the posterior fornix suggest that sperm are able to reach the cervix but are not able to pass through it. Immunological defects can interfere with sperm function and transport within the female reproductive tract. Therefore, the correct answer would be option 2: Immunological defect.",
