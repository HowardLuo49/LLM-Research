    "gpt_response": "In order to determine which muscle is not a hybrid muscle, a medical researcher would need to consider the characteristics of each muscle listed. Hybrid muscles are those that have characteristics of both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers.\n\n1: Pectoralis major - The pectoralis major muscle is a large muscle in the chest that is primarily composed of fast-twitch muscle fibers. While it may contain some slow-twitch fibers, it is not typically considered a hybrid muscle.\n\n2: Extensor digitorum - The extensor digitorum muscle is primarily responsible for extending the fingers and wrist. It is composed of primarily fast-twitch muscle fibers and would not be considered a hybrid muscle.\n\n3: Flexor digitorum profundus - The flexor digitorum profundus muscle is responsible for flexing the fingers. Like the extensor digitorum, it is composed of primarily fast-twitch muscle fibers and would not be considered a hybrid muscle.\n\n4: Brachialis - The brachialis muscle is located in the upper arm and is responsible for flexing the elbow. It is primarily composed of slow-twitch muscle fibers and would be considered a hybrid muscle.\n\nBased on this analysis, the muscle that is not a hybrid muscle is the extensor digitorum.",
