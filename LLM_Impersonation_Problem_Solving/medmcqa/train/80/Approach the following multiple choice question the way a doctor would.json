A hybrid muscle is a muscle that exhibits characteristics of both fast-twitch (Type II) and slow-twitch (Type I) muscle fibers.\n\n1. Pectoralis major: This muscle is primarily a fast-twitch muscle with some slow-twitch characteristics, making it a hybrid muscle.\n\n2. Extensor digitorum: This muscle is primarily a fast-twitch muscle, making it a non-hybrid muscle.\n\n3. Flexor digitorum profundus: This muscle is primarily a fast-twitch muscle, making it a non-hybrid muscle.\n\n4. Brachialis: This muscle is primarily a slow-twitch muscle with some fast-twitch characteristics, making it a hybrid muscle.\n\nTherefore, the muscle that is not a hybrid muscle is the Extensor digitorum.",
