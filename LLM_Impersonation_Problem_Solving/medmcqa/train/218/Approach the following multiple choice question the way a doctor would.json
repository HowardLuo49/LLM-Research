Albuterol, Metaproterenol, Terbutaline, and Pirbuterol are all beta-2 adrenergic agonists commonly used for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory conditions. \n\nAmong these drugs, Terbutaline is the only medication that can be administered subcutaneously. This route of administration allows for the drug to be injected into the layer of tissue just below the skin, providing a relatively rapid onset of action. Albuterol, Metaproterenol, and Pirbuterol are typically administered via inhalation or oral routes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n3: Terbutaline",
