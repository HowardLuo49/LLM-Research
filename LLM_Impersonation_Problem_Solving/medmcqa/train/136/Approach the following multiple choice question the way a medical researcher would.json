Live vaccines are typically administered orally to induce immunity in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n2: H1n1 killed - This vaccine contains inactivated virus particles and is therefore administered via injection. Killed vaccines are unable to replicate in the body and require a stronger immune response for protection.\n\n3: H1n1 live - Similar to the Typhoral live vaccine, this vaccine contains a weakened form of the virus and would likely be administered orally.\n\n4: Yellow fever live - This vaccine is live attenuated and is typically administered via subcutaneous injection. Live vaccines are often administered via injection to ensure direct delivery to the immune system.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer would be:\n4: Yellow fever live (administered subcutaneously)",
