    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by considering the different mechanisms of genetic transfer in bacteria. \nThe correct answer is 3: Conjugation. This is the process in which genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another through direct cell-to-cell contact. Transduction involves transfer of genetic material through a virus, transformation involves uptake of naked DNA from the environment, and vertical transmission refers to the transfer of genetic material from parent to offspring.",
