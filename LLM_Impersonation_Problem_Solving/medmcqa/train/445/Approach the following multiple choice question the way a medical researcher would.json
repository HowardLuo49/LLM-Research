In this assay, the activity of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase would be measured in the presence of each of the options (L-Alanine, L-Tyrosine, L-Tryptophan, L-Phenylalanine) at varying concentrations.\n\nA non-competitive inhibitor typically binds to the enzyme at a site other than the active site, thereby reducing the enzyme's activity without affecting substrate binding. By comparing the enzyme activity in the presence of each option, the researcher could determine which one acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase.\n\nIf after conducting the assay, only one of the options shows a decrease in enzyme activity without affecting substrate binding, that option would be identified as the non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase.",
