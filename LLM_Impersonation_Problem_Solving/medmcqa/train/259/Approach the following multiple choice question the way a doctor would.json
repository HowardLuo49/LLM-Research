    "solution": 2,
    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this multiple choice question by first considering the normal structure of Factor V. Factor V is a protein involved in blood clotting, and a mutation at position 506 can lead to Factor V Leiden, a condition that increases the risk of blood clots.\n\nIn Factor V Leiden, the mutation results in a substitution at position 506 from glutamine to a different amino acid. Glutamine is a polar, uncharged amino acid. To determine which amino acid replaces glutamine at position 506 in Factor V Leiden, I would carefully consider the options provided:\n\n1: Alanine - Alanine is a nonpolar, uncharged amino acid.\n2: Arginine - Arginine is a polar, charged amino acid.\n3: Glycine - Glycine is the smallest amino acid and is neutral.\n4: Glutamine - This is the original amino acid at position 506.\n\nBased on the options provided, the most likely substitution for glutamine at position 506 in Factor V Leiden would be Alanine, as it is a nonpolar, uncharged amino acid that differs from glutamine. Therefore, I would choose option 1: Alanine as the answer to the question.",
