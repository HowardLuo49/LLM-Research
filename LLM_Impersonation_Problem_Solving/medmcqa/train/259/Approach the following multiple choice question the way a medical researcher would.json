Since the mutation results in a substitution at this position, it is important to determine the specific amino acid that is being substituted.\n\nIn this case, the normal amino acid at position 506 in Factor V is glutamine. The mutation results in a substitution at this position, so we need to determine which amino acid replaces glutamine in Factor V Leiden.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n2: Arginine\n\nThis substitution of glutamine to arginine at position 506 in Factor V is characteristic of Factor V Leiden.",
