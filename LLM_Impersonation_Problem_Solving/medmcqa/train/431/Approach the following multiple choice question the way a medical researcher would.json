    "gpt_response": "In order to determine which antihypertensive drug is contraindicated in a patient on lithium therapy to prevent toxicity, we must consider the potential drug interactions between lithium and each of the antihypertensive medications listed.\n\n1: Clonidine - Clonidine has been reported to increase lithium levels, potentially leading to lithium toxicity. Therefore, clonidine is contraindicated in patients on lithium therapy.\n\n2: Beta blockers - There is limited evidence of a significant interaction between beta blockers and lithium. Beta blockers are generally considered safe to use in patients also taking lithium.\n\n3: Calcium channel blockers - There is no significant interaction between calcium channel blockers and lithium. Calcium channel blockers are generally considered safe to use in patients also taking lithium.\n\n4: Diuretics - Some diuretics, particularly thiazide diuretics, can increase lithium levels and potentially lead to toxicity. Therefore, diuretics should be used with caution in patients on lithium therapy.\n\nBased on this analysis, Clonidine and Diuretics are contraindicated in a patient on lithium therapy in order to prevent toxicity.",
