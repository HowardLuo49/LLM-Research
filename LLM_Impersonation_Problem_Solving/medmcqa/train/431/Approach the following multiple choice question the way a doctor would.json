    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when a patient on lithium therapy is found to be hypertensive, it is important to consider the potential for drug interactions and contraindications. Lithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and certain antihypertensive medications can affect lithium levels in the body.\n\nIn this case, the antihypertensive drug that is contraindicated in a patient on lithium therapy in order to prevent toxicity is thiazide diuretics. Thiazide diuretics can decrease lithium excretion by the kidneys, leading to increased levels of lithium in the body and potentially causing lithium toxicity. Therefore, it is important to avoid thiazide diuretics in patients on lithium therapy.\n\nThe other antihypertensive drug options listed (clonidine, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers) do not have significant interactions with lithium and may be safer choices for treating hypertension in a patient on lithium therapy.",
