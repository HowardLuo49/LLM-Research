    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by first understanding the characteristics of petit mal seizures and the mechanism of action of each of the drugs listed. Petit mal seizures are a type of epilepsy characterized by sudden and brief lapses in consciousness, typically lasting only a few seconds.\n\nGiven that petit mal seizures are primarily due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain, the drug most effective for this type of seizure would be one that targets the specific mechanisms underlying petit mal seizures. In this case, the drug with a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity indicates that it specifically targets petit mal seizures.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer would be 2: Ethosuximide. Ethosuximide is a medication specifically used for the treatment of petit mal seizures and has been shown to be effective in controlling this type of seizure activity. Lamotrigine, Phenytoin, and Primidone are also antiepileptic drugs, but they do not have as specific activity against petit mal seizures as Ethosuximide.",
