    "gpt_response": "To answer this question from a medical researcher perspective, we would first need to analyze the characteristics of each drug listed in relation to its use in petit mal seizures and its spectrum of antiepileptic activity.\n\n1: Lamotrigine - Lamotrigine is commonly used in the treatment of partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and bipolar disorder. It is not typically used as a first-line treatment for petit mal seizures, which are a type of generalized seizure. Its spectrum of antiepileptic activity is broad, including both partial and generalized seizures.\n\n2: Ethosuximide - Ethosuximide is a well-established drug for the treatment of petit mal seizures, also known as absence seizures. It has a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity, primarily targeting specific types of generalized seizures like petit mal seizures.\n\n3: Phenytoin - Phenytoin is used in the treatment of various types of seizures, including partial seizures and tonic-clonic seizures. It is not typically used as a first-line treatment for petit mal seizures. Its spectrum of antiepileptic activity is broad, including both partial and generalized seizures.\n\n4: Primidone - Primidone is primarily used in the treatment of partial seizures and tonic-clonic seizures. It is not typically used as a first-line treatment for petit mal seizures. Its spectrum of antiepileptic activity is broad, including both partial and generalized seizures.\n\nBased on the information provided, the drug that is used in petit mal seizures and has a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity is 2: Ethosuximide.",
