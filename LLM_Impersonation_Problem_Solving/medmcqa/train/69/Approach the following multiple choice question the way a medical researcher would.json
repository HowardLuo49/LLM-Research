It is typically measured using spirometry, but not specifically by Bellow's spirometer. \n\n2: RV (Residual Volume) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. It is typically measured using spirometry, but not specifically by Bellow's spirometer. \n\n3: Closing volume is the volume in the lungs at which small airways begin to close during expiration. It is typically measured using helium dilution or nitrogen washout techniques, not spirometry or Bellow's spirometer. \n\n4: ERV (Expiratory Reserve Volume) is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. This is a measurement that could potentially be measured using Bellow's spirometer, as it is a standard measurement in spirometry testing. \n\nBased on this information, option 4 (ERV) is the most likely measurement that would be measured by Bellow's spirometer.",
