    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by looking at the different chemical compounds listed and their known effects on succinate dehydrogenase. Succinate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain, making it essential for cellular respiration.\n\nMalonate is a known inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, blocking its activity in the citric acid cycle. Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be 2: Malonate.",
