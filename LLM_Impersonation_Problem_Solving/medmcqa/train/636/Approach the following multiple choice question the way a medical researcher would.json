    "gpt_response": "In approaching this question as a medical researcher, I would first need to understand what ophthalmoplegic migraine is and its possible manifestations in order to determine which cranial nerve is most commonly involved. Ophthalmoplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine headache that involves the eye muscles and can cause weakness or paralysis of the ocular muscles, leading to double vision, drooping eyelids, or difficulty moving the eyes.\n\nBased on the symptoms described, it is likely that the third cranial nerve (III nerve) would be most commonly involved in ophthalmoplegic migraine. The third cranial nerve controls the movement of the eye muscles responsible for raising the eyelid, moving the eye up, down, and inwards, as well as controlling the shape of the pupil. Dysfunction of the third cranial nerve can lead to the symptoms typically seen in ophthalmoplegic migraine. \n\nTherefore, as a medical researcher, I would choose option 2: III nerve as the most common cranial nerve involved in ophthalmoplegic migraine.",
