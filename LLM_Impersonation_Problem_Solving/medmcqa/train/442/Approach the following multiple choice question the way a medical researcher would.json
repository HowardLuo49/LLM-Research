The lymphatic system is responsible for draining excess fluid and waste products from tissues, as well as playing a key role in immune function.\n\nThe suprarenal gland, also known as the adrenal gland, is located on top of each kidney and is an important endocrine gland. In terms of lymphatic drainage, the lymphatics of the suprarenal gland typically drain into the para-aortic lymph nodes. These lymph nodes are located near the aorta in the abdomen.\n\nBased on this understanding, my answer to the question would be:\n2: Para-aortic",
