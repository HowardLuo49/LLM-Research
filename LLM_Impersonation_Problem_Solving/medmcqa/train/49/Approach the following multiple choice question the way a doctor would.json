    "solution": 2,
    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would consider the metabolism of alcohol in the context of chronic alcoholism. In this case, the rate limiting component for alcohol metabolism excluding enzymes would likely be NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). This is because NAD+ is required for the oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde in the first step of alcohol metabolism. In chronic alcoholism, NAD+ levels may become depleted due to the excessive consumption of alcohol, leading to a potential bottleneck in the metabolism of alcohol. Therefore, I would choose option 2: NAD+ as the correct answer.",
