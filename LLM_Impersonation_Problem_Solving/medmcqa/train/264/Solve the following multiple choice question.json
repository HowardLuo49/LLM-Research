Gastroscopy reveals multiple, scattered, punctate hemorrhagic areas in her gastric mucosa. Biopsies from one of these hemorrhagic lesions reveal mucosal erosions with edema and hemorrhage. No mucosal ulceration is seen.\n1: Active chronic gastritis\n2: Acute gastritis\n3: Autoimmune gastritis\n4: Chronic gastritis",
