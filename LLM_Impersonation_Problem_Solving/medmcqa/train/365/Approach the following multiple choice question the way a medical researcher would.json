    "gpt_response": "To answer this question from a medical research perspective, one would need to consider the anatomical location typically associated with Osgood Schlatter disease. Osgood Schlatter disease is a condition that primarily affects the tibial tubercle, which is where the patellar tendon inserts into the tibia. This condition is characterized by inflammation and pain at the tibial tubercle in growing adolescents, particularly those who are active in sports that involve running and jumping. Therefore, the correct answer to this question would be 3: Tibial tubercle.",
