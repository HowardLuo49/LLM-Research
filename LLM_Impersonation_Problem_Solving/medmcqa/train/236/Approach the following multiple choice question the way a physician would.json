    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this multiple choice question by considering the differential diagnosis for blood stained sputum. \n\nBronchiectasis is a condition characterized by abnormal and permanent dilation of the bronchi, which can lead to recurrent infections and bleeding. Carcinoma bronchus is a type of lung cancer that can present with symptoms such as coughing up blood and chest pain. Adenoma bronchus is a rare type of benign tumor that can sometimes present with blood stained sputum. \n\nHowever, the most common cause of blood stained sputum in the context of this question would likely be pulmonary tuberculosis (T.B.), which is a highly contagious infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB can affect the lungs and cause symptoms such as coughing up blood, chest pain, and prolonged coughing.\n\nTherefore, in this case, I would select option 4: Pulmonary T.B. as the most likely cause of blood stained sputum being the only symptom.",
