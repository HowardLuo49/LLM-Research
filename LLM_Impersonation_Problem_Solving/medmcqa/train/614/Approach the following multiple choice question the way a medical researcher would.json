    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this multiple choice question by analyzing each option in the context of its mechanism of action and efficacy in treating pulmonary hypertension. \n\n1: Calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, are commonly used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. They work by dilating blood vessels and reducing the pressure on the heart, making them a viable option for this condition. \n\n2: Endothelin receptor antagonists, like bosentan or ambrisentan, are also commonly used in pulmonary hypertension treatment. These drugs block the action of endothelin, a substance that constricts blood vessels and contributes to high blood pressure in the lungs. \n\n3: Alpha blockers, such as doxazosin or prazosin, are not typically used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. They work by relaxing muscles in the prostate and bladder to improve urine flow in conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia. \n\n4: Prostacyclin analogs, like epoprostenol or treprostinil, are a key class of medications used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. These drugs mimic the effects of prostacyclin, a natural substance that dilates blood vessels and inhibits platelet aggregation.\n\nTherefore, based on the mechanisms of action and common usage in pulmonary hypertension treatment, the drug NOT used in pulmonary hypertension is likely 3: Alpha blocker.",
