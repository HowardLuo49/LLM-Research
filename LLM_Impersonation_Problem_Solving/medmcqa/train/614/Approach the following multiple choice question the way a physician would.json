    "gpt_response": "As a physician, when considering which drugs are not used in pulmonary hypertension, it's important to think about the mechanism of action and potential side effects of each drug. \n\n1: Calcium channel blockers are commonly used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension as they help to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow in the lungs. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\n2: Endothelin receptor antagonists are also commonly used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension as they help to block the effects of endothelin, a hormone that can constrict blood vessels. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\n3: Alpha blockers are not typically used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension as they can cause blood pressure to decrease too much, which can be dangerous in this condition. Therefore, this is the correct answer.\n\n4: Prostacyclin is commonly used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension as it helps to dilate blood vessels and decrease the pressure in the lungs. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the drug NOT used in pulmonary hypertension is alpha blocker.",
