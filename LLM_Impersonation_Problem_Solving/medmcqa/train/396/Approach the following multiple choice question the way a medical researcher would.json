Splenunculi are accessory spleens, also known as supernumerary spleens, which are small, round nodules of splenic tissue that are separate from the main spleen. These can be found in various locations within the abdomen. \n\nBased on this knowledge, I would consider the most common locations for splenunculi to be found. In this case, splenunculi are most commonly seen in the hilum of the spleen, which is the area where blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels enter and exit the spleen. Therefore, the correct answer to the multiple-choice question would be:\n\n1: Hilum of spleen",
