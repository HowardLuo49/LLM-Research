    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 1: optimizing w:p. When considering the stability of hydrocolloids, it is important to maintain the appropriate water-to-powder ratio to achieve the desired consistency and properties of the material. Manipulation, temperature, and storage conditions may also play a role, but optimizing the water-to-powder ratio is typically the primary method to ensure stability.",
