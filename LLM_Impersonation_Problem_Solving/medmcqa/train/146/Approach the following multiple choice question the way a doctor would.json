    "gpt_response": "Based on my knowledge as a doctor, the best approach to achieve dimension stability of hydrocolloids would be by optimizing the water to powder ratio (w:p). This helps to maintain the desired consistency and stability of the material. The other options such as using cold water, prolonged manipulation, and using a humidor may not have as significant of an impact on the dimension stability of hydrocolloids.",
