    "gpt_response": "1: A series of meiotic divisions forming blastomeres\n\nAs a physician, I would choose option 1 because cleavage of the zygote involves a series of rapid mitotic divisions, not meiotic divisions, which form blastomeres. Meiotic divisions only occur during the formation of gametes, not during the cleavage of the zygote.",
