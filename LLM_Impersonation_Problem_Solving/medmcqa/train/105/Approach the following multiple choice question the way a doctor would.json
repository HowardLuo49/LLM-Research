She had a bleeding of \"easy bleeding\" with frequent bleeding of the gums, epistaxis, cutaneous bleeding and menorrhagia, further testing revealed a deficiency of Von willebrand factor. Which of the following thrombogenic processes involving platelets is most directly impaired?\n1: Adhesion\n2: Aggregation\n3: Formation of fibrinogen bridges\n4: Conformational change with activation of phospholipid surface",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would consider that the deficiency of Von Willebrand factor directly impairs the process of platelet adhesion. Von Willebrand factor is essential for the adhesion of platelets to the injured blood vessel wall, which is the initial step in the formation of a platelet plug at the site of injury. Therefore, the most directly impaired thrombogenic process involving platelets in this case would be adhesion (Option 1).",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: As a doctor, I would consider that the deficiency of Von Willebrand factor directly impairs the process of platelet adhesion. Von Willebrand factor is essential for the adhesion of platelets to the injured blood vessel wall, which is the initial step in the formation of a platelet plug at the site of injury.
