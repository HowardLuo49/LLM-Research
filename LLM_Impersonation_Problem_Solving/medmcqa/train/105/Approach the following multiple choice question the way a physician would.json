    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following multiple choice question the way a physician would. A 28 year old female teacher is found to have a prolonged bleeding time and normal platelet count. She had a bleeding of \"easy bleeding\" with frequent bleeding of the gums, epistaxis, cutaneous bleeding and menorrhagia, further testing revealed a deficiency of Von willebrand factor. Which of the following thrombogenic processes involving platelets is most directly impaired?\n1: Adhesion\n2: Aggregation\n3: Formation of fibrinogen bridges\n4: Conformational change with activation of phospholipid surface",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 1: Adhesion. Von Willebrand factor is essential for platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall. Deficiency of Von Willebrand factor impairs the initial adhesion of platelets to the exposed subendothelial collagen, leading to prolonged bleeding time and increased tendency for mucocutaneous bleeding.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question, with options 1, 2, 3, 4. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: The correct answer is 1: Adhesion. Von Willebrand factor is essential for platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall. Deficiency of Von Willebrand factor impairs the initial adhesion of platelets to the exposed subendothelial collagen, leading to prolonged bleeding time and increased tendency for mucocutaneous bleeding.",
