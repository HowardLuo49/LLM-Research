She had a bleeding of \"easy bleeding\" with frequent bleeding of the gums, epistaxis, cutaneous bleeding and menorrhagia, further testing revealed a deficiency of Von willebrand factor. Which of the following thrombogenic processes involving platelets is most directly impaired?\n1: Adhesion\n2: Aggregation\n3: Formation of fibrinogen bridges\n4: Conformational change with activation of phospholipid surface",
