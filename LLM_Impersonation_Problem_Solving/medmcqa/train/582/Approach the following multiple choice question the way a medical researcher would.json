We would then look at each answer choice and evaluate them based on our knowledge of medical conditions and their associations with electrolyte imbalances.\n\nIn this case, persistent vomiting can lead to loss of gastric contents, which can result in a variety of electrolyte imbalances. One common electrolyte imbalance seen with vomiting is hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which occurs due to the loss of potassium and hydrogen ions. Therefore, option c) Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis would be a likely cause of persistent vomiting in G.O.O.\n\nNext, we would need to evaluate the other answer choices in relation to electrolyte imbalances associated with vomiting. Hyponatremic hyperchloremia (option a) can occur with vomiting but it is less common compared to hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Hypernatremia without decreased chloride and alkalosis (option b) is less likely to be associated with persistent vomiting. Paradoxical aciduria (option d) is not a common electrolyte imbalance seen with vomiting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be 3: bd, as hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis is a common electrolyte imbalance seen with persistent vomiting in G.O.O. and hypernatremia without decreased chloride and alkalosis is less common.",
