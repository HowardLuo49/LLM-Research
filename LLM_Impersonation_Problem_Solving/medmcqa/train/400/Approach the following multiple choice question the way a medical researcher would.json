It is commonly associated with ciliopathies, including autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and Caroli syndrome.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely correct answer from the list provided would be:\n2: ARPKD\n\nThis is because ARPKD is a ciliopathy that often presents with congenital hepatic fibrosis as a characteristic feature.
