In this case, the correct answer would be:\n\n3: Cystic hygroma\n\nCystic hygroma is a fluid-filled sac that results from a blockage in the lymphatic system. It has a strong association with chromosomal abnormalities, particularly trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). This finding on ultrasound should prompt further evaluation and consideration for genetic testing. The other options, choroid plexus cyst, nuchal translucency, and single umbilical artery, are also ultrasound findings that can be associated with aneuploidy, but cystic hygroma has the highest association.",
