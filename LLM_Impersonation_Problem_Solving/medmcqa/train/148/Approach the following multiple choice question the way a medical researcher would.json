Nuchal translucency refers to the fluid-filled space at the back of the baby's neck, and increased thickness of this space has been shown to be strongly associated with chromosomal abnormalities, including aneuploidy. \n\nChoroid plexus cyst, cystic hygroma, and single umbilical artery have been associated with aneuploidy as well, but nuchal translucency is considered to have the highest association based on current evidence. \n\nTherefore, as a medical researcher, I would select option 2: Nuchal translucency as the ultrasound finding with the highest association with aneuploidy.",
