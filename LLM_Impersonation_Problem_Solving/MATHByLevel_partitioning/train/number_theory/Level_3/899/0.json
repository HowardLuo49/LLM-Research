You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSolve the congruence $11n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{43}$, as a residue modulo 43.\n",
    "solution": "Note that 43 is a close to a multiple of 11, namely 44.  Multiplying both sides of the given congruence by 4, we get $44n \\equiv 28 \\pmod{43}$, which reduces to $n \\equiv \\boxed{28} \\pmod{43}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the congruence $11n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{43}$, we can start by finding the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 43.\nTo find the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 mod 43, we need to find a number x such that (11 * x) mod 43 = 1.\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 mod 43:  \n43 = 3 * 11 + 10    \n11 = 10 * 1 + 1    \nThus, the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 mod 43 is 1.",
