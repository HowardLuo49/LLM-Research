The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe bagel shop has enough benches to sit $204_6$ people.If $2$ people are supposed to sit on one bench, how many benches does the shop have?\nFirst, convert the number of people the benches can sit from base 6 to base 10. \n$204_6 = 2*6^2 + 0*6^1 + 4*6^0 = 2*36 + 4 = 72 + 4 = 76.$\nSo, the benches can sit 76 people in base 10.",
    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches",
    "gpt_response": "Since 2 people are supposed to sit on one bench, divide the total number of people by 2 to find the number of benches.\n$76 \\div 2 = 38$\nTherefore, the bagel shop has 38 benches.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 38?: Since 2 people are supposed to sit on one bench, divide the total number of people by 2 to find the number of benches.\n$76 \\div 2 = 38$\nTherefore, the bagel shop has 38 benches.",
