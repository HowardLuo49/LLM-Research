The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe number $101$ is the smallest three-digit palindromic prime.What is the second-smallest one?\nLet's start by listing out the prime numbers less than 101 to see if there are any palindromic primes among them. \nThe prime numbers less than 101 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\nNow, our next step could be to check each of these primes to see if any of them are palindromic.",
    "solution": "We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s. Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1. We can only vary the tens digit. Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A palindromic number reads the same forwards as backwards. Thus, we see that the palindromic primes less than 101 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101. \n\nThe second-smallest palindromic prime is 101.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 131?: A palindromic number reads the same forwards as backwards. Thus, we see that the palindromic primes less than 101 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101. \n\nThe second-smallest palindromic prime is 101.",
