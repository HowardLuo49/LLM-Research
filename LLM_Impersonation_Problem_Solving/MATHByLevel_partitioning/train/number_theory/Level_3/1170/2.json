You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nMohan is selling cookies at the economics fair.As he decides how to package the cookies, he finds that when he bags them in groups of 4, he has 3 left over.When he bags them in groups of 5, he has 2 left over.\nTotal number of cookies Mohan has = 4n + 3, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nNumber of packs of 6 cookies Mohan will have to sell = (4n + 3)/6.\n\nTotal revenue generated by selling each pack at $5 = 5*((4n + 3)/6).\n\nIn order to analyze whether Mohan can reach a target revenue, we need to specify the target revenue and calculate if he can achieve it by selling a certain number of cookie packs.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the least number of cookies Mohan could have. From the given information, we know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\\\\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\\\\na&\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that $a=3+4m$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\implies m\\equiv 1\\pmod 5.\\] So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $m=1+5n$. Substituting $a=3+4m$ into $(3)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 2\\pmod 7.\\] Substituting $m=1+5n$ into this gives \\[1+5n\\equiv 2\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7.\\] The least $n$ such that $n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7$ is $n=3$. Since \\[a=3+4m=3+4(1+5n)=7+20n,\\]we have\\[n\\ge 3\\implies a=7+20n\\ge 67.\\] Since $67$ satisfies the three congruences, $a=\\boxed{67}$.",

Let's assume he is selling each pack for $5. \n\nLet the target revenue be R dollars.\n\nNow, we need to set up an equation to find the value of n (number of packs) such that the revenue generated by selling n packs at $5 each is equal to the target revenue R. \n\nThe equation will be: 5*((4n + 3)/6) = R\n\nNext, solve this equation to find the value of n.",
