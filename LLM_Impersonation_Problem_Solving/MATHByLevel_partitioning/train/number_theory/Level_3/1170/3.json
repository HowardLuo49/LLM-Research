    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nMohan is selling cookies at the economics fair.As he decides how to package the cookies, he finds that when he bags them in groups of 4, he has 3 left over.When he bags them in groups of 5, he has 2 left over.When he bags them in groups of 7, he has 4 left over.\nIn order to determine the target revenue, we need to know the price at which Mohan is selling each cookie pack. Let's assume he is selling each pack for $5. \n\nLet the target revenue be R dollars.\n\nNow, we need to set up an equation to find the value of n (number of packs) such that the revenue generated by selling n packs at $5 each is equal to the target revenue R. \n\nThe equation will be: 5*((4n + 3)/6) = R\n\nNext, solve this equation to find the value of n.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the least number of cookies Mohan could have. From the given information, we know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\\\\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\\\\na&\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that $a=3+4m$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\implies m\\equiv 1\\pmod 5.\\] So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $m=1+5n$. Substituting $a=3+4m$ into $(3)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 2\\pmod 7.\\] Substituting $m=1+5n$ into this gives \\[1+5n\\equiv 2\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7.\\] The least $n$ such that $n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7$ is $n=3$. Since \\[a=3+4m=3+4(1+5n)=7+20n,\\]we have\\[n\\ge 3\\implies a=7+20n\\ge 67.\\] Since $67$ satisfies the three congruences, $a=\\boxed{67}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The correct equation should have been: 5*((4n + 3)/6) = R, simplifying, we get 5(2n + 1/2) = R, so 10n + 5/2 = R. \n\nTo solve the equation, we can isolate n by doing the following steps: 10n = R - 5/2 => n = (R - 5/2) / 10\n\nNow, calculate the number of packs Mohan needs to sell in order to reach the target revenue R. Once you have the value of n, you can then determine the total number of cookies he must sell.",
