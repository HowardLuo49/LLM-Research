    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nMohan is selling cookies at the economics fair.As he decides how to package the cookies, he finds that when he bags them in groups of 4, he has 3 left over.\nLet's start by determining the total number of cookies Mohan has to sell at the fair. \n\nNext, let's assume that Mohan sells the cookies in packs of 6. So let's find out how many packs he will have to sell.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue Mohan will generate if the price of each pack is $5.\n\nFinally, let's analyze whether Mohan can reach a target revenue if he sells a certain number of cookie packs. \n\nThe next person to solve this problem will have to calculate the total revenue generated by Mohan based on the number of cookie packs sold. They will also need to determine whether Mohan can reach a target revenue by selling a certain number of cookie packs.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the least number of cookies Mohan could have. From the given information, we know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\\\\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\\\\na&\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that $a=3+4m$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\implies m\\equiv 1\\pmod 5.\\] So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $m=1+5n$. Substituting $a=3+4m$ into $(3)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 2\\pmod 7.\\] Substituting $m=1+5n$ into this gives \\[1+5n\\equiv 2\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7.\\] The least $n$ such that $n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7$ is $n=3$. Since \\[a=3+4m=3+4(1+5n)=7+20n,\\]we have\\[n\\ge 3\\implies a=7+20n\\ge 67.\\] Since $67$ satisfies the three congruences, $a=\\boxed{67}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Total number of cookies Mohan has = 4n + 3, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nNumber of packs of 6 cookies Mohan will have to sell = (4n + 3)/6.\n\nTotal revenue generated by selling each pack at $5 = 5*((4n + 3)/6).\n\nIn order to analyze whether Mohan can reach a target revenue, we need to specify the target revenue and calculate if he can achieve it by selling a certain number of cookie packs.",
