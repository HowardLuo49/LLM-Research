    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nMohan is selling cookies at the economics fair.As he decides how to package the cookies, he finds that when he bags them in groups of 4, he has 3 left over.When he bags them in groups of 5, he has 2 left over.When he bags them in groups of 7, he has 4 left over.What is the least number of cookies that Mohan could have?\nThe correct equation should have been: 5*((4n + 3)/6) = R, simplifying, we get 5(2n + 1/2) = R, so 10n + 5/2 = R. \n\nTo solve the equation, we can isolate n by doing the following steps: 10n = R - 5/2 => n = (R - 5/2) / 10\n\nNow, calculate the number of packs Mohan needs to sell in order to reach the target revenue R. Once you have the value of n, you can then determine the total number of cookies he must sell.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the least number of cookies Mohan could have. From the given information, we know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\\\\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\\\\na&\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $m$ such that $a=3+4m$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\\implies m\\equiv 1\\pmod 5.\\] So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $m=1+5n$. Substituting $a=3+4m$ into $(3)$ yields \\[3+4m\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 2\\pmod 7.\\] Substituting $m=1+5n$ into this gives \\[1+5n\\equiv 2\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7.\\] The least $n$ such that $n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7$ is $n=3$. Since \\[a=3+4m=3+4(1+5n)=7+20n,\\]we have\\[n\\ge 3\\implies a=7+20n\\ge 67.\\] Since $67$ satisfies the three congruences, $a=\\boxed{67}$.",
