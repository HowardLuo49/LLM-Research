The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the least positive integer that satisfies the following conditions?a) When divided by 2, the remainder is 1.\n\nb) When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n\nc) When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nd) When divided by 5, the remainder is 4.\nGiven conditions:\n1. The number is divisible by 2, 3, and 5.\n2. The number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and 6.\n3. The number is a perfect square.\n\nTo find the least positive integer that satisfies all these conditions, we can start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 5, which is 30. This means the number must be divisible by 30.\n\nNext, we consider the remainders when the number is divided by 4 and 6. If the number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and 6, it must be 1 greater than a multiple of both 4 and 6.\n\nLet's start by finding the multiples of 4 and 6:\nMultiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, ...\nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...\n\nNow, let's find the number that is 1 greater than a multiple of both 4 and 6.",
    "solution": "Let the smallest common solution be $a$. The given system of congruences is \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 1\\equiv -1\\pmod 2,\\\\\na\\equiv 2\\equiv -1\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv 3\\equiv -1\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv 4\\equiv -1\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Note that if $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 4$, then $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 2$ as well,  so we need only consider the final three congruences. Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv -1\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 59\\pmod{60}$.\n\nSo $a$ has a lower bound of $59$, but $59$ also happens to satisfy all of the original congruences. Thus, $a=\\boxed{59}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number that is 1 greater than a multiple of both 4 and 6, we need to find the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12. Adding 1 to a multiple of 12 gives us 13.\n\nSo far, we know that the number must be divisible by 30 and leave a remainder of 13 when divided by 12.\n\nTo satisfy the condition that the number is a perfect square, we need to find the smallest perfect square that satisfies these conditions. The smallest perfect square greater than 30 that leaves a remainder of 13 when divided by 12 is 49, which is 7^2.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that satisfies all the conditions is 7.",
