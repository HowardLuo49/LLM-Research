    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA box contains gold coins.If the coins are equally divided among six people, four coins are left over.If the coins are equally divided among five people, three coins are left over.If the box holds the smallest number of coins that meets these two conditions, how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people?\nTo solve the system of equations 20x = 6n + 4 and 10x = 1.4(6n + 4), we can first simplify the second equation by distributing the 1.4 on the right side to get 10x = 8.4n + 5.6. \n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for 10x from the first equation into the simplified second equation to eliminate x. This gives us 20(6n + 4) = 8.4n + 5.6.\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of n, which we can then substitute back into one of the original equations to solve for x.",
    "solution": "The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \\[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \\ldots.\\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \\[3, 8, 13,\n18, 23, 28, 33, \\ldots.\\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions. Because $4 \\times 7 = 28$, there are $\\boxed{0}$ coins left when they are divided among seven people. \\[ \\text{OR} \\] If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible by both 6 and 5. The smallest number that is divisible by 6 and 5 is 30, so the smallest possible number of coins in the box is 28, and our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Expanding the left side of the equation, we get 120n + 80 = 8.4n + 5.6. \n\nBringing all the n terms to one side, we get 111.6n = -74.4. \n\nDividing by 111.6, we get n = -0.66667. \n\nThis means that our assumption that the box holds the smallest number of coins that meet both conditions is incorrect. We need to go back and find the correct values of x and n. \n\nLet's calculate the correct values. \n\nStarting with the equation 20x = 6n + 4, we can rearrange to get n = 20x/6 - 4/6 = 10x/3 - 2/3. \n\nNow let's substitute this into the second equation 10x = 8.4n + 5.6. \n\nSubstituting and simplifying, we get 10x = 8.4(10x/3 - 2/3) + 5.6. \n\nThis simplifies to 10x = 28x - 18.4 + 5.6. \n\nRearranging terms, we get 4x = 14, so x = 3.5. \n\nNow we can substitute x back into the expression for n to find n. n = 10(3.5)/3 - 2/3 = 11.333. \n\nTherefore, the correct values for x and n are x = 3.5 and n = 11.333. \n\nWhen equally divided among seven people, the number of coins left will be 3, which is the remainder when dividing the total number of coins by 7.",
