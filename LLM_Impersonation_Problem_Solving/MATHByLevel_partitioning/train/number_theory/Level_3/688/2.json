    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA box contains gold coins.If the coins are equally divided among six people, four coins are left over.If the coins are equally divided among five people, three coins are left over.\nLet's first consider the case where each coin is worth 20 cents. In this case, the total value of the coins would be 20x. If the coins are equally divided among six people with four coins left over, then the number of coins can be represented as 6n + 4, where n is an integer. \n\nSo, 20x = 6n + 4.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where each coin is worth 10 cents. The total value of the coins in this case would be 10x. Since there are 40% more coins than in the previous case, the number of coins with a value of 10 cents each would be 1.4 times that of the previous case.\n\nThus, 10x = 1.4(6n + 4).\n\nThe next step would be to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and n.",
    "solution": "The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \\[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \\ldots.\\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \\[3, 8, 13,\n18, 23, 28, 33, \\ldots.\\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions. Because $4 \\times 7 = 28$, there are $\\boxed{0}$ coins left when they are divided among seven people. \\[ \\text{OR} \\] If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible by both 6 and 5. The smallest number that is divisible by 6 and 5 is 30, so the smallest possible number of coins in the box is 28, and our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the system of equations 20x = 6n + 4 and 10x = 1.4(6n + 4), we can first simplify the second equation by distributing the 1.4 on the right side to get 10x = 8.4n + 5.6. \n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for 10x from the first equation into the simplified second equation to eliminate x. This gives us 20(6n + 4) = 8.4n + 5.6.\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of n, which we can then substitute back into one of the original equations to solve for x.",
