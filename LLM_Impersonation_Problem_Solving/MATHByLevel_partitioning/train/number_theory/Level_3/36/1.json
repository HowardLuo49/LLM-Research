The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nHow many different prime factors does $20!$ have?(Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (n-1)\\cdot n$.)\nThe prime factorization of $20!$ is $2^{18} \\cdot 3^8 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19$.\nTo find the number of different prime factors, count the number of unique prime bases.",
    "solution": "$20!=20\\cdot19\\cdot18\\cdot...\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1$ is divisible by every prime less than 20. There are $\\boxed{8}$ such primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.",
