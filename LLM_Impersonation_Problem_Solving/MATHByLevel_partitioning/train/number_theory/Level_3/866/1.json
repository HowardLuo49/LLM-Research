You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nMarsha has two numbers, $a$ and $b$.When she divides $a$ by 70 she gets a remainder of 64.\nThe sum of the two numbers is 50: $a + b = 50$.\nThe product of the two numbers is 282: $ab = 282$.\nTo find the values of $a$ and $b$, we can first factorize 282 to find the pairs of factors that multiply to 282. \n\nFactors of 282:\n1, 2, 3, 6, 47, 94, 141, 282\n\nSince the sum of the two numbers is 50, we can look for a pair of factors from the list whose sum is 50.",
