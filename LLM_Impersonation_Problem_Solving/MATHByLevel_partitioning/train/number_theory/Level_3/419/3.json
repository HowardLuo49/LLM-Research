    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen we say that Ray is climbing up the stairs $m$ at a time, we mean that he starts on the floor (step $0$) then jumps to step $m$ and then to $2m$ and so on until the number of steps to the top is less than $m$.Ray climbs up a flight of stairs of $n$ steps in two ways.When he does it $4$ steps at a time, there are $3$ steps left at the top.When he does it $5$ steps at a time, there are $2$ steps left at the top.\nTaking the given information, we know that when Ray climbs up the stairs $4$ steps at a time, there are $3$ steps left at the top. So, now we can substitute these values into our formula for the number of steps that Ray will take to reach the top of the stairs, $x = \\frac{n^2}{2m} - \\frac{n}{2}$ when $m = 4$ and there are $3$ steps left at the top. \n\nLet's calculate this: \n\n$x = \\frac{n^2}{2(4)} - \\frac{n}{2} = \\frac{n^2}{8} - \\frac{n}{2} = 3$\n\nTherefore, \n\n$\\frac{n^2}{8} - \\frac{n}{2} = 3$\n\n$8 \\times 3 = n^2 - 4n$\n\n$24 = n^2 - 4n$\n\nSo, the next step would be to solve the quadratic equation $n^2 - 4n - 24 = 0$ to find the possible values of $n$. We can use the quadratic formula for this.",
    "solution": "The given information translates to the congruences \\begin{align*}\nn\\equiv 3 & \\pmod 4,\\\\\nn\\equiv 2 & \\pmod 5.\\\\\n\\end{align*}From the first congruence we obtain that $n = 3+4k$ for some integer $k.$ Combining this result with the second congruence, we have $3+4k=n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5.$ Therefore, $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5.$ So, $k = 1+5t$ for some integer $t.$ Substituting $1+5t$ for $k$, we have  \\begin{align*}\nn &=3+4k\\\\\n&=3+4(1+5t)\\\\\n&=7+20t \\equiv 7 \\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}The smallest such $n$ greater than $10$ is $\\boxed{27}$.",
