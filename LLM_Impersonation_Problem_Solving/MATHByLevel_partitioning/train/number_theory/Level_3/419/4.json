The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen we say that Ray is climbing up the stairs $m$ at a time, we mean that he starts on the floor (step $0$) then jumps to step $m$ and then to $2m$ and so on until the number of steps to the top is less than $m$.Ray climbs up a flight of stairs of $n$ steps in two ways.When he does it $4$ steps at a time, there are $3$ steps left at the top.When he does it $5$ steps at a time, there are $2$ steps left at the top.What is the smallest possible value of $n$ that is greater than $10$?\nQuadratic formula: $n = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-24)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$n = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 96}}{2}$\n\n$n = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{112}}{2}$\n\n$n = \\frac{4 \\pm 4\\sqrt{7}}{2}$\n\n$n = 2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{7}$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $n$ are $2 + 2\\sqrt{7}$ and $2 - 2\\sqrt{7}$.",
    "solution": "The given information translates to the congruences \\begin{align*}\nn\\equiv 3 & \\pmod 4,\\\\\nn\\equiv 2 & \\pmod 5.\\\\\n\\end{align*}From the first congruence we obtain that $n = 3+4k$ for some integer $k.$ Combining this result with the second congruence, we have $3+4k=n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5.$ Therefore, $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5.$ So, $k = 1+5t$ for some integer $t.$ Substituting $1+5t$ for $k$, we have  \\begin{align*}\nn &=3+4k\\\\\n&=3+4(1+5t)\\\\\n&=7+20t \\equiv 7 \\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}The smallest such $n$ greater than $10$ is $\\boxed{27}$.",
