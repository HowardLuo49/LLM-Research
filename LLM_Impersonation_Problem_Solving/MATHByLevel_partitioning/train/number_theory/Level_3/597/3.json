    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nYou recently bought more than 100 eggs.The eggs are sorted in containers that can store exactly 12 eggs.However, upon inspecting the containers, you realize that two containers each hold only 11 eggs, while all the other containers hold 12 eggs.What is the smallest number of eggs you could have right now?\nNext step: Let's represent the total number of containers as \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is an integer.",
    "solution": "If the two containers that held 11 eggs each held 12 eggs, then the number of eggs that you have would have been a multiple of 12. However, two eggs were removed, so the number of eggs you can have is two less than a multiple of 12. Therefore, the number of eggs you could have can be written in the form $12c-2$, where $c$ represents the number of containers you have. As a result, we would like to solve the inequality $12c-2 > 100$, which has solution $c > 8\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, since the number of containers must be an integer, we must have $c=9$, so the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is $12(9) - 2 = \\boxed{106}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let \\(x\\) be the total number of containers required to hold all the eggs.\nSince each container can store exactly 12 eggs, the total number of eggs can be represented as \\(12x\\).\nOut of \\(x\\) containers, two containers each hold only 11 eggs instead of 12.\nTherefore, the total number of eggs can also be represented as \\(12x - 2\\).\nGiven that the total number of eggs is more than 100, we have \\(12x - 2 > 100\\).\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\\(12x - 2 > 100\\)\n\\(12x > 102\\)\n\\(x > 8.5\\)\n\nSince x must be an integer representing the total number of containers, the smallest integer greater than 8.5 is 9. Therefore, the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is 12 * 9 = 108 eggs.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 106?: Let \\(x\\) be the total number of containers required to hold all the eggs.\nSince each container can store exactly 12 eggs, the total number of eggs can be represented as \\(12x\\).\nOut of \\(x\\) containers, two containers each hold only 11 eggs instead of 12.\nTherefore, the total number of eggs can also be represented as \\(12x - 2\\).\nGiven that the total number of eggs is more than 100, we have \\(12x - 2 > 100\\).\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\\(12x - 2 > 100\\)\n\\(12x > 102\\)\n\\(x > 8.5\\)\n\nSince x must be an integer representing the total number of containers, the smallest integer greater than 8.5 is 9.
