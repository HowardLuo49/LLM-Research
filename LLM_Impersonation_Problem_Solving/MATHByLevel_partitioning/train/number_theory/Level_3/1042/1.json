The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe positive integer divisors of 175, except 1, are arranged around a circle so that every pair of adjacent integers has a common factor greater than 1.What is the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7?\nGiven that 175 = 5^2 * 7, the positive integer divisors of 175 are 5, 7, 25, 35, and 175. \nTo place them around a circle such that each pair of adjacent integers have a common factor greater than 1, we must first consider the greatest common divisors between each pair of adjacent numbers.",
    "solution": "$175=5^2\\cdot7^1$. To arrange the divisors of 175, we can (conveniently) start with the divisor 7. Since $\\gcd(5,7)=1$, the two divisors that are adjacent to 7 must be multiples of 7, which means they have to be $5^1\\cdot7=35$ and $5^2\\cdot7=175$. Thus, the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7 is $35+175=\\boxed{210}$.",
