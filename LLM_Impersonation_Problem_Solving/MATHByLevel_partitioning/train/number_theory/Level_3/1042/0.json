You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe positive integer divisors of 175, except 1, are arranged around a circle so that every pair of adjacent integers has a common factor greater than 1.\n",
    "solution": "$175=5^2\\cdot7^1$. To arrange the divisors of 175, we can (conveniently) start with the divisor 7. Since $\\gcd(5,7)=1$, the two divisors that are adjacent to 7 must be multiples of 7, which means they have to be $5^1\\cdot7=35$ and $5^2\\cdot7=175$. Thus, the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7 is $35+175=\\boxed{210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that 175 = 5^2 * 7, the positive integer divisors of 175 are 5, 7, 25, 35, and 175. \nTo place them around a circle such that each pair of adjacent integers have a common factor greater than 1, we must first consider the greatest common divisors between each pair of adjacent numbers.",
