You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAdd $704_{12} + 159_{12}$.\n",
    "solution": "When adding the numbers in base $12$, we start by adding the rightmost digits as we do in normal addition. Since $4 + 9$ yields a residue of $1$ upon division by $12$, we write down a $1$ as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry-over a $1$. The remaining two digits do not yield and carry-overs, so we can add them as normal. Carrying out this addition, we find that:$$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{}{7} & \\stackrel{1}{0} & \\stackrel{}{4}_{12} \\\\ &+ & & 1 & 5 & 9_{12} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} && & 8 & 6 & 1_{12} \\\\ \\end{array} .$$Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{861_{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to convert the numbers to base 10 in order to add them together. \n\n$704_{12} = 7*12^2 + 0*12^1 + 4*12^0 = 7*144 + 4*1 = 1008$\n\n$159_{12} = 1*12^2 + 5*12^1 + 9*12^0 = 1*144 + 5*12 + 9*1 =  189$\n\nNow we can add the two numbers together in base 10: $1008 + 189$\n\nNext, we need to add the two numbers together in base 10:\n\n$1008 + 189 = 1197$\n\nTherefore, the sum of $704_{12} + 159_{12}$ is $1197_{10}$.",
