The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAdd $704_{12} + 159_{12}$.Express your answer in base $12$, using $A$ for $10$ and $B$ for $11$ if necessary.\nFirst, we need to convert the numbers to base 10 in order to add them together. \n\n$704_{12} = 7*12^2 + 0*12^1 + 4*12^0 = 7*144 + 4*1 = 1008$\n\n$159_{12} = 1*12^2 + 5*12^1 + 9*12^0 = 1*144 + 5*12 + 9*1 =  189$\n\nNow we can add the two numbers together in base 10: $1008 + 189$\n\nNext, we need to add the two numbers together in base 10:\n\n$1008 + 189 = 1197$\n\nTherefore, the sum of $704_{12} + 159_{12}$ is $1197_{10}$.",
    "solution": "When adding the numbers in base $12$, we start by adding the rightmost digits as we do in normal addition. Since $4 + 9$ yields a residue of $1$ upon division by $12$, we write down a $1$ as the rightmost digit of the sum, and carry-over a $1$. The remaining two digits do not yield and carry-overs, so we can add them as normal. Carrying out this addition, we find that:$$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{}{7} & \\stackrel{1}{0} & \\stackrel{}{4}_{12} \\\\ &+ & & 1 & 5 & 9_{12} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} && & 8 & 6 & 1_{12} \\\\ \\end{array} .$$Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{861_{12}}$.",
