    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nJenna collects stamps.She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.The other has 1008.What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?\nLet's write an equation using the information given in the problem: 840 = x * (840 / x). \n\nSimplify the equation to solve for x: 840 = 840.\n\nThere seems to be an error in the simplification of the equation. Let's reexamine the equation and try to correctly simplify it to find the value of x.",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The equation in this problem should be set up as follows: 840 = x * n, where x represents the number of stamps on each page and n represents the total number of pages in the stamp book with 840 stamps. \n\nTo find the largest value of x, we need to find the greatest common factor of 840 and 1008, as we want both stamp books to have the same number of stamps on each page. \n\nThe greatest common factor of 840 and 1008 is 168. Therefore, the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page is 168.",
