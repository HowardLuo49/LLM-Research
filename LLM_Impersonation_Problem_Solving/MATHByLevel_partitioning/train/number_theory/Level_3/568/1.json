The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind the modular inverse of $4$, modulo $21$.Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $20$, inclusive.\nSo the problem is asking us to find a number $x$ such that $4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$.\nFirst, let's find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $4$ and $21$ using the Euclidean algorithm.\n$21 = 5(4) + 1$\n$4 = 4(1) + 0$\nThe gcd is $1$ which means that $4$ is invertible modulo $21$. \n\nNext, let's express $1$ as a linear combination of $4$ and $21$ using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n$1 = 21 - 5(4)$\nThis means that the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ is $-5 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{21}$.\nTherefore, the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ is $16$.",
    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $4a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 21. One approach is to check integers of the form $21k+1$, where $k\\geq 0$ is an integer, for divisibility by 4. We find that 22 and 43 are not divisible by 4, but $21(3)+1=64$ is equal to $4\\times 16$. Thus $\\boxed{16}$ times 4 is congruent to 1 modulo 21.",
