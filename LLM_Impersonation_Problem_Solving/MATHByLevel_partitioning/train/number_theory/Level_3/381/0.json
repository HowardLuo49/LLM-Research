You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe base 5 number $34x1_5$ is divisible by 31.\n",
    "solution": "The base 5 number $34x1_5$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 5^3 + 4 \\cdot 5^2 + x \\cdot 5 + 1 = 5x + 476$.  The base-5 digit $x$ must be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Among these values, only $x = \\boxed{4}$ makes $5x + 476$ divisible by 31.",
    "gpt_response": "Since the number is given in base 5, we need to convert it to base 10 in order to work with it more easily. \n\n$34x1_5 = 3*5^3 + 4*5^2 + x*5^1 + 1*5^0 = 375 + 100 + 5x + 1 = 476 + 5x$ \n\nNow, we know that $476 + 5x$ is divisible by 31. \n\nTo find the possible values of $x$, we can evaluate $476 + 5x$ modulo 31 and set it equal to 0. \n\n$476 + 5x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}$\n\n$15 + 5x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}$\n\n$5x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{31}$\n\n$5x \\equiv 16 \\equiv 47 \\pmod{31}$\n\nAt this point, let's find the inverse of 5 modulo 31 to solve for x.",
