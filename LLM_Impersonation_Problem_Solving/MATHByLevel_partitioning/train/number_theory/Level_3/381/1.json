    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe base 5 number $34x1_5$ is divisible by 31.What is the digit $x$?\nSince the number is given in base 5, we need to convert it to base 10 in order to work with it more easily. \n\n$34x1_5 = 3*5^3 + 4*5^2 + x*5^1 + 1*5^0 = 375 + 100 + 5x + 1 = 476 + 5x$ \n\nNow, we know that $476 + 5x$ is divisible by 31. \n\nTo find the possible values of $x$, we can evaluate $476 + 5x$ modulo 31 and set it equal to 0. \n\n$476 + 5x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}$\n\n$15 + 5x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}$\n\n$5x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{31}$\n\n$5x \\equiv 16 \\equiv 47 \\pmod{31}$\n\nAt this point, let's find the inverse of 5 modulo 31 to solve for x.",
    "solution": "The base 5 number $34x1_5$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 5^3 + 4 \\cdot 5^2 + x \\cdot 5 + 1 = 5x + 476$.  The base-5 digit $x$ must be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Among these values, only $x = \\boxed{4}$ makes $5x + 476$ divisible by 31.",
    "gpt_response": "The inverse of 5 modulo 31 is 25 because $5*25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\n$5x \\equiv 47 \\pmod{31}$ becomes $x \\equiv 47*25 \\equiv 1175 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nTherefore, the digit $x$ is 7.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 4?: The inverse of 5 modulo 31 is 25 because $5*25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\n$5x \\equiv 47 \\pmod{31}$ becomes $x \\equiv 47*25 \\equiv 1175 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nTherefore, the digit $x$ is 7.",
