You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA $\\textit{composite number}$ is a number that has two or more prime factors.\n",
    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing out the first few composite numbers: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, ...\n\nTo find prime factors of a number, we can start by dividing the number by the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, ...).\n\nFor example, let's take the number 20 and find its prime factors: \n\n$20 = 2 \\times 10$\n\n$10 = 2 \\times 5$\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 20 are 2 and 5.\n\nNow, let's move on to finding prime factors for other composite numbers and listing them out to see if any patterns emerge.",
