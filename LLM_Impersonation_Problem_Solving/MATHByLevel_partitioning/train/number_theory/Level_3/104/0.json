You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $x$ be a positive integer such that $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$.\n",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by writing $x\\equiv 9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$. Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$.\n\nModulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\\cdot (9\\cdot 9^{-1}) \\equiv (11\\cdot 9)\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1}$. Thus \\begin{align*}\n11 + 9^{-1} &\\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\pmod{25},\n\\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNotice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the statement $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$, we can rewrite this as an equation: $9x = 25k + 1$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNext, we can rearrange the equation to isolate $x$: $x = \\frac{25k + 1}{9}$. \n\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we need to find values of $k$ such that $\\frac{25k + 1}{9}$ is an integer. \n\nTo do this, we can start by checking different values of $k$ starting from $k = 1$ and see if the expression $\\frac{25k + 1}{9}$ results in an integer. \n\nOnce we find the values of $k$ that satisfy the condition, we can substitute back into the equation to find the corresponding values of $x$.",
