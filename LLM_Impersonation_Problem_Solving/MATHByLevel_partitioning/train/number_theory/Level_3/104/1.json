    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $x$ be a positive integer such that $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$.What is the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$?\nGiven the statement $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$, we can rewrite this as an equation: $9x = 25k + 1$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNext, we can rearrange the equation to isolate $x$: $x = \\frac{25k + 1}{9}$. \n\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, we need to find values of $k$ such that $\\frac{25k + 1}{9}$ is an integer. \n\nTo do this, we can start by checking different values of $k$ starting from $k = 1$ and see if the expression $\\frac{25k + 1}{9}$ results in an integer. \n\nOnce we find the values of $k$ that satisfy the condition, we can substitute back into the equation to find the corresponding values of $x$.",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by writing $x\\equiv 9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$. Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$.\n\nModulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\\cdot (9\\cdot 9^{-1}) \\equiv (11\\cdot 9)\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1}$. Thus \\begin{align*}\n11 + 9^{-1} &\\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\pmod{25},\n\\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNotice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.",
