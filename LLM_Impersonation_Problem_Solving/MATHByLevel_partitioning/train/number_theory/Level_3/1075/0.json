You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nConvert $199_{10}$ to base 2.\n",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given $199_{10}$, to convert to base 2 we need to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 199. \n\n$2^7 = 128$\n$2^8 = 256$\n\nTherefore, we can use $2^7$ in our calculation.",
