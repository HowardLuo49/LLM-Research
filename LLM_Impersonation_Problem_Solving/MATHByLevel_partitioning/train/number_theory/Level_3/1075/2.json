    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nConvert $199_{10}$ to base 2.Let $x$ be the number of zeros and $y$ be the number of ones in base 2.What is the value of $y-x?$\n$199 - 128 = 71$\n\nNow, we need to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 71.\n\n$2^6 = 64$\n$2^7 = 128$\n\nWe can use $2^6$ in our calculation.\n\n$71 - 64 = 7$\n\nTherefore, $199_{10} = 11000111_2$. \n\nTo determine the values of $x$ and $y$ (the number of zeros and ones in base 2), we count the number of zeros and ones in $11000111_2$.",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In the binary representation $11000111_2$, $x$ (number of zeros) is equal to 3 and $y$ (number of ones) is equal to 5. \n\nTherefore, $y-x = 5 - 3 = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 2?: In the binary representation $11000111_2$, $x$ (number of zeros) is equal to 3 and $y$ (number of ones) is equal to 5. \n\nTherefore, $y-x = 5 - 3 = \\boxed{2}$.",
