You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThere is a prime number which is a factor of every sum of three  consecutive integers.\n",
    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the information provided, let's first consider the sum of three consecutive integers. \nLet's denote the three consecutive integers as n, n+1, and n+2, and the sum as S.\nTherefore, S = n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3.\nThis can be simplified to S = 3(n+1).\nSince the sum S is a multiple of 3, this means that the prime number that is a factor of every such sum of three consecutive integers must be 3.\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that 3 is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers.",
