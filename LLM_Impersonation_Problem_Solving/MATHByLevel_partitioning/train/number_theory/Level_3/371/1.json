The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThere is a prime number which is a factor of every sum of three  consecutive integers.What is the number?\nGiven the information provided, let's first consider the sum of three consecutive integers. \nLet's denote the three consecutive integers as n, n+1, and n+2, and the sum as S.\nTherefore, S = n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3.\nThis can be simplified to S = 3(n+1).\nSince the sum S is a multiple of 3, this means that the prime number that is a factor of every such sum of three consecutive integers must be 3.\nTherefore, the problem is to prove that 3 is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers.",
    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "To prove that 3 is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers, we can consider the sum S = n + (n+1) + (n+2). \n\nExpanding this, we get S = 3n + 3.\n\nThis can be further simplified as S = 3(n+1).\n\nSince n is an integer, n+1 is also an integer. Therefore, (n+1) is an integer.\n\nThis implies that S is a multiple of 3, and hence 3 is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers.\n\nTherefore, the prime number that is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers is indeed 3.",
