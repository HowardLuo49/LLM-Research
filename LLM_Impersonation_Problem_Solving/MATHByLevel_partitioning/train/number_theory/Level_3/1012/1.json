The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe positive integers $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers.The sum of these four primes is\n\n$\\bullet$ A. even\n\n$\\bullet$ B. divisible by $3$\n\n$\\bullet$ C. divisible by $5$\n\n$\\bullet$ D. divisible by $7$\n\n$\\bullet$ E. prime\n\nExpress your answer using a letter, as A, B, C, D, or E.\nGiven that $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers, we know that they must all be odd primes since $2$ is the only even prime number. Let's denote $A = 2x + 1$ and $B = 2y + 1$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. \n\nNext, we can use the fact that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime numbers to derive some constraints. Since $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime, they cannot be divisible by 2. This means $A-B$ and $A+B$ must be odd primes.\n\nNow, we know that $A$ and $B$ are both odd primes, which means $A-B = (2x + 1) - (2y + 1) = 2(x - y)$ and $A+B = (2x + 1) + (2y + 1) = 2(x + y) + 2$ are both even integers. Therefore, $A-B$ and $A+B$ differ by $2$, which implies that one of them must be $2$ and the other must be a prime number. \n\nBased on the above analysis, the possible values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the given conditions are when $A = 3$ and $B = 5$, or $A = 5$ and $B = 3$.",
    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",

Substituting in the values of $A$ and $B$ for each scenario, we get:\n\nScenario 1: $A = 3$, $B = 5$\n\n$A + B + (A - B) + (A + B) = 3 + 5 + (3 - 5) + (3 + 5) = 3 + 5 - 2 + 8 = 14$\n\nScenario 2: $A = 5$, $B = 3$\n\n$A + B + (A - B) + (A + B) = 5 + 3 + (5 - 3) + (5 + 3) = 5 + 3 - 2 + 8 = 14$\n\nIn both scenarios, the sum of the four primes is $14$ which is even and divisible by $7$.
