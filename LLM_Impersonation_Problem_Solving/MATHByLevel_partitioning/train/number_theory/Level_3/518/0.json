You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the sum of $111_4+323_4+132_4$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $1_4+3_4+2_4=12_4$, we carry over the $1$. Then we have $1_4+1_4+2_4+3_4=13_4$, so we carry over another $1$. For the leftmost column, we have $1_4+1_4+3_4+1_4=12_4$. In column format, this reads $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & _{1} &_{1}&\\\\ & & & 1& 1 & 1_4\\\\ & & & 3 & 2 & 3_4\\\\& & + & 1 & 3 & 2_4\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 1 & 2 & 3& 2_4\\\\ \\end{array} $$The sum is $\\boxed{1232_4}$.",
