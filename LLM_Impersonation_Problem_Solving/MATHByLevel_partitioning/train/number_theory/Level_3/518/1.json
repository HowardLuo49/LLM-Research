The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind the sum of $111_4+323_4+132_4$.Express your answer in base $4$.\nGiven the numbers $111_4$, $323_4$, and $132_4$, we need to convert them to base 10 to find their sum. \n\n$111_4 = 1*4^2 + 1*4^1 + 1*4^0 = 16+4+1 = 21$\n\n$323_4 = 3*4^2 + 2*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 48+8+3 = 59$\n\n$132_4 = 1*4^2 + 3*4^1 + 2*4^0 = 16+12+2 = 30$\n\nNow, we can find the sum of these numbers in base 10 and provide the answer for the next person to continue solving the problem.",
    "solution": "Since $1_4+3_4+2_4=12_4$, we carry over the $1$. Then we have $1_4+1_4+2_4+3_4=13_4$, so we carry over another $1$. For the leftmost column, we have $1_4+1_4+3_4+1_4=12_4$. In column format, this reads $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & _{1} &_{1}&\\\\ & & & 1& 1 & 1_4\\\\ & & & 3 & 2 & 3_4\\\\& & + & 1 & 3 & 2_4\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 1 & 2 & 3& 2_4\\\\ \\end{array} $$The sum is $\\boxed{1232_4}$.",
