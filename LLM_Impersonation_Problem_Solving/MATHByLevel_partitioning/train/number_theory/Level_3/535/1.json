The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nConvert $115_{10}$ to base 11.Represent $10$ as $A$, if necessary.\nGiven that $115_{10} = 10 \\cdot 11^1 + 5 \\cdot 11^0$, \n\nI will convert this into base 11. \n\nLet's assume $115_{10}$ in base 11 is represented as $xy_{11}$. \n\nTherefore, $xy_{11} = 10 \\cdot 11^1 + 5 \\cdot 11^0$. \n\nSolving for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$x = \\lfloor \\frac{115}{11} \\rfloor = 10$\n\n$y = 115 \\mod 11 = 5$\n\nTherefore, $115_{10} = 10 \\cdot 11^1 + 5 \\cdot 11^0 = \\boxed{A5_{11}}$. \n\nThe next step is to verify the representation A5 in base 11 is correct and make sure both the calculations and the conversions to base 11 are accurate.",
    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $115_{10}$ to base 11, we first need to divide 115 by 11 and find the remainder. \n\n$115 \\div 11 = 10$ with a remainder of 5. \n\nSince $10$ is represented as $A$, and the remainder is $5$, we have $115_{10} = A5_{11}$. \n\nTherefore, $115_{10}$ is equal to $\\boxed{A5_{11}}$ in base 11.",
