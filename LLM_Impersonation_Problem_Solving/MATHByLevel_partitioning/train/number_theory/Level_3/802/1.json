The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThree positive integers are each greater than $1$, have a product of $ 27000 $, and are pairwise relatively prime.What is their sum?\nGiven that the three integers are pairwise relatively prime, this means that the greatest common divisor of each pair of integers is 1.\nSince the product of the three integers is 27000, we can express this as $abc=27000$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the three integers in question.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find their sum, we need to find three positive integers that are pairwise relatively prime and have a product of 27000. \n\nFirst, let's prime factorize 27000: \n\n$27000 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^3$. \n\nSince the three numbers are pairwise relatively prime, they must each divide the product without repeating any of the prime factors. One such set of numbers is $2^3, 3^3,$ and $5^3$. \n\nSo the sum of the three integers is $2^3 + 3^3 + 5^3 = 8 + 27 + 125 = 160$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the three positive integers is $\\boxed{160}$.",
