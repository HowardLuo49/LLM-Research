You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThree positive integers are each greater than $1$, have a product of $ 27000 $, and are pairwise relatively prime.\n",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the three integers are pairwise relatively prime, this means that the greatest common divisor of each pair of integers is 1.\nSince the product of the three integers is 27000, we can express this as $abc=27000$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the three integers in question.",
