The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6.What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?\nGiven:\n- \\( \\text{60 mod } k^2 = 6 \\)\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( k \\), we can use the definition of the modulo operation:\n- \\( 60 = q \\cdot k^2 + 6 \\), where \\( q \\) is another positive integer\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation for \\( k \\) to determine the possible values that satisfy the condition.",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
