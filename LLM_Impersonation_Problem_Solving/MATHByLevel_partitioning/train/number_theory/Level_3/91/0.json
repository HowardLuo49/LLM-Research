You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6.\n",
    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given:\n- \\( \\text{60 mod } k^2 = 6 \\)\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( k \\), we can use the definition of the modulo operation:\n- \\( 60 = q \\cdot k^2 + 6 \\), where \\( q \\) is another positive integer\n\nNow, we need to solve the equation for \\( k \\) to determine the possible values that satisfy the condition.",
