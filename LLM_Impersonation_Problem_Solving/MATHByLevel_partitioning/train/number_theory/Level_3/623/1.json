The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe sum of all the positive factors of integer $x$ is 24.If one of the factors is 3, what is the value of $x$?\nLet's first list out the factors of the number to see if we can find any patterns. \n\nPossible values for x:\nx = 1: factors = 1, sum = 1\nx = 2: factors = 1, 2, sum = 3\nx = 3: factors = 1, 3, sum = 4\nx = 4: factors = 1, 2, 4, sum = 7\nx = 5: factors = 1, 5, sum = 6\nx = 6: factors = 1, 2, 3, 6, sum = 12\nx = 7: factors = 1, 7, sum = 8\nx = 8: factors = 1, 2, 4, 8, sum = 15\nx = 9: factors = 1, 3, 9, sum = 13\nx = 10: factors = 1, 2, 5, 10, sum = 18\nx = 11: factors = 1, 11, sum = 12\nx = 12: factors = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, sum = 28\n\nBased on the listed values, it doesn't seem like there is a specific pattern. We may need to approach this problem differently.",
    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",

Therefore, the value of x is indeed 6.",
