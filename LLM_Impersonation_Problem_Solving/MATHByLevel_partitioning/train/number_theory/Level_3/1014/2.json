The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWe know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.$Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.$Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?\nNext, let's find the prime factorization of $500$ and $1000$ to determine the possible values for $Z$. \n\n$500 = 2^2 * 5^3 = 2^2 * 5^3$\n\n$1000 = 2^3 * 5^3 = 2^3 * 5^3$ \n\nUsing the given information, $500 < Z < 1000$, we can see that $Z$ can take any integer value between $501$ and $999$. This narrows down the possible values for $Z$.",
    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
