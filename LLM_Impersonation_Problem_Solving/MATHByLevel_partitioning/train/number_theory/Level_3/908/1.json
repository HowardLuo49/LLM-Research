The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind all 6-digit multiples of 22 of the form $5d5,\\!22e$ where $d$ and $e$ are digits.What is the maximum value of $d$?\nLet the 6-digit number be $ABCDE\\!F$, where $A=5$, $C=5$, and $F=2$. \nSince the number is a multiple of 22, we know that $2F = 44$ which implies $F = 2$.\nSo far we have $A=5$, $C=5$, and $F=2$.",
    "solution": "First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. $5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum value of $d$, we must consider the remainder when the number is divided by 22.\nThe number 5d522e can be expressed in terms of its digits as $500000 + 10000d + 5000 + 200 + 10e = 500500 + 10000d + 210 + 10e$.\nSince this number is divisible by 22, $10000d + 210 + 10e$ is divisible by 22. \nSince the last two digits $10e$ are divisible by 22, $e$ must be 1 in order to satisfy this condition.\nNow we have $10000d + 210 + 10 = 10000d + 220$ divisible by 22.\nThis means $d$ must be 2 in order for the number to be divisible by 22.\nTherefore, the maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 8?: To find the maximum value of $d$, we must consider the remainder when the number is divided by 22.\nThe number 5d522e can be expressed in terms of its digits as $500000 + 10000d + 5000 + 200 + 10e = 500500 + 10000d + 210 + 10e$.\nSince this number is divisible by 22, $10000d + 210 + 10e$ is divisible by 22. \nSince the last two digits $10e$ are divisible by 22, $e$ must be 1 in order to satisfy this condition.\nNow we have $10000d + 210 + 10 = 10000d + 220$ divisible by 22.\nThis means $d$ must be 2 in order for the number to be divisible by 22.\nTherefore, the maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
