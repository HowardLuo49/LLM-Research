The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA cat has found $432_{9}$ methods in which to extend each of her nine lives.How many methods are there in base 10?\nThe previous person has incorrectly converted the base of the number of methods the cat found from base 9 to base 10.\nTo convert $432_{9}$ to base 10, we can use the following calculation:\n$4 \\times 9^{2} + 3 \\times 9^{1} + 2 \\times 9^{0} = 4 \\times 81 + 3 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 1 = 324 + 27 + 2 = 353$\nTherefore, the cat found 353 methods in total.",
