You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ be a positive integer and $a,b$ be invertible integers modulo $n$ such that $a\\equiv b^{-1}\\pmod n$.\n",

    "gpt_response": "Given $a\\equiv b^{-1}\\pmod n$, we can rewrite this as $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod n$.\nThis implies that $ab = kn + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nWe also know that $a$ and $b$ are invertible modulo $n$, meaning $a$ and $b$ are coprime to $n$.\nThis implies that $\\gcd(a,n) = \\gcd(b,n) = 1$.",
