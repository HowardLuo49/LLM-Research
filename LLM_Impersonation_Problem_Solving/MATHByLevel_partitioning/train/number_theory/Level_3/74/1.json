The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $A$ be the product of the divisors of $42$.How many distinct prime factors does $A$ have?\nTo find the product of the divisors of 42, we first need to find all the divisors of 42.\nThe divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.\nThe product of these divisors is $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 14 \\times 21 \\times 42$.",
    "solution": "The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. They can be paired off into four pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 42:  \\begin{align*}\n\\{1&,42\\}, \\\\\n\\{2&, 21\\},\\\\\n\\{3&, 14\\}, \\text{and}\\\\\n\\{6&, 7\\}.\n\\end{align*}Thus $A=42^4=(2\\cdot3\\cdot7)^4=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4$ has $\\boxed{3}$ prime divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To simplify this expression, we can group the divisors into pairs that multiply to 42. The pairs are $(1, 42)$, $(2, 21)$, $(3, 14)$, $(6, 7)$. Each pair multiplies to 42, giving us $42^4$.\n\nSince $42=2 \\times 3 \\times 7$, the prime factorization of $A$ is $42^{4} = (2 \\times 3 \\times 7)^4 = 2^4 \\times 3^4 \\times 7^4$. \n\nTherefore, the product of the divisors of 42, $A$, has $3$ distinct prime factors: $2, 3,$ and $7$.",
