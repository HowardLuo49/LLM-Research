    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nBoth $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b > 1$.When $a^b$ is the greatest possible value less than 399, what is the sum of $a$ and $b$?\nGiven the information provided, let's assume that $b$ is a prime number, as it is greater than 1. \nNext, let's consider the equation $a^b - b^a = a + b$.",
    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$.  Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$.  Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize $a^b$ and make it as close to 399 as possible, we need to start testing values. \nTaking $b = 2$, we find that the maximum value of $a^2$ less than 399 is $a = 19$ which is $361$. \nTherefore, $a+b = 19 + 2 = 21$. \nThus, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $21$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 21?: To maximize $a^b$ and make it as close to 399 as possible, we need to start testing values. \nTaking $b = 2$, we find that the maximum value of $a^2$ less than 399 is $a = 19$ which is $361$. \nTherefore, $a+b = 19 + 2 = 21$. \nThus, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $21$.",
