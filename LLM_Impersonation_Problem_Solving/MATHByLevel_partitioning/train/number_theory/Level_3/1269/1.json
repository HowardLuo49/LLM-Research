The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nDivide the product of the first five positive composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers.Express your answer as a common fraction.\nThe first five composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10.\nCalculating the product of these integers: 4*6*8*9*10 = 17280\nNow we need to find the next five composite integers.",
    "solution": "The first ten positive composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18. The desired quotient is $\\frac{4\\cdot6\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{12\\cdot14\\cdot15\\cdot16\\cdot18}$. After cancellation, we get $\\frac{1}{14\\cdot3}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{42}}$.",
