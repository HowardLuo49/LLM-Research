You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThere is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.\n",
    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the common difference of 6, we can express the arithmetic sequence as: p, p+6, p+12, p+18, p+24 where p is a prime number. \n\nIn order for all five numbers in the sequence to be prime, it must be the case that none of the numbers are divisible by 2 or 3 (since the common difference is 6). \n\nTherefore, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 3 for p and see if the resulting sequence contains five prime numbers.",
