The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThere is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.What is the sum of those five prime numbers?\nGiven the common difference of 6, we can express the arithmetic sequence as: p, p+6, p+12, p+18, p+24 where p is a prime number. \n\nIn order for all five numbers in the sequence to be prime, it must be the case that none of the numbers are divisible by 2 or 3 (since the common difference is 6). \n\nTherefore, we can start by checking prime numbers greater than 3 for p and see if the resulting sequence contains five prime numbers.",
    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
