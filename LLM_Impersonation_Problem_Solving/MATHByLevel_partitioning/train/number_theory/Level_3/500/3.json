    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA roll of quarters contains $40$ quarters and a roll of dimes contains $50$ dimes.James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes.James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible.\nThe final answer for the total value of 6 rolls of nickels is $12.00 and the total number of coins in 6 rolls of nickels is 240 coins.",
    "solution": "We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "To begin solving this problem, we first need to calculate the total value of the quarters and dimes that James and Lindsay have in their jars separately. \n\nFor James: $83$ quarters = $83 \\times 0.25 = \\$ 20.75$ and $159$ dimes = $159 \\times 0.10 = \\$ 15.90$.\nFor Lindsay: $129$ quarters = $129 \\times 0.25 = \\$ 32.25$ and $266$ dimes = $266 \\times 0.10 = \\$ 26.60$. \n\nNext, we can calculate the total value of the nickels in 6 rolls and use that information along with the given total value and total number of coins in 6 rolls to come up with a plan for solving the overall problem.",
