    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA roll of quarters contains $40$ quarters and a roll of dimes contains $50$ dimes.James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes.\nTo determine the total value of 6 rolls of nickels, we first need to find the total value of one roll of nickels. Since a roll of nickels contains 40 nickels, the total value of one roll is $40 \\times 5 = 200$ cents, or $2.00. Multiplying the value of one roll by the number of rolls, we get $2.00 \\times 6 = 12.00. Therefore, the total value of 6 rolls of nickels is $12.00. \nNext, to find the total number of coins in 6 rolls of nickels, we calculate the number of nickels in 6 rolls by multiplying 40 nickels by 6 rolls, giving us $40 \\times 6 = 240$ nickels. Since each nickel is equivalent to one coin, there are 240 coins in 6 rolls of nickels. \nYou can now provide the final answer for the total value and number of coins in 6 rolls of nickels.",
    "solution": "We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}. $$",
