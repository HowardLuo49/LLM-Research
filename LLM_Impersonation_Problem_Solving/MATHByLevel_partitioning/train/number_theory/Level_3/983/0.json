You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $m=\\underbrace{22222222}_{\\text{8 digits}}$ and $n=\\underbrace{444444444}_{\\text{9 digits}}$.\n",
    "solution": "Note that $20m = \\underbrace{444444440}_{\\text{9 digits}}$, so $n = 20m+4$.\n\nIf $d$ is any common divisor of $m$ and $n$, then $d$ must also be a divisor of $n-20m = 4$. Therefore, $\\gcd(m,n)$ is either $1$, $2$, or $4$. We can see that $m$ is not divisible by $4$ (since its last two digits form $22$, which is not a multiple of $4$). However, both $m$ and $n$ are clearly divisible by $2$, so $\\gcd(m,n)=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The gcd(m,n) = gcd(22222222, 444444444). We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find this gcd. \n$444444444 = 20 \\times 22222222 + 2222204$\n$22222222 = 10 \\times 2222204 + 22$\n$2222204 = 101009 \\times 22 + 2$\n$22 = 11 \\times 2$ \nTherefore, gcd(22222222, 444444444) = 2.",
