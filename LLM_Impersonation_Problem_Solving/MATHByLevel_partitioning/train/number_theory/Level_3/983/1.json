The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $m=\\underbrace{22222222}_{\\text{8 digits}}$ and $n=\\underbrace{444444444}_{\\text{9 digits}}$.What is $\\gcd(m,n)$?\nThe gcd(m,n) = gcd(22222222, 444444444). We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find this gcd. \n$444444444 = 20 \\times 22222222 + 2222204$\n$22222222 = 10 \\times 2222204 + 22$\n$2222204 = 101009 \\times 22 + 2$\n$22 = 11 \\times 2$ \nTherefore, gcd(22222222, 444444444) = 2.",
    "solution": "Note that $20m = \\underbrace{444444440}_{\\text{9 digits}}$, so $n = 20m+4$.\n\nIf $d$ is any common divisor of $m$ and $n$, then $d$ must also be a divisor of $n-20m = 4$. Therefore, $\\gcd(m,n)$ is either $1$, $2$, or $4$. We can see that $m$ is not divisible by $4$ (since its last two digits form $22$, which is not a multiple of $4$). However, both $m$ and $n$ are clearly divisible by $2$, so $\\gcd(m,n)=\\boxed{2}$.",
