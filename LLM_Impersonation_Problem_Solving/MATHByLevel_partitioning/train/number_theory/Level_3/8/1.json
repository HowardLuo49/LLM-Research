The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind the modular inverse of $27$, modulo $28$.Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $27$, inclusive.\nTo find the modular inverse of $27$ modulo $28$, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\nRecall that the Extended Euclidean Algorithm provides us with integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = \\gcd(a, b)$.\nWe want to find $x$ such that $27x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}$, so we need to calculate $\\gcd(27, 28)$ using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\nFollowing the steps of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we have:\n$28 = 27(1) + 1$\n$1 = 28 - 27(1)$\nThis tells us that $\\gcd(27, 28) = 1$.",
    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $27a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 28. In other words, we want to solve  \\[\n27 a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}.\n\\]We subtract $28a$ from the left-hand side to obtain $-a\\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}$. This congruence is equivalent to the previous one since $28a$ is a multiple of 28. Next we multiply both sides by $-1$ to obtain $a\\equiv -1\\pmod{28}$. Thus $28-1=\\boxed{27}$ is the modular inverse of 27 (mod 28). (Note that since $(m-1)^2=m^2-2m+1\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, we always have that $m-1$ is its own inverse modulo $m$.)",
