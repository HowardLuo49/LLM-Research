You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the modular inverse of $27$, modulo $28$.\n",
    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $27a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 28. In other words, we want to solve  \\[\n27 a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}.\n\\]We subtract $28a$ from the left-hand side to obtain $-a\\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}$. This congruence is equivalent to the previous one since $28a$ is a multiple of 28. Next we multiply both sides by $-1$ to obtain $a\\equiv -1\\pmod{28}$. Thus $28-1=\\boxed{27}$ is the modular inverse of 27 (mod 28). (Note that since $(m-1)^2=m^2-2m+1\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, we always have that $m-1$ is its own inverse modulo $m$.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular inverse of $27$ modulo $28$, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\nRecall that the Extended Euclidean Algorithm provides us with integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = \\gcd(a, b)$.\nWe want to find $x$ such that $27x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}$, so we need to calculate $\\gcd(27, 28)$ using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\nFollowing the steps of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we have:\n$28 = 27(1) + 1$\n$1 = 28 - 27(1)$\nThis tells us that $\\gcd(27, 28) = 1$.",
