    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA box contains tiles, numbered 1, 2, 3,..., 49, 50.Only tiles which are marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ are blue.\nPrevious Work/Progress Left for You:\nLet's first calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to 50 using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \n\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\nSum = 50/2 * (1 + 50) = 25 * 51 = 1275\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the integers from 1 to 49 using the same formula.\n\nSum = 49/2 * (1 + 49) = 24.5 * 50 = 1225. \n\nTo find the missing number, we can subtract the sum of 1 to 49 from the sum of 1 to 50.\n\n1275 - 1225 = 50. \n\nTherefore, the missing number in the box is 50. \n\nPlan for the Next Person:\nNow, to solve the given number theory problem, we need to reconsider the calculations and check if there are any mistakes in the previous work. Calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to 50 and 1 to 49 again to ensure accuracy. Then, analyze the relationship between the sums to determine the missing number in the box. If there are no mistakes, we can conclude the missing number is 50.",
    "solution": "Positive integers which are congruent to $2\\pmod{5}$ belong to the set $$\\{2+5(0), 2+5(1), 2+5(2), ..., \\}.$$To find the largest element of this set which is less than or equal to 50, we look for the largest possible integer $n$ such that $$2+5(n-1) \\le 50.$$Solving this inequality, we find $n \\le 53/5$, so the maximum integer solution is $n=\\lfloor 53/5 \\rfloor = 10$. Since there are 50 total tiles, the probability that the tile is marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ is $\\dfrac{10 \\; \\text{blue tiles} }{50 \\; \\text{total tiles}} = \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{5} } .$",
