    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA box contains tiles, numbered 1, 2, 3,..., 49, 50.Only tiles which are marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ are blue.One tile is chosen randomly from the box.What is the probability that the tile is blue?\nPlan for the next person:\nFrom the given information, figure out how many blue tiles are in the box by considering which numbers are congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$, as that is how the blue tiles are defined. After finding the number of blue tiles, calculate the probability of selecting a blue tile randomly from the box. Analyze the relationship between the total number of tiles in the box and the number of blue tiles to determine the probability.",
    "solution": "Positive integers which are congruent to $2\\pmod{5}$ belong to the set $$\\{2+5(0), 2+5(1), 2+5(2), ..., \\}.$$To find the largest element of this set which is less than or equal to 50, we look for the largest possible integer $n$ such that $$2+5(n-1) \\le 50.$$Solving this inequality, we find $n \\le 53/5$, so the maximum integer solution is $n=\\lfloor 53/5 \\rfloor = 10$. Since there are 50 total tiles, the probability that the tile is marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ is $\\dfrac{10 \\; \\text{blue tiles} }{50 \\; \\text{total tiles}} = \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{5} } .$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of blue tiles, we need to determine which numbers are congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$. In other words, we are looking for numbers of the form $5k+2$, where $k$ is an integer. \n\nThe numbers in this form that are less than or equal to 50 are: 2, 7, 12, ..., 47. To find the total number of blue tiles, we need to count how many numbers in this sequence there are.\n\nWe can see that this is an arithmetic sequence with first term $a = 2$, common difference $d = 5$, and last term $50 = a + (n-1)d = 2 + (n-1)5$. Solving for $n$ gives us $n = 10$.\n\nSo, there are 10 blue tiles out of a total of 50 tiles in the box. Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a blue tile is $\\frac{10}{50} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$.",
