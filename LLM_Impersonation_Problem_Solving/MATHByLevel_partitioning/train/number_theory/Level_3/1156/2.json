    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA box contains tiles, numbered 1, 2, 3,..., 49, 50.Only tiles which are marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ are blue.One tile is chosen randomly from the box.\nRecalculate the sum of the integers from 1 to 50 using the formula for an arithmetic series: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term). \n\nSum = 50/2 * (1 + 50) = 25 * 51 = 1275\n\nNow, recalculate the sum of the integers from 1 to 49.\n\nSum = 49/2 * (1 + 49) = 24.5 * 50 = 1225\n\nSubtract the sum of 1 to 49 from the sum of 1 to 50 to find the missing number. \n\n1275 - 1225 = 50\n\nIt seems that the missing number is indeed 50, as calculated in the previous work. So the conclusion is that the missing number in the box is 50.",
    "solution": "Positive integers which are congruent to $2\\pmod{5}$ belong to the set $$\\{2+5(0), 2+5(1), 2+5(2), ..., \\}.$$To find the largest element of this set which is less than or equal to 50, we look for the largest possible integer $n$ such that $$2+5(n-1) \\le 50.$$Solving this inequality, we find $n \\le 53/5$, so the maximum integer solution is $n=\\lfloor 53/5 \\rfloor = 10$. Since there are 50 total tiles, the probability that the tile is marked with a number congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$ is $\\dfrac{10 \\; \\text{blue tiles} }{50 \\; \\text{total tiles}} = \\boxed{ \\frac{1}{5} } .$",
    "gpt_response": "Plan for the next person:\nFrom the given information, figure out how many blue tiles are in the box by considering which numbers are congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$, as that is how the blue tiles are defined. After finding the number of blue tiles, calculate the probability of selecting a blue tile randomly from the box. Analyze the relationship between the total number of tiles in the box and the number of blue tiles to determine the probability.",
