The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $f(x) = x^2 - x + 2010$.What is the greatest common divisor of $f(100)$ and $f(101)$?\nOur goal is to find integer solutions to the equation $f(x) = p$, where $p$ is a prime number.\nLet's start by setting $f(x) = p$ and then rearranging the equation to make $x$ the subject.\nTherefore, $x^2 - x + 2010 = p$ can be rewritten as $x^2 - x = p - 2010$.\nNext, complete the square on the left side of the equation to make it easier to solve for $x$.\nTo complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$ inside the brackets, so the left side becomes $\\left(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$.\nSubstitute this back into the equation to get $\\left(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = p - 2010$ for the next person to solve.",
