You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the largest base-4 number that has four digits?\n",
    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given a base-4 number system, the largest four-digit number would be in the form:\n3333\nConverting this base-4 number to base-10, we get:\n3*4^3 + 3*4^2 + 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 192 + 48 + 12 + 3 = 255\nSo, the largest base-4 number that has four digits is 255.",
