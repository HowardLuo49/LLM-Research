    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe integer $x$ has 12 positive factors.\n",
    "solution": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the number of factors of a number $n$ can be calculated using its prime factorization, we can express $x$ as $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, p_2,...,p_k$ are distinct primes and $a_1, a_2,...,a_k$ are positive integers.\nWe know that the total number of factors of $x$ is equal to $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)...(a_k+1)=12$.\nTherefore, our plan will be to find all possible combinations of integer solutions to the equation $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)...(a_k+1)=12$ given the constraints of $a_i > 0$ and primes $p_i$.",
