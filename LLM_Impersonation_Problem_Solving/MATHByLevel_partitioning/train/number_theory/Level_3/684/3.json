    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAlex is at the candy store buying jellybeans.He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans.He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people.How many jellybeans should Alex buy?\nLet's start by checking the pair (1, 56). If Alex buys 1 jellybean, he would have $11\\%13 = 11$ leftover, which means this pair doesn't work. Next, let's check the pair (2, 28). If Alex buys 2 jellybeans, he would have $22\\%13 = 9$ leftover, which also doesn't work. The pair (4, 14) results in $44\\%13 = 5$ leftover, which is not $11$. Lastly, checking the pair (7, 8), if Alex buys 7 jellybeans, he would have $77\\%13 = 12$ leftover. This doesn't satisfy the condition of $11$ leftover. \nIt seems that none of the pairs that multiply to 56 work, so perhaps there is another approach we should take.",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's reconsider the problem with a different approach. Since Alex wants to buy the least amount of jellybeans such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing them evenly among $13$ people, we can rephrase this as finding the smallest multiple of $13$ that is greater than $100$ and adding $11$ to it. The smallest multiple of $13$ that is greater than $100$ is $104$, so adding $11$ to that gives us $115$. Therefore, Alex should buy $\\boxed{115}$ jellybeans.",
