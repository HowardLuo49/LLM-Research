You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAlex is at the candy store buying jellybeans.He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans.He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people.\nNext, let's try to find all the possible pairs of numbers that multiply to 56 (the number of jellybeans) and check if any of these pairs could potentially represent the number of jellybeans Alex buys.\n\nPairs that multiply to 56: (1, 56), (2, 28), (4, 14), (7, 8)\n\nNow, let's consider each pair and see if any of them can potentially represent the number of jellybeans Alex buys.",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by checking the pair (1, 56). If Alex buys 1 jellybean, he would have $11\\%13 = 11$ leftover, which means this pair doesn't work. Next, let's check the pair (2, 28). If Alex buys 2 jellybeans, he would have $22\\%13 = 9$ leftover, which also doesn't work. The pair (4, 14) results in $44\\%13 = 5$ leftover, which is not $11$. Lastly, checking the pair (7, 8), if Alex buys 7 jellybeans, he would have $77\\%13 = 12$ leftover. This doesn't satisfy the condition of $11$ leftover. \nIt seems that none of the pairs that multiply to 56 work, so perhaps there is another approach we should take.",
