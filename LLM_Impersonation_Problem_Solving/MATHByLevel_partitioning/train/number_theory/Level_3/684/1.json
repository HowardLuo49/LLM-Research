    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAlex is at the candy store buying jellybeans.He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans.\nPlan: Let's consider the number of jellybeans Alex buys and analyze any patterns or relationships that may emerge. \n\nGiven information: Alex buys a total of 56 jellybeans. \n\nCalculation: Let's list out the factors of 56 to see if there are any interesting patterns present:\n1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56\n\nObservation: There doesn't seem to be any immediate pattern in the factors of 56. Let's see if we can gain more insights with further analysis.\n\nNext steps: Let's explore different ways to represent 56 as a sum of two numbers and see if any interesting relationships emerge.",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "Next, let's try to find all the possible pairs of numbers that multiply to 56 (the number of jellybeans) and check if any of these pairs could potentially represent the number of jellybeans Alex buys.\n\nPairs that multiply to 56: (1, 56), (2, 28), (4, 14), (7, 8)\n\nNow, let's consider each pair and see if any of them can potentially represent the number of jellybeans Alex buys.",
