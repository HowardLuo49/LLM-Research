    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe $24^\\text{th}$ day of a particular month is a Saturday.\n",
    "solution": "If the $24$th is a Saturday, the $17$th was also a Saturday, as were the $10$th and the $3$rd.  So the $2$nd was a Friday and the $1$st was a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the $24^\\text{th}$ day of the month is a Saturday, we can work backwards to find out what day of the week the $1^\\text{st}$ day of the month falls on. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can subtract multiples of 7 from 24 to determine the day of the week for the $1^\\text{st}$ day of the month. \n\n$24 \\mod 7 = 3$, so the $1^\\text{st}$ day of the month is $3$ days before Saturday, which is Wednesday. \n\nNow that we know the $1^\\text{st}$ day of the month falls on a Wednesday, we can continue to figure out the days of the week for the other days in the month. This will help us determine the day of the week for the $N^\\text{th}$ day of the month. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify the calculations.",
