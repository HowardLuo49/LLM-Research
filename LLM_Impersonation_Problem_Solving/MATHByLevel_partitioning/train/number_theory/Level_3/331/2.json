    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe seven digits in Sam's phone number and the four digits in his house number have the same sum.The four digits in his house number are distinct, and his phone number is 271-3147.What is the largest possible value of Sam's house number?\nThe sum of the seven digits in Sam's phone number is 2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25.",
    "solution": "First, we need to add up the digits in his phone number to see what the digits in his address add up to.  $2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25$.\n\nFor his address, we want to find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to $25$.  Because we want a large number, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible, so the first digit should be $9$.  The next three digits, therefore, must add up to $25-9=16$.  Since the digits must be unique, the next digit cannot be $9$, so we will go for the next largest number, $8$.  The final two digits must add up to $16-8=8$, and since neither can be $8$, the next largest possibility for those numbers is $7$ and $1$.  Therefore, Sam's address is $\\boxed{9871}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of Sam's house number, we need to distribute the sum of 25 among four distinct digits. The largest possible distinct digits that sum to 25 are 9, 8, 7, and 1. Therefore, the largest possible value of Sam's house number is 9871.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 9871?: To find the largest possible value of Sam's house number, we need to distribute the sum of 25 among four distinct digits. The largest possible distinct digits that sum to 25 are 9, 8, 7, and 1. Therefore, the largest possible value of Sam's house number is 9871.",
