    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIt is currently $3\\!:\\!00\\!:\\!00 \\text{ p.m.}$ What time will it be in $6666$ seconds?\nThe previous person left no specific math work to build on, so I will start by considering the problem statement. Let's denote the hour hand angle as $h$ and the minute hand angle as $m$.",
    "solution": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds. Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\\boxed{4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.}}$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's calculate the number of seconds in an hour, which is $60 \\times 60 = 3600$ seconds. We can then find the angle covered by the hour hand in one second by dividing $360^\\circ$ by the total number of seconds in an hour. This gives us $\\frac{360}{3600} = 0.1$ degrees per second for the hour hand. Similarly, the minute hand covers $\\frac{360}{60} = 6$ degrees per minute or $\\frac{6}{60} = 0.1$ degrees per second.",
