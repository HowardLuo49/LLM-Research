    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIt is currently $3\\!:\\!00\\!\n",
    "solution": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds. Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\\boxed{4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.}}$",
