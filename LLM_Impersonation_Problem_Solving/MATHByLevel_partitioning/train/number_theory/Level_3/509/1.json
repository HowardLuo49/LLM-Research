    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe marching band has more than 100 members but fewer than 200 members.When they line up in rows of 4 there is one extra person; when they line up in rows of 5 there are two extra people; and when they line up in rows of 7 there are three extra people.\nLet's start by considering the factors of 100 and 200. \n\nThe factors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nThe factors of 200 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200.\n\nSince the band has more than 100 members but fewer than 200 members, we can eliminate any factors of 100 from the list of factors of 200. \n\nThis leaves us with the following possible number of members for the band: 125, 150, 175.  \n\nNow, let's think about how we can determine the exact number of members in the band based on the given information.",
    "solution": "First, we look for an integer which leaves remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.  Checking the remainders of 2, 7, 12, 17, $\\ldots$ when divided by 4, we find that 17 is the least positive integer satisfying this condition.  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the only positive integers which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot 5=20$.  Checking the remainders of 17, 37, $\\ldots$ when divided by 7, we find that $17$ leaves a remainder of 3.  Again, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers which satisfy all three conditions are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot5\\cdot7=140$.  Among the integers 17, 157, 297, $\\ldots$, only $\\boxed{157}$ is between 100 and 200.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the exact number of members in the band, we can set up a system of congruences based on the conditions given. \n\nLet x be the total number of band members. \n\nWe know that x \u2261 1 (mod 4) since when they line up in rows of 4, there is one extra person. \nWe also know that x \u2261 2 (mod 5) and x \u2261 3 (mod 7). \n\nWe can now use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this system of congruences and find the possible values for x.",
