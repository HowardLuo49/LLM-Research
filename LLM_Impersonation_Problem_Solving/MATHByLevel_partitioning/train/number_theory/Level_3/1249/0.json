    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nYou are given that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n",
    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, let's first break down 1000 into its prime factors: $1000=2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. \n\nNext, we know that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, so $3^{400}=1+k\\cdot1000$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNow, we can consider the powers of $3$ modulo $2^3$ and $5^3$ individually to further analyze the relationship between $3^{400}$ and 1 modulo 1000.",
