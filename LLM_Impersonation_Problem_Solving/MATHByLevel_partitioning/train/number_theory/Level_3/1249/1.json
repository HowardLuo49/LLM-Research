The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nYou are given that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.What are the last three digits of $3^{12000}$?\nGiven $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, let's first break down 1000 into its prime factors: $1000=2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. \n\nNext, we know that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, so $3^{400}=1+k\\cdot1000$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNow, we can consider the powers of $3$ modulo $2^3$ and $5^3$ individually to further analyze the relationship between $3^{400}$ and 1 modulo 1000.",
    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can rewrite $3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}$. Since we know that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we have $3^{12000}\\equiv 1^{30}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 001?: We can rewrite $3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}$. Since we know that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we have $3^{12000}\\equiv 1^{30}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are $\\boxed{001}$.",
