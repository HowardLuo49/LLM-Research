    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is $2343_6+15325_6$?\n",
    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The first step is to convert both numbers to base 10 in order to perform the addition. \n\n$2343_6 = 2*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0 = 432 + 108 + 24 + 3 = 567$\n\n$15325_6 = 1*6^4 + 5*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 2*6^1 + 5*6^0 = 1296 + 810 + 108 + 12 + 5 = 2231$\n\nNext, add the two converted numbers together to get the final result.",
