The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is $2343_6+15325_6$?Express your answer in base $6$.\nThe first step is to convert both numbers to base 10 in order to perform the addition. \n\n$2343_6 = 2*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0 = 432 + 108 + 24 + 3 = 567$\n\n$15325_6 = 1*6^4 + 5*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 2*6^1 + 5*6^0 = 1296 + 810 + 108 + 12 + 5 = 2231$\n\nNext, add the two converted numbers together to get the final result.",
    "solution": "Adding the first digits, we get $8$, hence $2$ after carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $1$, again with carrying. Adding the next two digits plus one, we get $2$, with carrying. Finally, adding $1$ to one, we get $2$. Thus our final answer is $\\boxed{22112_6}$.",
