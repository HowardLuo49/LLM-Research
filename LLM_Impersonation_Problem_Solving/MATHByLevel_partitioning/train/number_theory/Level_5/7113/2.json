    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be a subset of $\\{1,2,3,...,50\\}$ such that no pair of distinct elements in $S$ has a sum divisible by $7$.What is the maximum number of elements in $S$?$\\text{(A) } 6\\quad \\text{(B) } 7\\quad \\text{(C) } 14\\quad \\text{(D) } 22\\quad \\text{(E) } 23$\nLet's focus on one half of this process: from 1 to 7. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and since 7 is the sum that starts the second half, we won't encounter it in the pairs to avoid in the first half calculation. The pairs in the first half that we need to avoid are (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4). Let's think about how to strategically select numbers from 1 to 7 based on this information. Additionally, consider how the rest of the numbers up to 50 play into this strategy.",
    "solution": "The fact that $x \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\Rightarrow 7 \\mid x$ is assumed as common knowledge in this answer.\nFirst, note that there are $8$ possible numbers that are equivalent to $1 \\mod 7$, and there are $7$ possible numbers equivalent to each of $2$-$6 \\mod 7$.\nSecond, note that there can be no pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \\equiv -b$ mod $7$, because then $a+b | 7$. These pairs are $(0,0)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,4)$. Because $(0,0)$ is a pair, there can always be $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, and no more.\nTo maximize the amount of numbers in S, we will use $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, $8$ numbers equivalent to $1$, and $14$ numbers equivalent to $2$-$5$. This is obvious if you think for a moment. Therefore the answer is $1+8+14=\\boxed{23}$ numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the number of elements in $S$, we should select numbers from 1 to 7 in such a way that we avoid pairs with sums divisible by 7. Pairs to avoid are (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4). This means we can only select one number from each of these pairs. From 1 to 7, we can select at most 4 numbers (1, 2, 4, 7) which avoids all the problematic pairs. \n\nNow, moving on to the rest of the numbers from 8 to 50. We no longer need to worry about pairs with numbers from 1 to 7. We can continue selecting numbers in a way that avoids pairs with sums divisible by 7. This means for each number $n$ from 1 to 50, we cannot include the number such that $7 | n+k$ where $k$ is a number we have already selected. \n\nContinuing this process, we find that the maximum number of elements we can have in $S$ is 7, which corresponds to our choice of numbers from 1 to 7. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
