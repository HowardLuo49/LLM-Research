You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the sum of all positive integers such that their expression in base $7$ digits is the reverse of their expression in base $16$ digits.\n",
    "solution": "Let the given base $7$ number be $n$. Suppose that $n$ has $d+1$ digits in either base $7$ or base $16$. Let $a_d$ be the leftmost digit of $n$ in its base $7$ expression, $a_{d-1}$ be the digit that is second from the left, and so forth, so that $a_0$ is the base $7$ units digit of $n$. It follows that $a_d$ is the base $16$ units digit of $n$, and so forth. Converting to base $10$, it follows that $$n = 7^d \\cdot a_d + 7^{d-1} \\cdot a_{d-1} + \\cdots + a_0 = 16^d \\cdot a_0 + 16^{d-1} \\cdot a_1 + \\cdots + a_d.$$Combining the like terms, it follows that $$(16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d = 0.$$For $d \\le 3$, we observe that the powers of $16$ are significantly larger than the powers of $7$. More precisely, since $a_i \\le 6$ for each $i$, then we have the following loose bound from the geometric series formula\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= (16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d \\\\\n&\\ge (16^d - 1) + (1 - 7) \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + (1-7^d) \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= 16^d + d - 6 \\cdot \\frac{7^{d+1} - 1}{7 - 1} \\\\\n&\\ge 16^d - 7^{d+1} \\\\\n\\end{align*}For $d = 3$, then $16^3 = 4096 > 7^4 = 2401$, and by induction, $16^d > 7^{d+1}$ for all $d \\ge 3$. Thus, $d \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. If $d = 0$, then all values will work, namely $n = 1,2,3,4,5,6$. If $d = 1$, then $$(16 - 1)a_0 + (1-7)a_1 = 15a_0 - 6a_1 = 3(5a_0 - 2a_1) = 0.$$Thus, $5a_0 = 2a_1$, so $5$ divides into $a_1$. As $a_1 \\le 6$, then $a_1 = 0,5$, but the former yields that $n = 0$. Thus, we discard it, giving us the number $n = 52_7 = 5 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 37$. For $d=2$, we obtain that $$(256 - 1)a_0 + (16 - 7)a_1 + (1 - 49)a_2 = 3(51a_0 + 3a_1 - 16a_2) = 0.$$Since $16a_2 \\le 6 \\cdot 16 = 96$, then $a_0 = 1$. Then, $51 + 3a_1 = 3(17 + a_1) = 16a_2$, so it follows that $a_2$ is divisible by $3$. Thus, $a_2 = 0,3,6$, but only $a_2 = 6$ is large enough. This yields that $a_1 = 15$, which is not possible in base $7$. Thus, the sum of the numbers satisfying the problem statement is equal to $1+2+3+4+5+6+37 = \\boxed{58}.$",
