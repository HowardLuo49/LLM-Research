    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEvery 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator.He changed them the first time in May.\nPrevious work done:\nHal started using his calculator 7 years ago, and he has replaced the batteries 16 times since then.\n\nProgress/Work:\n1. Let's first calculate how many months Hal has been using his calculator: 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months.\n2. Hal replaced the batteries 16 times, which means he replaced the batteries every 5 months for a total of 16 * 5 = 80 months.\n3. The remaining time Hal has used the calculator without replacing the batteries is 84 months - 80 months = 4 months.\n4. Since Hal replaces the batteries every 5 months, we need to find out how many additional months Hal needs to use the calculator before replacing the batteries again. \nPlan for the next person:\nCalculate how many months Hal needs to use the calculator before replacing the batteries again.",
    "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate how many additional months Hal needs to use the calculator before replacing the batteries again, we know that he replaces the batteries every 5 months and has currently used the calculator for 4 months without replacing the batteries. \nTherefore, he needs to use the calculator for an additional 5 - 4 = 1 month before replacing the batteries again.",
