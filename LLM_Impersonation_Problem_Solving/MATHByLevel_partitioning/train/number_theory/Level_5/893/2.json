    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nEvery 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator.He changed them the first time in May.In what month will they be changed the 25th time?\nTo calculate how many additional months Hal needs to use the calculator before replacing the batteries again, we know that he replaces the batteries every 5 months and has currently used the calculator for 4 months without replacing the batteries. \nTherefore, he needs to use the calculator for an additional 5 - 4 = 1 month before replacing the batteries again.",
    "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.",
