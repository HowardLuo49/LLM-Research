    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTo transmit a positive integer less than 1000, the Networked Number Node offers two options.Option 1.Pay $\\$$d to send each digit d. Therefore, 987 would cost $\\$$9 + $\\$$8 + $\\$$7 = $\\$$24 to transmit.Option 2.Encode integer into binary (base 2) first, and then pay $\\$$d to send each digit d. Therefore, 987 becomes 1111011011 and would cost $\\$$1 + $\\$$1 + $\\$$1 + $\\$$1 + $\\$$0 + $\\$$1 + $\\$$1 + $\\$$0 + $\\$$1 + $\\$$1 = $\\$$8.What is the largest integer less than 1000 that costs the same whether using Option 1 or Option 2?\nLet's calculate the cost to transmit each digit from 0 to 9 using both options:\n- For Option 1: The cost to transmit each digit is equal to the digit itself.\n- For Option 2: First, let's convert each digit to binary:\n0 -> 0\n1 -> 1\n2 -> 10\n3 -> 11\n4 -> 100\n5 -> 101\n6 -> 110\n7 -> 111\n8 -> 1000\n9 -> 1001\n\nNext, calculate the cost for each digit in binary representation.",
    "solution": "First, we need to find the largest possible value when sending a number with Option 2.  If we had 10 1s the smallest binary number would be: $$1111111111_2=1023$$ This is greater than 1000, so the greatest possible cost when sending with option 2 will be 9.  We can look at the largest numbers less than 1000 which cost 9 with Option 1 and see if they cost 9 with option 2.  The largest numbers are: $$900,810,801,720,711,702,...$$ The smallest possible number with 10 digits and cost 9 in Option 2 is: $$1011111111_2=767$$ Below this, we would have: $$111111111_2=511$$ which doesn't work.  We can quickly check the numbers above and see that they cost less than 9 with method 2.  So, we now need to consider numbers with cost of 8.  The largest numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 1 are: $$800,710,701,620,611,602,530,521,512,503,...$$ It is possible to check these in base 2 and see which is the first to cost 8 with Option 2, or we can go the other way and look at numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 2.  Either way, we will find the largest possible integer with a cost of 8 is: $$111110111_2 = 503$$ We must check and make sure that there are no numbers larger than $503$ with an Option 2 cost lower than 8. The numbers with cost 7 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $700$, $610$, $601$, and $520$. We can check that all cost less than 7 in Option 2 and can be eliminated. The numbers with cost 6 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $600$ and $510$, neither of which have cost 6 in Option 2 and therefore do not work. Since a number with cost 5 or lower must be less than 500, the largest possible integer is $\\boxed{503}$.",
