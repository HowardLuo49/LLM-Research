    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ represent the smallest integer that satisfies the following conditions:\n$\\frac n2$ is a perfect square.$\\frac n3$ is a perfect cube.$\\frac n5$ is a perfect fifth.\nWe need to check if $n=2$ indeed satisfies the condition that $\\frac n3$ is a perfect cube. \nSince $n = 2$, $\\frac{n}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$ is not an integer, and hence not a perfect cube.\nTherefore, $n=2$ does not satisfy the given conditions. \n\nGiven this, we should increment $k$ and continue the process of checking for the smallest $n$ that satisfies both conditions. \nLet's move on to $k=2$ and repeat the process to find the next potential value of $n$.",
    "solution": "The first condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be an even power (excluding $2$, which must be an odd power). The second condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $3$ (excluding $3$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $3$). The third condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $5$ (excluding $5$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $5$).\nClearly, to minimize $n$, we want to just use the prime factors $2,3,5$. The power of $2$ must be divisible by $3,5$, and $2^{15}$ works. Similarly, the powers of $3$ and $5$ must be $10$ and $6$, respectively, both of which leave a residue of $1$ upon division. Thus, we need the number of factors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ which are not multiples of $10$.\nApplying the complement principle, there are a total of $(15+1)(10+1)(6+1) = 1232$ factors. We can draw a bijection between the number of divisors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ that are divisible by $10$ and the number of divisors of $2^{14} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{5}$ (as each of these divisors, when multiplied by 10, will provide a factor of the original number that is divisible by 10). There are $(14+1)(10+1)(5+1) = 990$. The answer is $1232-990 = \\boxed{242}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Using $k=2$, we have $n=2^2 = 4$. \nChecking $\\frac{4}{3}$, we see that it is not a perfect cube as it's not an integer.\nTherefore, $n=4$ does not satisfy the given conditions. \nNext, we can proceed to increase $k$ further and continue this process of checking for the smallest $n$.",
