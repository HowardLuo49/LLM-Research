    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ represent the smallest integer that satisfies the following conditions:\n$\\frac n2$ is a perfect square.$\\frac n3$ is a perfect cube.$\\frac n5$ is a perfect fifth.How many divisors does $n$ have that are not multiples of 10?\nUsing $k=2$, we have $n=2^2 = 4$. \nChecking $\\frac{4}{3}$, we see that it is not a perfect cube as it's not an integer.\nTherefore, $n=4$ does not satisfy the given conditions. \nNext, we can proceed to increase $k$ further and continue this process of checking for the smallest $n$.",
    "solution": "The first condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be an even power (excluding $2$, which must be an odd power). The second condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $3$ (excluding $3$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $3$). The third condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $5$ (excluding $5$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $5$).\nClearly, to minimize $n$, we want to just use the prime factors $2,3,5$. The power of $2$ must be divisible by $3,5$, and $2^{15}$ works. Similarly, the powers of $3$ and $5$ must be $10$ and $6$, respectively, both of which leave a residue of $1$ upon division. Thus, we need the number of factors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ which are not multiples of $10$.\nApplying the complement principle, there are a total of $(15+1)(10+1)(6+1) = 1232$ factors. We can draw a bijection between the number of divisors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ that are divisible by $10$ and the number of divisors of $2^{14} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{5}$ (as each of these divisors, when multiplied by 10, will provide a factor of the original number that is divisible by 10). There are $(14+1)(10+1)(5+1) = 990$. The answer is $1232-990 = \\boxed{242}$.",
