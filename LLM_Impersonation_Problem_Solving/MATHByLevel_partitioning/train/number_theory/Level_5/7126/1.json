The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S = \\{5^k | k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 0 \\le k \\le 2004 \\}$.Given that $5^{2004} = 5443 \\cdots 0625$ has $1401$ digits, how many elements of $S$ begin with the digit $1$?\nPrevious progress: Calculated the first few elements of the set $S$ by substituting different values of $k$ into the expression $5^k$.\n\nPlan for the next person: \n1. Continue calculating more elements of the set $S$ by substituting values of $k$ from 5 to 2004 into the expression $5^k$.\n2. Look for any patterns or relationships between the elements in the set $S$ that may help in understanding the structure of the set.\n3. Consider the properties of powers of 5 and how they may be related to the elements in the set $S$.\n4. Explore the divisibility properties of the elements in the set $S$ and see if there are any interesting observations to be made.",
    "solution": "Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$. Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\cdots 5^{2003}\\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \\boxed{604}$.",
