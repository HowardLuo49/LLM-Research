You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the least positive four-digit solution to the following system of congruences.\n",
    "solution": "Divide the first congruence by 7, remembering to divide 14 by $\\text{gcf}(7,14)=7$ as well. We find that the first congruence is equivalent to $x \\equiv 1\\pmod{2}$. Subtracting 13 from both sides and multiplying both sides by 5 (which is the modular inverse of 2, modulo 9) gives $x\\equiv 6\\pmod{9}$ for the second congruence. Finally, adding $2x$ to both sides in the third congruence and multiplying by 17 (which is the modular inverse of 3, modulo 25) gives $x\\equiv 17\\pmod{25}$. So we want to solve  \\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}Let's first find a simultaneous solution for the second and third congruences.  We begin checking numbers which are 17 more than a multiple of 25, and we quickly find that 42 is congruent to 17 (mod 25) and 6 (mod 9). Since 42 does not satisfy the first congruence we look to the next solution $42+\\text{lcm}(25,9)=267$. Now we have found a solution for the system, so we can appeal to the Chinese Remainder Theorem to conclude that the general solution of the system is $x\\equiv 267 \\pmod{450}$, where 450 is obtained by taking the least common multiple of 2, 9, and 25. So the least four-digit solution is $267 + 450 (2) = \\boxed{1167}$.",
