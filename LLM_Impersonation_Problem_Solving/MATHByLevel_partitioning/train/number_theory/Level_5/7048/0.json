You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe product $N$ of three positive integers is $6$ times their sum, and one of the integers is the sum of the other two.\n",
    "solution": "Let the three integers be $a, b, c$. $N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$. Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\\{a, b\\}$ is one of $\\{1, 12\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\\cdot 13 = 156, 12\\cdot 8 = 96, 12\\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \\boxed{336}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the information provided, we can set up the following equations based on the problem statement: Let the three positive integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c$ being the integer that is the sum of the other two.\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n$abc = 6(a + b + c)$\n$c = a + b$\n\nSubstitute $c = a + b$ into the first equation:\n$ab(a+b) = 6(2a + b)$\n$ab(a+b) = 12a + 6b$\n\nThis is where I currently am in the problem solving process.",
