The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe product $N$ of three positive integers is $6$ times their sum, and one of the integers is the sum of the other two.Find the sum of all possible values of $N$.\nGiven the information provided, we can set up the following equations based on the problem statement: Let the three positive integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c$ being the integer that is the sum of the other two.\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n$abc = 6(a + b + c)$\n$c = a + b$\n\nSubstitute $c = a + b$ into the first equation:\n$ab(a+b) = 6(2a + b)$\n$ab(a+b) = 12a + 6b$\n\nThis is where I currently am in the problem solving process.",
    "solution": "Let the three integers be $a, b, c$. $N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$. Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\\{a, b\\}$ is one of $\\{1, 12\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\\cdot 13 = 156, 12\\cdot 8 = 96, 12\\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \\boxed{336}$.",
