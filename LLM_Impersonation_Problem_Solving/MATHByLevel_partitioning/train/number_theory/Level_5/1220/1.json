    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $a_n$ be the integer obtained by writing all the integers from $1$ to $n$ from left to right.For example, $a_3 = 123$ and $a_{11} = 1234567891011$.\nPrevious work left for you:\nFind $a_{2022} \\mod 11$.\n\nWork done so far: \nTo find $a_{2022} \\mod 11$, we need to find the sum of all integers from $1$ to $2022$ and then find the remainder when divided by $11$. This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. In this case, $n = 2022$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 2022$. \n\nYour next steps:\n1. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of all integers from $1$ to $2022$.\n2. Find the remainder when the sum is divided by $11$ to determine $a_{2022} \\mod 11$.",
    "solution": "We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows: We will compute the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$. The remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 will be the residue (mod 45) which leaves the same remainders when divided by 5 and 9 as $a_{44}$ does. Since $a_{44}$ ends in $4$, it gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.\n\nFor the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 9, note that  \\begin{align*}\na_{44}&=44+43\\cdot 10^2 + 42 \\cdot 10^4+41\\cdot 10^6+\\cdots+10\\cdot10^{68}\\\\\n&\\qquad+9\\cdot 10^{70}+8\\cdot 10^{71}+\\cdots + 1\\cdot 10^{78} \\\\ &\\equiv 44+43+42+\\cdots+1\\pmod{9},\n\\end{align*}since $10^n\\equiv 1^n\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. In words, this calculation shows that we can sum groups of digits in any way we choose to check for divisibility by 9. For example, 1233 is divisible by 9 since $12+33=45$ is divisible by 9. This is a generalization of the rule that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Getting back to the problem at hand, we sum $44+43+\\cdots+1$ using the formula $1+2+\\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$ to find that $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.\n\nWe are looking for a multiple of $9$ that gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$. Nine satisfies this condition, so the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 is $\\boxed{9}$.",
