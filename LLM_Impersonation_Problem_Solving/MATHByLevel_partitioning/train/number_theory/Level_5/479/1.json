The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe infinite sequence $S=\\{s_1,s_2,s_3,\\ldots\\}$ is defined by $s_1=7$ and $s_n=7^{s_{n-1}}$ for each integer $n>1$.What is the remainder when $s_{100}$ is divided by $5$?\nThe first few terms of the sequence are $7, 7^7, 7^{7^7}, 7^{7^{7^7}}, \\ldots$. We can see that the terms grow rapidly. \n\nTo find a pattern or make any progress in understanding the numbers in this sequence, it may be necessary to explore the patterns of powers of 7. \n\nWe need to compute the next few terms of the sequence and see if we can identify any patterns or relationships between the terms.\n\nLet's compute $s_2, s_3,$ and $s_4$ to see if we can find a pattern or relationship between the terms of the sequence.",
    "solution": "Another way of writing the sequence $S$ is $\\{7,7^7,7^{7^7},7^{7^{7^7}},\\ldots\\}$. We wish to determine the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of this sequence modulo $5$.\n\nNote that $s_{100} = 7^{s_{99}}\\equiv 2^{s_{99}}\\pmod 5$. In order to determine the remainder of $2^{s_{99}}$ when divided by $5$, we look for a pattern in the powers of $2$ modulo $5$. Computing a few powers of $2$ yields \\[\\{2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\}\\equiv \\{1,2,4,3,1,\\ldots\\}\\pmod 5.\\]So we have a cyclic pattern $1,2,4,3$ of length $4$ (this is called a period). Now we need to determine where $2^{s_{99}}$ falls in the cycle; to do that, we must determine the residue of $s_{99}\\pmod 4$, since the cycle has length $4$.\n\nNote that \\begin{align*}\n7&\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^7&\\equiv (-1)^7 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^{7^7}&\\equiv (-1)^{7^7}\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}Continuing in this manner, we always have $s_n \\equiv 3\\pmod 4$. Thus, $s_{100} = 2^{s_{99}} \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv \\boxed{3}\\pmod 5$.",
