You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind $1_6 + 2_6 + 3_6 + \\cdots + 45_6$.\n",
    "solution": "By the arithmetic series formula, it follows that $$1_6 + 2_6 + 3_6 + \\cdots + 45_6 = \\frac{45_6 \\times 50_6}{2}$$(notice that this formula remains the same as the base $10$ formula, as the derivation remains the same). We can ignore the $0$ for now, and evaluate the product $45_6 \\times 5_6$ (and append a $0$ at the end). Evaluating the units digit, we need to multiply $5_6 \\times 5_6 = 25_{10} = 41_{6}$. Thus, the next digit is a $1$ and $4$ is carried over. The next digits are given by $4_6 \\times 5_6 + 4_6 = 24_{10} = 40_6$. Writing this out:  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & & \\stackrel{4}{4} & \\stackrel{}{5}_6 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & 5 & 0_6 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & 4 & 0 & 1 & 0_6 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$Now, we divide by $2$ to obtain that the answer is $\\boxed{2003}_6$. $$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{2} & 0 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n2 & 4 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{4} & \\downarrow & \\downarrow & \\\\ \\cline{2-2}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & 0 & 1 & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 0 & \\downarrow \\\\ \\cline{4-4}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\cline{4-5}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$We divide as we do normally; notice that $10_6 \\div 2_6 = 3_6$.",
