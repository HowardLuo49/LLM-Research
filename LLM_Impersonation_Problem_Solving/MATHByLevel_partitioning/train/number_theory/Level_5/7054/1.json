    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThree clever monkeys divide a pile of bananas.The first monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two.\nGiven that there are 104 bananas in the pile, and the first monkey takes half of the bananas plus half a banana, we can calculate that the first monkey took 52.5 bananas.\n[(104 / 2) + 0.5 = 52.5 bananas]\n\nThe second monkey takes half of the remaining bananas plus half a banana, leaving 25.75 bananas.\n[(104 - 52.5) / 2 + 0.5 = 25.75 bananas]\n\nUpon further inspection, it seems that there was a miscalculation in the amount of bananas the second monkey took. Let's correct that calculation by dividing the remaining bananas (51.5) by 2 and adding half a banana. \n[(104 - 52.5) / 2 + 0.5 = 25.25 bananas]\n\nNow let's calculate how many bananas the third monkey took by subtracting the previous two amounts from the total number of bananas, which is 104. \n[104 - 52.5 - 25.25 = 26.25 bananas]\n\nAt this point, we have figured out how many bananas each monkey took. Now, we need to come up with a plan to determine whether the number of bananas each monkey took is indeed valid.",
    "solution": "Denote the number of bananas the first monkey took from the pile as $b_1$, the second $b_2$, and the third $b_3$; the total is $b_1 + b_2 + b_3$. Thus, the first monkey got $\\frac{3}{4}b_1 + \\frac{3}{8}b_2 + \\frac{11}{24}b_3$, the second monkey got $\\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \\frac{1}{4}b_2 + \\frac{11}{24}b_3$, and the third monkey got $\\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \\frac{3}{8}b_2 + \\frac{1}{12}b_3$.\nTaking into account the ratio aspect, say that the third monkey took $x$ bananas in total. Then,\n$x = \\frac{1}{4}b_1 + \\frac{1}{8}b_2 + \\frac{11}{72}b_3 = \\frac{1}{16}b_1 + \\frac{1}{8}b_2 + \\frac{11}{48}b_3 = \\frac{1}{8}b_1 + \\frac{3}{8}b_2 + \\frac{1}{12}b_3$\nSolve this to find that $\\frac{b_1}{11} = \\frac{b_2}{13} = \\frac{b_3}{27}$. All three fractions must be integral. Also note some other conditions we have picked up in the course of the problem, namely that $b_1$ is divisible by $8$, $b_2$ is divisible by $8$, and $b_3$ is divisible by $72$ (however, since the denominator contains a $27$, the factors of $3$ cancel, and it only really needs to be divisible by $8$). Thus, the minimal value is when each fraction is equal to $8$, and the solution is $8(11 + 13 + 27) = \\boxed{408}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if the number of bananas each monkey took is valid, we can add up the bananas each monkey took and check against the total number of bananas in the pile, 104. \n- First Monkey: 52.5 bananas\n- Second Monkey: 25.25 bananas\n- Third Monkey: 26.25 bananas\n\nAdding these values together should equal 104 bananas. If the sum is indeed 104 bananas, then the distribution of bananas among the monkeys is valid. Proceed with this step to verify the distribution of bananas.",
