    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nIn a rectangular array of points, with 5 rows and $N$ columns, the points are numbered consecutively from left to right beginning with the top row.Thus the top row is numbered 1 through $N,$ the second row is numbered $N + 1$ through $2N,$ and so forth.Five points, $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4,$ and $P_5,$ are selected so that each $P_i$ is in row $i.$ Let $x_i$ be the number associated with $P_i.$ Now renumber the array consecutively from top to bottom, beginning with the first column.Let $y_i$ be the number associated with $P_i$ after the renumbering.It is found that $x_1 = y_2,$ $x_2 = y_1,$ $x_3 = y_4,$ $x_4 = y_5,$ and $x_5 = y_3.$ Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\nTo find the sum of all the numbers in the array after renumbering, we sum $20N + 5i$ over all $i$ from 1 to 5. This gives \\[20N + 5(1) + 20N + 5(2) + \\cdots + 20N + 5(5) = 20N \\cdot 5 + 5(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 5).\\]  \nNext, we can plug in the sum of the first $k$ positive integers, which is given by $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.",
    "solution": "Let each point $P_i$ be in column $c_i$. The numberings for $P_i$ can now be defined as follows.\\begin{align*}x_i &= (i - 1)N + c_i\\\\ y_i &= (c_i - 1)5 + i \\end{align*}\nWe can now convert the five given equalities.\\begin{align}x_1&=y_2 & \\Longrightarrow & & c_1 &= 5 c_2-3\\\\ x_2&=y_1 & \\Longrightarrow & & N+c_2 &= 5 c_1-4\\\\ x_3&=y_4 & \\Longrightarrow & & 2 N+c_3 &= 5 c_4-1\\\\ x_4&=y_5 & \\Longrightarrow & & 3 N+c_4 &= 5 c_5\\\\ x_5&=y_3 & \\Longrightarrow & & 4 N+c_5 &= 5 c_3-2 \\end{align}Equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ combine to form\\[N = 24c_2 - 19\\]Similarly equations $(3)$, $(4)$, and $(5)$ combine to form\\[117N +51 = 124c_3\\]Take this equation modulo 31\\[24N+20\\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}\\]And substitute for N\\[24 \\cdot 24 c_2 - 24 \\cdot 19 +20\\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}\\]\\[18 c_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}\\]\nThus the smallest $c_2$ might be is $7$ and by substitution $N = 24 \\cdot 7 - 19 = 149$\nThe column values can also easily be found by substitution\\begin{align*}c_1&=32\\\\ c_2&=7\\\\ c_3&=141\\\\ c_4&=88\\\\ c_5&=107 \\end{align*}As these are all positive and less than $N$, $\\boxed{149}$ is the solution.",
