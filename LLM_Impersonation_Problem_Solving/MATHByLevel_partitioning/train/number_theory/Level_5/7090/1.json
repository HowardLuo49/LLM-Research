    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $a_{10} = 10$, and for each positive integer $n >10$ let $a_n = 100a_{n - 1} + n$.Find the least positive $n > 10$ such that $a_n$ is a multiple of $99$.\nGiven $a_{10} = 10$, we can calculate $a_{11}$ as $100 \\times 10 + 11 = 1011$. \n\nNext, we can find $a_{12}$ by using the formula $a_{12} = 100 \\times a_{11} + 12$. \n\nWe continue this process to find $a_{n}$ for a given positive integer $n$. \n\nIt appears that finding a closed-form expression for $a_n$ may be challenging, so the next steps could involve looking for patterns in the numbers or simplifying the expression in some way. \n\nAlternatively, we could try to establish a recursive formula for $a_n$ to make calculations easier.",
    "solution": "Writing out the recursive statement for $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_{10}$ and summing them gives\\[a_n+\\dots+a_{10}=100(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+n+\\dots+10\\]Which simplifies to\\[a_n=99(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)\\]Therefore, $a_n$ is divisible by 99 if and only if $\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)$ is divisible by 99, so $(n+10)(n-9)$ needs to be divisible by 9 and 11. Assume that $n+10$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=12, 23, 34, 45$, we see that $n=45$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. Next, assume that $n-9$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=20, 31, 42, 53$, we see that $n=53$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. The smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\nNote that we can also construct the solution using CRT by assuming either $11$ divides $n+10$ and $9$ divides $n-9$, or $9$ divides $n+10$ and $11$ divides $n-9$, and taking the smaller solution.",
