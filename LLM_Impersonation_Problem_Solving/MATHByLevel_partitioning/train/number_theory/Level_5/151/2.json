    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIn any month with five Mondays, a school declares the fifth Monday a Marvelous Monday.School begins on Monday, September 4.What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts?\nTo find out how many times the first day of the month falls on a Monday in a year, we can use modular arithmetic. Since September 4 is a Monday, we know that the next month that starts with a Monday is December.\n\nLet's calculate how many days are between September 4 and December 1, and then find the remainder when dividing by 7 to see if December 1 is a Monday. \n\nSeptember has 30 days, October has 31 days, and November has 30 days, totaling 91 days. \n\nWhen we divide 91 by 7, we get a remainder of 0. \n\nSo, December 1 is indeed a Monday, and December is one of the months with five Mondays. \n\nNow, we need to figure out if there are any other months in the year that start with a Monday.",
    "solution": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if there are any other months in the year that start with a Monday, we can calculate the number of days between December 1 and January 1 of the next year. December has 31 days, so we can calculate the remainder when dividing by 7 to see if January 1 is a Monday. \n\nFrom December 1 to January 1, there are 31 days in December. \n\nDividing 31 by 7, we get a remainder of 3. \n\nTherefore, January 1 of the next year is a Wednesday, not a Monday. \n\nSince December is the only month that starts with a Monday, we know that the first Marvelous Monday after school starts is the fifth Monday of December. \n\nThe Marvelous Monday after school starts is December 31.",
