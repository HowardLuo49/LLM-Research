    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nIn any month with five Mondays, a school declares the fifth Monday a Marvelous Monday.School begins on Monday, September 4.What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts?(If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)\nTo determine if there are any other months in the year that start with a Monday, we can calculate the number of days between December 1 and January 1 of the next year. December has 31 days, so we can calculate the remainder when dividing by 7 to see if January 1 is a Monday. \n\nFrom December 1 to January 1, there are 31 days in December. \n\nDividing 31 by 7, we get a remainder of 3. \n\nTherefore, January 1 of the next year is a Wednesday, not a Monday. \n\nSince December is the only month that starts with a Monday, we know that the first Marvelous Monday after school starts is the fifth Monday of December. \n\nThe Marvelous Monday after school starts is December 31.",
    "solution": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The given information and work done so far are correct. \n\nTherefore, the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts is December 31.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response \\text{October 30?: The given information and work done so far are correct. \n\nTherefore, the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts is December 31.",
