    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIn any month with five Mondays, a school declares the fifth Monday a Marvelous Monday.School begins on Monday, September 4.\nGiven that there are 7 days in a week, the fifth Monday will occur on day 35 of the month.\n\nTo find out how many months have five Mondays in a year, we need to figure out the pattern of when the fifth Monday occurs.\n\nLet's start by considering the months with 31 days, as they are more likely to have five Mondays.\n\nWe know that for a month to have five Mondays, the first day of the month must be a Monday.\n\nTherefore, we need to find out how many times the first day of the month falls on a Monday in a year.",
    "solution": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many times the first day of the month falls on a Monday in a year, we can use modular arithmetic. Since September 4 is a Monday, we know that the next month that starts with a Monday is December.\n\nLet's calculate how many days are between September 4 and December 1, and then find the remainder when dividing by 7 to see if December 1 is a Monday. \n\nSeptember has 30 days, October has 31 days, and November has 30 days, totaling 91 days. \n\nWhen we divide 91 by 7, we get a remainder of 0. \n\nSo, December 1 is indeed a Monday, and December is one of the months with five Mondays. \n\nNow, we need to figure out if there are any other months in the year that start with a Monday.",
