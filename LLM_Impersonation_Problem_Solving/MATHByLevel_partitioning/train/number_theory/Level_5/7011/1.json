    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nBy a proper divisor of a natural number we mean a positive integral divisor other than 1 and the number itself.A natural number greater than 1 will be called nice if it is equal to the product of its distinct proper divisors.\nInitial plan: \n1. Define a function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a given natural number.\n2. Iterate through each natural number up to a certain limit.\n3. Check if the sum of proper divisors of the number is equal to the square of the number itself.\n4. Keep track of numbers that satisfy the condition.\n5. Output the list of numbers that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's start by defining the function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a given natural number. \n\nCorrecting the work: The sum of proper divisors should not include the number itself, so we need to adjust the calculation to exclude the number when summing the divisors. \n\nLet's code the function to calculate the sum of proper divisors first. \n\n```python\ndef sum_proper_divisors(num):\n    sum_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            sum_divisors += i\n    return sum_divisors\n``` \n\nNext, we will iterate through each natural number up to a certain limit and check if the sum of proper divisors equals the square of the number.",
    "solution": "Let $p(n)$ denote the product of the distinct proper divisors of $n$. A number $n$ is nice in one of two instances:\nIt has exactly two distinct prime divisors.\nIf we let $n = pq$, where $p,q$ are the prime factors, then its proper divisors are $p$ and $q$, and $p(n) = p \\cdot q = n$.\nIt is the cube of a prime number.\nIf we let $n=p^3$ with $p$ prime, then its proper divisors are $p$ and $p^2$, and $p(n) = p \\cdot p^2 =n$.\nWe now show that the above are the only two cases. Suppose that another nice number existed that does not fall into one of these two categories. Then we can either express it in the form $n = pqr$ (with $p,q$ prime and $r > 1$) or $n = p^e$ (with $e \\neq 3$). In the former case, it suffices to note that $p(n) \\ge (pr) \\cdot (qr) = pqr^2 > pqr = n$.\nIn the latter case, then $p(n) = p \\cdot p^2 \\cdots p^{(e-1)} = p^{(e-1)e/2}$.\nFor $p(n) = n$, we need $p^{(e-1)e/2} = p^e \\Longrightarrow e^2 - e = 2e \\Longrightarrow$ $e = 0 or e = 3$.\nSince $e \\neq 3$, in the case $e = 0 \\Longrightarrow n = 1$ does not work.\nThus, listing out the first ten numbers to fit this form, $2 \\cdot 3 = 6,\\ 2^3 = 8,\\ 2 \\cdot 5 = 10,$ $\\ 2 \\cdot 7 = 14,\\ 3 \\cdot 5 = 15,\\ 3 \\cdot 7 = 21,$ $\\ 2 \\cdot 11 = 22,\\ 2 \\cdot 13 = 26,$ $\\ 3^3 = 27,\\ 3 \\cdot 11 = 33$. Summing these yields $\\boxed{182}$.",
