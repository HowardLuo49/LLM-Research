The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1.What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?\nSince the sequence consists of positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1, we can first list out the positive multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, ...\n\nNext, we can identify the multiples of 3 that contain the digit 1: 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, ...\n\nWe can observe that the pattern follows after each multiple of 90, with a \"1\" in the tens place. Let's check the answer once we reach the end of the problem statement.",
    "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The $50^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence will be the $8^{\\text{th}}$ term after 81, which is 111.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 318?: The $50^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence will be the $8^{\\text{th}}$ term after 81, which is 111.",
