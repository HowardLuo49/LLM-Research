The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $p$ and $q$ be positive integers such that\\[\\frac{5}{9} < \\frac{p}{q} < \\frac{4}{7}\\]and $q$ is as small as possible.What is $q-p$?$\\textbf{(A) } 7 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 11 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 13 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 17 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 19$\nTo set up the inequality $5q < 9p$, we can rearrange it to $p > \\frac{5}{9}q$. This tells us that $p$ must be greater than $\\frac{5}{9}$ times $q$. We can use this information to find possible values of $p$ and $q$. Let's find the smallest possible $q$ such that $p$ is an integer.",
    "solution": "We claim that, between any two fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$, if $bc-ad=1$, the fraction with smallest denominator between them is $\\frac{a+c}{b+d}$. To prove this, we see that\n\\[\\frac{1}{bd}=\\frac{c}{d}-\\frac{a}{b}=\\left(\\frac{c}{d}-\\frac{p}{q}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{a}{b}\\right) \\geq \\frac{1}{dq}+\\frac{1}{bq},\\]which reduces to $q\\geq b+d$. We can easily find that $p=a+c$, giving an answer of $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can start by listing out the values of $q$ and see if we can find a corresponding integer value of $p$ that satisfies the given inequality. Since we are looking for the smallest possible $q$, we can start with $q = 10$, which gives us $p > \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot 10 = 5\\frac{5}{9}$. This is not an integer value for $p$, so we move on to the next smallest value of $q$, which is $11$. This gives us $p > \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot 11 = \\frac{55}{9} \\approx 6.11$, which is still not an integer. Continuing on, we find that $q = 12$ gives us $p > \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot 12 = \\frac{20}{3} = 6\\frac{2}{3}$. This is an integer value for $p$, namely $7$. Therefore, $q = 12$ and $p = 7$, and the answer to the problem is $q-p = 12-7 = \\boxed{5}$.",
