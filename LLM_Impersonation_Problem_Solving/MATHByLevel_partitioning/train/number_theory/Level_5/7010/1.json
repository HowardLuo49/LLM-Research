The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $m$ be the smallest integer whose cube root is of the form $n+r$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $r$ is a positive real number less than $1/1000$.Find $n$.\nLet's start by finding the cube root of $m$, which is equal to $n+r$. Since $m$ is the smallest integer satisfying the given condition, we can set up the equation as $m = (n+r)^3$. \n\nNext, let's expand the right side of the equation $(n+r)^3$ using the binomial theorem formula: $(n+r)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3$.\n\nWe know that $m$ is an integer, so $n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3$ must also be an integer.\n\nSince $r$ is a positive real number less than $1/1000$, we can write $r = \\frac{a}{1000}$, where $a$ is a positive integer.",
    "solution": "In order to keep $m$ as small as possible, we need to make $n$ as small as possible.\n$m = (n + r)^3 = n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3$. Since $r < \\frac{1}{1000}$ and $m - n^3 = r(3n^2 + 3nr + r^2)$ is an integer, we must have that $3n^2 + 3nr + r^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{r} > 1000$. This means that the smallest possible $n$ should be quite a bit smaller than 1000. In particular, $3nr + r^2$ should be less than 1, so $3n^2 > 999$ and $n > \\sqrt{333}$. $18^2 = 324 < 333 < 361 = 19^2$, so we must have $n \\geq 19$. Since we want to minimize $n$, we take $n = 19$. Then for any positive value of $r$, $3n^2 + 3nr + r^2 > 3\\cdot 19^2 > 1000$, so it is possible for $r$ to be less than $\\frac{1}{1000}$. However, we still have to make sure a sufficiently small $r$ exists.\nIn light of the equation $m - n^3 = r(3n^2 + 3nr + r^2)$, we need to choose $m - n^3$ as small as possible to ensure a small enough $r$. The smallest possible value for $m - n^3$ is 1, when $m = 19^3 + 1$. Then for this value of $m$, $r = \\frac{1}{3n^2 + 3nr + r^2} < \\frac{1}{1000}$, and we're set. The answer is $\\boxed{19}$.",
