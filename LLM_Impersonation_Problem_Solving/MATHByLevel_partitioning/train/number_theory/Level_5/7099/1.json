The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nHow many positive integers $n$ satisfy\\[\\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor?\\](Recall that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer not exceeding $x$.)$\\textbf{(A) } 2 \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } 4 \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } 6 \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } 30 \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } 32$\nGiven that \\(\\dfrac{n+1000}{70}=\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor\\), we can rewrite the equation as \\(\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor=\\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\\). We also know that \\(\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor\\) is an integer, so let's denote it as \\(m\\), which means \\(\\sqrt{n}=m\\). So the equation becomes \\(\\sqrt{n}=m\\) and \\(\\lfloor m\\rfloor=\\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\\).",
    "solution": "First notice that the graphs of $(n+1000)/70$ and $\\sqrt[]{n}$ intersect at 2 points. Then, notice that $(n+1000)/70$ must be an integer. This means that n is congruent to $50 \\pmod{70}$.\nFor the first intersection, testing the first few values of $n$ (adding $70$ to $n$ each time and noticing the left side increases by $1$ each time) yields $n=20$ and $n=21$. Estimating from the graph can narrow down the other cases, being $n=47$, $n=50$. This results in a total of $\\boxed{6}$ cases.",
    "gpt_response": "Since \\( \\sqrt{n} = m \\Longrightarrow n = m^2\\), we can substitute \\(n = m^2\\) into \\(\\left\\lfloor m \\right\\rfloor = \\dfrac{n + 1000}{70}\\) to get \\(\\left\\lfloor m \\right\\rfloor = \\dfrac{m^2 + 1000}{70}\\), which further simplifies to \\(\\left\\lfloor m \\right\\rfloor = \\dfrac{m^2 + 1000}{70} \\Longrightarrow 70\\left\\lfloor m\\right\\rfloor = m^2 + 1000\\). This equation implies that \\(m^2 \\equiv 30 \\pmod{70}\\), which gives us \\(m^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\\) and \\(m^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}\\). Substituting the value of \\( m \\) back gives us the possible values of \\( n \\) which satisfy the condition. Solving these congruences, we get that \\(m \\equiv 1, 6 \\pmod{7}\\) and \\(m \\equiv 7, 3 \\pmod{10}\\). This gives us the possible values of \\( m \\) as 1, 6, 13, 18, 25, 31. For each of these values of \\( m \\), we get two possible values of \\( n \\) hence a total of \\(2 \\times 6 = \\boxed{12}\\) solutions.",
