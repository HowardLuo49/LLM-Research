    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nHow many positive integers $n$ satisfy\\[\\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor?\\](Recall that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer not exceeding $x$.)\n",
    "solution": "First notice that the graphs of $(n+1000)/70$ and $\\sqrt[]{n}$ intersect at 2 points. Then, notice that $(n+1000)/70$ must be an integer. This means that n is congruent to $50 \\pmod{70}$.\nFor the first intersection, testing the first few values of $n$ (adding $70$ to $n$ each time and noticing the left side increases by $1$ each time) yields $n=20$ and $n=21$. Estimating from the graph can narrow down the other cases, being $n=47$, $n=50$. This results in a total of $\\boxed{6}$ cases.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that \\(\\dfrac{n+1000}{70}=\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor\\), we can rewrite the equation as \\(\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor=\\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\\). We also know that \\(\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor\\) is an integer, so let's denote it as \\(m\\), which means \\(\\sqrt{n}=m\\). So the equation becomes \\(\\sqrt{n}=m\\) and \\(\\lfloor m\\rfloor=\\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\\).",
