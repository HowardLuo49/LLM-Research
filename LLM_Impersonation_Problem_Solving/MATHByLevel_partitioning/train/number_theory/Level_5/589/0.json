    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nUse each of the five digits $2, 4, 6, 7$ and $9$ only once to form a three-digit integer and a two-digit integer which will be multiplied together.\n",
    "solution": "Let $\\underline{a}\\,\\underline{b}\\,\\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{d}\\,\\underline{e}$ be the two numbers.  The product of the numbers is  \\[\n(100a+10b+c)(10d+e) = 1000ad + 100(ae+bd) + 10 (cd+be) + ce\n\\] Clearly $ad$ should be as large as possible, so $a$ and $d$ should be 9 and 7 or vice versa.  Also, $c$ should be the smallest digit, since it only appears in the terms $10cd$ and $ce$.  Trying $a=9$ and $d=7$, we have a product of  \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(9e+7b) + 10 (14+be) + 2e = 63,\\!140+902e + 700b + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $e$ term is larger than that of the $b$ term, $e=6$ and $b=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $942\\times 76=71,\\!592$.  If $a=7$ and $d=9$, then the sum is \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(7e+9b) + 10 (18+be) + 2e = 63,\\!180+900b + 702e + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $b$ term is larger than that of the $e$ term, $b=6$ and $e=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $762\\times 94=71,\\!628$.  Since $71,\\!628>71,\\!592$, the three-digit integer yielding the maximum product is $\\boxed{762}$.",
