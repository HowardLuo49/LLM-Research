The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $a_n=6^{n}+8^{n}$.Determine the remainder upon dividing $a_ {83}$ by $49$.\nThe previous person has calculated the first few terms of the sequence $a_n=6^{n}+8^{n}$: $a_1=14$, $a_2=100$, $a_3=400$, $a_4=2308$. \n\nTo find a pattern in the sequence, we can simplify the expression by factoring out $2^{2n}$ from the terms:\n$a_n = 6^{n} + 8^{n} = 2^{2n}(3^{n} + 4^{n})$. \n\nThis simplification might help in finding a general formula for $a_n$.",
    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Now, notice that $3^{n} + 4^{n}$ appears to follow a pattern of $7, 25, 91, 337, \\ldots$. \n\nLooking at these numbers, we see that they are the sum of consecutive odd numbers. In fact, $3^n+4^n$ can be expressed as the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers raised to the second power. \n\nTherefore, $3^{n} + 4^{n} = (1^2 + 3^2 + \\ldots + (2n-1)^2)$. \n\nUsing the formula for the sum of squares of the first $n$ odd numbers, we get $3^{n} + 4^{n} = \\frac{n(2n-1)(2n+1)}{3}$. \n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $a_n$, we have $a_n = 2^{2n} \\cdot \\frac{n(2n-1)(2n+1)}{3}$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder upon dividing $a_{83}$ by $49$ is the same as the remainder upon dividing $2^{166} \\cdot \\frac{83(165)(167)}{3}$ by $49$. \n\nTo find this, we need to simplify the expression and then find the remainder when divided by $49$. \n\nLet's start simplifying the expression $2^{166} \\cdot \\frac{83(165)(167)}{3}$.",
