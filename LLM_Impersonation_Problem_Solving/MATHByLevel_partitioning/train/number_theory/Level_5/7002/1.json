    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe integer $n$ is the largest positive multiple of $15$ such that every digit of $n$ is either $8$ or $0$.Compute $\\frac{n}{15}$.\nGiven that $n$ is a multiple of $15$, we know that $n$ has to end in either $0$ or $5$. Let's start by finding the largest number possible if the last digit is $0$. The number must be divisible by $3$ and end in $0$, so it must also be divisible by $5$. The largest number where all other digits are $8$ would be $8880$.\n\nNext, we need to check the divisibility by 15. We know that a number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. Let's calculate the sum of the digits of $8880$ to see if it is divisible by $3$.\n\n$8 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 24$, which is divisible by $3$. Therefore, $8880$ is divisible by $3$.\n\nNext, let's check if $8880$ is divisible by $5$ by looking at the last digit. Since it is $0$, it is divisible by $5$. Therefore, $8880$ is divisible by $15$.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive multiple of $15$ such that every digit is either $8$ or $0$ is $\\boxed{8880}$.",
    "solution": "Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.\nAny multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.\nThe sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3. If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive. Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.\nThe smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880. Thus the answer is $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The solution presented is correct. \n\nThe largest positive multiple of 15 such that every digit is either 8 or 0 is 8880.\nTherefore, $\\frac{n}{15} = \\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 592?: The solution presented is correct. \n\nThe largest positive multiple of 15 such that every digit is either 8 or 0 is 8880.\nTherefore, $\\frac{n}{15} = \\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",
