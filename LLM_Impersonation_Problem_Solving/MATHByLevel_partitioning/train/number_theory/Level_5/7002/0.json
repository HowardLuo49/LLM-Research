    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe integer $n$ is the largest positive multiple of $15$ such that every digit of $n$ is either $8$ or $0$.\n",
    "solution": "Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.\nAny multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.\nThe sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3. If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive. Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.\nThe smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880. Thus the answer is $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $n$ is a multiple of $15$, we know that $n$ has to end in either $0$ or $5$. Let's start by finding the largest number possible if the last digit is $0$. The number must be divisible by $3$ and end in $0$, so it must also be divisible by $5$. The largest number where all other digits are $8$ would be $8880$.\n\nNext, we need to check the divisibility by 15. We know that a number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. Let's calculate the sum of the digits of $8880$ to see if it is divisible by $3$.\n\n$8 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 24$, which is divisible by $3$. Therefore, $8880$ is divisible by $3$.\n\nNext, let's check if $8880$ is divisible by $5$ by looking at the last digit. Since it is $0$, it is divisible by $5$. Therefore, $8880$ is divisible by $15$.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive multiple of $15$ such that every digit is either $8$ or $0$ is $\\boxed{8880}$.",
