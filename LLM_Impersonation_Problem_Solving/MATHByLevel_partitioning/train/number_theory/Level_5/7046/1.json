The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nIt is known that, for all positive integers $k$,\n$1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^{2}=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}6$.Find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$.\nGiven what we know about the sum of squares of natural numbers, let's consider the following problem: Prove that for any positive integer $n$, the sum of the first $n$ triangular numbers is equal to the square of $n$th triangular number, specifically, \n$1^2 + 3^2 + \\ldots + (2n-1)^2 = (n(2n-1))^2$. \nTo prove this, we can start by using induction. Let's assume the equation is true for $n = m$. Then we need to prove it for $n = m + 1$.\n\nLeave the above plan for the next person to continue solving the problem.",
    "solution": "$\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.\nSince $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 15 \\pmod{16}$.\nIf $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k$. If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$. If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.\nThus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\\pmod{3}$.\nIt is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$. So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 24, 12 \\pmod{25}$.\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \\equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \\pmod{400}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\\boxed{112}$.",
