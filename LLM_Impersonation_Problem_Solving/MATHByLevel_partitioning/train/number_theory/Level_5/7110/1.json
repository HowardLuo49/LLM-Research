The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe zeroes of the function $f(x)=x^2-ax+2a$ are integers.What is the sum of the possible values of $a?$\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 7\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 8\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 16\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 17\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 18$\nFirst, let's find the discriminant of the quadratic equation $f(x)=x^2-ax+2a$ by using the formula $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$.\nSince the discriminant has to be a perfect square to have integer roots, we can set it equal to $k^2$ where $k$ is an integer. So, $\\Delta = a^2 - 4\\cdot2a = a^2 - 8a$.\nSetting $a^2 - 8a = k^2$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^2 - 8a - k^2 = 0$.\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for $a$ and $k$.",
    "solution": "By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.\nBecause the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$. Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields\\[(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.\\]Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and\\[((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.\\]Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \\dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \\dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$. Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$. These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can complete the square to rewrite the equation as $(a - 4)^2 - k^2 = 16$. Factoring as a difference of squares gives us $(a - 4 - k)(a - 4 + k) = 16$. The integer pairs for $a$ are $(6,2)$ and $(8,8)$ or $a = 6, 2, 8$. The sum of the values of $a$ is $6 + 2 + 8 = \\boxed{16}$.",
