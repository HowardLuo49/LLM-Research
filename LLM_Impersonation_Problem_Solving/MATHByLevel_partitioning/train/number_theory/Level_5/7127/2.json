The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be the set of integers $n > 1$ for which $\\tfrac1n = 0.d_1d_2d_3d_4\\ldots$, an infinite decimal that has the property that $d_i = d_{i+12}$ for all positive integers $i$.Given that $9901$ is prime, how many positive integers are in $S$?(The $d_i$ are digits.)\nWhen $n=2$, we have $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.500000000000...$, which is not a repeating decimal. \nWhen $n=3$, we have $\\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333333333...$, where $d_i = 3 = d_{i+12}$.\nWhen $n=4$, we have $\\frac{1}{4} = 0.250000000000...$, which is not a repeating decimal.\nWhen $n=6$, we have $\\frac{1}{6} = 0.16666666666...$ which repeats, but with $d_i = 6 \\neq d_{i+12}$.\nWhen $n=12$, we have $\\frac{1}{12} = 0.08333333...$ which repeats and matches the criteria $d_i = d_{i+12}$. Next, let's consider the general solution for $n$ in the form $2^a3^b$.",
    "solution": "Let $k = d_1 d_2 d_3 \\ldots d_{12}$, the first $12$ decimal digits of $\\tfrac{1}{n}$. We can see that\\[(10^{12} - 1)\\left(\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right) = k \\implies kn = 10^{12} - 1,\\]so $S$ is the set that contains all divisors of $10^{12} - 1$ except for $1$. Since\\[10^{12} - 1 = (10^6 + 1)(10^6 - 1) = (10^2 + 1)(10^4 - 10^2 + 1)(10^3 + 1)(10^3 - 1) = 101 \\cdot 9901 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 37,\\]the number $10^{12} -1$ has $4 \\cdot 2^6 = 256$ divisors and our answer is $256 - 1 = \\boxed{255}.$",
