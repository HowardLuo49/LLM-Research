You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe number 236!\n",
    "solution": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros.",
    "gpt_response": "We need to determine the largest power of 2 that divides evenly into 236!.\n\nTo find the largest power of 2 that divides into 236!, we need to calculate the number of times 2 divides into each factor of 236! and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many times 2 divides into the even numbers from 1 to 236. \n\nTo calculate how many times 2 divides into a number, we can use the formula n = floor(num/2) + floor(num/4) + floor(num/8) + ..., where the floors indicate integer division.\n\nLet's start by calculating how many times 2 divides into 236.",
