You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $N$ be the largest integer whose square has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9.\n",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $N$ has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9, we know that $9^2 \\leq N < 10^2$, since $9^2$ has $3$ digits and $10^2$ has $4$ digits in base 9. This means $81 \\leq N < 100$.\n\nTo find the largest integer $N$ such that $N^2$ has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9, we can start by finding the largest integer whose square is less than $1000$ in base 9 and then converting it back to base 10. \n\nLet's take the highest possible value for $N$ in base 9, which is $99_9$. Converting this back to base 10, we get $N = 9 \\cdot 9 + 9 = 90 + 9 = 99$. Thus, $N = 99$.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer $N$ whose square has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9 is $99$.",
