The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCall a positive integer $n$ $k$-pretty if $n$ has exactly $k$ positive divisors and $n$ is divisible by $k$.For example, $18$ is $6$-pretty.Let $S$ be the sum of positive integers less than $2019$ that are $20$-pretty.Find $\\tfrac{S}{20}$.\n5. For k=5: A 5-pretty number must have exactly 5 divisors and be divisible by 5. The number can be of the form $p_1^4$ where $p_1$ is a prime number. 1, $p_1$, $p_1^2$, $p_1^3$, and $p_1^4$ are the divisors.\n\n6. For k=6: A 6-pretty number must have exactly 6 divisors and be divisible by 6. The number can be of the form $p_1 * p_2^2$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes.\n\nTo continue finding k-pretty numbers, we need to analyze the number of divisors and the prime factorization for each value of k. We can create a general form for k-pretty numbers using the patterns observed. Once a general form is established, we can iterate through numbers less than 2019 to find all k-pretty numbers and calculate their sum for each k. Let the next person proceed with this step.",
    "solution": "Every 20-pretty integer can be written in form $n = 2^a 5^b k$, where $a \\ge 2$, $b \\ge 1$, $\\gcd(k,10) = 1$, and $d(n) = 20$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Thus, we have $20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k)$, using the fact that the divisor function is multiplicative. As $(a+1)(b+1)$ must be a divisor of 20, there are not many cases to check.\nIf $a+1 = 4$, then $b+1 = 5$. But this leads to no solutions, as $(a,b) = (3,4)$ gives $2^3 5^4 > 2019$.\nIf $a+1 = 5$, then $b+1 = 2$ or $4$. The first case gives $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime other than 2 or 5. Thus we have $80p < 2019 \\implies p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$. The sum of all such $n$ is $80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) = 7440$. In the second case $b+1 = 4$ and $d(k) = 1$, and there is one solution $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3 = 2000$.\nIf $a+1 = 10$, then $b+1 = 2$, but this gives $2^9 \\cdot 5^1 > 2019$. No other values for $a+1$ work.\nThen we have $\\frac{S}{20} = \\frac{80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) + 2000}{20} = 372 + 100 = \\boxed{472}$.",

For k=8: A 8-pretty number must have exactly 8 divisors and be divisible by 8. The number can be of the form $p_1 * p_2^3$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes.\n\nBy continuing this pattern and analyzing the number of divisors and prime factorization for each value of k, we can derive a general formula for k-pretty numbers. Once we have the general formula, we can iterate through numbers less than 2019 to find all k-pretty numbers and calculate their sum for each k.
