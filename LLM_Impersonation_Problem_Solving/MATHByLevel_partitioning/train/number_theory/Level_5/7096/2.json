    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCall a positive integer $n$ $k$-pretty if $n$ has exactly $k$ positive divisors and $n$ is divisible by $k$.For example, $18$ is $6$-pretty.Let $S$ be the sum of positive integers less than $2019$ that are $20$-pretty.\n3. For k=3: A 3-pretty number must have exactly 3 divisors. The number must be of the form $p_1^2$ where $p_1$ is a prime number. This ensures that the number has exactly 3 divisors: 1, $p_1$, and $p_1^2$.\n\n4. For k=4: A 4-pretty number must have exactly 4 divisors and be divisible by 4. The number can be of the form $p_1 * p_2$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes. \n\nTo solve the problem for larger values of k, we can generalize the patterns observed for k=2, 3, and 4. Look for common characteristics among the k-pretty numbers already found and see if there is a way to find a formula or method to generate k-pretty numbers efficiently.",
    "solution": "Every 20-pretty integer can be written in form $n = 2^a 5^b k$, where $a \\ge 2$, $b \\ge 1$, $\\gcd(k,10) = 1$, and $d(n) = 20$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Thus, we have $20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k)$, using the fact that the divisor function is multiplicative. As $(a+1)(b+1)$ must be a divisor of 20, there are not many cases to check.\nIf $a+1 = 4$, then $b+1 = 5$. But this leads to no solutions, as $(a,b) = (3,4)$ gives $2^3 5^4 > 2019$.\nIf $a+1 = 5$, then $b+1 = 2$ or $4$. The first case gives $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime other than 2 or 5. Thus we have $80p < 2019 \\implies p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$. The sum of all such $n$ is $80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) = 7440$. In the second case $b+1 = 4$ and $d(k) = 1$, and there is one solution $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3 = 2000$.\nIf $a+1 = 10$, then $b+1 = 2$, but this gives $2^9 \\cdot 5^1 > 2019$. No other values for $a+1$ work.\nThen we have $\\frac{S}{20} = \\frac{80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) + 2000}{20} = 372 + 100 = \\boxed{472}$.",
    "gpt_response": "5. For k=5: A 5-pretty number must have exactly 5 divisors and be divisible by 5. The number can be of the form $p_1^4$ where $p_1$ is a prime number. 1, $p_1$, $p_1^2$, $p_1^3$, and $p_1^4$ are the divisors.\n\n6. For k=6: A 6-pretty number must have exactly 6 divisors and be divisible by 6. The number can be of the form $p_1 * p_2^2$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes.\n\nTo continue finding k-pretty numbers, we need to analyze the number of divisors and the prime factorization for each value of k. We can create a general form for k-pretty numbers using the patterns observed. Once a general form is established, we can iterate through numbers less than 2019 to find all k-pretty numbers and calculate their sum for each k. Let the next person proceed with this step.",
