    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9.$ For example, the number $19\\,836$ is divisible by $9$ but $19\\,825$ is not.\n",
    "solution": "For $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ we must have $$D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37+D+E$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, we know each is between $0$ and $9.$ Therefore, $D+E$ is between $0$ and $18.$ Therefore, $37+D+E$ is between $37$ and $55.$ The numbers between $37$ and $55$ that are divisible by $9$ are $45$ and $54.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=45,$ then $D+E=8.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=54,$ then $D+E=17.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $D+E$ are $8$ and $17.$ Our answer is then $8+17=\\boxed{25}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Given the property that a number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$, we can establish the following plan to solve the problem in a general manner:\n1. Consider a general three-digit number $\\overline{abc}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively.\n2. Express $\\overline{abc}$ in expanded form as $100a + 10b + c$.\n3. The sum of the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c$.\n4. Determine the conditions under which the sum $a + b + c$ is divisible by $9$.\n5. Deduce the properties that the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ must satisfy in order for the number $\\overline{abc}$ to be divisible by $9$ and generalize for larger numbers.",
