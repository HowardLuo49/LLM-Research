The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9.$ For example, the number $19\\,836$ is divisible by $9$ but $19\\,825$ is not.If $D\\,767\\,E89$ is divisible by $9,$ where $D$ and $E$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all possible values of the sum $D+E?$\nGiven the property that a number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$, we can establish the following plan to solve the problem in a general manner:\n1. Consider a general three-digit number $\\overline{abc}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively.\n2. Express $\\overline{abc}$ in expanded form as $100a + 10b + c$.\n3. The sum of the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $a + b + c$.\n4. Determine the conditions under which the sum $a + b + c$ is divisible by $9$.\n5. Deduce the properties that the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ must satisfy in order for the number $\\overline{abc}$ to be divisible by $9$ and generalize for larger numbers.",
    "solution": "For $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ we must have $$D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37+D+E$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, we know each is between $0$ and $9.$ Therefore, $D+E$ is between $0$ and $18.$ Therefore, $37+D+E$ is between $37$ and $55.$ The numbers between $37$ and $55$ that are divisible by $9$ are $45$ and $54.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=45,$ then $D+E=8.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=54,$ then $D+E=17.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $D+E$ are $8$ and $17.$ Our answer is then $8+17=\\boxed{25}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $19\\,836$ is divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits $1 + 9 + 8 + 3 + 6 = 27$ is divisible by $9$, while in the case of $19\\,825$ the sum of its digits $1 + 9 + 8 + 2 + 5 = 25$ is not divisible by $9$. \n\nTherefore, in the number $D767E89$ to be divisible by $9$, the sum $D + 7 + 6 + 7 + E + 8 + 9$ must be divisible by $9$. Simplifying this gives $30 + D + E = 9n$ where $n$ is an integer. \n\nThus, $D + E = 9n - 30$. The possible values of $n$ that make $D + E$ a positive digit are $4, 5, 6, 7, 8,$ and $9$. \n\nSumming up all possible values of $D + E$, we get $4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = \\boxed{39}$.",
