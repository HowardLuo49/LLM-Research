The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$.What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?\nGiven that $x = 2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$, we can simplify the expression by adding the exponents of the same bases: $x = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot (2^2)^2 \\cdot (3^3)^4 \\cdot (2^2)^3 \\cdot (3^3)^6 \\cdot (2^2)^4 \\cdot (3^3)^8 \\cdot (3^3)^{10}$.\n\nThis can be further simplified by multiplying the exponents: $x = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 2^6 \\cdot 3^{18} \\cdot 2^8 \\cdot 3^{24} \\cdot 3^{30}$. \n\nNext, calculate the value of $x$ using the simplified expression.",
    "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.",

Thus, the smallest positive integer to multiply by $x$ to get a perfect square is $2$.",
