The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor all positive integers $n$, the $n$th triangular number $T_n$ is defined as $T_n = 1+2+3+ \\cdots + n$.What is the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of $4T_n$ and $n-1$?\nLet's start by writing out the first few triangular numbers to see if we can identify any patterns or relationships: $T_1 = 1$, $T_2 = 1 + 2 = 3$, $T_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, $T_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$. \n\nThe $n$th triangular number $T_n$ can also be expressed as $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. \n\nNow, let's try to find a formula or a relationship involving triangular numbers that might help solve this problem more efficiently. \n\nOne interesting property of triangular numbers is that $T_{n+1} - T_n = n+1$.",
    "solution": "By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \\times 2n, n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n, n - 1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4, n -1) \\le \\boxed{4}.\\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$.",
    "gpt_response": "Another interesting property is that $T_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Also, the greatest common divisor of $4T_n$ and $n-1$ is equal to the greatest common divisor of $2T_n$ and $\\frac{n-1}{2}$. \n\nSince $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, we can rewrite $4T_n$ as $2n(n+1)$. \n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $2T_n$ and $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ is equal to the greatest common divisor of $2n(n+1)$ and $\\frac{n-1}{2}$. \n\nLet's try to simplify the expression further.",
