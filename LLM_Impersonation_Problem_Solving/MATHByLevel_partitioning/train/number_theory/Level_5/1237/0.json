You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor all positive integers $n$, the $n$th triangular number $T_n$ is defined as $T_n = 1+2+3+ \\cdots + n$.\n",
    "solution": "By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \\times 2n, n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n, n - 1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4, n -1) \\le \\boxed{4}.\\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing out the first few triangular numbers to see if we can identify any patterns or relationships: $T_1 = 1$, $T_2 = 1 + 2 = 3$, $T_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, $T_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$. \n\nThe $n$th triangular number $T_n$ can also be expressed as $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. \n\nNow, let's try to find a formula or a relationship involving triangular numbers that might help solve this problem more efficiently. \n\nOne interesting property of triangular numbers is that $T_{n+1} - T_n = n+1$.",
