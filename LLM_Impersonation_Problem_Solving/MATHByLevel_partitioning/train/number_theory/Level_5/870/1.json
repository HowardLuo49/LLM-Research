    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms.How many different denominators are possible?\nGiven the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$, we can express it as the fraction $\\frac{ab}{99}$. \n\nTo write $\\frac{ab}{99}$ in lowest terms, we need to make sure that $ab$ and $99$ do not have any common factors other than 1.\n\nIn order to do this, we need to determine if $a$ and $b$ have any common factors aside from 1. \n\nLet $ab = 10a + b$. \n\nWe know that $a$ and $b$ are digits, so $0 \\leq a,b \\leq 9$. \n\nOne way to proceed is to list out the possible pairs $(a,b)$ and check for common factors. \n\nSince $a$ and $b$ cannot be both nine and not both zero, we only need to check the pairs where $a = 0, 1, ..., 9$ and $b = 0, 1, ..., 9$ with the restrictions mentioned.",
    "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
