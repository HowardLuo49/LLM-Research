    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nHarold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence.\n",
    "solution": "Note that it is impossible for any of $h,t,u$ to be $1$, since then each picket will have been painted one time, and then some will be painted more than once.\n$h$ cannot be $2$, or that will result in painting the third picket twice. If $h=3$, then $t$ may not equal anything not divisible by $3$, and the same for $u$. Now for fourth and fifth pickets to be painted, $t$ and $u$ must be $3$ as well. This configuration works, so $333$ is paintable.\nIf $h$ is $4$, then $t$ must be even. The same for $u$, except that it can't be $2 \\mod 4$. Thus $u$ is $0 \\mod 4$ and $t$ is $2 \\mod 4$. Since this is all $\\mod 4$, $t$ must be $2$ and $u$ must be $4$, in order for $5,6$ to be paint-able. Thus $424$ is paintable.\n$h$ cannot be greater than $5$, since if that were the case then the answer would be greater than $999$, which would be impossible for the AIME.\nThus the sum of all paintable numbers is $\\boxed{757}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the picket fence is very long, let's define the total length of the fence as L units.\nLet's represent Harold's painting speed as h units per hour, Tanya's painting speed as t units per hour, and Ulysses' painting speed as u units per hour.\nAssuming that they start painting at the same time, let's denote the total time it takes to paint the fence as T hours.",
