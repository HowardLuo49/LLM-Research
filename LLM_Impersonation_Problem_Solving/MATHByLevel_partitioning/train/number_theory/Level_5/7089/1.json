The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors.Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\nI need to find a way to approach this problem using number theory concepts.\nLet's consider what it means for a positive integer to have a certain number of divisors.\nOne way to find the number of divisors of a positive integer is to factorize it.\nWe know that the number of positive divisors of a positive integer $n$ is given by the formula: $\\prod_{p} (e_p + 1)$, where $p$ runs through the distinct prime factors of $n$ and $e_p$ is the exponent of the prime $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$.\nThis means that if $N$ is $k$-nice, then we need to find a way to express the condition in terms of prime factorization and exponents.",
    "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.",
