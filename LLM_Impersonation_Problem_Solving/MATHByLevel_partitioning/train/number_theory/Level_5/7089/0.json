    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors.\n",
    "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.",
    "gpt_response": "I need to find a way to approach this problem using number theory concepts.\nLet's consider what it means for a positive integer to have a certain number of divisors.\nOne way to find the number of divisors of a positive integer is to factorize it.\nWe know that the number of positive divisors of a positive integer $n$ is given by the formula: $\\prod_{p} (e_p + 1)$, where $p$ runs through the distinct prime factors of $n$ and $e_p$ is the exponent of the prime $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$.\nThis means that if $N$ is $k$-nice, then we need to find a way to express the condition in terms of prime factorization and exponents.",
