The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTwo numbers $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors.What is the greatest of these three common divisors?\nGiven that $90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$ and $m = p^{x-1}$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $x$, we can find the number of positive divisors each number has.\nThe total number of divisors of $90$ is $(1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 12$.\nThe total number of divisors of $m$ is $x$.\nSince $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors, we can set up the equation $12 = 3 + x$.\nThis gives us $x = 9$, which means $m = p^8$ for some prime $p$.",
    "solution": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The greatest common divisor between $90$ and $m$ will be the smallest number in the prime factorization that is common to both $90$ and $m$. In this case, the greatest common divisor is $3$.",
