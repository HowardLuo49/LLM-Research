You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTwo numbers $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors.\n",
    "solution": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$ and $m = p^{x-1}$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $x$, we can find the number of positive divisors each number has.\nThe total number of divisors of $90$ is $(1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 12$.\nThe total number of divisors of $m$ is $x$.\nSince $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors, we can set up the equation $12 = 3 + x$.\nThis gives us $x = 9$, which means $m = p^8$ for some prime $p$.",
