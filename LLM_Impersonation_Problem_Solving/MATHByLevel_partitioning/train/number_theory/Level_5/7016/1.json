    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nOne of Euler's conjectures was disproved in the 1960s by three American mathematicians when they showed there was a positive integer such that $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^{5}$.Find the value of $n$.\nTo solve this problem, we can start by calculating the sum of the fifth powers of the given numbers: $133^5 + 110^5 + 84^5 + 27^5$. Let's denote this sum as $S$.\nCalculating $133^5$: $133^5 = 3486784401$\nCalculating $110^5$: $110^5 = 1610510000$\nCalculating $84^5$: $84^5 = 482680900$\nCalculating $27^5$: $27^5 = 14348907$\nAdding these values together to get $S = 3486784401 + 1610510000 + 482680900 + 14348907 = 5157150208$.",
    "solution": "Note that $n$ is even, since the $LHS$ consists of two odd and two even numbers. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know ${n^{5}}$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5. Hence,\n$3 + 0 + 4 + 2 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\n$4 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\nContinuing, we examine the equation modulo 3,\n$1 - 1 + 0 + 0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\n$0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\nThus, $n$ is divisible by three and leaves a remainder of four when divided by 5. It's obvious that $n>133$, so the only possibilities are $n = 144$ or $n \\geq 174$. It quickly becomes apparent that 174 is much too large, so $n$ must be $\\boxed{144}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Now, we have the equation $S = n^5$, where $S = 5157150208$. To find the value of $n$, we need to take the fifth root of $5157150208$. \n\nCalculating the fifth root of $5157150208$:\n$n = \\sqrt[5]{5157150208} \\\\ \nn = 170$ \n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is $170$.",
