    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of real numbers that can be represented as repeating decimals of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ where $a, b, c$ are distinct digits.\n",
    "solution": "Numbers of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ can be written as $\\frac{abc}{999}$. There are $10\\times9\\times8=720$ such numbers. Each digit will appear in each place value $\\frac{720}{10}=72$ times, and the sum of the digits, 0 through 9, is 45. So the sum of all the numbers is $\\frac{45\\times72\\times111}{999}= \\boxed{360}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $a, b, c$ are distinct digits, there are a total of $10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720$ possible numbers in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nTo find the sum of all numbers in $\\mathcal{S}$, we can first consider the sum of each place value separately. The sum of the digits in the hundredths place is $\\sum_{a \\neq b \\neq c} (a + b + c) = 3(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 9) = 3 \\times 45 = 135$.",
