    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$.\n",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the equation $8x+1\\equiv 5\\pmod{12}$, we first simplify the equation by subtracting 1 from both sides to get $8x\\equiv 4\\pmod{12}$. \n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4 to get $2x\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$. \n\nThis simplifies further to $x\\equiv 2^{-1}\\pmod{3}$. \n\nWe can find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3 by checking which number when multiplied by 2 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. \n\nThus, the next step would be to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3.",
