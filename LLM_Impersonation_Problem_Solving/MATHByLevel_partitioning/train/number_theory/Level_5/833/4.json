You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson recover a suitcase with a three-digit combination lock from a mathematician turned criminal.Embedded in the suitcase above the lock is the cryptic message \"AT SEA BASE.SEAS EBB SEA: BASS. \"Dr. Watson comments, \"This probably isn't about ocean fish.Perhaps it is an encrypted message.\nThe cryptic message \"AT SEA BASE.SEAS EBB SEA: BASS\" may be indicating a substitution cipher where each word corresponds to a prime number. The word \"AT\" could correspond to 103, \"SEA\" could correspond to 127, \"BASE\" could correspond to 233, \"SEAS\" could correspond to 347, \"EBB\" could correspond to 157, and \"SEA\" could correspond to 127 again. Now, the word \"BASS\" remains, which might give a clue about the combination lock. \n\nNext steps:\n1. Decode the word \"BASS\" to its corresponding prime numbers using the previously matched words as a guide.\n2. Look for patterns or relationships among the prime numbers from the decoded words and see if they can help solve the combination lock.",
    "solution": "We must solve the addition problem $$ \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & S & E & A & S_d \\\\ & & & E & B & B_d \\\\ + & & & S & E & A_d\\\\ \\cline{1-6} & & B & A& S& S_d\\end{array},$$ where $d$ is an unknown base. It follows that $S + B + A$ leaves a residue of $S$ upon division by $d$. Thus, $B+A$ must be divisible by $d$. Since $B$ and $A$ cannot both be $0$, and $B+A < (d-1) + (d-1) = 2d-2$, then $B + A = d$.\n\nLooking at the $d$s digit, we must carry-over $1$ from the units digit sum, so $1 + A + B + E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Since $B + A = d$, then $1 + E + d \\equiv 1+E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Thus, $S = E+1$ or $E = d-1$ and $S = 0$. However, the latter is impossible since $S$ is the leftmost digit of 'SEAS' and 'SEA'. Thus, $S = E+1$, and we again carry-over $1$ to the $d^2$ digit.\n\nLooking at the $d^2$ digit, after carry-over, it follows that $1 + E + E + S \\equiv A \\pmod{d}$. Note that $1 + E + E + S < 1 + 3(d-1) = 3d - 2 < 3d$. Then, $2E + S + 1 - A$ is either equal to $0$, $d$, or $2d$. However, we can immediately discard the $0$ case: there would be no carry-over for the leftmost digit, so $S = B$ are not distinct.\n\nIn the next case, if $2E + S + 1 = A + d$, then there is a carry-over of $1$ to the last digit. It follows that $S + 1 = B$. This gives us the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nB + A &= d \\\\\nE + 1 &= S \\\\\nS + 1 &= B \\\\\n2E + S +1 - A&= d\n\\end{align*} Setting the first and fourth equations equal to each other yields that $d = B+A = 2E + S +1 - A$, and since $B = S+1 = E+2$, substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $2A = 3E + S + 1 - B = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - (E+2) = 2E$. This contradicts the distinct digits criterion.\n\nThus, $2E + S + 1 - A= 2d = 2(B+A)$, so $2E + S + 1 - 2B = 3A$. Also, we have that $B = S+2$, due to the carry-over in the leftmost digit. Substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $3A = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - 2(E + 3) = E - 4$, so $E = 3A+4$. Thus, $S = 3A+5$ and $B=3A+7$. Also, $S,E,$ and $A$ are decimal digits, so it follows that $S = 3A + 5 \\le 9 \\Longrightarrow A = 0,1$. We can discard the solution $A = 0$, as $d = B+A$ but $B < d$. Thus, $B = 10, S = 8, E = 7$, occurring in base $d = B+A = 11$. The answer is $\\boxed{871}$.",
