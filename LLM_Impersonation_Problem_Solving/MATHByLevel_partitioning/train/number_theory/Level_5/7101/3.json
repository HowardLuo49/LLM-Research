    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nMary chose an even $4$-digit number $n$.She wrote down all the divisors of $n$ in increasing order from left to right: $1,2,...,\\dfrac{n}{2},n$.At some moment Mary wrote $323$ as a divisor of $n$.What is the smallest possible value of the next divisor written to the right of $323$?\n1. Since $n$ is a $4$-digit number, the largest divisor of $n$ will be $n$ itself.\n2. Notice that since $1$ and $n$ are divisors of $n$, we can also deduce that $327$ and $n/327$ are divisors of $n$.\n3. Let $n = abcd$, then the divisors of $n$ will be $1,a,b,c,d,abcd$.\n4. We can calculate the divisors of $n$ incrementally by starting with $1$, then checking $a,b,c,d$.",
    "solution": "Since prime factorizing $323$ gives you $17 \\cdot 19$, the desired answer needs to be a multiple of $17$ or $19$, this is because if it is not a multiple of $17$ or $19$, $n$ will be more than a $4$ digit number. For example, if the answer were to instead be $324$, $n$ would have to be a multiple of $2^2 * 3^4 * 17 * 19$ for both $323$ and $324$ to be a valid factor, meaning $n$ would have to be at least $104652$, which is too big. Looking at the answer choices, $\\text{(A) }324$ and $\\text{(B) }330$ are both not a multiple of neither 17 nor 19, $\\text{(C) }340$ is divisible by $17$. $\\text{(D) }361$ is divisible by $19$, and $\\text{(E) }646$ is divisible by both $17$ and $19$. Since $\\boxed{340}$ is the smallest number divisible by either $17$ or $19$ it is the answer. Checking, we can see that $n$ would be $6460$, a four-digit number. Note that $n$ is also divisible by $2$, one of the listed divisors of $n$. (If $n$ was not divisible by $2$, we would need to look for a different divisor)",
    "gpt_response": "5. To find the next divisor after $327$, we need to calculate its prime factors to find the smallest possible value. Let's calculate the prime factors of $327$.\n6. The prime factorization of $327$ is $3*3*3*3*3$. \n7. Since we have the prime factorization of $327, we can find the next divisor of $n$ after $327$ that includes the prime factors of $327$ and pairs them with other prime factors to form the divisor of $n$.",
