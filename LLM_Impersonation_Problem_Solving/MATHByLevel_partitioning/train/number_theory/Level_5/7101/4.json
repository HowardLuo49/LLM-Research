The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nMary chose an even $4$-digit number $n$.She wrote down all the divisors of $n$ in increasing order from left to right: $1,2,...,\\dfrac{n}{2},n$.At some moment Mary wrote $323$ as a divisor of $n$.What is the smallest possible value of the next divisor written to the right of $323$?$\\textbf{(A) } 324 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 330 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 340 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 361 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 646$\n5. To find the next divisor after $327$, we need to calculate its prime factors to find the smallest possible value. Let's calculate the prime factors of $327$.\n6. The prime factorization of $327$ is $3*3*3*3*3$. \n7. Since we have the prime factorization of $327, we can find the next divisor of $n$ after $327$ that includes the prime factors of $327$ and pairs them with other prime factors to form the divisor of $n$.",
    "solution": "Since prime factorizing $323$ gives you $17 \\cdot 19$, the desired answer needs to be a multiple of $17$ or $19$, this is because if it is not a multiple of $17$ or $19$, $n$ will be more than a $4$ digit number. For example, if the answer were to instead be $324$, $n$ would have to be a multiple of $2^2 * 3^4 * 17 * 19$ for both $323$ and $324$ to be a valid factor, meaning $n$ would have to be at least $104652$, which is too big. Looking at the answer choices, $\\text{(A) }324$ and $\\text{(B) }330$ are both not a multiple of neither 17 nor 19, $\\text{(C) }340$ is divisible by $17$. $\\text{(D) }361$ is divisible by $19$, and $\\text{(E) }646$ is divisible by both $17$ and $19$. Since $\\boxed{340}$ is the smallest number divisible by either $17$ or $19$ it is the answer. Checking, we can see that $n$ would be $6460$, a four-digit number. Note that $n$ is also divisible by $2$, one of the listed divisors of $n$. (If $n$ was not divisible by $2$, we would need to look for a different divisor)",
