The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nGiven a prime $p$ and an integer $a$, we say that $a$ is a $\\textit{primitive root} \\pmod p$ if the set $\\{a,a^2,a^3,\\ldots,a^{p-1}\\}$ contains exactly one element congruent to each of $1,2,3,\\ldots,p-1\\pmod p$.For example, $2$ is a primitive root $\\pmod 5$ because $\\{2,2^2,2^3,2^4\\}\\equiv \\{2,4,3,1\\}\\pmod 5$, and this list contains every residue from $1$ to $4$ exactly once.However, $4$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod 5$ because $\\{4,4^2,4^3,4^4\\}\\equiv\\{4,1,4,1\\}\\pmod 5$, and this list does not contain every residue from $1$ to $4$ exactly once.What is the sum of all integers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ that are primitive roots $\\pmod 7$?\nTo find the primitive root modulo p, we can first calculate the totient function of p using the formula \u03c6(p) = p - 1. This tells us the number of positive integers less than p that are relatively prime to p. This value will help us determine the potential values of a that need to be checked for being a primitive root modulo p.",
    "solution": "Obviously, $1$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod 7$ (its powers are all congruent to $1$!).\n\nExamining the powers of $2$, we see that $\\{2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\} \\equiv \\{2,4,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ with repetition from this point onward. Since the powers of $2$ do not include all residues from $1$ to $6\\pmod 7$, we see that $2$ is not a primitive root.\n\nThe logic of this example can be generalized. If $a$ is an integer and $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$, then the powers of $a$ repeat on a cycle of length at most $k$. Therefore, for $a$ to be a primitive root, it is necessary that $a^k\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for all positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$. Conversely, if $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for some positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$, then $a$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod p$. As examples, $4$ and $6$ are not primitive roots $\\pmod 7$, because $4^3\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$ and $6^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$.\n\nThis leaves $3$ and $5$ as candidates. Checking the powers of $3$ and $5$ modulo $7$, we see that \\begin{align*}\n3^1\\equiv 3,~ 3^2\\equiv 2,~3^3 \\equiv 6,~3^4\\equiv 4,~3^5\\equiv 5,~ 3^6\\equiv 1;\\\\\n5^1\\equiv 5,~ 5^2\\equiv 4,~5^3 \\equiv 6,~5^4\\equiv 2,~5^5\\equiv 3,~ 5^6\\equiv 1.\\,\n\\end{align*}Thus, $3,5$ are primitive roots of $7$, so the desired sum is $3+5=\\boxed{8}$.",

The powers of 1 modulo 7 are {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...}, which clearly do not contain all residues from 1 to 6 exactly once.\n\nNext, let's consider 2. The powers of 2 modulo 7 are {2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, ...}.
