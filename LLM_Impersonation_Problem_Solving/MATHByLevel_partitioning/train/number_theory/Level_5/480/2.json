    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$.(Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.)For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?\nTo generalize the observations for $n=6$, we can consider that $g(6) = 6 = 2 \\cdot 3$, and in general, $n = p_1^{a_1}\\cdot p_2^{a_2}\\cdot...\\cdot p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_i$ are prime numbers exponents $a_i >= 1$. Thus, $g(n) = p_1^{a_1+1}\\cdot p_2^{a_2+1}\\cdot...\\cdot p_k^{a_k+1}$. Based on this, your task is to prove this relationship between $n$ and $g(n)$ by mathematical induction for all positive integers $n$.",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
