    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$.\n",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the definition of $g(n)$, it is clear that $g(n)$ includes $n$ itself in the product, so $g(n) = n \\cdot g(n')$ for some $n'$. \n\nTo simplify the problem, let's start by considering a specific number $n$ and calculating $g(n)$ manually to look for any patterns or observations. Let's pick a small number like $n = 6$ to start with. \n\nFor $n = 6$, the proper divisors are $1, 2, 3$. So, $g(6) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. \n\nNext, let's generalize the observations made for $n = 6$ to come up with a strategy for finding $g(n)$.",
