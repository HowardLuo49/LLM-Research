You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe positive integers $N$ and $N^2$ both end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$, where digit a is not zero.\n",
    "solution": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $N$ ends in the sequence of four digits $abcd$, we can express $N$ as $10000k + abcd$ for some positive integer $k$. \nNext, we know that $N^2$ will end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$. \nExpanding $(10000k + abcd)^2 = 100000000k^2 + 200000k \\cdot abcd + abcd \\cdot abcd$, \nwe can simplify it to $10000(10000k^2 + 2k \\cdot abcd) + abcd \\cdot abcd$. \n\nNow, we can observe that the last four digits of $N^2$, which is $abcd$, must be equal to $abcd \\cdot abcd$ in mod $10000$. \n\nThe plan for the next person is to determine the possible values of $abcd$ such that $abcd \\cdot abcd \\equiv abcd \\pmod{10000}$ and then find the corresponding values of $N$.",
