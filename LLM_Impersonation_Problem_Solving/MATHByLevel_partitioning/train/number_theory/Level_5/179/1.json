The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, their product is 200.How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers?\nGiven:\nLet the two integers be a and b.\nWe know that gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = 200.\nWe also know that gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b. (This is a property of gcd and lcm).\n\nNext steps:\n1. Since gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b = 200, we can start by finding all pairs of numbers that multiply to 200.\n2. List all the factors of 200 and try to find pairs that satisfy the condition gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = 200. If the pairs do not satisfy this condition, discard them.\n3. Once you find potential pairs, calculate their gcd and lcm to see if they indeed satisfy the given condition.",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 200$.  The prime factorization of 200 is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 5^q$ and $b = 2^r \\cdot 5^s$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + r} \\cdot 5^{q + s}$.  But $ab = 200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $p + r = 3$ and $q + s = 2$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,r\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{q,s\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,r)$ are $(0,3)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,r\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 5^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 5$, and $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.",
