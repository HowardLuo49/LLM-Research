    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCall a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$.\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",
    "gpt_response": "Given a positive integer $N$, let's express it in base 7 to form the number $a_na_{n-1}\\ldots a_1a_0$. Then, we can express $N$ in base 10 as $N = a_n \\cdot 7^n + a_{n-1} \\cdot 7^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 \\cdot 7 + a_0$. Since we know that this base 10 number is twice the value of N, we can set up the equation $2N = 2(a_n \\cdot 7^n + a_{n-1} \\cdot 7^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 \\cdot 7 + a_0)$.",
