    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCall a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$.For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$.What is the largest 7-10 double?\nExpanding this equation, we get $2N = 2a_n \\cdot 7^n + 2a_{n-1} \\cdot 7^{n-1} + \\ldots + 2a_1 \\cdot 7 + 2a_0$. Now, we can express this equation as $2N = b_kb_{k-1}\\ldots b_1b_0$, where in base 7, the number $2N$ is represented as $b_kb_{k-1}\\ldots b_1b_0$, and $b_i = 2a_i$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\nTo show that a number is a 7-10 double, notice that in the base $7$ representation of that number, the digits only use digits from $0$ to $6$. Therefore, when we multiply it by $2$ in base $7$, we should not have carries to the next digits. We can now generate a method to check if a given number is a 7-10 double.",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing out the first few powers of 7 and their multiples by 2 in base 7:\n$7^0$ = 1, 2\n$7^1$ = 7, 14\n$7^2$ = 49, 104\n\nWe notice that for a 7-10 double to occur, the last digit of $2N$ must be either 0 or 4. This is because when multiplying by 2 in base 7, the only way to get a carry is when the digit is 4 or higher.\n\nLet's now work backwards to find the largest 7-10 double. Starting with the last digit being 4, we can see if any previous digits cause a carry. This process can be continued until the largest 7-10 double is found.",
