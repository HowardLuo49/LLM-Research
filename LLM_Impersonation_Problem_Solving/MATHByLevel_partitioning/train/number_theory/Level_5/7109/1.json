    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor some positive integer $n$, the number $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, including $1$ and the number $110n^3$.How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?\nWe start by prime factorizing $110 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 11$.\nHence, $110n^3$ can be written as $2 \\times 5 \\times 11 \\times n^3$.\nThe formula for the number of factors a number has given its prime factorization is $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)...$ where $a, b, c, ...$ are the exponents of the prime factors.\nSince $110n^3$ has $110$ factors, we can set up the equation $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(3+1) = 110$ using the prime factorization discovered earlier.",
    "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Expanding the equation gives $(2)(2)(2)(4) = 32$ as the total number of factors of $110n^3$.\nSince we have an error in the number of factors we calculated for $110n^3$, we need to correct that mistake.\nWe can do this by finding the prime factorization of $110n^3$ again to determine the correct number of factors.\nLet's recount the factors of $110n^3$ by prime factorizing $110n^3$ correctly and plugging it back into the formula for the number of factors to ensure accuracy.",
