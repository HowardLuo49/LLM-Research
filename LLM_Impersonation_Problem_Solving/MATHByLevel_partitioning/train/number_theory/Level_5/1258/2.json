    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSquare each integer $n$ in the range $1\\le n\\le 10$ and find the remainders when the squares are divided by $11$.Add up all the distinct results and call it $m$.What is the quotient when $m$ is divided by $11$?\nLooking at the remainders obtained when squaring the numbers $1$ to $10$ and dividing by $11$, we notice that the remainders are repeating - specifically, $1, 4, 9, 5, 3$, which then repeat again. This suggests a pattern in the remainders. Let's verify this pattern by squaring the remaining numbers exceeding $10$ to see if the pattern holds. For example, calculate $11^2$, $12^2$, and so on, and determine if the remainders follow the established pattern.",
    "solution": "First notice that $(11-n)^2=11^2-2\\cdot 11+n^2\\equiv n^2\\pmod{11}$, and since we're asked to find distinct results, we only need to compute the squares of $n=1,2,3,4,5$. Respectively, $n^2\\equiv 1,4,9,5,3\\pmod{11}$. Thus, $1+4+9+5+3=22=11\\cdot\\boxed{2}$.",
