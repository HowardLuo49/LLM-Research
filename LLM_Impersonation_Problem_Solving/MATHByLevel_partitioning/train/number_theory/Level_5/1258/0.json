You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSquare each integer $n$ in the range $1\\le n\\le 10$ and find the remainders when the squares are divided by $11$.\n",
    "solution": "First notice that $(11-n)^2=11^2-2\\cdot 11+n^2\\equiv n^2\\pmod{11}$, and since we're asked to find distinct results, we only need to compute the squares of $n=1,2,3,4,5$. Respectively, $n^2\\equiv 1,4,9,5,3\\pmod{11}$. Thus, $1+4+9+5+3=22=11\\cdot\\boxed{2}$.",
