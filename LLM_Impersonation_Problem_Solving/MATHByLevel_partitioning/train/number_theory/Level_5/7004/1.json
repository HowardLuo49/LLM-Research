The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAssume that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers such that $a^5 = b^4$, $c^3 = d^2$, and $c - a = 19$.Determine $d - b$.\nGiven $a^5 = b^4$, we can rewrite this as $a = b^{\\frac{4}{5}}$.\nSince $c^3 = d^2$, we can rewrite this as $c = d^{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nGiven $c - a = 19$, we can substitute our expressions for $a$ and $c$ into this equation.",
    "solution": "It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\\boxed{757}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We substitute our expressions for $a$ and $c$ into the equation $c - a = 19$ to get $d^{\\frac{2}{3}} - b^{\\frac{4}{5}} = 19$. \nTo make it easier to solve, we can raise both sides of the equation to the least common multiple of $3$ and $5$, which is $15$. \nThis gives us ${(d^{\\frac{2}{3}} - b^{\\frac{4}{5}})}^{15} = 19^{15}$.\nNow, we can expand the left side of the equation using the binomial theorem to get a polynomial in $d$ and $b$.",
