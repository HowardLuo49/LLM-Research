    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe formula for converting a Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to the corresponding Celsius temperature $C$ is $C = \\frac{5}{9}(F-32).$ An integer Fahrenheit temperature is converted to Celsius, rounded to the nearest integer, converted back to Fahrenheit, and again rounded to the nearest integer.For how many integer Fahrenheit temperatures between 32 and 1000 inclusive does the original temperature equal the final temperature?\nGiven an integer Fahrenheit temperature $F$, we want to find the result of this process.\nLet's start by converting the Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to Celsius using the formula $C = \\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$.\nSince we are rounding the Celsius temperature to the nearest integer, we need to consider the cases when the decimal part is greater than or equal to $0.5$ and less than $0.5$.\nNext, we convert this rounded Celsius temperature back to Fahrenheit using $F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$.\nFinally, round the Fahrenheit temperature to the nearest integer to get the result of the process for a given Fahrenheit temperature $F$.",
    "solution": "Examine $F - 32$ modulo 9.\nIf $F - 32 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x = F - 32$. This shows that $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = 9x + 32$. This case works.\nIf $F - 32 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x + 1 = F - 32$. This shows that $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x + 1) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow$$F = \\left[9x + \\frac{9}{5}+ 32 \\right] \\Longrightarrow F = 9x + 34$. So this case doesn't work.\nGeneralizing this, we define that $9x + k = F - 32$. Thus, $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(9x + k)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x + \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k\\right]) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5} \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k \\right] \\right] + 9x + 32$. We need to find all values $0 \\le k \\le 8$ that $\\left[ \\frac{9}{5} \\left[ \\frac{5}{9} k \\right] \\right] = k$. Testing every value of $k$ shows that $k = 0, 2, 4, 5, 7$, so $5$ of every $9$ values of $k$ work.\nThere are $\\lfloor \\frac{1000 - 32}{9} \\rfloor = 107$ cycles of $9$, giving $5 \\cdot 107 = 535$ numbers that work. Of the remaining $6$ numbers from $995$ onwards, $995,\\ 997,\\ 999,\\ 1000$ work, giving us $535 + 4 = \\boxed{539}$ as the solution.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of integer Fahrenheit temperatures between 32 and 1000 inclusive such that the original temperature equals the final temperature after the described process, we need to check for each Fahrenheit temperature if it remains the same after the process.\n\nLet's consider the given process. We start with an integer Fahrenheit temperature $F$ and convert it to Celsius using the formula $C = \\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$. Rounding $C$ to the nearest integer, we get $C_{rounded}$.\n\nNext, we convert $C_{rounded}$ back to Fahrenheit using $F = \\frac{9}{5}C_{rounded} + 32$, and round this value to the nearest integer to get $F_{final}$.\n\nTo check if $F$ is equal to $F_{final}$, we can substitute $C = C_{rounded}$ in the formula $F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$ and then round the result to the nearest integer.\n\nTherefore, to find the integers $F$ between 32 and 1000 inclusive that satisfy the condition $F = F_{final}$, we need to iterate over all integer values of $F$ in this range and count the ones that meet this condition.
