    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe formula for converting a Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to the corresponding Celsius temperature $C$ is $C = \\frac{5}{9}(F-32).$ An integer Fahrenheit temperature is converted to Celsius, rounded to the nearest integer, converted back to Fahrenheit, and again rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
    "solution": "Examine $F - 32$ modulo 9.\nIf $F - 32 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x = F - 32$. This shows that $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = 9x + 32$. This case works.\nIf $F - 32 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$, then we can define $9x + 1 = F - 32$. This shows that $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x + 1) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow$$F = \\left[9x + \\frac{9}{5}+ 32 \\right] \\Longrightarrow F = 9x + 34$. So this case doesn't work.\nGeneralizing this, we define that $9x + k = F - 32$. Thus, $F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}\\left[\\frac{5}{9}(9x + k)\\right] + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5}(5x + \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k\\right]) + 32\\right] \\Longrightarrow F = \\left[\\frac{9}{5} \\left[\\frac{5}{9}k \\right] \\right] + 9x + 32$. We need to find all values $0 \\le k \\le 8$ that $\\left[ \\frac{9}{5} \\left[ \\frac{5}{9} k \\right] \\right] = k$. Testing every value of $k$ shows that $k = 0, 2, 4, 5, 7$, so $5$ of every $9$ values of $k$ work.\nThere are $\\lfloor \\frac{1000 - 32}{9} \\rfloor = 107$ cycles of $9$, giving $5 \\cdot 107 = 535$ numbers that work. Of the remaining $6$ numbers from $995$ onwards, $995,\\ 997,\\ 999,\\ 1000$ work, giving us $535 + 4 = \\boxed{539}$ as the solution.",
    "gpt_response": "Given an integer Fahrenheit temperature $F$, we want to find the result of this process.\nLet's start by converting the Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to Celsius using the formula $C = \\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$.\nSince we are rounding the Celsius temperature to the nearest integer, we need to consider the cases when the decimal part is greater than or equal to $0.5$ and less than $0.5$.\nNext, we convert this rounded Celsius temperature back to Fahrenheit using $F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$.\nFinally, round the Fahrenheit temperature to the nearest integer to get the result of the process for a given Fahrenheit temperature $F$.",
