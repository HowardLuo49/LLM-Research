You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAn eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer.\n",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that an eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer, let's denote the four-digit integer as $abcd$ where $a,b,c,d$ are digits.\n\nLet $n$ be the eight-digit integer formed by repeating the four-digit integer, so we can express $n$ as $abcdabcd$.\n\nTo find the relationship between the four-digit integer and the eight-digit integer, we can express $n$ in terms of $a,b,c,d$ and manipulate it to derive a condition for $a,b,c,d$. \n\nLet's begin by expressing $n$ as $1000(1000a+b) + 1000c+d$.",
