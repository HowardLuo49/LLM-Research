The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThere are positive integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations\\begin{align*} \\log_{10} x + 2 \\log_{10} (\\text{gcd}(x,y)) &= 60\\\\ \\log_{10} y + 2 \\log_{10} (\\text{lcm}(x,y)) &= 570.\\end{align*}Let $m$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $x$, and let $n$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $y$.Find $3m+2n$.\nThis gives us the equation $x\\cdot \\left(\\frac{xy}{\\text{lcm}(x,y)}\\right)^2 = 10^{60}$, which simplifies to $x^3 y^2 = 10^{60}\\text{lcm}(x,y)$.",
    "solution": "Add the two equations to get that $\\log x+\\log y+2(\\log(\\gcd(x,y))+\\log(\\text{lcm}(x,y)))=630$. Then, we use the theorem $\\log a+\\log b=\\log ab$ to get the equation, $\\log (xy)+2(\\log(\\gcd(x,y))+\\log(\\text{lcm}(x,y)))=630$. Using the theorem that $\\gcd(x,y) \\cdot \\text{lcm}(x,y)=x\\cdot y$, along with the previously mentioned theorem, we can get the equation $3\\log(xy)=630$. This can easily be simplified to $\\log(xy)=210$, or $xy = 10^{210}$.\n$10^{210}$ can be factored into $2^{210} \\cdot 5^{210}$, and $m+n$ equals to the sum of the exponents of $2$ and $5$, which is $210+210 = 420$. Multiply by two to get $2m +2n$, which is $840$. Then, use the first equation ($\\log x + 2\\log(\\gcd(x,y)) = 60$) to show that $x$ has to have lower degrees of $2$ and $5$ than $y$ (you can also test when $x>y$, which is a contradiction to the restrains you set before). Therefore, $\\gcd(x,y)=x$. Then, turn the equation into $3\\log x = 60$, which yields $\\log x = 20$, or $x = 10^{20}$. Factor this into $2^{20} \\cdot 5^{20}$, and add the two 20's, resulting in $m$, which is $40$. Add $m$ to $2m + 2n$ (which is $840$) to get $40+840 = \\boxed{880}$.",

Thus, this simplifies to $Z = 10^{285/2} = 10^{142.5}$. Counting the prime factors gives $142.5$. Therefore, $3m+2n = \\boxed{427}$.",
