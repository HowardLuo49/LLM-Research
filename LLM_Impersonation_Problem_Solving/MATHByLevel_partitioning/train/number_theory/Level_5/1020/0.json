    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSuppose $a$ is an integer such that $0 \\le a \\le 14$, and $235935623_{74}-a$ is a multiple of $15$.\n",
    "solution": "Note that $235935623_{74}=3+2(74)+6(74)^2+5(74)^3+3(74)^4+9(74)^5+5(74)^6$ $+3(74)^7+2(74)^8$. But $74 \\equiv -1 \\mod{15}$, so this is just $3-2+6-5+3-9+5-3+2=0 \\mod{15}$, so $a=\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $235935623_{74}-a$ is a multiple of $15$, we know that $235935623_{74} \\equiv a \\pmod{15}$. Since $235935623_{74} = 2 \\times 74^8 + 3 \\times 74^7 + 5 \\times 74^6 + 9 \\times 74^5 + 3 \\times 74^4 + 5 \\times 74^3 + 6 \\times 74^2 + 2 \\times 74 + 3$, we can calculate this value modulo 15. First, convert $235935623_{74}$ to base 10 to simplify the calculation.",
