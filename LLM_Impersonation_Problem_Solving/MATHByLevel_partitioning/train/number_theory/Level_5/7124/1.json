    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2+12n-2007$ is a perfect square.Find the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000.$\nGiven the quadratic $n^2 + 12n - 2007$, we complete the square to get $(n+6)^2 - 2007 - 36 = (n+6)^2 - 2043$. \n\nNext, we set $(n+6)^2 - 2043 = m^2$ where $m$ is an integer and try to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's express $(n+6)^2 - 2043$ as $(n+6)^2 - (m)^2$ and factor it using the difference of squares formula. \n\nThen, we get $(n+6+m)(n+6-m) = 2043$. \n\nNow, we can use the prime factorization of $2043$, which is $3 \\times 3 \\times 227$, to find the possible values of $(n+6+m)$ and $(n+6-m)$.",
    "solution": "If $n^2 + 12n - 2007 = m^2$, we can complete the square on the left-hand side to get $n^2 + 12n + 36 = m^2 + 2043$ so $(n+6)^2 = m^2 + 2043$. Subtracting $m^2$ and factoring the left-hand side, we get $(n + m + 6)(n - m + 6) = 2043$. $2043 = 3^2 \\cdot 227$, which can be split into two factors in 3 ways, $2043 \\cdot 1 = 3 \\cdot 681 = 227 \\cdot 9$. This gives us three pairs of equations to solve for $n$:\n$n + m + 6 = 2043$ and $n - m + 6 = 1$ give $2n + 12 = 2044$ and $n = 1016$.\n$n + m + 6 = 681$ and $n - m + 6 = 3$ give $2n + 12 = 684$ and $n = 336$.\n$n + m + 6 = 227$ and $n - m + 6 = 9$ give $2n + 12 = 236$ and $n = 112$.\nFinally, $1016 + 336 + 112 = 1464$, so the answer is $\\boxed{464}$.",
