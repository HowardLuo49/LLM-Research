You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2+12n-2007$ is a perfect square.\n",
    "solution": "If $n^2 + 12n - 2007 = m^2$, we can complete the square on the left-hand side to get $n^2 + 12n + 36 = m^2 + 2043$ so $(n+6)^2 = m^2 + 2043$. Subtracting $m^2$ and factoring the left-hand side, we get $(n + m + 6)(n - m + 6) = 2043$. $2043 = 3^2 \\cdot 227$, which can be split into two factors in 3 ways, $2043 \\cdot 1 = 3 \\cdot 681 = 227 \\cdot 9$. This gives us three pairs of equations to solve for $n$:\n$n + m + 6 = 2043$ and $n - m + 6 = 1$ give $2n + 12 = 2044$ and $n = 1016$.\n$n + m + 6 = 681$ and $n - m + 6 = 3$ give $2n + 12 = 684$ and $n = 336$.\n$n + m + 6 = 227$ and $n - m + 6 = 9$ give $2n + 12 = 236$ and $n = 112$.\nFinally, $1016 + 336 + 112 = 1464$, so the answer is $\\boxed{464}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the quadratic $n^2 + 12n - 2007$, we complete the square to get $(n+6)^2 - 2007 - 36 = (n+6)^2 - 2043$. \n\nNext, we set $(n+6)^2 - 2043 = m^2$ where $m$ is an integer and try to simplify the expression.\n\nLet's express $(n+6)^2 - 2043$ as $(n+6)^2 - (m)^2$ and factor it using the difference of squares formula. \n\nThen, we get $(n+6+m)(n+6-m) = 2043$. \n\nNow, we can use the prime factorization of $2043$, which is $3 \\times 3 \\times 227$, to find the possible values of $(n+6+m)$ and $(n+6-m)$.",
