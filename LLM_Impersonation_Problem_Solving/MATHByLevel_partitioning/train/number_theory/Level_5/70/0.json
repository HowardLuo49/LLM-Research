You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $f(n)$ be the sum of the positive integer divisors of $n$.\n",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $f(n) = n+1$. If $n+1$ is prime, then $n$ must be even. Therefore, the only prime value of $n$ for which $n+1$ is prime is $n = 2$. If $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and an integer $a > 1$, then $f(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$. This value is not guaranteed to be composite, so we must check all powers of primes. Checking powers of $2$ first, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and $f(16) = 31$. Two of these powers of 2 work. Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works. Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works. Finally, if $n$ is any other composite integer, it can be written as the product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Since $n \\le 25$, $n$ cannot be the product of three distinct primes, so $n = p^aq^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$. As a result, $f(n) = \\left(\\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{q^{b+1}-1}{q-1}\\right)$, but then $f(n)$ is the product of two integers which are greater than $1$, so $f(n)$ is composite. Therefore, there are $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{5}$ values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ is prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Based on what we know so far, let's calculate some values of $f(n)$ for small values of $n$ to see if we can find any patterns or insights to help us solve the problem. Let's start with $n=1$ and work our way up from there. \n\n$f(1) = 1$\n\nFor $n=2$, the divisors are 1 and 2, so $f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFor $n=3$, the divisors are 1 and 3, so $f(3) = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nFor $n=4$, the divisors are 1, 2, and 4, so $f(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7$.\n\nFor $n=5$, the divisors are 1 and 5, so $f(5) = 1 + 5 = 6$.\n\nBased on these calculations, we can see that $f(n) = \\sigma(n)$. \n\nNext step: Try to prove that $f(n) = \\sigma(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.",
