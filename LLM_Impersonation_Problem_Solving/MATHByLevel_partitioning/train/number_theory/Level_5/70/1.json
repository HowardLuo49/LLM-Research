The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $f(n)$ be the sum of the positive integer divisors of $n$.For how many values of $n$, where $1 \\le n \\le 25$, is $f(n)$ prime?\nBased on what we know so far, let's calculate some values of $f(n)$ for small values of $n$ to see if we can find any patterns or insights to help us solve the problem. Let's start with $n=1$ and work our way up from there. \n\n$f(1) = 1$\n\nFor $n=2$, the divisors are 1 and 2, so $f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFor $n=3$, the divisors are 1 and 3, so $f(3) = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nFor $n=4$, the divisors are 1, 2, and 4, so $f(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7$.\n\nFor $n=5$, the divisors are 1 and 5, so $f(5) = 1 + 5 = 6$.\n\nBased on these calculations, we can see that $f(n) = \\sigma(n)$. \n\nNext step: Try to prove that $f(n) = \\sigma(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $f(n) = n+1$. If $n+1$ is prime, then $n$ must be even. Therefore, the only prime value of $n$ for which $n+1$ is prime is $n = 2$. If $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and an integer $a > 1$, then $f(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$. This value is not guaranteed to be composite, so we must check all powers of primes. Checking powers of $2$ first, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and $f(16) = 31$. Two of these powers of 2 work. Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works. Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works. Finally, if $n$ is any other composite integer, it can be written as the product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Since $n \\le 25$, $n$ cannot be the product of three distinct primes, so $n = p^aq^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$. As a result, $f(n) = \\left(\\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{q^{b+1}-1}{q-1}\\right)$, but then $f(n)$ is the product of two integers which are greater than $1$, so $f(n)$ is composite. Therefore, there are $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{5}$ values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ is prime.",
