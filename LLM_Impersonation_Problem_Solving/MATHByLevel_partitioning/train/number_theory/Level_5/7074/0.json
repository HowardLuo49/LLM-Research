    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTen identical crates each of dimensions $3\\mathrm{ft}\\times 4\\mathrm{ft}\\times 6\\mathrm{ft}$.\n",
    "solution": "Only the heights matter, and each crate is either 3, 4, or 6 feet tall with equal probability. We have the following:\n\\begin{align*}3a + 4b + 6c &= 41\\\\ a + b + c &= 10\\end{align*}\nSubtracting 3 times the second from the first gives $b + 3c = 11$, or $(b,c) = (2,3),(5,2),(8,1),(11,0)$. The last doesn't work, obviously. This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$. In terms of choosing which goes where, the first two solutions are analogous.\nFor $(5,2,3),(3,5,2)$, we see that there are $2\\cdot\\dfrac{10!}{5!2!3!} = 10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7$ ways to stack the crates. For $(1,8,1)$, there are $2\\dbinom{10}{2} = 90$. Also, there are $3^{10}$ total ways to stack the crates to any height.\nThus, our probability is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 90}{3^{10}} = \\dfrac{10\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 10}{3^{8}} = \\dfrac{570}{3^8} = \\dfrac{190}{3^{7}}$. Our answer is the numerator, $\\boxed{190}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by calculating the volume of one crate: $3 \\text{ ft} \\times 4 \\text{ ft} \\times 6 \\text{ ft} = 72 \\text{ cubic ft}$.\nNext, we need to find the total volume of all ten crates: $72 \\text{ cubic ft} \\times 10 = 720 \\text{ cubic ft}$.\nTo find the side length of a cube with the same volume as the total volume of the ten crates, we take the cube root of 720: $\\sqrt[3]{720} \\approx 8.66 \\text{ ft}$.\nNow, we need to find the number of smaller cubes that can be formed by dividing the large cube into unit cubes. We know the side length of the large cube is 8.66 ft, so we calculate $8.66^3 \\approx 658$ smaller unit cubes can be formed.",
