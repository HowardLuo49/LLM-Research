    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.\n",
    "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, let's find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square.\nTo do this, we need to find the smallest square number that is a multiple of 20.\nThe multiples of 20 are 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and so on.\nThe first perfect square among these multiples is 400, which is 20 squared.\nTherefore, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square is 400.\nNow, let's find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube.\nTo do this, we need to find the smallest cube number that is a multiple of 20.\nThe multiples of 20 are 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and so on.\nThe cube numbers among these multiples are 8000 (20 cubed) and 27000 (30 cubed).\nTherefore, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube is 8000.\nNow we have the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square (400) and the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube (8000).\nLet's list all the multiples of 20 between 400 and 8000 and see how many there are.",
