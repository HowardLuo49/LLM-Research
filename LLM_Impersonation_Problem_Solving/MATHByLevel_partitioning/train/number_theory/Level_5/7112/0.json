    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor $k > 0$, let $I_k = 10\\ldots 064$, where there are $k$ zeros between the $1$ and the $6$.\n",
    "solution": "The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.\nFor $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \\left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \\right)$. The first value in the parentheses is odd, the second one is even, hence their sum is odd and we have $N(k)=k+2\\leq 5$.\nFor $k>4$ we have $I_k=2^6 \\left( 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k-4} + 1 \\right)$. For $k>4$ the value in the parentheses is odd, hence $N(k)=6$.\nThis leaves the case $k=4$. We have $I_4 = 2^6 \\left( 5^6 + 1 \\right)$. The value $5^6 + 1$ is obviously even. And as $5\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and therefore $5^6 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the expression for $I_k$, we can rewrite it as $10^{k+2} + 64$. \n\nWe can rewrite $10^{k+2} + 64$ as $2^6 + 10^{k+2}$. \n\nThe problem is to determine if $2^6 + 10^{k+2}$ is a perfect square for any positive integer value of $k$.\n\nTo make progress on this, we should consider the properties of perfect squares and explore the relationship between $2^6$ and $10^{k+2}$. \n\nLet's start by investigating the possible values of $k$ that could lead to $2^6 + 10^{k+2}$ being a perfect square.",
