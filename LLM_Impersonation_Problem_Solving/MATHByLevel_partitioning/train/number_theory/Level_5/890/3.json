    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA book has 136 pages.Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it.The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203.How many words are on each page?\nLet's denote the number of words on a page as x. Given that each page has no more than 100 words, we have x <= 100. Since each page has 8, 16, 24, ... words on it, x could equal 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96 or 100.\n\nTo find the possible values for x using the congruency condition x * 136 \u2261 184 (mod 203), we can calculate x * 136 mod 203 and find the values that are congruent to 184. Let's calculate that next.",
    "solution": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it.",
