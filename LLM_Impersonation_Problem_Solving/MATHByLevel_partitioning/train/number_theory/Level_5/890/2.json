    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA book has 136 pages.Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it.The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203.\nNext, we can assume that the number of words on each page is a multiple of the highest power of 2 in the prime factorization of 136, which is 2^3. This means that each page has 8, 16, 24, ... words on it. \n\nWe also know that the total number of words in the book is equal to the product of the number of pages and the number of words per page. Let P be the number of pages and W be the number of words per page, then P * W = 136 * W.",
    "solution": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of words on a page as x. Given that each page has no more than 100 words, we have x <= 100. Since each page has 8, 16, 24, ... words on it, x could equal 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96 or 100.\n\nTo find the possible values for x using the congruency condition x * 136 \u2261 184 (mod 203), we can calculate x * 136 mod 203 and find the values that are congruent to 184. Let's calculate that next.",
