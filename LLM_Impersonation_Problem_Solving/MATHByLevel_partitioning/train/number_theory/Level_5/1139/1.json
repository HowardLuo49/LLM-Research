You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTom's graduating class has 288 students.At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row.\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 288.\n288 = 2^5 * 3^2. \n\nNext, let's find the total number of factors of 288.\nTo find the total number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and then multiply the results.\n(5+1) * (2+1) = 6 * 3 = 18\n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of 288 is 18.",
    "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Next, we need to determine how many different ways we can distribute these 288 students into an equal number of students in each row.",
