    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTom's graduating class has 288 students.At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row.If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row.What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?\nTo determine how many students can be in each row, we need to find the factors of 288.\nThe prime factorization of 288 is $2^5 \\times 3^2$. \nThis means the total number of factors of 288 is $(5+1)(2+1) = 18$.\nNow, we need to find the factors of 288 that are greater than or equal to 15, as this is the minimum number of students in each row.",
    "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.",

    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 58?: The factors of 288 that are greater than or equal to 15 are 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, 36, 48, 54, 64, 72, 96, 108, 144, and 288.\nThe sum of all these possible values of x is 882.",
