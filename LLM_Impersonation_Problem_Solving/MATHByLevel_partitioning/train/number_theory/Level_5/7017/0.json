You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $T = \\{9^k : k ~ \\mbox{is an integer}, 0 \\le k \\le 4000\\}$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the numbers in set $T$ are of the form $9^k$, we can start by looking at the pattern of the last digit of powers of $9$. \nThe last digit of $9^1$ is 9, the last digit of $9^2$ is 1, the last digit of $9^3$ is 9, and so on. \nThis pattern repeats every 2 powers of 9, which means we can predict the last digit of any power of 9. \nKnowing this, we can focus on finding a pattern in the last digits of numbers in set $T$.",
