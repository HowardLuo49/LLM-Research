The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions.If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over.The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over.Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\nCalculating (8!)^4:\n\n(8!)^4 = (40320)^4\n(8!)^4 = 66,210,816,000\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible formations for the marching band with 40 members in a square formation with 8 members on each side is 66,210,816,000. Now, we need to compare this with 40! to see if there was a mistake in the calculations. Let's calculate 40!.",
    "solution": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.",
