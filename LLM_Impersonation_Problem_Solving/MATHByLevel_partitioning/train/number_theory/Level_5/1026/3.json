    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004.That Wednesday was the first day of her life.Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life.On which day of the week was the party?\nSubstitute q = 1, m = 14, K = 4, J = 20 (since 2000 is in the 20th century) into Zeller's Congruence formula:\n\\(h = (1 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{13(14+1)}{5}\\right\\rfloor + 4 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{4}{4}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{20}{4}\\right\\rfloor - 2 \\times 20) \\mod 7\\)\n\nSimplify and solve for h to find the day of the week when Lucy was born. Provide this information for the next person to continue.",
    "solution": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "After substituting the values into the formula and simplifying, we get:\n\\(h = (1 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{13 \\times 15}{5}\\right\\rfloor + 4 + 1 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = (1 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{195}{5}\\right\\rfloor + 4 + 1 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = (1 + 39 + 4 + 1 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = 10 \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = 3\\)\n\nTherefore, Lucy was born on a Wednesday (h=3). Let the next person continue from here.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response \\text{Monday?: After substituting the values into the formula and simplifying, we get:\n\\(h = (1 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{13 \\times 15}{5}\\right\\rfloor + 4 + 1 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = (1 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{195}{5}\\right\\rfloor + 4 + 1 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = (1 + 39 + 4 + 1 + 5 - 40) \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = 10 \\mod 7\\)\n\\(h = 3\\)\n\nTherefore, Lucy was born on a Wednesday (h=3).
