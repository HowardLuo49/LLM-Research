    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004.That Wednesday was the first day of her life.Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life.\nZeller's Congruence formula is \\(h = (q + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{13(m+1)}{5}\\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{K}{4}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{J}{4}\\right\\rfloor - 2J) \\mod 7\\), where:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month (1 to 31)\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 12 = December; January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year)\n- K is the year of the century (year % 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (year / 100)\n\nLet's substitute the values for December 1, 2004 into Zeller's Congruence formula and calculate the day of the week when Lucy was born.",
    "solution": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Substitute q = 1, m = 14, K = 4, J = 20 (since 2000 is in the 20th century) into Zeller's Congruence formula:\n\\(h = (1 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{13(14+1)}{5}\\right\\rfloor + 4 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{4}{4}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{20}{4}\\right\\rfloor - 2 \\times 20) \\mod 7\\)\n\nSimplify and solve for h to find the day of the week when Lucy was born. Provide this information for the next person to continue.",
