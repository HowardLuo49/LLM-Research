The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA $150\\times 324\\times 375$ rectangular solid is made by gluing together $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes.An internal diagonal of this solid passes through the interiors of how many of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes?\nGiven the dimensions of the rectangular solid, we can find the total number of cubes used by multiplying 150, 324, and 375. This would give us: $150 \\times 324 \\times 375 = 18,450,000$ cubes used. \n\nTo find the total number of cubes on the surface of the rectangular solid, we can calculate the number of cubes on the front face, top face, and side face, then sum them up. \n\nFront face: $150 \\times 324 = 48,600$ cubes\nTop face: $150 \\times 375 = 56,250$ cubes\nSide face: $324 \\times 375 = 121,500$ cubes\n\nAdding all three faces together would give us the total number of cubes on the surface area of the rectangular solid.",
    "solution": "Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$. The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ respectively. We proceed by using PIE.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\\frac{d}{324}$. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324)$ times. Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\\gcd(375, 150)$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ are equal. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.\nThe total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\\gcd(150, 324)+\\gcd(324, 375)+\\gcd(375, 150))] + \\gcd(150, 324, 375) = \\boxed{768}$",
