    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ be the integer such that $0 \\le n < 31$ and $3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.What is $\\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31}$?\nGiven that $3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$, we know that $n$ is the modular multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{31}$. To find the modular multiplicative inverse, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Let's calculate it to find $n$.",
    "solution": "Since $21 \\cdot 3 = 63 = 2 \\cdot 31 + 1$, it follows that $21$ is the modular inverse of $3$, modulo $31$. Thus, $2^n \\equiv 2^{21} \\pmod{31}$. After computing some powers of $2$, we notice that $2^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$, so $2^{21} \\equiv 2 \\cdot \\left(2^{5}\\right)^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}$. Thus, $\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}$, and $$\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{31}$$Notice that this problem implies that $\\left(a^{3^{-1}}\\right)^3 \\not\\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ in general, so that certain properties of modular inverses do not extend to exponentiation (for that, one needs to turn to Fermat's Little Theorem or other related theorems).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular multiplicative inverse of $3 \\pmod{31}$, we need to apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the coefficients $a$ and $b$ such that $3a + 31b = 1$. Let's start this computation now.",
