    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSuppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes.\n",
    "solution": "The prime factors of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both). The prime factors of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nThus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$. So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Given $7$ distinct primes dividing $\\gcd(a,b)$ and $28$ distinct primes dividing $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, we can write the prime factorization of $\\gcd(a,b)$ as $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\ldots p_7^{e_7}$ and the prime factorization of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ as $q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\ldots q_{28}^{f_{28}}$.\n\nTo find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the given conditions, we need to determine the relationship between $a$ and $b$ based on their greatest common divisor and least common multiple. \n\nOne approach to solve this problem is to use the formula $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = a \\cdot b$ and the fact that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\ldots p_7^{e_7}q_1^{f_1}q_2^{f_2}\\ldots q_{28}^{f_{28}}$. \n\nTo proceed, let's express $a$ and $b$ in terms of their prime factorization using the given prime factors and exponents of $\\gcd(a,b)$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$.\n\n(After solving the steps you provided, the next person will likely need to analyze the relationships between the prime factorizations of $a$ and $b$ to determine the possible values that satisfy the conditions.)",
