The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be the set of integers between $1$ and $2^{40}$ whose binary expansions have exactly two $1$'s.If a number is chosen at random from $S,$ the probability that it is divisible by $9$ is $p/q,$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.Find $p+q.$\nThe total number of integers in the set $S$ is calculated as $\\binom{40}{2} \\times 2^{38} = 780 \\times 2^{38}$. \nLet's find all the integers in set $S$, then check how many of them are divisible by 9. \nWe will divide the total number of integers in $S$ by the number of integers that are divisible by 9 to find the probability. \nIf you can proceed, calculate the number of integers in set $S$ that are divisible by 9 and then determine the probability.",
    "solution": "A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \\neq k$ nonnegative integers. Thus, the set $S$ is equal to the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n = 2^j + 2^k \\,\\mathrm{ and }\\, 0 \\leq j < k \\leq 39\\}$. (The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \\neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.\nNow, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \\equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \\equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \\equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\nIt's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like. If one is of the form $6n$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 3$ (7 choices). If one is of the form $6n + 1$ (7 choices) the other must be of the form $6n + 4$ (6 choices). And if one is of the form $6n + 2$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 5$ (6 choices). This means that there are $7\\cdot 7 + 7\\cdot 6 + 7\\cdot 6 = 49 + 42 +42 = 133$ total \"good\" numbers.\nThe probability is $\\frac{133}{780}$, and the answer is $133 + 780 = \\boxed{913}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of integers in set $S$ that are divisible by 9, we need to understand what values the two $1$'s in the binary expansion can take. Since we are dealing with binary numbers, the two $1$'s can be positioned in $40$ ways (choosing $2$ positions out of $40$). This gives us $\\binom{40}{2}$ combinations. The two $1$'s can be adjacent to each other or separated by $0's$. \n\nFor a binary number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $9$.\nConsidering the binary number, every time we read a $1$, we add $1$ to the sum. In this case, since there are only $2$ $1$'s, the sum of the binary number is either $2$, $4$, $8$, ..., $20$. Only the sum $18$ is divisible by $9$. So, any binary number with exactly two $1$'s that sums to $18$ or $9+9$ when converted to decimal will be divisible by $9$.\n\nTo get a sum of $18$, we need a $1$ followed by $17$ $0$'s or a $1$ followed by $1$ separated by $17$ $0$'s.
