    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCindy wishes to arrange her coins into $X$ piles, each consisting of the same number of coins, $Y$.Each pile will have more than one coin and no pile will have all the coins.If there are 13 possible values for $Y$ given all of the restrictions, what is the smallest number of coins she could have?\nWe know that $X \\cdot Y = 60$, so substituting $X = Y$ into this equation gives us $Y^2 = 60$.\nSolving this equation, we find that $Y = \\pm \\sqrt{60}$, which is not a valid solution since the number of coins in each pile, $Y$, must be a positive integer.\nTherefore, the previous calculations and approach were incorrect, let's try a different method.\n\nPlan for the next person:\n1. Let's consider factors of 60 in order to find possible values for the number of coins in each pile and the number of piles.\n2. After listing out the factors of 60, determine the pairs of factors that satisfy the conditions of the problem.\n3. From these pairs of factors, identify the values that correspond to the number of piles, X, and the number of coins in each pile, Y.\n4. Verify that the solutions found indeed fulfill the conditions specified in the problem.",
    "solution": "If Cindy has $n$ coins, then the possible values for $Y$ are the proper factors of $n$ (recall that a proper factor of $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since there are 13 possible values of $Y$, there are $13+2=15$ factors of $n$.  Our goal is to find the least value of $n$ with exactly 15 factors.  Recall that we can determine the number of positive integer factors of $n$ by prime factorizing $n$, adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization, and multiplying the results.  The sets of exponents which would give rise to 15 factors are $\\{14\\}$ and $\\{2,4\\}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has an exponent of 14 is $2^{14}$.  The least positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 2 and 4 is obtained by assigning these exponents in decreasing order to the smallest two primes, which yields $2^4\\cdot 3^2=144$.  The smaller of these two numbers is 144, so Cindy has $\\boxed{144}$ coins.",
