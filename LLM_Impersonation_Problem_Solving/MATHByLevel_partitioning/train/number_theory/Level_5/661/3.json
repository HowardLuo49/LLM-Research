The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTwo farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$.When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary.(For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.)What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?\nLet's first write out the given system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n300p_1 + 210g_1 &= 210 \\tag{1} \\\\\n300p_2 + 210g_2 &= -210 \\tag{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can start by multiplying equation (1) by 2 in order to eliminate $g_1$ when we add it to equation (2). This gives us:\n\\begin{align*}\n600p_1 + 420g_1 &= 420 \\\\\n300p_2 + 210g_2 &= -210\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can add these two equations together to eliminate $g_1$ and solve for $p_2$.",
    "solution": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.",
