    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTwo farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$.When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary.\nLet's define variables to represent the number of pigs and goats each farmer has. Let $p_1$ and $g_1$ be the number of pigs and goats Farmer 1 has, and $p_2$ and $g_2$ be the number of pigs and goats Farmer 2 has.\n\nWe can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:\n\\begin{align*}\n300p_1 + 210g_1 &= 300 \\tag{1} \\\\\n300p_2 + 210g_2 &= 210 \\tag{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNext, we can use the equations to find the values of $p_1$, $g_1$, $p_2$, and $g_2$. This will allow us to determine the specific problem that needs to be solved.",
    "solution": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.",
    "gpt_response": "There seems to be a mistake in the formulation of the system of equations. The second equation should actually be:\n\\begin{align*}\n300p_2 + 210g_2 &= -210 \\tag{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we need to solve the system of equations to find the values of $p_1$, $g_1$, $p_2$, and $g_2$.",
