    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe numbers in the sequence $101$, $104$, $109$, $116$,$\\ldots$ are of the form $a_n=100+n^2$, where $n=1,2,3,\\ldots$ For each $n$, let $d_n$ be the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$.Find the maximum value of $d_n$ as $n$ ranges through the positive integers.\nGiven the form of the numbers in the sequence, we have $a_n = 100 + n^2$. Let's calculate the first few values of $d_n$ to look for a pattern. \n\nFor $n=1$, $a_1 = 100 + 1^2 = 101$ and $a_2 = 100 + 2^2 = 104$. Calculating the greatest common divisor of 101 and 104, we have $d_1 = \\text{gcd}(101, 104) = 1$.\n\nFor $n=2$, $a_2 = 100 + 2^2 = 104$ and $a_3 = 100 + 3^2 = 109$. Calculating the greatest common divisor of 104 and 109, we have $d_2 = \\text{gcd}(104, 109) = 1$. \n\nLet's continue this pattern and observe if there is a relationship between $d_n$ and $n$ that we can use to find a general formula for $d_n$.",
    "solution": "If $(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, then we have $d_n=(a_n,a_{n+1})=(100+n^2,100+n^2+2n+1)$. Now assuming that $d_n$ divides $100+n^2$, it must divide $2n+1$ if it is going to divide the entire expression $100+n^2+2n+1$.\nThus the equation turns into $d_n=(100+n^2,2n+1)$. Now note that since $2n+1$ is odd for integral $n$, we can multiply the left integer, $100+n^2$, by a power of two without affecting the greatest common divisor. Since the $n^2$ term is quite restrictive, let's multiply by $4$ so that we can get a $(2n+1)^2$ in there.\nSo $d_n=(4n^2+400,2n+1)=((2n+1)^2-4n+399,2n+1)=(-4n+399,2n+1)$. It simplified the way we wanted it to! Now using similar techniques we can write $d_n=(-2(2n+1)+401,2n+1)=(401,2n+1)$. Thus $d_n$ must divide $\\boxed{401}$ for every single $n$. This means the largest possible value for $d_n$ is $401$, and we see that it can be achieved when $n = 200$.",
    "gpt_response": "For $n=3$, $a_3 = 100 + 3^2 = 109$ and $a_4 = 100 + 4^2 = 116$. Calculating the greatest common divisor of 109 and 116, we have $d_3 = \\text{gcd}(109, 116) = 1$.\n\nFor $n=4$, $a_4 = 100 + 4^2 = 116$ and $a_5 = 100 + 5^2 = 125$. Calculating the greatest common divisor of 116 and 125, we have $d_4 = \\text{gcd}(116, 125) = 1$.\n\nBased on the values calculated so far, it seems that the greatest common divisor $d_n$ is always $1$ for all positive integers $n$. This is because the consecutive numbers in the sequence $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ are all relatively prime to each other, as the step between consecutive numbers is adding a perfect square. Thus, the maximum value of $d_n$ as $n$ ranges through the positive integers is $\\boxed{1}$.",
