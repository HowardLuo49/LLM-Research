    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x, y <m$.To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence.For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.The graph of $$3x\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}$$has a single $x$-intercept $(x_0,0)$ and a single $y$-intercept $(0,y_0)$, where $0\\le x_0,y_0<35$.What is the value of $x_0+y_0$?\nTo calculate this, we need to consider all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ modulo 4. Since $m=2^r=4$, we have four possible residues for each $x$ and $y$, namely 0, 1, 2, and 3.\nThen we calculate the sum $x+y$ modulo 4 for each pair of residues. This creates all possible congruences of the form $x+y\\equiv k \\pmod 4$.\nThe next step is to list out all these congruences explicitly. By analyzing the list, we can start looking for patterns in the number of points that satisfy each congruence.",
    "solution": "To find the $x$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $y$ and solve $$3x\\equiv 4(0)-1 \\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $12$, we get $$36x \\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$$and thus $x\\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$. Translating this to the interval $0\\le x<35$, we have $x\\equiv 23\\pmod{35}$, so the $x$-intercept on our graph is at $(23,0)$.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $x$ and solve $$3(0)\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}.$$We can rewrite this as $$1\\equiv 4y\\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $9$, we get $$9\\equiv 36y\\pmod{35},$$and thus $y\\equiv 9\\pmod{35}$. So the $y$-intercept is at $(0,9)$.\n\nWe have $x_0+y_0 = 23+9 = \\boxed{32}$.",
