The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA point whose coordinates are both integers is called a lattice point.How many lattice points lie on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$?\nGiven the definition of a lattice point, I will start by considering a point (x, y) where x and y are integers. \n\nNext, I will explore the properties of lattice points in relation to number theory. \n\nI will examine the characteristics of the set of lattice points in the Cartesian plane. \n\nI will investigate any patterns or relationships that exist among the lattice points. \n\nIf there are any errors in the previous work or calculations, I will correct them before moving forward.",
    "solution": "\\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \\cdot 5^6\\]\nNote that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even. We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$. We have $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ left. Since there are $7 \\cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\\cdot2=\\boxed{98}$ lattice points.",
