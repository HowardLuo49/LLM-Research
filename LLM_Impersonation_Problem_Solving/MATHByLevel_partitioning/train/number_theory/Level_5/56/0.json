You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nRecall that a perfect square is the square of some integer.\n",
    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",

Let's start by finding such perfect squares for smaller values.",
