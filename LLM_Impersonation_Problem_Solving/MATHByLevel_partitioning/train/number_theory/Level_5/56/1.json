The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nRecall that a perfect square is the square of some integer.How many perfect squares less than 10,000 can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares?\nGiven:\nLet \\(x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\).\nLet \\(y \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\\).\n\nPlan:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two perfect squares, one of which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, and the other leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. Let's start by finding such perfect squares for smaller values.",
    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",
