The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $d_1 = a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$ and $d_2 = a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$.If $1 \\le a \\le 251$, how many integral values of $a$ are there such that $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of $5$?\nGiven $d_1 = a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$ and $d_2 = a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$, we can see that a pattern emerges if we let $a$ take on different values and observe the resulting values of $d_1$ and $d_2$. \n\nFor example, let's consider $a=1$:\n$d_1 = 1^2 + 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^{(1+1)/2} = 1 + 2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 5$\n$d_2 = 1^2 + 2^1 - 1 \\cdot 2^{(1+1)/2} = 1 + 2 - 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 1$\n\nContinuing this process and observing the patterns may help in finding a solution to the problem.",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}[(a^2 + 2^a) + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}][(a^2 + 2^a) - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}] &= (a^2 + 2^a)^2 - a^2 \\cdot 2^{a+1}\\\\ &= a^4 + 2 \\cdot a^22^{a} + 2^{2a} - a^2 \\cdot 2^{a+1}\\\\ &= a^4 + 2^{2a}\\end{align*}\n(If you recall the reverse of Sophie Germain Identity with $a=a,\\, b = 2^{(a-1)/2}$, then you could have directly found the answer).\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, we have that $a^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ if $a \\nmid 5$ and $a^{4} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ if $a | 5$. Also, we note that by examining a couple of terms, $2^{2a} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ if $a \\nmid 2$ and $2^{2a} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ if $a|2$. Therefore,\\[a^{4} + 2^{2a} \\equiv \\{0,1\\} + \\{1,4\\} \\equiv \\{0,1,2,4\\} \\pmod{5}\\]With divisibility by $5$ achievable only if $a \\nmid 2,5$. There are $\\frac{251-1}{2}+1 = 126$ odd numbers in the range given, and $\\frac{245-5}{10}+1 = 25$ of those are divisible by $5$, so the answer is $126 - 25 = \\boxed{101}$.",
