You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $d_1 = a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$ and $d_2 = a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$.\n",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}[(a^2 + 2^a) + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}][(a^2 + 2^a) - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}] &= (a^2 + 2^a)^2 - a^2 \\cdot 2^{a+1}\\\\ &= a^4 + 2 \\cdot a^22^{a} + 2^{2a} - a^2 \\cdot 2^{a+1}\\\\ &= a^4 + 2^{2a}\\end{align*}\n(If you recall the reverse of Sophie Germain Identity with $a=a,\\, b = 2^{(a-1)/2}$, then you could have directly found the answer).\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, we have that $a^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ if $a \\nmid 5$ and $a^{4} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ if $a | 5$. Also, we note that by examining a couple of terms, $2^{2a} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ if $a \\nmid 2$ and $2^{2a} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ if $a|2$. Therefore,\\[a^{4} + 2^{2a} \\equiv \\{0,1\\} + \\{1,4\\} \\equiv \\{0,1,2,4\\} \\pmod{5}\\]With divisibility by $5$ achievable only if $a \\nmid 2,5$. There are $\\frac{251-1}{2}+1 = 126$ odd numbers in the range given, and $\\frac{245-5}{10}+1 = 25$ of those are divisible by $5$, so the answer is $126 - 25 = \\boxed{101}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given $d_1 = a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$ and $d_2 = a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$, we can see that a pattern emerges if we let $a$ take on different values and observe the resulting values of $d_1$ and $d_2$. \n\nFor example, let's consider $a=1$:\n$d_1 = 1^2 + 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^{(1+1)/2} = 1 + 2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 5$\n$d_2 = 1^2 + 2^1 - 1 \\cdot 2^{(1+1)/2} = 1 + 2 - 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 1$\n\nContinuing this process and observing the patterns may help in finding a solution to the problem.",
