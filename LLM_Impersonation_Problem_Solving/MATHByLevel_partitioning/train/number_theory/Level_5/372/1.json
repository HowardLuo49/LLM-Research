    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits.What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?\nThe number $ABCBA$ can be expressed as $10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10B + A$. \nSimplifying, we get $10001A + 1010B + 100C$.",
    "solution": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value that is divisible by 11, we need to find the remainder when we divide 10001A + 1010B + 100C by 11. \nUsing divisibility rule for 11 (alternating sum of digits), the remainder can be expressed as $10A + 9B + C$.\nFor this value to be divisible by 11, the remainder needs to be 0.\nTo maximize the value, choose $A=9$, $B=8$, and $C=1$.\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven is $98119$.",
