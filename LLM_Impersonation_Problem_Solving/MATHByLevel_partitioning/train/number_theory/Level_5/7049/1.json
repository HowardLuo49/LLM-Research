    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $N$ be the greatest integer multiple of 8, no two of whose digits are the same.What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000?\nFirst, let's find the largest number that is a multiple of 8. \nThe largest number divisible by 8 is $999$, as $8 \\times 125 = 1000$. \nTo form a number with distinct digits, we can choose the digits such that they are in decreasing order, starting from 9. \nSo the largest integer multiple of 8, with distinct digits, is $984$. \n\nPlan for the next person:\n1. Check if 984 is indeed the largest integer multiple of 8 with distinct digits.\n2. If 984 is not the largest, find the next number that fits the criteria. \n3. Present a proof or reasoning for why the number found is the largest.",
    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "1. To check if 984 is the largest integer multiple of 8 with distinct digits, we can list out all the multiples of 8 and check for the criteria of having distinct digits. Multiples of 8 less than 984 are: 976, 968, 960, 952, 944, 936, 928, 920, 912, 904, 896 and 992. Out of these, 968, 936, and 928 have distinct digits. So, 984 is not the largest.\n2. The next largest integer multiple of 8 with distinct digits is 968.\n3. To prove that 968 is the largest, we can quickly check that there are no other multiples of 8 with distinct digits larger than 968. Therefore, the remainder when 968 is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{968}$.",
