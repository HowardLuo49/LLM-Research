    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $N$ be the greatest integer multiple of 8, no two of whose digits are the same.\n",
    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the largest number that is a multiple of 8. \nThe largest number divisible by 8 is $999$, as $8 \\times 125 = 1000$. \nTo form a number with distinct digits, we can choose the digits such that they are in decreasing order, starting from 9. \nSo the largest integer multiple of 8, with distinct digits, is $984$. \n\nPlan for the next person:\n1. Check if 984 is indeed the largest integer multiple of 8 with distinct digits.\n2. If 984 is not the largest, find the next number that fits the criteria. \n3. Present a proof or reasoning for why the number found is the largest.",
