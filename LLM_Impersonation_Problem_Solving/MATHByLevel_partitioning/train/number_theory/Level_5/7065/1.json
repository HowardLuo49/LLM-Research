The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S_n$ be the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero digits of the integers from $1$ to $10^n$ inclusive.Find the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $S_n$ is an integer.\nLet's start by calculating $S_1$, which is the sum of the reciprocals of the non-zero digits of the integers from $1$ to $10$. \nFor the integers from $1$ to $9$, the non-zero digits are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$, so $S_1 = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{9}$. \n\nNow, let's simplify the sum $S_1$. \n$S_1 = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{9}$\n$S_1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{9}$\n$S_1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + 0.2 + \\frac{1}{6} + 0.142857 + 0.125 + 0.111$\n$S_1 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.333 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0,1667 + 0.142857 + 0.125 + 0.111$\n\nNext, let's generalize the calculations and find a pattern that can help us determine $S_n$.",
    "solution": "Let $K = \\sum_{i=1}^{9}{\\frac{1}{i}}$. Examining the terms in $S_1$, we see that $S_1 = K + 1$ since each digit $n$ appears once and 1 appears an extra time. Now consider writing out $S_2$. Each term of $K$ will appear 10 times in the units place and 10 times in the tens place (plus one extra 1 will appear), so $S_2 = 20K + 1$.\nIn general, we will have that\n$S_n = (n10^{n-1})K + 1$\nbecause each digit will appear $10^{n - 1}$ times in each place in the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, 10^{n} - 1$, and there are $n$ total places.\nThe denominator of $K$ is $D = 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$. For $S_n$ to be an integer, $n10^{n-1}$ must be divisible by $D$. Since $10^{n-1}$ only contains the factors $2$ and $5$ (but will contain enough of them when $n \\geq 3$), we must choose $n$ to be divisible by $3^2\\cdot 7$. Since we're looking for the smallest such $n$, the answer is $\\boxed{63}$.",
