    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nMary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$.From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly.\nThe next person should start by considering the possible range of scores on the AHSME exam- since Mary's score was over 80, we can assume that the minimum score she could have gotten is an 81.",
    "solution": "Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)\nIt follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Next, the next person should think about the structure of the AHSME exam, which typically consists of 25 multiple-choice questions. This means that Mary's score must be a number that is achievable by getting a certain number of questions correct out of 25. \n\nBased on this information, the next person can create a list of all possible scores Mary could have gotten on the AHSME exam if she got over 80, and then determine which of these scores could yield a unique number of problems solved correctly.",
