The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nMary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$.From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly.If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this.What was Mary's score?(Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers.(Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)\nLet's continue listing the possibilities:\n- For a score of 88: 26 solved correctly\n- For a score of 89: 27 solved correctly\n- For a score of 90: 28 solved correctly\n- For a score of 91: 29 solved correctly\n- For a score of 92: 30 solved correctly (maximum possible)\n- For a score of 93: not possible with 30 questions\n- For a score of 94: not possible with 30 questions\n- For a score of 95: not possible with 30 questions\n- For a score of 96: not possible with 30 questions\n- For a score of 97: not possible with 30 questions\n- For a score of 98: not possible with 30 questions\n- For a score of 99: not possible with 30 questions\n- For a score of 100: not possible with 30 questions\n\nBased on this, we see that the score of 92 has a unique solution of 30 problems solved correctly. Thus, Mary's score on the AHSME was 92.",
    "solution": "Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)\nIt follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$.",
