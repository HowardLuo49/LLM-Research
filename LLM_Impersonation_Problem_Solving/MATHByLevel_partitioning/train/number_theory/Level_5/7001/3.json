    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nMary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$.From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly.If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this.What was Mary's score?\nFirst, let's list all possible scores Mary could have gotten on the AHSME exam if she got over 80. Since the exam consists of 25 multiple-choice questions, each question is worth 1 point, so Mary's score could be any number between 0 and 25 inclusive. This gives us 26 possible scores.\n\nNext, let's determine which of these scores could yield a unique number of problems solved correctly. For example, if Mary's score was 90, she could have gotten 21 questions correct, 91 could be 22 questions correct, and so on up to 100 which would be all correct. We need to find the score where there is no ambiguity in determining the number of problems solved correctly.",
    "solution": "Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)\nIt follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the scores that have a unique number of problems solved correctly. We know that if Mary's score had been any lower, but still over 80, John could not have determined the number of problems solved correctly. This means that the score must be such that there is only one possible number of correctly solved problems for that score, but for any lower score, there are multiple possibilities. \n\nTo find this score, we can calculate the possible numbers of correctly solved problems for each score in the range of 81 to 100 and see where there is a unique solution. Let's start by listing the possibilities for each score:\n- For a score of 81: 19 solved correctly\n- For a score of 82: 20 solved correctly\n- For a score of 83: 21 solved correctly\n- For a score of 84: 22 solved correctly\n- For a score of 85: 23 solved correctly\n- For a score of 86: 24 solved correctly\n- For a score of 87: 25 solved correctly\n\nNow, let's confirm if there is a unique solution among these possibilities. If so, that would be Mary's score.",
