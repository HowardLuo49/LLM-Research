    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThere are $20n$ members in the Trumpington marching band, and when they line up in rows of 26, there are 4 band members left over.If $n$ is an integer and there are fewer than 1000 band members, what is the maximum number of people that could be in the Trumpington marching band?\nGiven that when the members line up in rows of 26, there are 4 band members left over, we can write this as $20n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{26}$. Now let's simplify this congruence. \n\nFirst, we can simplify $20n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{26}$ by dividing both sides by 2 to get $10n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13}$. \n\nNext, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of 10 modulo 13 to solve for $n$. The inverse of 10 modulo 13 is 4 since $10 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. \n\nTherefore, we have $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}$. \n\nNow, the plan for the next person is to find the value of $n$ by looking for a positive integer $n$ such that $n \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}$ and $n$ is a multiple of 20.",
    "solution": "Since there are 4 band members left over when they line up in rows of 26, we have $20n \\equiv 4\\pmod{26}$. We divide both sides of the congruence by 4, remembering that we have to divide 26 by the greatest common divisor of 4 and 26. The original congruence is equivalent to \\[\n5n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]So we would like to find a multiple of 13 which is one less than a multiple of 5. Noticing that $13\\cdot 3$ has a units digit of 9, we identify $(13\\cdot 3 + 1)/5 =8$ as the inverse of 5 (mod 13). Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 gives \\[\nn \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]We have found that $n$ satisfies the conditions given in the problem if $n=8+13k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $20n<1000$. Rewriting the inequality $20n<1000$ as $n<50$, we solve $8+13k < 50$ to find that the maximum solution is $k=\\lfloor 42/13\\rfloor = 3$. When $k=3$, the number of band members is $20(8+13(3))=\\boxed{940}$.",
