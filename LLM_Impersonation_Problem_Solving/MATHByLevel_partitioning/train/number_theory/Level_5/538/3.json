    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nZan has created this iterative rule for generating sequences of whole numbers:\n\n1) If a number is 25 or less, double the number.2) If a number is greater than 25, subtract 12 from it.Let $F$ be the first number in a sequence generated by the rule above.$F$ is a \"sweet number\" if 16 is not a term in the sequence that starts with $F$.\nThe work provided seems to have a mistake in it. The correct calculations based on the given iterative rule are as follows:\n- $10 \\times 2 = 20$\n- $20 \\times 2 = 40$\n- $40 - 12 = 28$ (since 40 is greater than 25).\n\nBased on the corrected calculations, the sequence starting with the number 10 is 10, 20, 28. \n\nPlan for the next person:\n1. Continue generating the sequence using the given iterative rule starting with the number 10 to see if any patterns emerge.\n2. Analyze the differences in operations and results when the numbers are below and above 25.\n3. Look for relationships between the initial numbers and the subsequent terms in the sequence to determine a general rule governing this iterative process.",
    "solution": "Consider the remainders of numbers in one of these sequences modulo 12. The first step doubles the remainder, but second step does not change it. So, if repeatedly doubling a number modulo 12 does not give $16 \\equiv 4$, the number 16 cannot be a term in the sequence. On the other hand, if there is a term congruent to 4 mod 12 in the sequence, it must be 4, 16, or a number greater than 25. If it's 4, two steps later 16 will be in the sequence. If it's 16, then 16 is in the sequence. If it's greater than 25, then subtracting off 12 repeatedly will eventually give 16, the largest number less than 25 which is congruent to 4 modulo 12.\n\nSo, we just need to find which remainders modulo 12 will eventually give 4 when doubled modulo 12 repeatedly. We can easily see that 1, 2, 4, and 8 all give 4 modulo 12 eventually. We can also see that 3, 6, 9 and 0 will just end up at 0 (ie, multiples of 12) when doubled modulo 12, and so they will not reach 4 modulo 12. This leaves 5, 7, 10, and 11. Doubling 11 gives $22\\equiv10$, $20\\equiv8$, so 11 and 10 reach 4 modulo 12. Double 5 gives 10 modulo 12, and double 7 gives 2 modulo 12, so they will eventually reach 4.\n\nTherefore, the only sweet numbers are congruent to 0, 3, 6, or 9 modulo 12, or in other words, multiples of 3. There are $\\boxed{16}$ multiples of 3 between 1 and 50.",
    "gpt_response": "Using the correct calculations provided, the sequence starting with the number 10 is 10, 20, 28, 16, 32, 20, 40, 28, 16, ...\nContinuing with the iterative process:\n- $16 \\times 2 = 32$\n- $32 - 12 = 20$\n- $20 \\times 2 = 40$\n- $40 - 12 = 28$\n- $28 \\times 2 = 56$\n- $56 - 12 = 44$\n- $44 - 12 = 32$\n- $32 - 12 = 20$\n- $20 \\times 2 = 40$\n- $40 - 12 = 28$\n\nIt seems that the sequence starting with the number 10 repeats the terms 10, 20, 28, 16, 32, 20, 40, 28, 16, 32, 20, 40, 28, ... \n\nNext steps:\n1. Investigate why the sequence repeats after a certain pattern.\n2. Determine under what conditions, the sequence generated terminates or continues.\n3.
