    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe repeating decimals $0.abab\\overline{ab}$ and $0.abcabc\\overline{abc}$ satisfy\n\\[0.abab\\overline{ab}+0.abcabc\\overline{abc}=\\frac{33}{37},\\]\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.Find the three digit number $abc$.\nLet's start by expressing the repeating decimals in a more mathematical form: $0.abab\\overline{ab}=\\frac{ab}{99}$ and $0.abcabc\\overline{abc}=\\frac{abc}{999}$. The equation then becomes $\\frac{ab}{99}+\\frac{abc}{999}=\\frac{33}{37}$. \n\nTo get rid of the fractions, we can multiply everything by $999\\cdot 99\\cdot 37$ to get $37ab \\cdot 999 + 99abc \\cdot 37 = 33 \\cdot 999 \\cdot 99$. \n\nNow, it's your turn to solve the resulting equation and find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$!",
    "solution": "Notice repeating decimals can be written as the following:\n$0.\\overline{ab}=\\frac{10a+b}{99}$\n$0.\\overline{abc}=\\frac{100a+10b+c}{999}$\nwhere a,b,c are the digits. Now we plug this back into the original fraction:\n$\\frac{10a+b}{99}+\\frac{100a+10b+c}{999}=\\frac{33}{37}$\nMultiply both sides by $999*99.$ This helps simplify the right side as well because $999=111*9=37*3*9$:\n$9990a+999b+9900a+990b+99c=33/37*37*3*9*99=33*3*9*99$\nDividing both sides by $9$ and simplifying gives:\n$2210a+221b+11c=99^2=9801$\nAt this point, seeing the $221$ factor common to both a and b is crucial to simplify. This is because taking $mod 221$ to both sides results in:\n$2210a+221b+11c  \\equiv 9801 \\mod 221 \\iff 11c  \\equiv 77 \\mod 221$\nNotice that we arrived to the result $9801 \\equiv 77 \\mod 221$ by simply dividing $9801$ by $221$ and seeing $9801=44*221+77.$ Okay, now it's pretty clear to divide both sides by $11$ in the modular equation but we have to worry about $221$ being multiple of $11.$ Well, $220$ is a multiple of $11$ so clearly, $221$ couldn't be. Also, $221=13*17.$ Now finally we simplify and get:\n$c \\equiv 7 \\mod 221$\nBut we know $c$ is between $0$ and $9$ because it is a digit, so $c$ must be $7.$ Now it is straightforward from here to find $a$ and $b$:\n$2210a+221b+11(7)=9801 \\iff 221(10a+b)=9724 \\iff 10a+b=44$\nand since a and b are both between $0$ and $9$, we have $a=b=4$. Finally we have the $3$ digit integer $\\boxed{447}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Multiplying out both sides of the equation results in $36863ab + 3663abc = 327327$. \nSimplifying this, we get $37ab + abc = 33$. \nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, they must be single-digit integers. \nFrom here, we can proceed by trial and error to find that $a = 3$, $b = 0$, and $c = 7$. \nTherefore, the three-digit number $abc$ is $\\boxed{307}$.",
