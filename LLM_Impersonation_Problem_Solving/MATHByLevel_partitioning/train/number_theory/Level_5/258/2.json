    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $f(n)$ return the number of distinct ordered pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ such that for each ordered pair, $a^2 + b^2 = n$.Note that when $a \\neq b$, $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are distinct.What is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f(n) = 3$?\nTo do this, we can look at a list of perfect squares to identify any potential patterns that may help us determine the values of $n$ where $a^2 + b^2 = n$. We can then choose a method to test these values of $n$ such as systematically checking all possible pairs $(a,b)$ that satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = n$.",
    "solution": "If $f(n) = 3$, this implies that $n = 2m^2$ for some positive integer $m$ since the only time $f(n)$ can be odd is when there is an ordered pair $(m, m)$ that cannot be reversed. We start testing values of $m$. The values $m = 1$, $m=2$, $m=3$, and $m=4$ do not give $f(n)=3$. However, when $m=5$, we get $50 = 5^2 + 5^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 7^2 + 1^2$. Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which $f(n)=3$ is $\\boxed{50}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f(n) = 3$, we can start by listing out the perfect squares to identify patterns.

Let's move on to the next perfect square, $3$. \n\nFor $n = 3$, the only way to express it as the sum of two squares is $1^2 + 1^2$. Therefore, $f(3) = 1$.\n\nThe next perfect square after $3$ is $4$. Let's see if we can express $4$ as the sum of two squares in $3$ different ways.",
