You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCompute the multiplicative inverse of $201$ modulo $299$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the inverse of $201$ modulo $299$. Then, by the definition of the inverse, $201\\cdot a \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}$. We are looking for an integer $a$ that satisfies this congruence.\n\nTo make our task easier, we note that $603\\equiv 5\\pmod{299}$, and so \\begin{align*}\n603\\cdot 60 &\\equiv 5\\cdot 60 \\\\\n&= 300 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.\n\\end{align*}Now we write $603$ as $201\\cdot 3$: $$201\\cdot 3\\cdot 60 \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.$$Thus, the inverse we seek is $a = 3\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{180}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the multiplicative inverse of $201$ modulo $299$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $201x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{299}$.\nWe can rewrite the congruence as $201x - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{299}$.\nThis gives us the equation $201x - 1 = 299k$ for some integer $k$.\nWe can rearrange this to get $201x - 299k = 1$.",
