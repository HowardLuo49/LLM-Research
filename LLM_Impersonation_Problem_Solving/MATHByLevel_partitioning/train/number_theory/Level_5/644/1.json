The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCompute the multiplicative inverse of $201$ modulo $299$.Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $298$.\nTo find the multiplicative inverse of $201$ modulo $299$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $201x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{299}$.\nWe can rewrite the congruence as $201x - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{299}$.\nThis gives us the equation $201x - 1 = 299k$ for some integer $k$.\nWe can rearrange this to get $201x - 299k = 1$.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the inverse of $201$ modulo $299$. Then, by the definition of the inverse, $201\\cdot a \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}$. We are looking for an integer $a$ that satisfies this congruence.\n\nTo make our task easier, we note that $603\\equiv 5\\pmod{299}$, and so \\begin{align*}\n603\\cdot 60 &\\equiv 5\\cdot 60 \\\\\n&= 300 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.\n\\end{align*}Now we write $603$ as $201\\cdot 3$: $$201\\cdot 3\\cdot 60 \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.$$Thus, the inverse we seek is $a = 3\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{180}$.",
