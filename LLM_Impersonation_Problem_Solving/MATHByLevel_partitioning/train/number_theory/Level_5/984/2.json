You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nNatural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers.In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime.(The conjecture was later shown to be false.)\nTo find the next Fermat number, we can use the formula $F_{n+1} = 2^{2^{n+1}} + 1$.\n$F_4 = 2^{2^4} + 1 = 2^{16} + 1 = 65537$",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the next Fermat number, we can calculate $F_5$ using the formula $F_{n+1} = 2^{2^{n+1}} + 1$.\n$F_5 = 2^{2^5} + 1 = 2^{32} + 1$. We need to calculate $2^{32}$.\n$2^{32} = (2^{16})^2 = 65536^2 = 4294967296$.\nTherefore, $F_5 = 4294967296 + 1 = 4294967297$.  The next Fermat number is $4294967297$.",
