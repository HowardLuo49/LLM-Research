    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAn integer $n$ is said to be square-free if the only perfect square that divides $n$ is $1^2$.How many positive odd integers greater than 1 and less than $100$ are square-free?\nThe problem is related to square-free numbers, which are integers that are not divisible by any perfect square other than 1.\nTo solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for a number to be square-free.\nA positive integer $n$ is square-free if it is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1.\nIn other words, if the prime factorization of $n$ includes a prime raised to a power greater than 1, then $n$ is not square-free.\nWe can use this definition of square-free numbers to come up with a plan to determine whether a given integer $n$ is square-free.",
    "solution": "If an integer $n$ is not square-free, then there is a square greater than $1$ that does divide $n$. The odd squares less than $100$ are $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$, and $9^2 = 81$. If an integer is divisible by $81$, then it is divisible by $9$, so we will only consider $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. There are $11$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $100$. Six of them are odd and five are even. There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$. Two of them are odd and one is even. There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$. One of them is odd and one is even. Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free. The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100. Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1. There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$.",
