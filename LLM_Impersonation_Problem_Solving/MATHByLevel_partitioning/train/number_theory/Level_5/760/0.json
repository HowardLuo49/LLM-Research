    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Previous work: Let's take a look at a few examples to see if we can identify any patterns. \n1. $n=2$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 2 is 2 since $2!=2$.\n2. $n=3$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 3 is also 2 since $2!=2$ but it's not 1.\n3. $n=4$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 4 is 4 since $4!=24$.\n4. $n=5$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 5 is also 4 since $4!=24$ but it's not 3. \n\nPlan for the next person: Let's form a pattern with the examples given and determine a formula or algorithm to calculate $f(n)$ for any integer $n$.",
