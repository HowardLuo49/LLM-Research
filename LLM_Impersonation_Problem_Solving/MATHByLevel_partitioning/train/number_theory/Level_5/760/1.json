The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$.Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?\nPrevious work: Let's take a look at a few examples to see if we can identify any patterns. \n1. $n=2$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 2 is 2 since $2!=2$.\n2. $n=3$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 3 is also 2 since $2!=2$ but it's not 1.\n3. $n=4$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 4 is 4 since $4!=24$.\n4. $n=5$: The smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 5 is also 4 since $4!=24$ but it's not 3. \n\nPlan for the next person: Let's form a pattern with the examples given and determine a formula or algorithm to calculate $f(n)$ for any integer $n$.",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",

For $n=5$, $k=4$.\n\nFrom the given examples, we observe that for prime numbers $p$, the smallest value of $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by $p$ is always $p-1$.\n\nIn the case of composite numbers like 15 (which is $3 \\times 5$), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the primes in its factorization, which is $\\text{LCM}(2, 2)=2$. Therefore, the smallest value of $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 15 is $2$ (since it is the smallest number divisible by both $3$ and $5$).\n\nThus, the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n)>15$ is $15$.",
