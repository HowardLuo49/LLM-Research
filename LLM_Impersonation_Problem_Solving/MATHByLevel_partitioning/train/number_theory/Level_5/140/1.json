    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIn base $b$, there are exactly one hundred three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct.(That's \"one hundred\" in the ordinary sense, $100_{10}$.)\nLet's start by considering the possible choices for the first digit of the three-digit number. Since the first digit cannot be 0 and all digits must be distinct, there are $b-1$ choices for the first digit.\n\nNext, we consider the choices for the second digit. Since the second digit must be different from the first digit and cannot be 0, there are $b-2$ choices for the second digit.\n\nSimilarly, for the third digit, there are $b-2$ choices as well, since it must be different from the first two digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of three-digit numbers with distinct digits in base $b$ is $(b-1)(b-2)^2$. \n\nNow, using the information given in the problem, we know that there are exactly 103 such three-digit numbers in base $b$. So we can set up the equation $(b-1)(b-2)^2 = 103$ and solve for $b$. \n\nNow, I will leave it to the next person to solve the equation and find the value of $b$.",
    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Expanding the left side of the equation $(b-1)(b-2)^2 = 103$, we get $b^3 - 5b^2 + 8b - 4 = 103$, which simplifies to $b^3 - 5b^2 + 8b - 107 = 0$. This is a cubic equation, and we need to find the integer value of $b$ that satisfies this equation. The next person should attempt to solve this cubic equation for $b$.",
