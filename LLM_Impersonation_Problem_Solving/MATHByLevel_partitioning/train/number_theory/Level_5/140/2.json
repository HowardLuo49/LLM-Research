The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nIn base $b$, there are exactly one hundred three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct.(That's \"one hundred\" in the ordinary sense, $100_{10}$.)What is $b$?\nExpanding the left side of the equation $(b-1)(b-2)^2 = 103$, we get $b^3 - 5b^2 + 8b - 4 = 103$, which simplifies to $b^3 - 5b^2 + 8b - 107 = 0$. This is a cubic equation, and we need to find the integer value of $b$ that satisfies this equation. The next person should attempt to solve this cubic equation for $b$.",
    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the cubic equation $b^3 - 5b^2 + 8b - 107 = 0$, we can try different integer values for $b$ until we find one that satisfies the equation. \n\nBy testing values starting from $b=2$, we find that $b=7$ satisfies the equation when $b=7^3 - 5(7)^2 + 8(7) - 107 = 343 - 245 + 56 - 107 = 0$. \n\nTherefore, in base $b=7$, there are exactly one hundred three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct.",
