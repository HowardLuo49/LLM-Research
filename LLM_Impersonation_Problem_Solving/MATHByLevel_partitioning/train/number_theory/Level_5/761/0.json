You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $m$ be the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$.\n",

So we want exactly the numbers in the set $\\{1,\\ldots,24\\}$ which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $3$, since an integer $a$ is invertible modulo $n$ for some positive integer $n$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,n)=1$. These turn out to be $\\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\\}$.
