The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nDefine $n!!$ to be $n(n-2)(n-4)\\cdots 3\\cdot 1$ for $n$ odd and $n(n-2)(n-4)\\cdots 4\\cdot 2$ for $n$ even.When $\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\frac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, its denominator is $2^ab$ with $b$ odd.Find $\\dfrac{ab}{10}$.\nLet's write out the first few values to see a pattern: $1!! = 1, 3!! = 1\\cdot 3 = 3, 5!! = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15, 7!! = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 = 105.$\nSimilarly, $2!! = 2, 4!! = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8, 6!! = 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 48, 8!! = 8 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 384$ and so on. \nThis pattern will help us in finding the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\frac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$.\nNext, we need to find a way to simplify the expression $\\frac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$.",
    "solution": "First, note that $(2n)!! = 2^n \\cdot n!$, and that $(2n)!! \\cdot (2n-1)!! = (2n)!$.\nWe can now take the fraction $\\dfrac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ and multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $(2i)!!$. We get that this fraction is equal to $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(2i)!!^2} = \\dfrac{(2i)!}{2^{2i}(i!)^2}$.\nNow we can recognize that $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(i!)^2}$ is simply ${2i \\choose i}$, hence this fraction is $\\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$, and our sum turns into $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$.\nLet $c = \\sum_{i=1}^{2009} {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i}$. Obviously $c$ is an integer, and $S$ can be written as $\\dfrac{c}{2^{2\\cdot 2009}}$. Hence if $S$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, its denominator will be of the form $2^a$ for some $a\\leq 2\\cdot 2009$.\nIn other words, we just showed that $b=1$. To determine $a$, we need to determine the largest power of $2$ that divides $c$.\nLet $p(i)$ be the largest $x$ such that $2^x$ that divides $i$.\nWe can now return to the observation that $(2i)! = (2i)!! \\cdot (2i-1)!! = 2^i \\cdot i! \\cdot (2i-1)!!$. Together with the obvious fact that $(2i-1)!!$ is odd, we get that $p((2i)!)=p(i!)+i$.\nIt immediately follows that $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\right) = p((2i)!) - 2p(i!) = i - p(i!)$, and hence $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i} \\right) = 2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$.\nObviously, for $i\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,2009\\}$ the function $f(i)=2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$ is is a strictly decreasing function. Therefore $p(c) = p\\left( {2\\cdot 2009\\choose 2009} \\right) = 2009 - p(2009!)$.\nWe can now compute $p(2009!) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{2009}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = 1004 + 502 + \\cdots + 3 + 1 = 2001$. Hence $p(c)=2009-2001=8$.\nAnd thus we have $a=2\\cdot 2009 - p(c) = 4010$, and the answer is $\\dfrac{ab}{10} = \\dfrac{4010\\cdot 1}{10} = \\boxed{401}$.",
