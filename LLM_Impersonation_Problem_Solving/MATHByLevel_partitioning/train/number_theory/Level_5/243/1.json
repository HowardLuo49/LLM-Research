The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe sum of the positive divisors of a positive integer of the form $2^i3^j$ is equal to $600$.What is $i + j$?\nGiven that the positive integer is of the form $2^i3^j$, we can express the sum of its divisors using the formula $\\frac{2^{i+1}-1}{2-1} \\cdot \\frac{3^{j+1}-1}{3-1} = 600$. \n\nNext, we can simplify the equation to $2^{i+1} \\cdot 3^{j+1} - 2^{i+1} - 3^{j+1} + 1 = 600$. \n\nWe can further rearrange the equation to $2^{i+1} \\cdot 3^{j+1} - 2^{i+1} - 3^{j+1} = 599$. \n\nTo solve for $i$ and $j$, we can use trial and error in combination with factoring to find integer solutions.",
    "solution": "The sum of the divisors of $2^i3^j$ is equal to $(1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i-1} + 2^i)(1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j-1} + 3^j) = 600,$ since each factor of $2^i3^j$ is represented exactly once in the sum that results when the product is expanded. Let $A = 1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i}$ and $B = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j}$, so that $A \\times B = 600$. The prime factorization of $600$ is $600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$.\n\nNotice that $A$ is the sum of $1$ and an even number and $B$ is the sum of $1$ and a number divisible by $3$. Thus, $A$ is odd and $B$ is not divisible by $3$. It follows that $A$ is divisible by $3$ and $B$ is divisible by $2^3$. We now have three separate cases: $(A,B) = (3 \\cdot 25,8), (3 \\cdot 5, 8 \\cdot 5), (3, 8 \\cdot 25)$.\n\nIn the first case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 8$; for $j = 1$, we have that $1 + 3 = 4 < 8$, and for $j = 2$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 = 13 > 8$. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\nFor the third case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 200$; for $j = 4$, then $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 < 200$, and for $j = 5$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364 > 200$. Thus, this case is also not possible.\n\nIt follows that $(A,B) = (15, 40)$, in which case we find that $i = j = 3$ works. Thus, the answer is $3 + 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
