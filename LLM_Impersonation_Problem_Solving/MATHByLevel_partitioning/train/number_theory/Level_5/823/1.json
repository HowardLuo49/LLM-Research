You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nKaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9.What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27?\nGiven that the clever integer must be even and the sum of its digits must be 9, possible options are 27, 45, 63, 81, 90, 108.\nNext, we need to check which of these numbers are between 20 and 120.\nOnly 27, 45, 63, and 81 satisfy the constraint of being between 20 and 120.\nNow, we need to find the prime factorization of these numbers to determine if they are prime or composite.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
