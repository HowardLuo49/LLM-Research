The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCall a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence.Find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers.\nGiven that a geometric sequence is of the form $a, ar, ar^2$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio, we can set up the following equations for a 3-digit number: $100a + 10b + c = a, ar, ar^2$. \nTherefore, $100a + 10b + c = a(1 + r + r^2)$.",
    "solution": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers, we need to consider the possible values of a, b, and c that satisfy the equation $100a + 10b + c = a(1 + r + r^2)$.\n\nLet's start by considering possible values for a. Since the number is a 3-digit number, a must be between 1 and 9, inclusive.\n\nIf a = 1, then the equation becomes $100 + 10b + c = 1(1 + r + r^2)$, which simplifies to $100 + 10b + c = 1 + r + r^2$. This implies that $r = 9$, but this value of r is not valid since r must be an integer.\n\nIf a = 2, then the equation becomes $200 + 10b + c = 2(1 + r + r^2)$. With further analysis, it can be seen that the common ratio r must be 3 in order to satisfy this equation. Therefore, the geometric number corresponding to a = 2 is 231.\n\nIf a = 3, then the equation becomes $300 + 10b + c = 3(1 + r + r^2)$. By testing different values of r, it can be determined that the common ratio r must be 2, resulting in the geometric number 321.\n\nIf a = 4, the equation becomes $400 + 10b + c = 4(1 + r + r^2)$, which is not solvable given the constraints of a, b, and c.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers. The largest geometric number is 321 and the smallest is 231. Therefore, the difference is $321 - 231 = \\boxed{90}$.",
