    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCall a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence.\n",
    "solution": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that a geometric sequence is of the form $a, ar, ar^2$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio, we can set up the following equations for a 3-digit number: $100a + 10b + c = a, ar, ar^2$. \nTherefore, $100a + 10b + c = a(1 + r + r^2)$.",
