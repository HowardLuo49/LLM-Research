    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $A$ and $B$ are digits in base $d > 6$ such that $\\overline{AB}_d + \\overline{AA}_d = 162_d$.Find $A_d - B_d$ in base $d$.\nGiven that $A$ and $B$ are digits in base $d$, we know that $0 \\leq A,B \\leq d-1$.\n\nSince we have $\\overline{AB}_d + \\overline{AA}_d = 162_d$, we can write this as $dA + B + dA + A = d^2 + 6d + 2$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $2d(A+1) + B + A = d^2 + 6d + 2$.",
    "solution": "Looking at the $d$'s place, we see that $A_d + A_d = 16_d = d + 6$ or $A_d + A_d + 1 = 16_d = d + 6$ (if there is carry-over). Re-arranging and solving for $A_d$, we find that $A_d = \\frac{d + 6}2$ or $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. In either case, since $d > 6$, it follows that $A_d > 2$. Thus, when we add the units digits $B_d + A_d$, there must be carry-over, so $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. It follows that $$B_d + A_d = d + 2 \\Longrightarrow B_d = d+2 - \\frac{d + 5}2 = \\frac d2 - \\frac 12.$$Thus, $A_d - B_d = \\frac{d + 5}2 - \\frac{d-1}{2} = \\boxed{3}_d$.",

Also, $d > 6$ implies $d^2 > 36$. Therefore, $3dA + 2d < d^2$.\n\nThis means that $3dA + 2d + B < d^2 \\implies 3dA + 2d < d^2 - B \\leq d^2 - 1$.",
