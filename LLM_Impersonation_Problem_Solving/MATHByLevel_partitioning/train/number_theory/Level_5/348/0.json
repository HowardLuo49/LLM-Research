You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind $2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$.\n",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 25 + \\frac{8}{11} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 5}{55} \\equiv \\frac{62}{-1} \\equiv -62 \\equiv \\boxed{50} \\pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows. Suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \\equiv 55n \\equiv 22 + 40 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, let's find the modular inverses of 5 and 11 modulo 56 by finding integers $a$ and $b$ such that $5a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$ and $11b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$. \n\nTo find the modular inverse of 5, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $5a + 56b = 1$. \n\nWe have $56 = 5 \\cdot 11 + 1$. By repeatedly substituting backwards, we find that $1 = 56 - 5 \\cdot 11$. \n\nTherefore, $-5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$, so the modular inverse of 5 modulo 56 is -5. \n\nNext, let's find the modular inverse of 11.",
