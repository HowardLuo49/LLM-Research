The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind $2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$.Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $55$, inclusive.\nTo begin, let's find the modular inverses of 5 and 11 modulo 56 by finding integers $a$ and $b$ such that $5a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$ and $11b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$. \n\nTo find the modular inverse of 5, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $5a + 56b = 1$. \n\nWe have $56 = 5 \\cdot 11 + 1$. By repeatedly substituting backwards, we find that $1 = 56 - 5 \\cdot 11$. \n\nTherefore, $-5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}$, so the modular inverse of 5 modulo 56 is -5. \n\nNext, let's find the modular inverse of 11.",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 25 + \\frac{8}{11} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 5}{55} \\equiv \\frac{62}{-1} \\equiv -62 \\equiv \\boxed{50} \\pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows. Suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \\equiv 55n \\equiv 22 + 40 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{56}$.",
