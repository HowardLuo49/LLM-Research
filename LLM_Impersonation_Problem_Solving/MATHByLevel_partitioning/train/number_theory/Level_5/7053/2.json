    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face.When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen.Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\nNext, I will use the information given in the problem that there are $231$ cubes that cannot be seen when the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible. This means that the volume of the rectangular block minus $231$ is the total number of cubes visible, which is equal to $Nab$. So, we have $2(ab + aN + bN) - 231 = Nab$.",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",
