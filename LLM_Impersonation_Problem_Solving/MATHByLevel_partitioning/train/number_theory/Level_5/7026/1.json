    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA right rectangular prism $P$ (i.e., a rectangular parallelpiped) has sides of integral length $a, b, c,$ with $a\\le b\\le c.$ A plane parallel to one of the faces of $P$ cuts $P$ into two prisms, one of which is similar to $P,$ and both of which have nonzero volume.Given that $b=1995,$ for how many ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ does such a plane exist?\nIn order for the two prisms to be similar, the ratio of corresponding side lengths must be the same.",
    "solution": "Let $P'$ be the prism similar to $P$, and let the sides of $P'$ be of length $x,y,z$, such that $x \\le y \\le z$. Then\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{y}{b} = \\frac zc < 1.\\]\nNote that if the ratio of similarity was equal to $1$, we would have a prism with zero volume. As one face of $P'$ is a face of $P$, it follows that $P$ and $P'$ share at least two side lengths in common. Since $x < a, y < b, z < c$, it follows that the only possibility is $y=a,z=b=1995$. Then,\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{a}{1995} = \\frac{1995}{c} \\Longrightarrow ac = 1995^2 = 3^25^27^219^2.\\]\nThe number of factors of $3^25^27^219^2$ is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 81$. Only in $\\left\\lfloor \\frac {81}2 \\right\\rfloor = 40$ of these cases is $a < c$ (for $a=c$, we end with a prism of zero volume). We can easily verify that these will yield nondegenerate prisms, so the answer is $\\boxed{40}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $b=1995,$ we see that the two prisms are similar if and only if their bases are similar. To find the possible values of $a$ and $c,$ we know that they must be factors of the volume of the whole prism, which is $abc.$ Since $a\\le b\\le c$ and the volume is $abc=(1995)(b)=1995^2,$ we see that $1995=3^1\\cdot 5^1\\cdot 7^2.$ Then, the possible values of $a$ are the factors of $3^1\\cdot 5^1\\cdot 7^2=3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7=105$ and the possible values of $c$ are the factors of $\\frac{1995^2}{3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7} = 315.$ \nHence, the pairs of factors of 105 and 315 are $(1,315), (3, 105), (5,63),$ and $(7,45),$ giving us $\\boxed{4}$ ordered triples of $(a,b,c).$",
