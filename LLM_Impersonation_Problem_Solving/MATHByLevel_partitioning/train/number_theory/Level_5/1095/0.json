You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThere are four distinct positive integers $a,b,c,d$ less than $8$ which are invertible modulo $8$.\n",
    "solution": "First we note that the four integers are $1,3,5,7$. Then we expand to get \\[(abc+abd+acd+bcd)(abcd)^{-1}=a^{-1}+b^{-1}+c^{-1}+d^{-1}.\\]Finally, we see that (amazingly) each of the four numbers is its own inverse modulo $8$. Thus,  \\[1^{-1}+3^{-1}+5^{-1}+7^{-1}\\equiv 1+3+5+7\\equiv 16\\equiv \\boxed{0} \\pmod 8.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first list out all the positive integers less than 8. These are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\nNext, we need to find the invertible integers modulo 8. This means we need to find numbers which have a multiplicative inverse modulo 8. This can be done by finding numbers whose greatest common divisor with 8 is 1. Let's calculate the gcd of each number with 8.",
