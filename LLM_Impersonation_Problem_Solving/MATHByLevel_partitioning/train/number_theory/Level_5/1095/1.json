The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThere are four distinct positive integers $a,b,c,d$ less than $8$ which are invertible modulo $8$.Find the remainder when $(abc+abd+acd+bcd)(abcd)^{-1}$ is divided by $8$.\nLet's first list out all the positive integers less than 8. These are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\nNext, we need to find the invertible integers modulo 8. This means we need to find numbers which have a multiplicative inverse modulo 8. This can be done by finding numbers whose greatest common divisor with 8 is 1. Let's calculate the gcd of each number with 8.",

Then we expand to get \\[(abc+abd+acd+bcd)(abcd)^{-1}=a^{-1}+b^{-1}+c^{-1}+d^{-1}.\\]Finally, we see that (amazingly) each of the four numbers is its own inverse modulo $8$.
