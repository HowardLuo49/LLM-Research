    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nIn a parlor game, the magician asks one of the participants to think of a three digit number $(abc)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent digits in base $10$ in the order indicated.The magician then asks this person to form the numbers $(acb)$, $(bca)$, $(bac)$, $(cab)$, and $(cba)$, to add these five numbers, and to reveal their sum, $N$.If told the value of $N$, the magician can identify the original number, $(abc)$.Play the role of the magician and determine $(abc)$ if $N= 3194$.\nCalculating $124+142+214+241+412+421=1354$, which is clearly not divisible by 37, so we will move on to the next set of values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let's try $a=2$, $b=1$, $c=3$: $213, 231, 123, 132, 312, 321$. Next, we will calculate the sum of these numbers and check if it is divisible by 37. If it is not divisible by 37, we can continue with this brute force method to exhaust all possible combinations for $a$, $b$, and $c$.",
    "solution": "Let $m$ be the number $100a+10b+c$. Observe that $3194+m=222(a+b+c)$ so\n\\[m\\equiv -3194\\equiv -86\\equiv 136\\pmod{222}\\]\nThis reduces $m$ to one of $136, 358, 580, 802$. But also $a+b+c=\\frac{3194+m}{222}>\\frac{3194}{222}>14$ so $a+b+c\\geq 15$. Of the four options, only $m = \\boxed{358}$ satisfies this inequality.",
