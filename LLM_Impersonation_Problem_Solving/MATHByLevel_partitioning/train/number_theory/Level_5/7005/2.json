    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIn a parlor game, the magician asks one of the participants to think of a three digit number $(abc)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent digits in base $10$ in the order indicated.The magician then asks this person to form the numbers $(acb)$, $(bca)$, $(bac)$, $(cab)$, and $(cba)$, to add these five numbers, and to reveal their sum, $N$.If told the value of $N$, the magician can identify the original number, $(abc)$.\nLet's start by testing the number formed by $a=1$, $b=2$, $c=4$: $124, 142, 214, 241, 412, 421$. \nNext, we will calculate the sum of these numbers and check if it is divisible by 37. If it is not divisible by 37, we can move on to the next set of values for $a$, $b$, and $c$.",
    "solution": "Let $m$ be the number $100a+10b+c$. Observe that $3194+m=222(a+b+c)$ so\n\\[m\\equiv -3194\\equiv -86\\equiv 136\\pmod{222}\\]\nThis reduces $m$ to one of $136, 358, 580, 802$. But also $a+b+c=\\frac{3194+m}{222}>\\frac{3194}{222}>14$ so $a+b+c\\geq 15$. Of the four options, only $m = \\boxed{358}$ satisfies this inequality.",
    "gpt_response": "Calculating $124+142+214+241+412+421=1354$, which is clearly not divisible by 37, so we will move on to the next set of values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let's try $a=2$, $b=1$, $c=3$: $213, 231, 123, 132, 312, 321$. Next, we will calculate the sum of these numbers and check if it is divisible by 37. If it is not divisible by 37, we can continue with this brute force method to exhaust all possible combinations for $a$, $b$, and $c$.",
