The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $R$ be the set of all possible remainders when a number of the form $2^n$, $n$ a nonnegative integer, is divided by 1000.Let $S$ be the sum of the elements in $R$.Find the remainder when $S$ is divided by 1000.\n$2^4 = 16 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{1000}$, $2^5 = 32 \\equiv 32 \\pmod{1000}$, $2^6 = 64 \\equiv 64 \\pmod{1000}$, $2^7 = 128 \\equiv 128 \\pmod{1000}$. \nTherefore, the set $R$ becomes $R = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128\\}$. \n\nThe sum of these elements can be calculated as $S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128$. \nNext person, please find the sum $S$ to determine the sum of the remainders of all possible powers of 2 when divided by 1000.",
    "solution": "Note that $x \\equiv y \\pmod{1000} \\Leftrightarrow x \\equiv y \\pmod{125}$ and $x \\equiv y \\pmod{8}$. So we must find the first two integers $i$ and $j$ such that $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{125}$ and $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{8}$ and $i \\neq j$. Note that $i$ and $j$ will be greater than 2 since remainders of $1, 2, 4$ will not be possible after 2 (the numbers following will always be congruent to 0 modulo 8). Note that $2^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$ (see Euler's theorem) and $2^0,2^1,2^2,\\ldots,2^{99}$ are all distinct modulo 125 (proof below). Thus, $i = 103$ and $j =3$ are the first two integers such that $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{1000}$. All that is left is to find $S$ in mod $1000$. After some computation:\\[S = 2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+...+2^{101}+ 2^{102} = 2^{103}-1 \\equiv 8 - 1 \\mod 1000 = \\boxed{7}.\\]To show that $2^0, 2^1,\\ldots, 2^{99}$ are distinct modulo 125, suppose for the sake of contradiction that they are not. Then, we must have at least one of $2^{20}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$ or $2^{50}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$. However, writing $2^{10}\\equiv 25 - 1\\pmod{125}$, we can easily verify that $2^{20}\\equiv -49\\pmod{125}$ and $2^{50}\\equiv -1\\pmod{125}$, giving us the needed contradiction.",
