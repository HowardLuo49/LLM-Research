The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ be an odd integer with exactly 11 positive divisors.Find the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$.\nGiven that $n$ is an odd integer, we know that it is not divisible by 2. \nThus, the prime factorization of $n$ must only include odd prime numbers. \nLet's express the number of divisors of $n$ in terms of its prime factorization and use the fact that $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors.",
    "solution": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$",
