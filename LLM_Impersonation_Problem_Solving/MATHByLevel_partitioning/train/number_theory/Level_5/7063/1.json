    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nEquilateral $\\triangle ABC$ is inscribed in a circle of radius $2$.Extend $\\overline{AB}$ through $B$ to point $D$ so that $AD=13,$ and extend $\\overline{AC}$ through $C$ to point $E$ so that $AE = 11.$ Through $D,$ draw a line $l_1$ parallel to $\\overline{AE},$ and through $E,$ draw a line $l_2$ parallel to $\\overline{AD}.$ Let $F$ be the intersection of $l_1$ and $l_2.$ Let $G$ be the point on the circle that is collinear with $A$ and $F$ and distinct from $A.$ Given that the area of $\\triangle CBG$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac{p\\sqrt{q}}{r},$ where $p, q,$ and $r$ are positive integers, $p$ and $r$ are relatively prime, and $q$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $p+q+r.$\nLet's label the center of the circle as $O$. The circumradius of the circle is $2$, so $OA=OB=OC=2$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, all three angles are $60^\\circ$. \nFrom $OA=OB=OC=2$, we know that $\\angle AOB=\\angle BOC=\\angle COA=120^\\circ$. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle A=\\angle B=\\angle C=60^\\circ$. \nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the side length of the triangle. \nLet $a=BC$, $b=CA$, $c=AB$ be the side lengths of the triangle. \nWe know that $a=b=c$, since $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral. \nThe Law of Cosines states that $a^2=b^2+c^2-2bc\\cos A$. \nFor an equilateral triangle, the law simplifies: $a^2=2b^2 - 2bc\\cos 60^\\circ$. \n\nThe next person should calculate the side length of the equilateral triangle by plugging in the known values and solving for $a$.",

Also, $\\angle{GBC} = \\angle{GAC} = \\angle{FAE}$ because they both correspond to arc ${GC}$.
