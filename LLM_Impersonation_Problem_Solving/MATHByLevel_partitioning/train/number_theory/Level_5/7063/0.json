You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEquilateral $\\triangle ABC$ is inscribed in a circle of radius $2$.\n",

Also, $\\angle{GBC} = \\angle{GAC} = \\angle{FAE}$ because they both correspond to arc ${GC}$. So $\\Delta{GBC} \\sim \\Delta{EAF}$.\n\\[[EAF] = \\frac12 (AE)(EF)\\sin \\angle AEF  = \\frac12\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot\\sin{120^\\circ} = \\frac {143\\sqrt3}4.\\]\nBecause the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of the corresponding sides, $[GBC] = \\frac {BC^2}{AF^2}\\cdot[EAF] = \\frac {12}{11^2 + 13^2 - 2\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot\\cos120^\\circ}\\cdot\\frac {143\\sqrt3}4 = \\frac {429\\sqrt3}{433}$. Therefore, the answer is $429+433+3=\\boxed{865}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's label the center of the circle as $O$. The circumradius of the circle is $2$, so $OA=OB=OC=2$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral, all three angles are $60^\\circ$. \nFrom $OA=OB=OC=2$, we know that $\\angle AOB=\\angle BOC=\\angle COA=120^\\circ$. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle A=\\angle B=\\angle C=60^\\circ$. \nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the side length of the triangle. \nLet $a=BC$, $b=CA$, $c=AB$ be the side lengths of the triangle. \nWe know that $a=b=c$, since $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral. \nThe Law of Cosines states that $a^2=b^2+c^2-2bc\\cos A$. \nFor an equilateral triangle, the law simplifies: $a^2=2b^2 - 2bc\\cos 60^\\circ$. \n\nThe next person should calculate the side length of the equilateral triangle by plugging in the known values and solving for $a$.",
