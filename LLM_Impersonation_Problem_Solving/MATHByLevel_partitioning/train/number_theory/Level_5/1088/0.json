You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be the set of all positive integers that have four digits in base $2$.\n",
    "solution": "Any number in $S$ has a leftmost (eights) digit that is equal to $1$. The remaining three digits can either be $0$ or $1$, so there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ elements in $S$. Notice that element $x$ in $S$ can be paired with another element $10111_2-x$, which is the base $2$ number whose right-most three digits are the opposite of those of $x$. Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is equal to $4 \\times 10111_2 = 100_2 \\times 10111_2 = \\boxed{1011100}_2$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that we are looking for four-digit numbers in base 2, we know that the range of possible numbers will be from $2^3=8$ to $2^4-1=15$. \nThe first step is to list out all the four-digit binary numbers from $2^3$ to $2^4-1$, which are from $1000_2$ to $1111_2$. \nNext, we need to convert these binary numbers to base 10 to see which ones are four-digit numbers. \n\nSince all the numbers in the range have 4 binary digits, we need to simply convert each of them into base 10 and check if they have exactly 4 digits. For example, 1000 in binary is 8 in base 10, which is a 1-digit number.",
