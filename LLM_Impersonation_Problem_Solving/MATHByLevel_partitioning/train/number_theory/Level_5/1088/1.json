    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be the set of all positive integers that have four digits in base $2$.What is the sum of all of the elements in $S$, when expressed in base $2$?\nGiven that we are looking for four-digit numbers in base 2, we know that the range of possible numbers will be from $2^3=8$ to $2^4-1=15$. \nThe first step is to list out all the four-digit binary numbers from $2^3$ to $2^4-1$, which are from $1000_2$ to $1111_2$. \nNext, we need to convert these binary numbers to base 10 to see which ones are four-digit numbers. \n\nSince all the numbers in the range have 4 binary digits, we need to simply convert each of them into base 10 and check if they have exactly 4 digits. For example, 1000 in binary is 8 in base 10, which is a 1-digit number.",
    "solution": "Any number in $S$ has a leftmost (eights) digit that is equal to $1$. The remaining three digits can either be $0$ or $1$, so there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ elements in $S$. Notice that element $x$ in $S$ can be paired with another element $10111_2-x$, which is the base $2$ number whose right-most three digits are the opposite of those of $x$. Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is equal to $4 \\times 10111_2 = 100_2 \\times 10111_2 = \\boxed{1011100}_2$.",
