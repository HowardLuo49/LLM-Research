The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind $10110_2\\times10100_2\\div10_2$.Express your answer in base 2.\nTo solve $10110_2\\times10100_2\\div10_2$, first convert $10110_2$ and $10100_2$ into base 10. \n\n$10110_2 = 1\\cdot2^4 + 0\\cdot2^3 + 1\\cdot2^2 + 1\\cdot2^1 + 0\\cdot2^0 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 22$\n\n$10100_2 = 1\\cdot2^4 + 0\\cdot2^3 + 1\\cdot2^2 + 0\\cdot2^1 + 0\\cdot2^0 = 16 + 4 = 20$\n\nNow multiply $22$ by $20$. \n\n$22 \\times 20 = 440$\n\nFinally, divide $440$ by $10$. \n\n$440 \\div 10 = 44$\n\nTherefore, $10110_2\\times10100_2\\div10_2 = 44_{10}$.",
    "solution": "It is much easier to find $10110_2\\div10_2$ and then multiply by $10100_2$ than it is to do the calculations in the original order. For $10110_2\\div10_2$, since the last digit of $10110_2$ is a 0, we can simply take it off to get $1011_2$. This is similar to base 10, where $10110_{10}\\div10_{10}=1011_{10}$. In base 2, each place represents a power of 2, and since we're dividing by 2, each place goes down by a power 2, so each digit shifts to the right. Now we find the product of $1011_2$ and $10100_2$. $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & &1 &0 & 1 & 1_2 & & \\\\\n& & & \\times & 1& 0 & 1& 0 & 0_2 \\\\\n\\cline{1-9}& & &1 &0 &1 &1 & & \\\\\n& & & & & &0 & & \\\\\n& 1 &\\stackrel{1}{0}&1 &1 &0 &0 &\\downarrow &\\downarrow \\\\\n\\cline{1-9}\n&1 &1 &0 &1 &1 &1 &0 &0_2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$The answer is $\\boxed{11011100_2}$.",
