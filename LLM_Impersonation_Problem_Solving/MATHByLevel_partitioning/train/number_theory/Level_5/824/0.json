You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind $10110_2\\times10100_2\\div10_2$.\n",
    "solution": "It is much easier to find $10110_2\\div10_2$ and then multiply by $10100_2$ than it is to do the calculations in the original order. For $10110_2\\div10_2$, since the last digit of $10110_2$ is a 0, we can simply take it off to get $1011_2$. This is similar to base 10, where $10110_{10}\\div10_{10}=1011_{10}$. In base 2, each place represents a power of 2, and since we're dividing by 2, each place goes down by a power 2, so each digit shifts to the right. Now we find the product of $1011_2$ and $10100_2$. $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & &1 &0 & 1 & 1_2 & & \\\\\n& & & \\times & 1& 0 & 1& 0 & 0_2 \\\\\n\\cline{1-9}& & &1 &0 &1 &1 & & \\\\\n& & & & & &0 & & \\\\\n& 1 &\\stackrel{1}{0}&1 &1 &0 &0 &\\downarrow &\\downarrow \\\\\n\\cline{1-9}\n&1 &1 &0 &1 &1 &1 &0 &0_2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$The answer is $\\boxed{11011100_2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve $10110_2\\times10100_2\\div10_2$, first convert $10110_2$ and $10100_2$ into base 10. \n\n$10110_2 = 1\\cdot2^4 + 0\\cdot2^3 + 1\\cdot2^2 + 1\\cdot2^1 + 0\\cdot2^0 = 16 + 4 + 2 = 22$\n\n$10100_2 = 1\\cdot2^4 + 0\\cdot2^3 + 1\\cdot2^2 + 0\\cdot2^1 + 0\\cdot2^0 = 16 + 4 = 20$\n\nNow multiply $22$ by $20$. \n\n$22 \\times 20 = 440$\n\nFinally, divide $440$ by $10$. \n\n$440 \\div 10 = 44$\n\nTherefore, $10110_2\\times10100_2\\div10_2 = 44_{10}$.",
