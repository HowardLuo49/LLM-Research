The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nGiven that\n\\begin{eqnarray*}&(1)& x\\text{ and }y\\text{ are both integers between 100 and 999, inclusive;}\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\\\     &(2)& y\\text{ is the number formed by reversing the digits of }x\\text{; and}\\\\     &(3)& z=|x-y|.\\end{eqnarray*}\nHow many distinct values of $z$ are possible?\nTo generate the integers x and y, we can loop through all possible values between 100 and 999 for x and check if y (the number formed by reversing the digits of x) falls within the same range. We can then calculate z using the absolute difference between x and y. Let's write a Python code that implements this plan.",
    "solution": "We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$. From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).",
