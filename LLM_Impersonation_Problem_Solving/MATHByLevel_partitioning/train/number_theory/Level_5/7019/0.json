    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ be the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of $75$ and has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, including $1$ and itself.\n",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \\cdot 5^2} = 16 \\cdot 27 = \\boxed{432}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $n$ is divisible by 75, we can express $n$ as $n = 3^a5^b$. Since $n$ has 75 divisors, we know that $75 = (a+1)(b+1)$. So, we need to find the smallest values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this equation. \n\nLet's first express 75 as a product of two factors in order to find potential values for $a$ and $b$. $75 = 3 \\times 25$.\n\nTherefore, we have the equations $a+1=3$ and $b+1=25$. Solving these, we get $a=2$ and $b=24$.\n\nSo, the next person should calculate $n = 3^2 \\times 5^{24}$ and check if it has exactly 75 divisors.",
