    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ be the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of $75$ and has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, including $1$ and itself.Find $\\frac{n}{75}$.\nGiven that $n$ is divisible by 75, we can express $n$ as $n = 3^a5^b$. Since $n$ has 75 divisors, we know that $75 = (a+1)(b+1)$. So, we need to find the smallest values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this equation. \n\nLet's first express 75 as a product of two factors in order to find potential values for $a$ and $b$. $75 = 3 \\times 25$.\n\nTherefore, we have the equations $a+1=3$ and $b+1=25$. Solving these, we get $a=2$ and $b=24$.\n\nSo, the next person should calculate $n = 3^2 \\times 5^{24}$ and check if it has exactly 75 divisors.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \\cdot 5^2} = 16 \\cdot 27 = \\boxed{432}$.",
    "gpt_response": "$n = 3^2 \\times 5^{24} = 2025 \\times 59604644775390625$.\n\nTo find the number of positive divisors of $n$, we use the formula $(a+1)(b+1)$ where $n=3^a5^b$. In this case, the number of positive divisors of $n$ is $(2+1)(24+1) = 3 \\times 25 = 75$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2025 \\times 59604644775390625}{75} = 2684354569262500$. \n\nThe solution is $\\boxed{2684354569262500}$.",
