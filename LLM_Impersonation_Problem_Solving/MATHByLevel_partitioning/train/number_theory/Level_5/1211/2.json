    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation.When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation.When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied.\nGiven that the band members are arranged in a rectangular formation with 8 rows and 2 unoccupied positions, we can form the equation $r \\times c = (r \\times 8) - 2$.\n\nNext, let's substitute the values given for $r=8$ into the equation and simplify to get a relationship between $c$ and the total number of band members.",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "$r \\times c = (8 \\times 8) - 2$\n\n$c \\times 8 = 62$\n\nNow, let's use the information that when the band members are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied to form a similar equation. We have $9 \\times c = (9 \\times 8) - 3 = 69$.\n\nNext, we will substitute the value of $c=69$ into the equation $c \\times 8 = 62$ to find the total number of band members.",
