The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$?Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $24$, inclusive.\nTo find $3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$, we need to find an integer $a$ such that $3a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nWe notice that $3 \\times 8 = 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}$, so $3^{-1} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{25}$.\nNow we can substitute $3^{-1} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{25}$ into the expression to simplify it: $8 + 8^2 \\pmod{25}$.",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",
    "gpt_response": "$3^{-1} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{25}$ is correct.\nNow, we need to find $8 + 8^2 \\pmod{25}$.\n$8^2 = 64 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$.\nTherefore, $8 + 8^2 \\equiv 8 + 14 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{25}$.\nSo, $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 22 \\pmod{25}$ when expressed as an integer from 0 to 24.",
