You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$?\n",
    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$, we need to find an integer $a$ such that $3a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nWe notice that $3 \\times 8 = 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}$, so $3^{-1} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{25}$.\nNow we can substitute $3^{-1} \\equiv 8 \\pmod{25}$ into the expression to simplify it: $8 + 8^2 \\pmod{25}$.",
