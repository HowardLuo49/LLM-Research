    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIf $f(x)$ is a function, then we define the function $f^{(n)}(x)$ to be the result of $n$ applications of $f$ to $x$, where $n$ is a positive integer.For example, $f^{(3)}(x)=f(f(f(x)))$.We define the $\\textit{order}$ of an input $x$ with respect to $f$ to be the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $f^{(m)}(x)=x$.Now suppose $f(x)$ is the function defined as the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $11$.\nTo find $f^{(3)}(x)$, we substitute $f^{(2)}(x)$ into $f(x)$ to get $f^{(3)}(x) = f(f^{(2)}(x)) = f(4x + 3) = 2(4x + 3) + 1 = 8x + 6 + 1 = 8x + 7$. Now, let's find $f^{(4)}(x)$ using this pattern.",
    "solution": "By computing the first few $f^{(n)}(5)$, we get \\begin{align*}\nf^{(1)}(5)=f(5) = 3,\\\\\nf^{(2)}(5)=f(f^{(1)}(5))=f(3)=9,\\\\\nf^{(3)}(5)=f(f^{(2)}(5))=f(9)=4,\\\\\nf^{(4)}(5)=f(f^{(3)}(5))=f(4)=5.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired order is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $f^{(4)}(x)$, we substitute $f^{(3)}(x)$ into $f(x)$ to get $f^{(4)}(x) = f(f^{(3)}(x)) = f(8x + 7) = 2(8x + 7) + 1 = 16x + 14 + 1 = 16x + 15 \\equiv 5x + 4 \\pmod {11}$. Given that the period of  is 5, because $f^{(4)}(x) = f(x)$, this allows us to start a cycle of values. This means $f(x) = f^{(4)}(x)$ for all $x$ which satisfies $f(x) = f^{(4)}(x)$.",
