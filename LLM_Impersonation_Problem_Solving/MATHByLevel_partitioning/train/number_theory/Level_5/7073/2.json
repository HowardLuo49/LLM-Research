The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$.For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$.How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\nThe sum of all integers in $S_i$ can be calculated as $S = \\frac{100}{2}(100i + (100(i+1) - 1)) = \\frac{100}{2}(100i + 100i + 100 - 1)$\nSimplifying further, $S = 50(200i + 99) = 10000i + 4950$.\nThe sum of all integers in $S_i$ is $10000i + 4950$.",
    "solution": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of sets $S_i$ that do not contain a perfect square, we need to consider the integers in each set $S_i$ that are perfect squares. \n\nFor each $i$, the perfect squares within the set $S_i$ are the integers of the form $100k^2$ where $i \\leq k < i+1$. \n\nIn order for the set $S_i$ to not contain a perfect square, the largest perfect square less than $100(i+1)$ should be $100i^2$.\n\nSince $100(i+1)-1$ is the largest integer in $S_i$, we need to check if $100i^2 < 100(i+1)-1$.\n\nThis simplifies to $100i^2 < 100i + 99$ which further simplifies to $i^2 < i + 0.99$.\n\nSolving this inequality for integer values of $i$, we find that $i = 0$ to $9$ satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are $10$ sets $S_i$ that do not contain a perfect square.",
