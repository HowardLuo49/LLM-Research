    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$.For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$.\nGiven $S_i = \\{n | 100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)\\}$, we can see that there are a total of $100$ integers in $S_i$.\nTo find the sum of all integers in $S_i$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nIn this case, $n = 100$ terms, $a_1 = 100i$, and $a_n = 100(i+1) - 1$.\nLet's calculate the sum and leave the result for the next person to use in solving the problem.",
    "solution": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "The sum of all integers in $S_i$ can be calculated as $S = \\frac{100}{2}(100i + (100(i+1) - 1)) = \\frac{100}{2}(100i + 100i + 100 - 1)$\nSimplifying further, $S = 50(200i + 99) = 10000i + 4950$.\nThe sum of all integers in $S_i$ is $10000i + 4950$.",
