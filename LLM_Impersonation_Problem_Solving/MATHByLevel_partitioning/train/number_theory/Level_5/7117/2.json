    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nYou are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$.Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence.Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\nOne approach to finding the smallest positive integers that have no common divisibility with any of the terms in the sequence is to consider the primes that appear in $P$. Since the product of all primes less than or equal to $61$ is known to us, the next step could be to go through the terms in the sequence $P+n$ and identify which primes appear in each term. This analysis will help in determining the prime factors that need to be avoided in the smallest positive integer.",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The product $P$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61= 2305567963945518424753102147331756070$. \nThere are $N$ primes appearing in the sequence. To determine $N$, we must analyze the prime factors of each term in the sequence $P+n$.\nFor each term, $P+n$, the smallest positive integer that has no common divisibility with it must not have any of the prime factors present in $P+n$.\nTherefore, $N$ is equal to the number of primes strictly smaller than the smallest prime factor of $P$. \nThe smallest prime factor of $P$ is $2$, and the number of primes less than $2$ is $0$. Hence, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0}$ is the correct answer.",
