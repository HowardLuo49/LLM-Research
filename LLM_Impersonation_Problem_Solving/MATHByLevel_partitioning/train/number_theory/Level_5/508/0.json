You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor positive integers $n$, let $f(n)$ return the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point.\n",
    "solution": "We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$. Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. If we multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10. Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10. If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10. For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10. Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.\n\nAs a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$. The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \\le x \\le 2010$. There are $\\boxed{2011}$ such integers.",
