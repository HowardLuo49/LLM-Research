You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible.\n",
    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that a standard six-sided die is rolled, the possible outcomes are numbers 1 through 6.\n\nThe product $P$ can range from $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120$ to $2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 720$.\n\nTo find the average product $\\overline{P}$ of the five numbers, we can calculate the sum of all possible products...\n\n$\\overline{P} = \\frac{120 + 720}{2} = 420$. \n\nNow, we will move on to the next step in solving the full problem.",
