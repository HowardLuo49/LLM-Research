    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThree different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors.\n",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing out the factors of each number to better understand the problem. \n\nLet's represent the factors of x as {1, a, x} where a is a prime number. \n\nSimilarly, let's represent the factors of y as {1, b, y} where b is a prime number. \n\nFinally, let's represent the factors of z as {1, c, z} where c is a prime number. \n\nSince each number has exactly three factors, a, b, and c must be distinct primes.\n\nTo find the possible values of x, y, and z, we need to find the numbers which have exactly three factors. \n\nFor a number to have exactly three factors, it must be a prime number squared. \n\nSo, the possible values of x, y, and z are numbers which are square of distinct prime numbers. \n\nThe next step would be to find all prime numbers such that their square is less than or equal to 100 (assuming we are looking at natural numbers). \n\nThen, we can create all possible combinations of x, y, and z as squares of these prime numbers. \n\nOnce we have all the possible combinations, we can check if they have exactly three factors each. \n\nThe final task would be to determine which of these combinations satisfy the given conditions of the problem.",
