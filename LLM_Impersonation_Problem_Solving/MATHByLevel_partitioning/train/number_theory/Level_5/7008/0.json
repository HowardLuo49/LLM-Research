You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "solution": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The first few terms of the sequence are:\n$1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 81, 82, 84, 85, \\ldots$\n\nObserving the sequence, we can see that the powers of 3 occur at $1, 3, 9, 27, 81, \\ldots$\n\nLet's denote the $n$th power of 3 as $3^n$. \n\nTo find the sum of distinct powers of 3, we need to find all the possible sums of the form $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} 3^{a_i}$ where $a_i$ are distinct positive integers.\n\nA plan to solve this problem could be to generate all possible sums of distinct powers of 3 up to a certain limit, then check if each of these sums are in the sequence and count how many terms there are.",
