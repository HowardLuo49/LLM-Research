The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe Lucas numbers $L_n$ are given by the recursion $L_0 = 2, L_1 = 1$, and $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$.Find the units digit of $L_{L_{10}}$.\nGiven the Lucas numbers $L_n$, the first few terms are $2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, ...$.\n\nTo find an explicit formula for the Lucas numbers, we can consider the characteristic equation of the recursion $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$.\n\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 = r + 1$, which simplifies to $r^2 - r - 1 = 0$.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots of the characteristic equation to be $r = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\nThus, the explicit formula for the Lucas numbers is $L_n = a\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n + b\\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n$ for constants $a$ and $b$.",
    "solution": "First, we need to find $L_{10}$. We find that \\begin{align*}L_2 &= L_1 + L_0 = 3,\\\\ L_3 &= L_2 + L_1 = 4,\\\\ L_4 &= 7,\\\\ L_5 &= 11,\\\\ L_6 &= 18,\\\\ L_7 &= 29,\\\\ L_8 &= 47,\\\\ L_9 &= 76,\\\\ L_{10} &= 123\\end{align*}Thus, $L_{L_{10}} = L_{123}$. To find its units digit, we continue listing more values in the sequence until we reach a pattern: the units digit of $L_{11}$ is that of $123 + 76$, and so is $9$; that of $L_{12}$ is $2$; and that of $L_{13}$ is $1$. Hence, the units digit repeats starting from here, with a period of $12$. As $123 = 12 \\times 10 + 3$, then the units digit of $L_{123}$ is the same as that of $L_3$, or $\\boxed{4}$.",
