The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x<m$.To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence.For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.The graphs of $$y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$$and $$y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$$on modulo $16$ graph paper have some points in common.What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of those points?\nFor $m=5$, there will be $5^2 = 25$ points on the modulo $5$ graph paper. Following similar pairs of residues for $x$ and $y$ as done for $m=4$, we can list them out to confirm the total number of points. This would help us understand the structure of the graph and provide a basis for analyzing the intersection of multiple congruences. Let's start listing out the pairs of residues for $x$ and $y$ modulo $5$.",
    "solution": "We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $y\\equiv 5x+2$ and $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. Thus, the $x$-coordinates in all such pairs satisfy $$5x+2 \\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}.$$Subtracting $5x+2$ from both sides of this congruence, we have $$0 \\equiv 6x+10\\pmod{16},$$which is equivalent to $$0 \\equiv 6x-6\\pmod{16}$$(since $10\\equiv -6\\pmod{16}$).\n\nThus the solutions we seek are values $x$ in the range $0\\le x<16$ such that $16$ divides $6(x-1)$. The solutions are $x=1,$ $x=9,$ so the sum of $x$-coordinates is $1+9=\\boxed{10}$.\n\n(As a check, note that the pairs $(1,7)$ and $(9,15)$ satisfy both of the original congruences, so these are the points shared by the two graphs.)",
