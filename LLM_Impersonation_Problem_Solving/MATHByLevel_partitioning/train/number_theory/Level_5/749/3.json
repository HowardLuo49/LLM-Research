    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x<m$.To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence.For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.The graphs of $$y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$$and $$y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$$on modulo $16$ graph paper have some points in common.\nFor $m=4$, the number of points on the mod $4$ graph paper can be found by $4^2 = 16$. Let's list out all the pairs of residues for $x$ and $y$ to confirm this:\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\nSo, there are indeed $16$ points on the modulo $4$ graph paper. Now let's move on to calculate for $m=5$.",
    "solution": "We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $y\\equiv 5x+2$ and $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. Thus, the $x$-coordinates in all such pairs satisfy $$5x+2 \\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}.$$Subtracting $5x+2$ from both sides of this congruence, we have $$0 \\equiv 6x+10\\pmod{16},$$which is equivalent to $$0 \\equiv 6x-6\\pmod{16}$$(since $10\\equiv -6\\pmod{16}$).\n\nThus the solutions we seek are values $x$ in the range $0\\le x<16$ such that $16$ divides $6(x-1)$. The solutions are $x=1,$ $x=9,$ so the sum of $x$-coordinates is $1+9=\\boxed{10}$.\n\n(As a check, note that the pairs $(1,7)$ and $(9,15)$ satisfy both of the original congruences, so these are the points shared by the two graphs.)",
    "gpt_response": "For $m=5$, there will be $5^2 = 25$ points on the modulo $5$ graph paper. Following similar pairs of residues for $x$ and $y$ as done for $m=4$, we can list them out to confirm the total number of points. This would help us understand the structure of the graph and provide a basis for analyzing the intersection of multiple congruences. Let's start listing out the pairs of residues for $x$ and $y$ modulo $5$.",
