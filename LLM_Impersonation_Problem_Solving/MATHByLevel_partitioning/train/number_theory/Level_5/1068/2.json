The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$.What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?(Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)\nLet's find $11^1$, $11^2$, $11^3$, and $11^5$.\n$11^1 = 11$.\n$11^2 = 121$.\n$11^3 = 1331$.\n$11^5 = 161051$.\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern based only on these few calculated powers of 11. Let's try a few more powers to see if there's a more obvious pattern.",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
