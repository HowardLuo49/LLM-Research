    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCall an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$.How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?\nWe are given an integer $n$ which is said to be oddly powerful, meaning $n=a^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with $b$ being odd. To determine whether a number is oddly powerful, we need to consider the prime factorization of $n$ and see if all the exponents are odd. Let's consider an example to illustrate this concept. Let's say our number is 125. The prime factorization of 125 is $5^3$ which satisfies the condition of being oddly powerful since the exponent 3 is odd. So, for the next person, I recommend they start by finding the prime factorization of the given integer $n$ and check if all the exponents are odd.",
    "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of oddly powerful integers less than 2010, we can systematically go through each number from 1 to 2010 and check if it is oddly powerful using the method described earlier. Starting from 1, we see that 1 is raised to any power, odd or even, will still result in 1. Moving on to 2, the prime factorization of 2 is $2^1$, which is not oddly powerful since the exponent is even. Continuing this process for numbers 3, 4, 5, and so on, we can eventually count the total number of oddly powerful integers less than 2010. I suggest the next steps involve creating a systematic way to check each number efficiently to determine if it is oddly powerful or not.",
