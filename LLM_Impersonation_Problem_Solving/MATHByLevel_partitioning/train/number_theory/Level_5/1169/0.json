You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCall an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$.\n",
    "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
    "gpt_response": "We are given an integer $n$ which is said to be oddly powerful, meaning $n=a^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with $b$ being odd. To determine whether a number is oddly powerful, we need to consider the prime factorization of $n$ and see if all the exponents are odd. Let's consider an example to illustrate this concept. Let's say our number is 125. The prime factorization of 125 is $5^3$ which satisfies the condition of being oddly powerful since the exponent 3 is odd. So, for the next person, I recommend they start by finding the prime factorization of the given integer $n$ and check if all the exponents are odd.",
