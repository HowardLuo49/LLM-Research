    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $[r,s]$ denote the least common multiple of positive integers $r$ and $s$.Find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which $[a,b] = 1000$, $[b,c] = 2000$, and $[c,a] = 2000$.\nGiven positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, where $[a,b]=12$, $[b,c]=15$, $[a,c]=20$, we can start by prime factorizing the given least common multiples. Let's express $[a,b]$ as $2^2 \\cdot 3$, $[b,c]$ as $3 \\cdot 5$, and $[a,c]$ as $2^2 \\cdot 5$. \n\nNext, we can use the prime factorizations to set up equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since the least common multiple is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors in the numbers, we have $a=2^2 \\cdot 5 = 20$, $b=3 \\cdot 5 = 15$, and $c=2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12$. \n\nTherefore, the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are $20$, $15$, and $12$ respectively. The problem is now complete.",
    "solution": "It's clear that we must have $a = 2^j5^k$, $b = 2^m 5^n$ and $c = 2^p5^q$ for some nonnegative integers $j, k, m, n, p, q$. Dealing first with the powers of 2: from the given conditions, $\\max(j, m) = 3$, $\\max(m, p) = \\max(p, j) = 4$. Thus we must have $p = 4$ and at least one of $m, j$ equal to 3. This gives 7 possible triples $(j, m, p)$: $(0, 3, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4), (3, 3, 4), (3, 2, 4), (3, 1, 4)$ and $(3, 0, 4)$.\nNow, for the powers of 5: we have $\\max(k, n) = \\max(n, q) = \\max(q, k) = 3$. Thus, at least two of $k, n, q$ must be equal to 3, and the other can take any value between 0 and 3. This gives us a total of 10 possible triples: $(3, 3, 3)$ and three possibilities of each of the forms $(3, 3, n)$, $(3, n, 3)$ and $(n, 3, 3)$.\nSince the exponents of 2 and 5 must satisfy these conditions independently, we have a total of $7 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{70}$ possible valid triples.",
