    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen the digits in the number $2005$ are reversed we obtain the number $5002,$ and $5002 = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$, such that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three distinct primes.\n",
    "solution": "5002 factors to $2 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61$, which sums to 104.  Since 2 is the only even prime number, and we need the sum of these 3 distinct primes to be even, 2 must be one of these primes, meaning we need to look at pairs of primes that sum to 102.  We start with 3, subtract that from 102, and see if the resulting number is prime.  We need check only primes up to 51 in this manner because if the prime is greater than 51, its corresponding prime would be less than 51, meaning we would have found the pair already.  In this manner, we find the following 7 different pairs: $(5,97);(13,89);(19,83);(23,79);(29,73);(31,71);(43,59)$, and thus, there are $\\boxed{7 \\text{ distinct integers}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the number $2005 = 5 \\cdot 401$ and $5002 = 2 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61$, we find that this fact implies $a = 2, b = 41, c = 61$. However, $41$ and $61$ are not distinct primes. Thus, $2005$ and $5002$ cannot be the numbers we are looking for.",
