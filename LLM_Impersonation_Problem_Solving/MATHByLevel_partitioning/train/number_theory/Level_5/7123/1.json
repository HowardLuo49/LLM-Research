The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ is divided by $1000$, a remainder of $N$ is obtained.Determine the value of $N$.\nTo solve this problem, we can first notice that the sum $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ forms a geometric series with common ratio $7$. \nThe sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula $S_n = \\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$ where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms. \nIn this case, $a=1$, $r=7$, and $n=2005$.\nLet's calculate $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$.",

Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
