The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA natural number is abundant if it is less than the sum of its proper divisors.What is the smallest abundant number?\nGiven the definition of an abundant number, we can start by finding the proper divisors of a given natural number.\nLet's consider the example of the number 12. The proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\nNext, we need to calculate the sum of these proper divisors, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16.\nSince 16 is greater than 12, we can conclude that 12 is not an abundant number.",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check only composite numbers:\n\n$\\bullet$ For $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $6$, $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $12$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest abundant number, we can start checking natural numbers starting from 12 and moving upwards. Let's move on to the next number, 13, and find its proper divisors. The proper divisors of 13 are just 1. The sum is 1, which is less than 13. Therefore, 13 is not an abundant number. Let's move on to the number 14.\n\nThe proper divisors of 14 are 1, 2, and 7. The sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 7 = 10. Since 10 is less than 14, we can conclude that 14 is not an abundant number. \n\nLet's move on to the number 15.\n\nThe proper divisors of 15 are 1, 3, and 5. The sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Since 9 is less than 15, we can conclude that 15 is not an abundant number. \n\nLet's move on to the number 16.\n\nThe proper divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.

Therefore, 17 is not an abundant number. \n\nLet's move on to the number 18.\n\nThe proper divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. The sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 18, we can conclude that 18 is an abundant number. Therefore, the smallest abundant number is 18.",
