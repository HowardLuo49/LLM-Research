    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTwo positive integers $m$ and $n$ are chosen such that $m$ is the smallest positive integer with only two positive divisors and $n$ is the largest integer less than $100$ with exactly three positive divisors.\n",
    "solution": "For an integer to have only two positive divisors, it must be prime (the only positive divisors of a prime number are $1$ and itself). Since $2$ is the smallest positive prime, $m=2$. For a positive integer to have exactly three positive divisors, it must be in the form $p^2$ where $p$ is prime (its only factors would be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$). The largest $p^2$ less than $100$ is $7^2=49$. Thus, $n=49$ and $m+n=2+49=\\boxed{51}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $m$ is the smallest positive integer with only two positive divisors, it must be a prime number.\nLet's list out the prime numbers to find the smallest with only two positive divisors: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97$.\nThe only numbers with exactly two positive divisors are the primes themselves. Thus, $m$ must be $2$.\nNow, we need to find the largest integer less than $100$ with exactly three positive divisors.\nTo have exactly three positive divisors, the number must be the square of a prime number.\nLet's list out the squares of prime numbers less than $10$ to find the largest one less than $100$: $4, 9, 25, 49, 121$.\nThe largest one is $49$, so $n=49$. \nNow, the next person can use $m=2$ and $n=49$ to potentially find the relation between the two numbers in order to solve the problem.",
