    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTwo positive integers $m$ and $n$ are chosen such that $m$ is the smallest positive integer with only two positive divisors and $n$ is the largest integer less than $100$ with exactly three positive divisors.What is $m+n$?\nGiven that $m$ is the smallest positive integer with only two positive divisors, it must be a prime number.\nLet's list out the prime numbers to find the smallest with only two positive divisors: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97$.\nThe only numbers with exactly two positive divisors are the primes themselves. Thus, $m$ must be $2$.\nNow, we need to find the largest integer less than $100$ with exactly three positive divisors.\nTo have exactly three positive divisors, the number must be the square of a prime number.\nLet's list out the squares of prime numbers less than $10$ to find the largest one less than $100$: $4, 9, 25, 49, 121$.\nThe largest one is $49$, so $n=49$. \nNow, the next person can use $m=2$ and $n=49$ to potentially find the relation between the two numbers in order to solve the problem.",
    "solution": "For an integer to have only two positive divisors, it must be prime (the only positive divisors of a prime number are $1$ and itself). Since $2$ is the smallest positive prime, $m=2$. For a positive integer to have exactly three positive divisors, it must be in the form $p^2$ where $p$ is prime (its only factors would be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$). The largest $p^2$ less than $100$ is $7^2=49$. Thus, $n=49$ and $m+n=2+49=\\boxed{51}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the relation between $m$ and $n$ we need to recall that a positive integer $N$ can be expressed as $N=p^k$, where $p$ is prime and $k$ is a positive integer. The number of divisors of $N$ is given by $(k_1+1)(k_2+1)\\cdots(k_r+1)$, where $k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_r$ are the exponents in the prime factorization of $N$. \nFor $m=2$, the prime factorization is $2^1$, which has $1+1=2$ divisors, and for $n=49$, the prime factorization is $7^2$, which has $(2+1)(2+1)=9$ divisors.\nTherefore, the relation between $m$ and $n$ is that $n=m^3$.\nFinally, $m+n=2+49=\\boxed{51}$.",
