The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind $120_4\\times13_4\\div2_4$.Express your answer in base 4.\nGiven: $120_4\\times13_4\\div2_4$\nTo find the solution, we will first convert the numbers into base 10 to simplify the calculations. \n\n$120_4 = 1\\cdot4^2 + 2\\cdot4^0 = 16+2 = 18$\n\n$13_4 = 1\\cdot4^1 + 3\\cdot4^0 = 4+3 = 7$\n\n$2_4 = 2$\n\nNow we can perform the multiplication and division in base 10: \n\n$18 \\times 7 = 126$\n\n$126 \\div 2 = 63$\n\nHence, the solution is $63_{10}$.",
    "solution": "It is much easier to find $120_4\\div2_4$ and then multiply by $13_4$ than it is to do the calculations in the original order.
