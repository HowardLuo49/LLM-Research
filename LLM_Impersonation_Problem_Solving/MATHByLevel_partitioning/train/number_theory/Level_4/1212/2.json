    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTo express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$.The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$.If 400 were expressed as a sum of at least two distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?\nThe calculations done to express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2 are correct. \nGiven a different number, say 30, find its binary representation and identify the positions of the 1s, then express it as a sum of different powers of 2. \nThe binary representation of 30 is 11110, so 30 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1. \nThis problem can be repeated for other numbers to practice on various cases.",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 400 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 400 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 400 is $2^8=256$.  The difference between 400 and 256 is 144. The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7=128$.  The difference between 144 and 128 is 16.  Since $16=2^4$, we have found that $400=2^8+2^7+2^4$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the binary representation of 400 is 110010000, the sum of the exponents of the powers of 2 used to express 400 as a sum would be 9, 10, and 6 for a total sum of 25.",
