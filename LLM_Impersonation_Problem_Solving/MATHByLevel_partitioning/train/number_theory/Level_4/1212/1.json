    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTo express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$.The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$.\nGiven that, let's consider the binary representation of 20: 10100. This can help us identify the powers of 2 that add up to 20. \n\nThe binary representation of 20 is 10100, which means that $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$.\n\nTo express a number as a sum of different powers of 2, we need to find the binary representation of the number and identify the positions of the 1s to determine which powers of 2 are needed.\n\nWe know that $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. \n\nLooking at the binary representation of 20 (10100), we see that there are 1s in the 4th and 2nd positions.\n\nTo fully express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2, we can write it as $20 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1$. \n\nNext steps: Verify the correctness of the calculations and provide a plan for expressing a different number as a sum of different powers of 2.",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 400 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 400 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 400 is $2^8=256$.  The difference between 400 and 256 is 144. The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7=128$.  The difference between 144 and 128 is 16.  Since $16=2^4$, we have found that $400=2^8+2^7+2^4$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The calculations done to express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2 are correct. \nGiven a different number, say 30, find its binary representation and identify the positions of the 1s, then express it as a sum of different powers of 2. \nThe binary representation of 30 is 11110, so 30 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1. \nThis problem can be repeated for other numbers to practice on various cases.",
