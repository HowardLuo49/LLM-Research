The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA two-digit integer $AB$ equals $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the three-digit integer $AAB$, where $A$ and $B$ represent distinct digits from 1 to 9.What is the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer $AAB$?\nGiven that $AB = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot AAB$, we can express $AAB$ as $9 \\cdot AB$. \n\nTo determine what values $A$ and $B$ can take on, we can start by listing out all two-digit multiples of 9.\n\nMultiples of 9: 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90\n\nNext, we need to find which of these multiples have the property that $AB = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot AAB$. \n\nLet's start checking each multiple to see if there is a valid pair $A$ and $B$ that satisfies the given conditions.",
    "solution": "We rewrite $AB$ as $10A+B$ and $AAB$ as $100A+10A+B$. Now we set $AAB=9\\cdot AB$ since $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of $AAB$. \\begin{align*}\n100A+10A+B&=9(10A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=90A+9B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5A&=2B\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ such that $5A=2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$. So $AAB=\\boxed{225}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by looking at the first multiple of 9, which is 18. In this case, $A = 1$ and $B = 8$. \n\nHowever, the problem states that $A$ and $B$ must be distinct digits from 1 to 9. This means that 1 cannot be used as both $A$ and $B$. \n\nMoving on to the next multiple of 9, which is 27. Here, $A = 2$ and $B = 7$, which are distinct digits. \n\nThus, the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer $AAB$ where $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits is $\\boxed{277}$.",
