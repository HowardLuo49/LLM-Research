    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe prime numbers are added in order starting with $2$: $2$, $2 + 3$, $2 + 3 + 5$, and so on.\n",
    "solution": "Approach this problem systematically: 2 is prime, 2+3=5 is prime, 5+5=10 is composite, 10+7=17 is prime, 17+11=28 is composite, 28+13=41 is prime, 41+17=58 is composite, 58+19=77 is composite, 77+23=100 is composite, 100+29=129 is composite, 129+31=160 is composite, and finally 160+37=197 is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{5}$ of the first 12 such sums are prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the sum of the first $n$ prime numbers can be represented by the formula $S_n = \\frac{n^2}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}$.\nLet's compute the sum of the first $10$ prime numbers using the formula $S_{10} = \\frac{10^2}{2} + \\frac{10}{2} = 50 + 5 = 55$.\nNow, let's find the prime factorization of the result $55$ to see if it leads to any insights for the next part of the problem.",
