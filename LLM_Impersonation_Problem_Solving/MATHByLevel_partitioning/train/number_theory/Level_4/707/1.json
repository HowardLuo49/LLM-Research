The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe prime numbers are added in order starting with $2$: $2$, $2 + 3$, $2 + 3 + 5$, and so on.How many of the first 12 such sums are also prime?\nGiven that the sum of the first $n$ prime numbers can be represented by the formula $S_n = \\frac{n^2}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}$.\nLet's compute the sum of the first $10$ prime numbers using the formula $S_{10} = \\frac{10^2}{2} + \\frac{10}{2} = 50 + 5 = 55$.\nNow, let's find the prime factorization of the result $55$ to see if it leads to any insights for the next part of the problem.",
    "solution": "Approach this problem systematically: 2 is prime, 2+3=5 is prime, 5+5=10 is composite, 10+7=17 is prime, 17+11=28 is composite, 28+13=41 is prime, 41+17=58 is composite, 58+19=77 is composite, 77+23=100 is composite, 100+29=129 is composite, 129+31=160 is composite, and finally 160+37=197 is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{5}$ of the first 12 such sums are prime.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of $55$ is $5 \\times 11$.\nSo out of the first $10$ prime sums, we have $3$ prime sums: $2, 2+3, 2+3+5$.\nNow we need to find the prime sums of the first $12$ prime numbers.\nWe know that any sum greater than $2$ is not prime since it would be divisible by $2$. \nTherefore, the only prime sums out of the first $12$ are $2$, $2+3$, $2+3+5$, $2+3+5+7$, $2+3+5+7+11$, $2+3+5+7+11+13$.\nSo, there are $6$ prime sums out of the first 12 such sums that are also prime.",
