The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$, as a residue modulo 185.(Give an answer between 0 and 184, inclusive.)\nLet's start by finding the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185. \n\nWe want to find $x$ such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nTo do this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor and the coefficients of Bezout's identity. \n\nLet's apply the extended Euclidean algorithm to 2 and 185. \n\nStarting with 185 = 2*92 + 1, the remainder is 1 so the previous remainder, 1 is the GCD.\n\nGoing back through the calculations, we can determine the coefficients for 1 = 185 + (-92)2. This gives us 1 = 185 - 92*2. \n\nTherefore, the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185 is -92, or 93 in modulo 185.",
