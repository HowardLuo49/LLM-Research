    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10.\n",
    "solution": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$, and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10, we can start by listing out the possible values of $x$ and $y$.\nSince $x$ and $y$ are both less than 10, we can have $x$ take on values from 2 to 7 and $y$ take on values from 2 to 9. \n\nTo find the possible combinations of $x$ and $y$, we need to check which combinations result in a three-digit number when multiplied by $10x+y$.",
