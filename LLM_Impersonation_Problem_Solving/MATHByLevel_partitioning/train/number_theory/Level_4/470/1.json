The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $a-b=6$ and $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) = 9$.Find the smallest possible value of $b$.\nSince $a-b=6$, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$ as $a = b + 6$. \nLet $d = \\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right)$. \nThen $d$ must divide both $\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}$ and $ab$. \nWe know that $d = 9$, so $9$ must divide both $\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}$ and $ab$. \nSince $9$ divides $ab$, either $3$ or $9$ must divide $a$ or $b$ (or both).",
    "solution": "Recall that $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. By the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) &= \\text{gcd}(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(a^2-2ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}((a-b)^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(36, ab).\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Trying values of $b$,  we find that $b = 1 \\Rightarrow a=7$ and $ab = 7\\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 1$. If $b = 2$, then $a=8$ and $ab=16 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 4$. Finally, $b = 3 \\Rightarrow a=9$ and $ab=27 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $b$ is  $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $a = b + 6$, $9$ divides $b(b+6)$, implying that either $3$ or $9$ divides $b$ or $b+6$. \nWe can test values of $b$ to find that the smallest positive integer $b$ such that either $3$ or $9$ divides $b$ or $b+6$ is $6$. \nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
