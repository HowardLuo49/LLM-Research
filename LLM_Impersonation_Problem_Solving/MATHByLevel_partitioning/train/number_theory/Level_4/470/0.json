    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $a-b=6$ and $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) = 9$.\n",
    "solution": "Recall that $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. By the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) &= \\text{gcd}(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(a^2-2ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}((a-b)^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(36, ab).\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Trying values of $b$,  we find that $b = 1 \\Rightarrow a=7$ and $ab = 7\\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 1$. If $b = 2$, then $a=8$ and $ab=16 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 4$. Finally, $b = 3 \\Rightarrow a=9$ and $ab=27 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $b$ is  $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $a-b=6$, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$ as $a = b + 6$. \nLet $d = \\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right)$. \nThen $d$ must divide both $\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}$ and $ab$. \nWe know that $d = 9$, so $9$ must divide both $\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}$ and $ab$. \nSince $9$ divides $ab$, either $3$ or $9$ must divide $a$ or $b$ (or both).",
