The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA divisor of a number is a proper divisor if it is not equal to the number.What is the sum of the proper divisors of $432$?\nPrevious work: The number in question is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\nPlan: To find all proper divisors of a number, start by finding all divisors of the number. Then, remove the number itself from the list to obtain the proper divisors. \n\nNext step: Find all divisors of the number provided in the problem statement.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $432 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3)$, as each factor of $432$ is represented when the product is expanded. We have to subtract $432$ so that we only count the proper divisors, so the answer is \\begin{align*}\n(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) - 432 &= (31)(40) - 432\\\\\n&= 1240 - 432\\\\\n&= \\boxed{808}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}",
