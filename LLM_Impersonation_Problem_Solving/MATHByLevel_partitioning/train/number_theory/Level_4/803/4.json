    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nNine stones are arranged in a straight line.They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10.The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17.The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on.The counting continues in this manner.\nI think it would be helpful to list out the distances that remain the same when counted from both left to right and right to left for the given arrangement of 9 stones. This will give us a better understanding of the pattern and help us identify the stones that are affected by the counting method. Let's work on listing these symmetric distances and determining the stones involved in each of them. Once we have this information, we can proceed to find a pattern and generalize the method for any number of stones in a similar arrangement.",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing out the distances that remain the same when counted from both left to right and right to left. \nThe symmetric distances are: 1-9, 2-8, 3-7, 4-6.\nNow, let's determine the stones involved in each of these symmetric distances:\n1-9: Stone 1 and Stone 9\n2-8: Stone 2 and Stone 8\n3-7: Stone 3 and Stone 7\n4-6: Stone 4 and Stone 6\n\nNext, let's analyze the pattern formed by the symmetric distances and see if we can discover any relationships or rules that govern the counting method described in the problem. We can then use this insight to derive a general formula for any number of stones in a similar arrangement.",
