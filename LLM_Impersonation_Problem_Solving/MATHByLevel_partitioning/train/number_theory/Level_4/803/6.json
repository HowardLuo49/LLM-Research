    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nNine stones are arranged in a straight line.They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10.The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17.The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on.The counting continues in this manner.Which of the original stones is counted as 99?Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone.\nThe pattern of symmetric distances suggests that the stone number counted as 99 will be part of a symmetric distance with another stone. Let's look for a symmetric distance that contains 99.\n\nSymmetric distances with 99:\n99-x = x-17\n99 = 2x-17\n2x = 116\nx = 58\n\nTherefore, the stone originally counted as 58 is counted as 99 in this pattern.",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "gpt_response": "Since we are looking for the original stone number counted as 99, we need to find the first digit assigned to stone number 58. The first digit assigned to stone number 58 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the original stone counted as 99 is stone number 58, and the answer is 5.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 3?: Since we are looking for the original stone number counted as 99, we need to find the first digit assigned to stone number 58. The first digit assigned to stone number 58 is 5.\n\nTherefore, the original stone counted as 99 is stone number 58, and the answer is 5.",
