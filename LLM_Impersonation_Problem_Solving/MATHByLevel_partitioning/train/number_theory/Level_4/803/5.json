    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nNine stones are arranged in a straight line.They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10.The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17.The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on.The counting continues in this manner.Which of the original stones is counted as 99?\nLet's start by listing out the distances that remain the same when counted from both left to right and right to left. \nThe symmetric distances are: 1-9, 2-8, 3-7, 4-6.\nNow, let's determine the stones involved in each of these symmetric distances:\n1-9: Stone 1 and Stone 9\n2-8: Stone 2 and Stone 8\n3-7: Stone 3 and Stone 7\n4-6: Stone 4 and Stone 6\n\nNext, let's analyze the pattern formed by the symmetric distances and see if we can discover any relationships or rules that govern the counting method described in the problem. We can then use this insight to derive a general formula for any number of stones in a similar arrangement.",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "gpt_response": "The pattern of symmetric distances suggests that the stone number counted as 99 will be part of a symmetric distance with another stone. Let's look for a symmetric distance that contains 99.\n\nSymmetric distances with 99:\n99-x = x-17\n99 = 2x-17\n2x = 116\nx = 58\n\nTherefore, the stone originally counted as 58 is counted as 99 in this pattern.",
