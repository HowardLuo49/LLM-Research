You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is $11111111_2+111111_2$?\n",
    "solution": "One could add them up by carrying in base $2$. But there is a simpler way. Note that the first number is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7$, which, by the formula for geometric series, is $2^8-1=256-1=255$. The second number is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5=2^6-1=64-1=63$. Thus the sum is $255+63=305+13=\\boxed{318}$.",
