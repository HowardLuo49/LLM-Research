The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is $11111111_2+111111_2$?Write your answer in base $10$.\nTo solve this problem, first convert the binary numbers to decimal. \n$11111111_2 = 1*2^7 + 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255$ \n$111111_2 = 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 63$ \n\nNow, add the two numbers together: $255 + 63 = 318$ \nSo, $11111111_2 + 111111_2 = 318$",
    "solution": "One could add them up by carrying in base $2$. But there is a simpler way. Note that the first number is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7$, which, by the formula for geometric series, is $2^8-1=256-1=255$. The second number is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5=2^6-1=64-1=63$. Thus the sum is $255+63=305+13=\\boxed{318}$.",
