The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCompute $10^{-1}\\pmod{1001}$.Express your answer as a residue from $0$ to $1000$, inclusive.\nTo find $10^{-1}\\pmod{1001}$, we want to find an integer $x$ such that $10x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$. \n\nFirst, we can calculate the greatest common divisor of $10$ and $1001$ using the Euclidean algorithm. $1001 = 10 \\times 100 + 1$. \n\n$1 = 1001 - 10 \\times 100 = 1001 - 10(100) = 1001 - 1000$. \n\nThus, the greatest common divisor of $10$ and $1001$ is $1$. \n\nSince $1$ divides $10$ and $1001$, $10$ does have a multiplicative inverse modulo $1001$. \n\nTherefore, $10^{-1}\\pmod{1001}$ exists and solving $10x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$ will give us the desired result.",
    "solution": "Notice that $1001=10\\cdot 100+1$. Therefore, $$10\\cdot 100\\equiv -1 \\pmod{1001},$$which implies that $$10\\cdot -100\\equiv 1\\pmod{1001}.$$The inverse of $10\\pmod{1001}$ is $-100$, but we need an answer in the interval from $0$ to $1000$. The equivalent residue in this interval is $-100+1001 = \\boxed{901}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: $10\\cdot 901 = 9010 = 9(1001)+1 \\equiv 1\\pmod{1001}$, so $901$ is indeed the inverse of $10\\pmod{1001}$.",
