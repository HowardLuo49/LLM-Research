You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCompute $10^{-1}\\pmod{1001}$.\n",
    "solution": "Notice that $1001=10\\cdot 100+1$. Therefore, $$10\\cdot 100\\equiv -1 \\pmod{1001},$$which implies that $$10\\cdot -100\\equiv 1\\pmod{1001}.$$The inverse of $10\\pmod{1001}$ is $-100$, but we need an answer in the interval from $0$ to $1000$. The equivalent residue in this interval is $-100+1001 = \\boxed{901}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: $10\\cdot 901 = 9010 = 9(1001)+1 \\equiv 1\\pmod{1001}$, so $901$ is indeed the inverse of $10\\pmod{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $10^{-1}\\pmod{1001}$, we want to find an integer $x$ such that $10x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$. \n\nFirst, we can calculate the greatest common divisor of $10$ and $1001$ using the Euclidean algorithm. $1001 = 10 \\times 100 + 1$. \n\n$1 = 1001 - 10 \\times 100 = 1001 - 10(100) = 1001 - 1000$. \n\nThus, the greatest common divisor of $10$ and $1001$ is $1$. \n\nSince $1$ divides $10$ and $1001$, $10$ does have a multiplicative inverse modulo $1001$. \n\nTherefore, $10^{-1}\\pmod{1001}$ exists and solving $10x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$ will give us the desired result.",
