The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $n = 2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 4^6\\cdot 6^7$.How many natural-number factors does $n$ have?\nGiven $n = 2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 4^6 \\cdot 6^7$, notice that $4 = 2^2$ and $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$, so we can rewrite $n$ as $2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot (2^2)^6 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3)^7$. \n\nSimplify further to get $2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 3^7$.\n\nCombine the exponents to get $2^{4+12} \\cdot 3^{5+7}$.\n\nSimplify to get $2^{16} \\cdot 3^{12}$.",
    "solution": "Prime factorizing gives $n = 2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$. Since any positive factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ where $0 \\le a \\le 23$ and $0 \\le b \\le 12$, there are $(23+1)(12+1) = 24 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{312}$.",
