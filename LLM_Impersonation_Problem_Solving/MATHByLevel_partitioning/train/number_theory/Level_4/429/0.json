You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $n = 2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 4^6\\cdot 6^7$.\n",
    "solution": "Prime factorizing gives $n = 2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$. Since any positive factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ where $0 \\le a \\le 23$ and $0 \\le b \\le 12$, there are $(23+1)(12+1) = 24 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{312}$.",
