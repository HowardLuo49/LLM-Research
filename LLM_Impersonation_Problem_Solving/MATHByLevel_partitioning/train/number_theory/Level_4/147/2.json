    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEach pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.\nTo find out how many packs of hot dogs and hot dog buns Phil buys, we can divide the total number of hot dogs and buns needed by the number in each pack. \nSince each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs, we would need 40 hot dogs \u00f7 10 hot dogs per pack = 4 packs of hot dogs. \nSimilarly, since each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns, we would need 40 buns \u00f7 8 buns per pack = 5 packs of hot dog buns. \n\nTherefore, Phil buys 4 packs of hot dogs and 5 packs of hot dog buns for the barbecue.",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The total number of hot dogs and buns needed is 40 hot dogs + 40 buns = 80 items.\nPhil has 4 hot dogs left over, so he must have bought 80 items - 4 items = 76 items.\nTo find out how many packs of hot dogs and hot dog buns Phil buys, we can divide the total number of hot dogs and buns needed by the number in each pack: 76 items \u00f7 (10 hot dogs + 8 buns) = 76/18 = 4 r 4.\nSince Phil bought 5 packs of hot dog buns in the previous calculation, there is an error. Let's go back and recheck the calculations.",
