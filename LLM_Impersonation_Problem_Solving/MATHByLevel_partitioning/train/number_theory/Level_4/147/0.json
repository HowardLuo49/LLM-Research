You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEach pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.\n",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs and each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns, we can calculate that in order to have an equal number of hot dogs and buns, we would need a number that is divisible by both 10 and 8, which is the least common multiple of 10 and 8. \nThe LCM of 10 and 8 is 40, so in order to have an equal number of hot dogs and buns, we would need 40 hot dogs and 40 buns.",
