    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nEach pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?\nThe total number of hot dogs and buns needed is 40 hot dogs + 40 buns = 80 items.\nPhil has 4 hot dogs left over, so he must have bought 80 items - 4 items = 76 items.\nTo find out how many packs of hot dogs and hot dog buns Phil buys, we can divide the total number of hot dogs and buns needed by the number in each pack: 76 items \u00f7 (10 hot dogs + 8 buns) = 76/18 = 4 r 4.\nSince Phil bought 5 packs of hot dog buns in the previous calculation, there is an error. Let's go back and recheck the calculations.",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The correct calculation should be 76 items \u00f7 (10 hot dogs + 8 buns) = 76/18 = 4 r 4. This means Phil bought a total of 4 packs of hot dogs and hot dog buns, not 5. However, since we are looking for the SECOND smallest number of packs he could have bought, we need to consider the next possibility. \n\nIf Phil had bought one less pack of hot dogs and one more pack of hot dog buns, he would have bought 3 packs of hot dogs and 5 packs of hot dog buns. This would give him a total of 30 hot dogs and 40 buns, which equals 70 items. Since he has 4 hot dogs left over, the total items needed would be 70 + 4 = 74 items.\n\nDividing the total items needed by the number in each pack gives 74 items \u00f7 (10 hot dogs + 8 buns) = 74/18 = 4 r 2. \n\nTherefore, the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs Phil could have bought is 3 packs.",
