The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5?(Express your answer in base 8.)\nLet's start by listing out the 3-digit numbers in base 8 to see if we can find any patterns or divisibility rules that can help us determine which ones are divisible by 5.\nThe numbers 100 to 777 are the possible 3-digit numbers in base 8 (or octal).\nNext, let's convert these numbers to base 10 to see what they are equivalent to in our familiar decimal system. This will help us determine if they are divisible by 5.\nLet's divide each converted base 10 number by 5 and see if there are any remainders to narrow down our search for the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5.",
    "solution": "The greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer is $777_8$, which is equal to $7 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 7 = 511$.  This number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so we subtract 1, to get $\\boxed{776_8}$.",
