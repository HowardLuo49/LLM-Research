    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$.How many of its positive integer factors are perfect squares?\nGiven the prime factorization of 2160, I can calculate the total number of factors it has by adding 1 to each of the exponents and multiplying them together. \nThe total number of factors of 2160 is (4 + 1)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 * 4 * 2 = 40 factors. \nI can now leave this information for the next person to further analyze the problem.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "There is an error in the work done so far. To find the total number of factors of 2160, you need to multiply the factors of each prime in its prime factorization, not add them. \n\nThe prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. \n\nTo find the total number of factors, we calculate (4+1)(3+1)(1+1) = 5*4*2 = 40 factors.\n\nTo find the number of positive integer factors that are perfect squares, we look for factors where each of the exponents in the prime factorization is even. In this case, the exponents of 2 and 3 need to be even for a factor to be a perfect square.\n\nFor the exponent of 2 to be even, it can be 0, 2, or 4. For the exponent of 3 to be even, it can be 0 or 2. Since the exponent of 5 is odd, it cannot contribute to making a perfect square factor.\n\nThe number of positive integer factors that are perfect squares is calculated by (3)(2) = 6. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares is 6.",
