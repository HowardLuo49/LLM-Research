You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$.\n",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the prime factorization of 2160, I can calculate the total number of factors it has by adding 1 to each of the exponents and multiplying them together. \nThe total number of factors of 2160 is (4 + 1)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 * 4 * 2 = 40 factors. \nI can now leave this information for the next person to further analyze the problem.",
