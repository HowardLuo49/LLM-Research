You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the units digit of the sum of the nine terms of the sequence $1!+ 1, \\, 2!+ 2, \\, 3!+ 3, \\, ..., \\, 8!+ 8, \\, 9!\nThe units digit of each term is 1, and when we add 9 terms with a units digit of 1, we get $9 \\times 1 = 9$. Thus, the units digit of the sum of the nine terms of the sequence $1!+ 1, \\, 2!+ 2, \\, 3!+ 3, \\, ..., \\, 8!$ is $9$.",
    "solution": "For $n\\ge5$, $n!$ includes the product $2\\times5=10$, which means the units digit of $n!$ is 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0). The units digits of $1!+ 2!+3!+4!$ is the units digit of $1+2+6+4=13$, which is 3. The units digit of the sum $1+2+\\ldots+9=\\frac{9(1+9)}{2}=45$ is 5. Therefore, the units digit of $(1!+1)+(2!+2)+\\ldots+(9!+9)= (1!+2!+\\ldots+9!)+(1+2+\\ldots+9)$ is $3+5=\\boxed{8}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $9!$ we need to evaluate $9!$ and look at the units digit. $9! = 362880$, so the units digit of $9!$ is $0$. Adding the units digit of $9!$ to the sum of the first 8 terms we found earlier, we get the units digit of the sum of the sequence $1!+1, 2!+2, ..., 9!$ is $9 + 0 = 9$.",
