You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the units digit of the sum of the nine terms of the sequence $1!+ 1, \\, 2!+ 2, \\, 3!\nTo find the units digit of the sum of the sequence $1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111, 1111111, 11111111, 111111111$, we can first look at a few properties of addition and units digit.\n\n1. Sum of a unit digit number (1-digit) and a two-digit number:\nLet's consider how the units digits add up when you add a 1-digit number to a 2-digit number. For example, 4 + 18 = 22. The unit digit of 4 added to the unit digit of 8 (2) gives the units digit of the sum.\n\n2. Sum of two n-digit numbers:\nThe unit's place of a sum of two n-digit numbers is just the sum of the digits in the unit's place of each number. E.g., 45 + 67 = 112. The units digit of the sum is 5 (from 45) + 7 = 12.\n\nUse this knowledge to calculate the units digit for each addition in the sequence. Then, sum these units digits to find the final units digit of the full sum.",
    "solution": "For $n\\ge5$, $n!$ includes the product $2\\times5=10$, which means the units digit of $n!$ is 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0). The units digits of $1!+ 2!+3!+4!$ is the units digit of $1+2+6+4=13$, which is 3. The units digit of the sum $1+2+\\ldots+9=\\frac{9(1+9)}{2}=45$ is 5. Therefore, the units digit of $(1!+1)+(2!+2)+\\ldots+(9!+9)= (1!+2!+\\ldots+9!)+(1+2+\\ldots+9)$ is $3+5=\\boxed{8}.$",
