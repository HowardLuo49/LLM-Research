The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind $73^{-1} \\pmod{74}$, as a residue modulo 74.(Give an answer between 0 and 73, inclusive.)\nSince $73$ is relatively prime to $74$, we know that $73$ has an inverse modulo 74. To find $73^{-1} \\pmod{74}$, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $73x + 74y = 1$. Then, $x$ will be the inverse of $73$ modulo 74.
