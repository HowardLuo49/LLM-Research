You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind $73^{-1} \\pmod{74}$, as a residue modulo 74.\n",
    "solution": "Since $73^2 \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{74}$, $73^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{73} \\pmod{74}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $73$ is relatively prime to $74$, we know that $73$ has an inverse modulo 74. To find $73^{-1} \\pmod{74}$, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $73x + 74y = 1$. Then, $x$ will be the inverse of $73$ modulo 74. Let's start by finding the greatest common divisor of 73 and 74.",
