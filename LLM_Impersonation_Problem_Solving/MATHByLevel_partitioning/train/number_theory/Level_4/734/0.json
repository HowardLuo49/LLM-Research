    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAn abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.\n",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the definition of an abundant number, we can start by calculating the sum of proper divisors for a few small positive integers to get a better understanding. Let's start by finding the proper divisors and their sum for the number 12. \n\nFor the number 12, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16. Since 16 is greater than 12, we can confirm that 12 is an abundant number. \n\nNext, let's try to find a pattern or method for determining if a number is abundant or not based on its divisors. To do this, we can continue calculating the sum of proper divisors for a few more numbers and see if there are any similarities or differences in the results.",
