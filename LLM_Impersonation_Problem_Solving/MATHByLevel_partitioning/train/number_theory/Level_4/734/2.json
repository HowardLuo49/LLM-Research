    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAn abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$.What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?\nSince the next step is to find a pattern or method for determining if a number is abundant or not based on its divisors, let's calculate the sum of proper divisors for the number 18. \nThe proper divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. The sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21. Since 21 is greater than 18, we can confirm that 18 is also an abundant number.\nNow, let's try to generalize a method or rule to determine if a number is abundant or not without having to manually sum the proper divisors.",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if a number is abundant without having to manually sum the proper divisors, we can use the following rule: \nFor a number n, find the sum of all proper divisors less than n. If this sum is greater than n, then n is an abundant number.\nApplying this rule to the multiples of 6, we can see that any number that is a multiple of 6 will have a large sum of proper divisors due to the repeated factors of 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6 will be the smallest abundant number that is not divisible by 2 or 3.\nThe smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6 and not divisible by 2 or 3 is 20. This is because the proper divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10, with a sum of 22, which is greater than 20.\nTherefore, the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6 is 20.",
