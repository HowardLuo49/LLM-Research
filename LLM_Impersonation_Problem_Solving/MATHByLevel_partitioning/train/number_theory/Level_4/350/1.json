The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $N$ be the sum of the divisors of $200$.What is the largest prime factor of $N$?\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of $200$: $200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$.\nTo find the sum of the divisors, we can use the formula: \n$$\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{a_1}) \\cdot (1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{a_2}) \\cdots.$$\nHere, $p_i$ are the prime factors of $n$ and $a_i$ are their respective powers. \n\nTo find the sum of divisors of $200$, we calculate:\n$$(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3) \\cdot (1 + 5 + 5^2) = 15 \\cdot 31 = 465.$$\n\nTherefore, $N = 465$. The next step would be to ___________.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $200$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2$. It follows that $N = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 5 + 5^2)$, as each factor of $200$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that $N = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 5 + 25) = (15)(31)$. The largest prime factor is $\\boxed{31}$.",
