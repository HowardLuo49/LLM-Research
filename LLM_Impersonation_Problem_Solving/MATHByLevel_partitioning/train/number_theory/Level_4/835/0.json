You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $b$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to $2.$ When $197$ is converted to base $b$, the resulting representation has $4$ digits.\n",
    "solution": "We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\\leq b \\leq 5.$ So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first convert 197 to base $b.$ \n\nWe have $197 = a \\cdot b^3 + c \\cdot b^2 + d \\cdot b + e,$ where $a, c, d, e$ are digits in base $b.$ \n\nSince the result has 4 digits, $a$ must be greater than 0. \n\nTherefore, $197 = a \\cdot b^3 + c \\cdot b^2 + d \\cdot b + e \\geq b^3 \\Rightarrow b^3 \\leq 197.$ \n\nSince $b$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to $2,$ we can start testing values of $b$ starting from 2. Let's try to find the possible values of $b$ first.",
