The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $b$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to $2.$ When $197$ is converted to base $b$, the resulting representation has $4$ digits.What is the number of possible values for $b$?\nLet's first convert 197 to base $b.$ \n\nWe have $197 = a \\cdot b^3 + c \\cdot b^2 + d \\cdot b + e,$ where $a, c, d, e$ are digits in base $b.$ \n\nSince the result has 4 digits, $a$ must be greater than 0. \n\nTherefore, $197 = a \\cdot b^3 + c \\cdot b^2 + d \\cdot b + e \\geq b^3 \\Rightarrow b^3 \\leq 197.$ \n\nSince $b$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to $2,$ we can start testing values of $b$ starting from 2. Let's try to find the possible values of $b$ first.",
    "solution": "We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\\leq b \\leq 5.$ So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.",
    "gpt_response": "Using simple trial and error, we find that $b=5$ gives us $5^3 = 125$, which is less than $197$, but $6^3 = 216$ is greater than $197$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $b$ are $b=2,3,4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ possible values for $b$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 2?: Using simple trial and error, we find that $b=5$ gives us $5^3 = 125$, which is less than $197$, but $6^3 = 216$ is greater than $197$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $b$ are $b=2,3,4$.
