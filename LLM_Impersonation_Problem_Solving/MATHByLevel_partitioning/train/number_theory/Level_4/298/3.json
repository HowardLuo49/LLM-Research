You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the units digit of the sum, $$ 1!+ 2!+ 3!+ \\cdots + 2006!.\nThe current sum is $3$, so the units digit is $3$. \n\nNext, we need to find the units digit of $3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$.\n\nAdding 3 to the current sum of 3 gives us a new sum of 6.\n\nSo, the new sum is 6, which means the units digit is 6. \n\nTo find the units digit of the final sum, we can calculate $3 + 6 = 9$.",
    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "The next step is to find the units digit of $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$. \nAdding 9 to the current sum of 6 gives us a new sum of 15. \nSo, the new sum is 15, which means the units digit is 5. \nTo find the units digit of the final sum, we can calculate $9 + 5 = 14$.",
