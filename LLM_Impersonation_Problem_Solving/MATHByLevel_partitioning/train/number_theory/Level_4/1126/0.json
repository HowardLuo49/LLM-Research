You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nDetermine the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$.\n",
    "solution": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$, we need to divide $-811$ by $24$ and find the remainder. \n\nFirst, let's find the residue of $811\\pmod{24}$.\n\n$811\\div 24=33$ with a remainder of $19$, so the residue of $811\\pmod{24}$ is $19$.\n\nSince we are looking for the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$, it will be the additive inverse of $19$ modulo $24$. \n\nThus, the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$ is $24-19=5$. \n\nSo, the plan for the next person is to confirm the calculations for the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$.",
