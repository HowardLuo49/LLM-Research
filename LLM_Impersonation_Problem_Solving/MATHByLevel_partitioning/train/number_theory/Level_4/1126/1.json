The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nDetermine the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$.Your answer should be an integer in the range $0,1,2,\\ldots,22,23$.\nTo find the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$, we need to divide $-811$ by $24$ and find the remainder. \n\nFirst, let's find the residue of $811\\pmod{24}$.\n\n$811\\div 24=33$ with a remainder of $19$, so the residue of $811\\pmod{24}$ is $19$.\n\nSince we are looking for the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$, it will be the additive inverse of $19$ modulo $24$. \n\nThus, the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$ is $24-19=5$. \n\nSo, the plan for the next person is to confirm the calculations for the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$.",
    "solution": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24).",
