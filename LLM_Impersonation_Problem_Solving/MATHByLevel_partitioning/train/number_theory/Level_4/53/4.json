    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nJenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.\nThe calculation done previously was incorrect. Let's correct it. \n\nGiven that Jenny has a total of 8 stamp books and each book has 42 pages, and each page contains 6 stamps, the total number of stamps in all her books is:\n8 books * 42 pages/book * 6 stamps/page = 2016 stamps in total.\n\nAfter reorganizing her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps, the total number of stamps in all 8 books would be:\n8 books * 42 pages/book * 10 stamps/page = 3360 stamps in total after reorganizing.\n\nTo find out how many stamps Jenny has left after reorganizing, subtract the newly organized total from the original total:\n2016 total stamps - 3360 stamps after reorganizing = -1344 stamps left. Since the result is negative, it indicates that Jenny needs 1344 more stamps to have 10 stamps per page in all her books. So, Jenny has -1344 stamps left after organizing her stamp books.",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To correct the mistake and find out how many stamps Jenny has left after reorganizing, we should add the two results (original total and after reorganizing) instead of subtracting. So, the correct calculation should be:\n\n2016 total stamps + 3360 stamps after reorganizing = 5376 stamps in total.\n\nTherefore, Jenny has 5376 stamps in total after reorganizing her stamp books.",
