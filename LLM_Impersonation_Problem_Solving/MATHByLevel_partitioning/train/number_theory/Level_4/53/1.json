    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nJenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.\nLet's start by finding the total number of pages in all 8 stamp books. \nThis can be done by multiplying the number of pages in one stamp book by the total number of stamp books. \nSo, 42 pages/book x 8 books = 336 pages in total. \nNext, we want to find the total number of stamps in all of the stamp books. \nEach page has 6 stamps on it, so we can multiply the total number of pages by the number of stamps on each page. \n336 pages x 6 stamps = 2016 stamps in total. \nNow, the problem states that Jenny has lost 16 stamps. \nTo find out how many stamps she has left, we would simply subtract the number of lost stamps from the total. \nTherefore, 2016 stamps - 16 lost stamps = 2000 stamps left.",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Next, let's determine how many stamps are needed in order to fill all 8 stamp books. \nSince each page contains 6 stamps and there are 42 pages per book, we can calculate the total number of stamps in one book first. \n42 pages/book x 6 stamps/page = 252 stamps in one book. \nNow, to find the total number of stamps needed for all 8 books, we multiply the number of stamps per book by the total number of books. \n252 stamps/book x 8 books = 2016 stamps required to fill all 8 stamp books completely. \nThis means that Jenny already has the exact number of stamps needed to fill her books, so the number of stamps she has left is enough.",
