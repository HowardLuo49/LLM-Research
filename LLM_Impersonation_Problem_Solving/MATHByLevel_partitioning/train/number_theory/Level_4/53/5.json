    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nJenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.\nTo correct the mistake and find out how many stamps Jenny has left after reorganizing, we should add the two results (original total and after reorganizing) instead of subtracting. So, the correct calculation should be:\n\n2016 total stamps + 3360 stamps after reorganizing = 5376 stamps in total.\n\nTherefore, Jenny has 5376 stamps in total after reorganizing her stamp books.",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Now, in order to find out how many stamps Jenny started with before reorganizing, we need to subtract the 3360 stamps she added during the reorganization from the total of 5376 stamps. \n\n5376 total stamps - 3360 stamps added = 2016 stamps initially.\n\nTherefore, Jenny started with 2016 stamps before reorganizing her stamp books.",
