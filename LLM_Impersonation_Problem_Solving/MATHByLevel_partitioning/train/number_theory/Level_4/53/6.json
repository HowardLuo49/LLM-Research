    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nJenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.How many stamps are on that last page?\nNow, in order to find out how many stamps Jenny started with before reorganizing, we need to subtract the 3360 stamps she added during the reorganization from the total of 5376 stamps. \n\n5376 total stamps - 3360 stamps added = 2016 stamps initially.\n\nTherefore, Jenny started with 2016 stamps before reorganizing her stamp books.",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since Jenny originally had 8 stamp books, each containing 42 pages with 6 stamps per page, the total number of stamps she had initially can be calculated as:\n\n8 books * 42 pages/book * 6 stamps/page = 2016 stamps\n\nTherefore, Jenny started with 2016 stamps before reorganizing her stamp books.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 6?: Since Jenny originally had 8 stamp books, each containing 42 pages with 6 stamps per page, the total number of stamps she had initially can be calculated as:\n\n8 books * 42 pages/book * 6 stamps/page = 2016 stamps\n\nTherefore, Jenny started with 2016 stamps before reorganizing her stamp books.",
