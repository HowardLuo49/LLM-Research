The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nExpress $249_{11}+3AB_{12}$ as a base 10 integer.Here $A$ and $B$ denote the digits whose values are 10 and 11, respectively, in base 12.\nGiven that $249_{11} = 2(11^2) + 4(11^1) + 9(11^0)$, we can calculate that $249_{11} = 2(121) + 4(11) + 9(1) = 242 + 44 + 9 = 295$.\n\nLet's convert $3AB_{12}$ to base 10. Since $A$ represents the number 10 in base 10, we have $3AB_{12} = 3(12^2) + 10(12^1) + B(12^0)$.\n\nSolving further, $3(12^2) + 10(12^1) + B(12^0) = 432 + 120 + B = 552 + B$.\n\nSo, the expression $249_{11}+3AB_{12} = 295 + 552 + B$.",
    "solution": "We have that \\begin{align*} 249_{11} &= 2(11^2)+ 4(11^1) +9(11^0) \\\\\n&= 2(121)+4(11)+9(1)\\\\\n&= 242 + 44 + 9\\\\\n&= 295\\\\\n3AB_{12} &= 3(12^2)+ 10(12^1) +11(12^0) \\\\\n&= 3(144)+10(12)+11(1)\\\\\n&= 432 + 120 + 11\\\\\n&= 563\n\\end{align*}So, $249_{11}+3AB_{12}=295+563=\\boxed{858}$.",
