You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe numbers 60, 221, and 229 are the legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle.\n",
    "solution": "We notice that $450=221+229,$ so that must be the connection.  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us  \\[60^2+221^2=229^2\\] so \\[229^2-221^2=60^2.\\] The difference of squares factorization tells us  \\[(229-221)(229+221)=3600\\] and taken modulo 3599 we get  \\[8\\cdot450\\equiv1\\pmod{3599}.\\] The answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the legs (a,b) and hypotenuse (c) of a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\nLet's use this information to set up equations involving the numbers 60, 221, and 229 and try to solve for the lengths of the legs.",
