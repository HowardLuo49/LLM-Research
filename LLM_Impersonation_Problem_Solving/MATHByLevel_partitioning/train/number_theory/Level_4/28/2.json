The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe numbers 60, 221, and 229 are the legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle.Find the multiplicative inverse to 450 modulo 3599.(Express your answer as an integer $n$ with $0\\leq n<3599$.)\nLet's denote the legs of the right triangle as a and b, and the hypotenuse as c.\n\nWe are given that a = 60, b = 221, and c = 229.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n60^2 + 221^2 = 229^2\n\nSimplify the equation:\n3600 + 48841 = 52441\n\nSo, the Pythagorean theorem holds true for the given values of a, b, and c.",
    "solution": "We notice that $450=221+229,$ so that must be the connection.  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us  \\[60^2+221^2=229^2\\] so \\[229^2-221^2=60^2.\\] The difference of squares factorization tells us  \\[(229-221)(229+221)=3600\\] and taken modulo 3599 we get  \\[8\\cdot450\\equiv1\\pmod{3599}.\\] The answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
