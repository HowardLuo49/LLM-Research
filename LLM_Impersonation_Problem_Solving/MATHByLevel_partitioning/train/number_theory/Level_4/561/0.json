    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe product of positive integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ equals 2004.\n",
    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The first step is to prime factorize 2004: $2004 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 167$. \n\nNext, we can consider the possible values for $x$, $y$, and $z$ based on the prime factorization. \n\nSince the product of $x$, $y$, and $z$ is 2004, we know that they must all be factors of 2004. \n\nLet's continue by listing out all the factors of 2004 and see if we can form any triples that multiply to 2004.",
