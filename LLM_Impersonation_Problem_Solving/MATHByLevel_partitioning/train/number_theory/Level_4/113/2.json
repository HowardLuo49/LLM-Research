    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $m$ be the smallest positive, three-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11).Let $n$ be the smallest positive, four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11).What is $n-m$?\nWe'll continue incrementing $k$ until we find a suitable three-digit number. When $k=2$, we get $m = 11(2) + 5 = 27$. This is still in the two-digit range.\n\nLet's try $k=3$: $m = 11(3) + 5 = 38$. This is also two digits, so we'll increase $k$ again.\n\nWhen $k=4$, $m = 11(4) + 5 = 49$. This is still in the two-digit range.\n\nWe see that it takes $k = 10$ to get a three-digit number for $m = 11(10) + 5 = 115$.\n\nSo, the smallest positive three-digit integer congruent to 5 mod 11 is 115. We have found $m$. Now we must find $n$. \n\nTo find $n$ we will follow a similar process as we did for $m$. Let's set up the equation $n = 11x + 5$. Our goal is to find the smallest positive four-digit integer that satisfies the congruence $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.",
    "solution": "Both $m$ and $n$ can be written in the form $11k+5$. For $m$, we have that $11k+5 \\ge 100$, so $k \\ge \\frac{95}{11}$, so since $k$ must be an integer, we have that $k = 9$, so $m = 11(9) + 5 = 104$. For $n$, we have that $11l+5 \\ge 1000$, so $l \\ge \\frac{995}{11}$, so since $l$ must be an integer, we have that $l = 91$, so $n = 11(91) + 5 = 1006$. Therefore, $n-m = 1006 - 104 = \\boxed{902}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since we know that $n$ is a four-digit integer, we can start by setting $x = 100$ to get $n = 11(100) + 5 = 1105$. This is a four-digit number, so we have found the smallest positive four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11).\n\nTherefore, $n = 1105$.\n\nTo find $n - m$, we simply subtract $m$ from $n$:\n\n$n - m = 1105 - 115 = 990$.\n\nTherefore, $n - m = \\boxed{990}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 902?: Since we know that $n$ is a four-digit integer, we can start by setting $x = 100$ to get $n = 11(100) + 5 = 1105$. This is a four-digit number, so we have found the smallest positive four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11).\n\nTherefore, $n = 1105$.\n\nTo find $n - m$, we simply subtract $m$ from $n$:\n\n$n - m = 1105 - 115 = 990$.\n\nTherefore, $n - m = \\boxed{990}$.",
