    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $m$ be the smallest positive, three-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11).Let $n$ be the smallest positive, four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11).\nGiven that $m \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$, we can express $m$ as $m = 11k + 5$, where $k$ is an integer. Let's find the smallest three-digit integer that satisfies this congruence. We need to find the smallest positive $k$ such that $11k + 5$ is a three-digit number. \n\nWe can start by setting $k = 1$ to find $m = 11(1) + 5 = 16$. \n\nHowever, since we are looking for the smallest positive three-digit integer, we can see that $k = 1$ results in a two-digit number. So, we need to increment $k$ and continue to find the smallest three-digit integer that satisfies the congruence $m \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.",
    "solution": "Both $m$ and $n$ can be written in the form $11k+5$. For $m$, we have that $11k+5 \\ge 100$, so $k \\ge \\frac{95}{11}$, so since $k$ must be an integer, we have that $k = 9$, so $m = 11(9) + 5 = 104$. For $n$, we have that $11l+5 \\ge 1000$, so $l \\ge \\frac{995}{11}$, so since $l$ must be an integer, we have that $l = 91$, so $n = 11(91) + 5 = 1006$. Therefore, $n-m = 1006 - 104 = \\boxed{902}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We'll continue incrementing $k$ until we find a suitable three-digit number. When $k=2$, we get $m = 11(2) + 5 = 27$. This is still in the two-digit range.\n\nLet's try $k=3$: $m = 11(3) + 5 = 38$. This is also two digits, so we'll increase $k$ again.\n\nWhen $k=4$, $m = 11(4) + 5 = 49$. This is still in the two-digit range.\n\nWe see that it takes $k = 10$ to get a three-digit number for $m = 11(10) + 5 = 115$.\n\nSo, the smallest positive three-digit integer congruent to 5 mod 11 is 115. We have found $m$. Now we must find $n$. \n\nTo find $n$ we will follow a similar process as we did for $m$. Let's set up the equation $n = 11x + 5$. Our goal is to find the smallest positive four-digit integer that satisfies the congruence $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.",
