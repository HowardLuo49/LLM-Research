The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe volume of the box is 240 cubic units where $a,b,$ and $c$ are integers with $1<c<b<a$.What is the largest possible value of $b$?[asy]\n\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3)--(6,3)--(6,0)--cycle);\ndraw((2,1.5)--(2,4.5)--(8,4.5)--(8,1.5)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,1.5)--(2,4.5)--(0,3)--cycle);\ndraw((6,0)--(6,3)--(8,4.5)--(8,1.5)--cycle);\nlabel(\"a\",(3,0),S);\nlabel(\"b\",(7,0.75),SE);\nlabel(\"c\",(8,3.5),E);\n[/asy]\nLet's list out the factors of 240 again and look for possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the conditions. The factors of 240 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, and 240. \n\nNext, let's find all possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy $abc = 240$ and $1<c<b<a$.\t\t      \n\nOnce we have all possible combinations, we can then determine the largest possible value of $b$ that satisfies the given conditions. \n\nFinally, we check to see if the largest value of $b$ we found is indeed the largest possible value that satisfies the conditions provided in the problem.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of 240 is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5$. We want $c$ to be as small as possible, so $c=2$. Now we have $a\\cdot b=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=120$. For the maximum $b$, we seek the minimum $a$ while $b<a$. If $b<a$ then $a\\cdot b<a^2$, so $120<a^2$. That means $a$ is at least 11. However, 11 is not a factor of 240. The least factor of 240 greater than 11 is $2^2\\cdot3=12$. So the minimum $a$ is 12 and that makes the maximum $b=\\frac{2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^2\\cdot3}=2\\cdot5=\\boxed{10}$.",

Given the conditions $1<c<b<a$ and $abc = 240$, we can now list the possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy these conditions: $(a, b, c) = (8, 15, 2) \\text{ and } (12, 10, 2)$.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value of $b$ which is $15$ in this case.
