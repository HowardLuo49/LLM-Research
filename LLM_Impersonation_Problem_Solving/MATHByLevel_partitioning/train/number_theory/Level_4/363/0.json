You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen $x$ is divided by each of $4$, $5$, and $6$, remainders of $3$, $4$, and $5$ (respectively) are obtained.\n",
    "solution": "Note that $x+1$ is divisible by $4$, $5$, and $6$. Therefore, it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is $60$. Therefore, the smallest value for $x+1$ is $60$ and the smallest possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $x$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$, $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. \n\nTherefore, we can express $x$ as $x = 4a + 3$ for some integer $a$. \n\nWhen $x$ is divided by $5$, a remainder of $4$ is obtained, so $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nSubstitute $x = 4a + 3$ into $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ to get $4a + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, so $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nTherefore, $a = 5b + 4$ for some integer $b$. \n\nSubstitute $a = 5b + 4$ into $x = 4a + 3$ to express $x$ in terms of $b$. \n\nThis gives $x = 4(5b + 4) + 3 = 20b + 19$.\n\nNow we can use the fact that when $x$ is divided by $6$, a remainder of $5$ is obtained.",
