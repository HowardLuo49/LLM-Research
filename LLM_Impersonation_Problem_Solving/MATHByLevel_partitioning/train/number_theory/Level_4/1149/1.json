    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe digits of a four-digit positive integer add up to 14.The sum of the two middle digits is nine, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one.\nLet's consider the possible combinations of four digits that add up to 14. \n\nPossible combinations:\n1. 1 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 14\n2. 1 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 14\n3. 1 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 14\n4. 4 + 1 + 4 + 5 = 14\n5. 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 14\n6. 4 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 14\n7. 4 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 14\n8. 4 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 14\n9. 4 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 14\n10. 5 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14\n11. 5 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14\n12. 5 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14\n\nThis gives us a total of 12 possible combinations to work with. Let's move on to the next steps.",
    "solution": "Let the integer be $abcd$.  We know that \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d&=14,\\\\\nb+c&=9,\\\\\na-d&=1.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$.  Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.\n\nNow, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.  Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$.  If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$.  With the second equation above, we now have \\begin{align*}\nc-b&=-1,\\\\\nc+b&=9.\n\\end{align*} Adding these equations, we get $2c=8$, or $c=4$.  Substituting this back in, we get $b=5$.  Thus the integer is $\\boxed{3542}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the four-digit number, we know the sum of the two middle digits is nine, so the possible combinations are (4,5),(5,4). Since the thousands digit minus the units digit is one, the possibilities are (4,5) which gives 4152 and (5,4) which gives 5142 as potential numbers.",
