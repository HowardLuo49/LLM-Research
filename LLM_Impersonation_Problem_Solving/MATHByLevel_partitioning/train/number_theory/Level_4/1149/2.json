    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe digits of a four-digit positive integer add up to 14.The sum of the two middle digits is nine, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one.If the integer is divisible by 11, what is the integer?\nTo find the four-digit number, we know the sum of the two middle digits is nine, so the possible combinations are (4,5),(5,4). Since the thousands digit minus the units digit is one, the possibilities are (4,5) which gives 4152 and (5,4) which gives 5142 as potential numbers.",
    "solution": "Let the integer be $abcd$.  We know that \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d&=14,\\\\\nb+c&=9,\\\\\na-d&=1.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$.  Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.\n\nNow, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.  Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$.  If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$.  With the second equation above, we now have \\begin{align*}\nc-b&=-1,\\\\\nc+b&=9.\n\\end{align*} Adding these equations, we get $2c=8$, or $c=4$.  Substituting this back in, we get $b=5$.  Thus the integer is $\\boxed{3542}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Checking the divisibility rule for 11, we sum the digits in odd positions and subtract the sum of the digits in even positions. For 4152, (4+5)-(1+2) = 6, which is not divisible by 11. For 5142, (5+4)-(1+2) = 6, which is also not divisible by 11. Therefore, there seems to be an error in listing the possible numbers. The correct possibilities for the middle digits are (3,6) and (6,3), resulting in 3162 and 6132 as potential numbers. Let's check the divisibility rule for 11 for these numbers. (3+6)-(1+2) = 6 for 3162 and (6+3)-(1+2) = 6 for 6132. None of them are divisible by 11. So, there could be an error in identifying the possible combinations. Let's reevaluate our options.",
