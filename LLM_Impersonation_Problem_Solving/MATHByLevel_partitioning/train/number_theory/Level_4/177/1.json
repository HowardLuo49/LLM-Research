The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe product of the positive integer divisors of a positive integer $n$ is 729.Find $n$.\nGiven that the product of the positive integer divisors of $n$ is 729, we can express the prime factorization of $n$ in terms of the prime factorization of 729 which is $3^6$.\n\nTherefore, we can represent $n$ as $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are distinct prime factors of $n$, and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ are their respective exponents.\n\nTo find the prime factorization of $n$, we will need to consider the equation involving the product of divisors.",
    "solution": "Suppose that $n$ has $d$ divisors and that $d$ is even. Since the divisors come in pairs whose product is $n$, the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$. For example, if $n=12$ then the product of the divisors is $(1\\cdot 12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot 4)=12^3$. If $d$ is odd, then there are $(d-1)/2$ pairs which give a product of $n$, as well as the divisor $\\sqrt{n}$. So again the product of the divisors is $n^{(d-1)/2}n^{1/2}=n^{d/2}$. For example, if $n=16$, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $(1\\cdot 16)(2\\cdot 8)(4)=16^{5/2}$. To summarize, we have found that the product of the positive integers divisors of a positive integer $n$ is $n^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Writing 729 as $3^6$, then, we have $n^{d/2}=3^6$, which implies $n^d=3^{12}$. So the possible values of $(n,d)$ are $(3,12)$, $(9,6)$, $(27,4)$, $(81,3)$ and $(729,2)$. We find that only in the third case $(n,d)=(27,4)$ is $d$ the number of divisors of $n$, so $n=\\boxed{27}$.",
