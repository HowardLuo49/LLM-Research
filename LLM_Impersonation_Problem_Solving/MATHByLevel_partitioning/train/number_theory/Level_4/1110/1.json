The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind $4^{-1} \\pmod{35}$, as a residue modulo 35.(Give an answer between 0 and 34, inclusive.)\nGiven the problem of finding $4^{-1} \\pmod{35}$, we can start by writing $4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}$.\nThis equation can be rewritten as $4x = 35k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nSince we're looking for the modular inverse of $4 \\pmod{35}$, we know that $\\gcd(4, 35) = 1$.\nThus, $4x = 35k + 1$ has a solution if and only if $1$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(4, 35)$.\nIn other words, we need to find integers $x$ and $k$ that satisfy $4x - 35k = 1$.",
