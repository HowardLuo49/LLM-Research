You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind $4^{-1} \\pmod{35}$, as a residue modulo 35.\n",
    "solution": "Since $4 \\cdot 9 = 36 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}$, $4^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{9} \\pmod{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the problem of finding $4^{-1} \\pmod{35}$, we can start by writing $4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}$.\nThis equation can be rewritten as $4x = 35k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nSince we're looking for the modular inverse of $4 \\pmod{35}$, we know that $\\gcd(4, 35) = 1$.\nThus, $4x = 35k + 1$ has a solution if and only if $1$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(4, 35)$.\nIn other words, we need to find integers $x$ and $k$ that satisfy $4x - 35k = 1$.",
