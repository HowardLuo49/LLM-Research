    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward.For example, 343 and 1221 are palindromes.\nLet's focus on finding palindromes that are square numbers. \n\nFirst, let's start by listing out some palindromes: $11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,...$\n\nNext, let's find the squares of these numbers and see if any of them are palindromes. \n\n$11^2 = 121$\n\n$22^2 = 484$\n\n$33^2 = 1089$\n\n$44^2 = 1936$\n\n$55^2 = 3025$\n\n$66^2 = 4356$\n\n$77^2 = 5929$\n\n$88^2 = 7744$\n\n$99^2 = 9801$\n\nNow, identify any square numbers that are palindromes, and see if you can find a pattern or formulate a conjecture based on these examples.",
    "solution": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "gpt_response": "From the calculations done above, we can see that square palindromes only occur for numbers from 1 to 9. \n\nLet's consider the general form of a palindrome. Let $n$ be a palindrome with digits $d_1, d_2, ..., d_k$, then $n = d_1 10^{k-1} + d_2 10^{k-2} + ... + d_{k-1}10 + d_k$.\n\nLet's see if we can identify a pattern or come up with a conjecture for the properties of square palindromes.",
