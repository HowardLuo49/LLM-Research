The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward.For example, 343 and 1221 are palindromes.What is the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome?\nFrom the calculations done above, we can see that square palindromes only occur for numbers from 1 to 9. \n\nLet's consider the general form of a palindrome. Let $n$ be a palindrome with digits $d_1, d_2, ..., d_k$, then $n = d_1 10^{k-1} + d_2 10^{k-2} + ... + d_{k-1}10 + d_k$.\n\nLet's see if we can identify a pattern or come up with a conjecture for the properties of square palindromes.",
    "solution": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome, we can start by considering the general form of a palindrome as shown above.\nSince 40,305 is not a palindrome itself, we need to find the smallest number that can be added to it to make it a palindrome.\nLet's call this unknown number x and the resulting palindrome y, so we have: 40,305 + x = y.\nTo make y a palindrome, the last digit of x must be the same as the first digit of 40,305, which is 4.\nSimilarly, the second last digit of x must be the same as the second digit of 40,305, which is 0.\nTherefore, the smallest number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is 44.",
