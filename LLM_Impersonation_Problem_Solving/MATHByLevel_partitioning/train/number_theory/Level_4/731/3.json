The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nEleanor is making chocolate chip cookies for her friends.If she divides the cookies equally among $11$ of her friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over.If she divides the cookies equally among $7$ of her friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over.Assuming that Eleanor made fewer than $100$ cookies, what is the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made?\nTo calculate the perfect square values of n that satisfy the equation m^2 = 11k + 4, we first need to find integers k such that 11k + 4 is a perfect square. Let's start by trying k = 1 and onwards and calculate the corresponding m values.",
    "solution": "If Eleanor made $N$ cookies, we know from the first requirement that $N = 11x + 4$ for some integer $x,$ and from the second requirement we know that $N = 7y+1$ for some integer $y.$ Therefore,  $$11x+4 = 7y+1\\Rightarrow 11x+3 = 7y$$If we list the possible values of $11x+3$ such that $N = 11x+4<100,$ we have $14,$ $25,$ $36,$ $47,$ $58,$ $69,$ $80,$ $91.$ The only members of this list divisible by $7$ are $14$ and $91,$ and so the possible values of $$11x+4 = 7y+1$$are $14+1 = 15$ and $91+1 = 92$, and thus the sum of the possible numbers of cookies is $15+92 =\\boxed{107}.$",
