    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEach letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$.\n",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given a string of letters, find the sum of the values of all the letters in the string. \n\nPlan for the next person:\n1. Start by assigning numerical values to each letter in the string based on the given alphabet values.\n2. Add up all the numerical values to find the total sum of the letters in the string.\n3. Consider using modular arithmetic if the sum becomes too large to handle easily.\n4. Think about how you can optimize the process of assigning values to letters and adding them up to improve efficiency.",
