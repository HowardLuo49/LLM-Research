    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEach letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$.The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters.The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$.What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$?\nThe numerical values of the letters in the list $ADGI$ are 1, 4, 7, and 9, which multiply together to give a product of 252.\n\nNext, we can consider all possible combinations of four different numbers from the set {1, 4, 7, 9} and calculate the product of each combination to see if any other combinations result in the product of 252.",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
