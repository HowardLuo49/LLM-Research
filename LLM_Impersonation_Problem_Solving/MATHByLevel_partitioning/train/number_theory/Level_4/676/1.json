The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCompute $1011_2 + 101_2 - 1100_2 + 1101_2$.Express your answer in base 2.\nGiven:\n$1011_2$\n$+101_2$\n$-1100_2$\n$+1101_2$\nFirst convert these binary numbers to decimal:\n$1011_2 = 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8+0+2+1 = 11$\n$101_2 = 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 4+0+1 = 5$\n$1100_2 = 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 8+4+0+0 = 12$\n$1101_2 = 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8+4+0+1 = 13$",
