The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAlicia has $n$ candies, where $n$ is a positive integer with three digits.If she buys $5$ more, she will have a multiple of $8$.If she loses $8$, she will have a multiple of $5$.What is the smallest possible value of $n$?\nTo list out the possible values of c that satisfy the congruence relation, we can subtitute different values for a and b and find the corresponding values of c. \n\nLet's try a = 0, b = 0:\nWhen a = 0, b = 0, the congruence simplifies to c \u2261 3 (mod 8). \nThis means that the possible values of c are 3, 11, 19, 27, ...\n\nNow let's try a = 0, b = 1:\nWhen a = 0, b = 1, the congruence simplifies to c \u2261 1 (mod 8). \nThis means that the possible values of c are 1, 9, 17, 25, ...\n\nYou can repeat this process for different values of a and b to find the possible values of c that satisfy the congruence relation.",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by the congruences \\begin{align*}n+5\\equiv 0\\pmod 8 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 8,\\\\n-8\\equiv 0\\pmod 5 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.\\end{align*}Since $\\gcd(5,8)=1$, the above congruences imply $n\\equiv 3\\pmod{40}$. This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$. The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$. Thus $\\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits.",
