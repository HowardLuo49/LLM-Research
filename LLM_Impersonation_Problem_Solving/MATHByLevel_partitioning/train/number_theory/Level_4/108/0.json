You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the product of $1011_2 \\cdot 101_2$.\n",
    "solution": "We carry out the multiplication as we carry out multiplication in base $10$. Fortunately, we do not have to worry about carrying over, since we are only multiplying by digits of $0$ or $1$. Thus:  $$ \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1_2 \\\\\n& & & \\times & 1 & 0 & 1_2 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1_2 \\\\\n& & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0_2 \\\\\n+ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0_2 \\\\ \\cline{1-7}\n& 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1_2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$When summing, we need to carry-over for the second digit from the left. Thus, the sum is equal to $\\boxed{110111}_2$.",
