The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, where $x$ is a positive integer.If one of the integers is 50, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?\nGiven that the greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, we can use the formula that the product of GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers itself, which means GCD * LCM = a * b.\nSo, in this case, we have $(x+5) * x(x+5) = a * b$, where a and b are the two positive integers we are looking for.",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 5) \\cdot x(x + 5)}{50} = \\frac{x(x + 5)^2}{50}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nWe are told that the greatest common divisor is $x + 5$, so $x + 5$ divides 50.  The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5.  When $x = 5$, the other number is $5 \\cdot 10^2/50 = 10$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 10 and 50 is 10, and $x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10$.  The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that one of the integers is 50, so we can substitute this value in for either a or b. Let's substitute 50 in for a. The equation becomes $(x+5) * x(x+5) = 50 * b$.\nExpanding the left side of the equation gives us $x(x+5)^2 = 50b$.\nSince we are looking for the smallest possible value of the other integer, we want to minimize the value of b. In order to do this, we should look for the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation. Let's solve for x.",
