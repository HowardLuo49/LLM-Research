    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAn arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ has a common difference of $6$.A second sequence begins with $4$ and has a common difference of $7$.\nGiven an arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ and common difference of $6$, the $n$th term can be represented as $1 + 6(n-1) = 6n - 5$.\n\nLet's find out the $10$th term of this arithmetic sequence. We can do this by substituting $n=10$ into the formula we found earlier: $10$th term $= 6(10) - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55$. \n\nNow we have found the $10$th term of the arithmetic sequence, which is $55$.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smallest common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\\\\na & \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} We see that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+6n$. Substituting this into $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$ yields \\[1+6n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $4$. Then $n\\ge 4\\implies a=1+6n\\ge 25$. We see that $25$ satisfies both congruences so $a=25$. If $b$ is any common term, subtracting $25$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-25 & \\equiv -24\\equiv 0\\pmod 6 \\\\\nb-25 & \\equiv -21\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(6,7)=1$, we have $b-25\\equiv 0\\pmod {6\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 25\\pmod{42}.$ So $b=25+42m$ for some integer $m$. The largest such number less than $100$ is $\\boxed{67}$, which happens to satisfies the original congruences.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $10$th term of the second arithmetic sequence that begins with $4$ and has a common difference of $7$, we will use the formula: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting the values $a_1 = 4$, $n = 10$, and $d = 7$ into the formula, we get $10$th term of second sequence $= 4 + (10-1) \\cdot 7 = 4 + 63 = 67$. \n\nBased on the calculations above, we have now determined the $10$th term of the second arithmetic sequence, which is $67$. \n\nThe next person can proceed by calculating the difference between the $10$th terms of both arithmetic sequences and using that information to propose a question or problem for others to solve.",
