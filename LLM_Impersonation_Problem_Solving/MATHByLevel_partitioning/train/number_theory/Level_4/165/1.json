The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe prime factorization of 2007 is $3^{2}\\times223$.How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy the equation $xy=2007$?\nGiven that the prime factorization of 2007 is $3^{2}\\times223$, we can calculate the total number of factors for 2007 by using the formula: $(a+1)(b+1)$ where $a$ and $b$ are the exponents in the prime factorization. \nIn this case, $a=2$ and $b=1$, so the total number of factors of 2007 is $(2+1)(1+1)=3\\times2=6$.\nTherefore, the next person should determine the sum of all the factors of 2007.",
    "solution": "$x$ must be a divisor of 2007. To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor. The total number of divisors is then $3\\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223). Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair. So there are $\\boxed{6}$ ordered pairs.",
