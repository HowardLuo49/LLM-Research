    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTo test whether an integer, $n$, is prime, it is enough to be sure that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$.\n",
    "solution": "You need to test the primes less than a number between $\\sqrt{900}=30$ and $\\sqrt{950}<31$, so the largest prime divisor you need to test is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by considering an integer $n$ and calculating its square root to find the primes less than or equal to it. For example, if $n = 25$, the square root is 5, so we need to check if any primes less than or equal to 5 divide 25. The primes less than or equal to 5 are 2, 3, and 5, so we need to check if any of these divide 25.\n\nNext, we need to perform the actual division to check if any of the primes found in the previous step divide the integer $n$. In the example where $n = 25$, we would check if 2, 3, or 5 divide 25. If any of them divide $n$ evenly, then $n$ is not a prime number.\n\nIf we find that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$, then $n$ is a prime number. If any of the primes do divide $n$, then $n$ is not a prime number. \n\nTherefore, the plan for the next person is to implement the steps mentioned above to test whether a given integer $n$ is prime. Remember that prime numbers are greater than 1 and are only divisible by 1 and themselves.",
