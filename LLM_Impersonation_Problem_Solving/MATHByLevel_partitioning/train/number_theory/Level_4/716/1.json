    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTo test whether an integer, $n$, is prime, it is enough to be sure that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$.If you want to check that a number between 900 and 950 is prime with this rule, what is the largest prime divisor you need to test?\nLet's start by considering an integer $n$ and calculating its square root to find the primes less than or equal to it. For example, if $n = 25$, the square root is 5, so we need to check if any primes less than or equal to 5 divide 25. The primes less than or equal to 5 are 2, 3, and 5, so we need to check if any of these divide 25.\n\nNext, we need to perform the actual division to check if any of the primes found in the previous step divide the integer $n$. In the example where $n = 25$, we would check if 2, 3, or 5 divide 25. If any of them divide $n$ evenly, then $n$ is not a prime number.\n\nIf we find that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$, then $n$ is a prime number. If any of the primes do divide $n$, then $n$ is not a prime number. \n\nTherefore, the plan for the next person is to implement the steps mentioned above to test whether a given integer $n$ is prime. Remember that prime numbers are greater than 1 and are only divisible by 1 and themselves.",
    "solution": "You need to test the primes less than a number between $\\sqrt{900}=30$ and $\\sqrt{950}<31$, so the largest prime divisor you need to test is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest prime divisor we need to test when checking if a number between 900 and 950 is prime, we first calculate the square root of the number. The largest number in the given range is 950, and its square root is approximately 30.82. Therefore, we need to test for prime numbers less than or equal to 30. \n\nThe prime numbers less than or equal to 30 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. We need to perform division tests with each of these primes to check if they divide the number between 900 and 950 evenly.\n\nStarting with the smallest prime, we check if 2 divides the number, then move on to 3, 5, and so on. If we find a prime that divides the number evenly, then that prime would be the largest prime divisor to test. Otherwise, if none of the primes divide the number evenly, then the number between 900 and 950 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the largest prime divisor to test when checking if a number between 900 and 950 is prime is 29.",
