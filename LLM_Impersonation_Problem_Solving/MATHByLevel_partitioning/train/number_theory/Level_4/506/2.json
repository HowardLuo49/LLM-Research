    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe base-10 numbers 217 and 45 are multiplied.The product is then written in base-6.What is the units digit of the base-6 representation?\nOne interesting property to note is that the prime factors of 9765 include 3, 5, 7, and 31.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we notice that both 217 and 45 share a common factor of 3.\n\nNext, let's convert the base-10 numbers 217 and 45 into base-6 to see if there are any patterns that emerge. \n\nConverting 217 into base-6, we get 1105 and for 45, we get 201.",
    "solution": "The units digit of a positive integer when expressed in base 6 is the same as the remainder when the integer is divided by 6.  For example, the number $1502_6$ is equal to $1\\cdot 6^3+5\\cdot 6^2+0\\cdot 6+2$, and 6 divides every term except the units digit, 2.  When 217 is divided by 6, the remainder is 1.  When 45 is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.  Therefore, the product of 217 and 45 has a remainder of $1\\cdot 3=\\boxed{3}$ when divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of 217 and 45 in base-6, we multiply their base-6 representations: \n\n1105 (217 in base-6) x 201 (45 in base-6) = 2220505  \n\nTherefore, the units digit of the base-6 representation of the product of 217 and 45 is 5.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 3?: To find the product of 217 and 45 in base-6, we multiply their base-6 representations: \n\n1105 (217 in base-6) x 201 (45 in base-6) = 2220505  \n\nTherefore, the units digit of the base-6 representation of the product of 217 and 45 is 5.",
