You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nBase prime representation of a natural number is defined using the exponents of its prime factorization as follows.\n",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $225$ is $225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. Since $2$ does not divide into $225$, we treat $2$ as having a $0$ exponent; the next two primes are $3$ and $5$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Given a natural number n, the base prime representation of n is the list of exponents of the prime factorization of n, in non-decreasing order.\nFor example, the base prime representation of 60 is [2, 2, 1], since 60 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1.\nTo solve this number theory problem, we will first factorize the given natural number n into its prime factors.\nThen, we will count the number of times each prime factor appears in the factorization and list them in non-decreasing order to get the base prime representation.\nOur task will be to find an efficient algorithm to calculate the base prime representation of any given natural number n.",
