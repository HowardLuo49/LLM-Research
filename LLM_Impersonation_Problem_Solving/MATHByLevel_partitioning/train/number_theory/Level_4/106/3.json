The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nBase prime representation of a natural number is defined using the exponents of its prime factorization as follows.Each place in a base prime represents a prime number, and it is occupied by the corresponding exponent of that prime, starting on the right side with the smallest prime number and proceeding to the left with the next largest prime number.For instance, since $84 = 7^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^2$, then $84$ would be written as $1012$ in base prime.What is $225$ written in base prime?\nLet's consider the number 84 as an example to demonstrate the base prime representation. The prime factorization of 84 is 2^2 * 3^1 * 7^1.\nWe will start by dividing 84 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, to obtain 42.\nNext, we divide 42 by the next smallest prime number, 3, to get 14.\nThen, we divide 14 by the next prime number, 7, to get 2.\nFinally, we divide 2 by the last prime number, 2, to get 1.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $225$ is $225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. Since $2$ does not divide into $225$, we treat $2$ as having a $0$ exponent; the next two primes are $3$ and $5$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "The correct prime factorization of 84 is $2^2 * 3^1 * 7^1$, not $2^2 * 3^1 * 7^1$.\nTherefore, the base prime representation of 84 is 1012.\nNow, we need to find the base prime representation of 225 using the same method.\nThe prime factorization of 225 is $3^2 * 5^2$.\nSo, the base prime representation of 225 is 0220.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 220?: The correct prime factorization of 84 is $2^2 * 3^1 * 7^1$, not $2^2 * 3^1 * 7^1$.\nTherefore, the base prime representation of 84 is 1012.\nNow, we need to find the base prime representation of 225 using the same method.\nThe prime factorization of 225 is $3^2 * 5^2$.\nSo, the base prime representation of 225 is 0220.",
