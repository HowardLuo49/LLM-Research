    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nBase prime representation of a natural number is defined using the exponents of its prime factorization as follows.Each place in a base prime represents a prime number, and it is occupied by the corresponding exponent of that prime, starting on the right side with the smallest prime number and proceeding to the left with the next largest prime number.For instance, since $84 = 7^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^2$, then $84$ would be written as $1012$ in base prime.\nTo factorize a number n into its prime factors, we can start by dividing n by the smallest prime number (2) and continue dividing by primes until we reach 1.\nOnce we have the prime factors of n, we can count the number of times each prime factor appears by continuously dividing n by the prime factor until we can no longer do so.\nAfter counting the exponents of each prime factor, we can list them in non-decreasing order to obtain the base prime representation of the natural number n. \nTo make the algorithm more efficient, we can optimize the prime factorization process by only checking prime numbers up to the square root of n.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $225$ is $225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. Since $2$ does not divide into $225$, we treat $2$ as having a $0$ exponent; the next two primes are $3$ and $5$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the number 84 as an example to demonstrate the base prime representation. The prime factorization of 84 is 2^2 * 3^1 * 7^1.\nWe will start by dividing 84 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, to obtain 42.\nNext, we divide 42 by the next smallest prime number, 3, to get 14.\nThen, we divide 14 by the next prime number, 7, to get 2.\nFinally, we divide 2 by the last prime number, 2, to get 1.",
