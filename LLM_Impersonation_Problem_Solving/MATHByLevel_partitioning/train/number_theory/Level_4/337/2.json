    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nGeorge is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register.If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount.If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount.\nThe amount of change that George is about to get must satisfy the condition that he receives 3 pennies and the rest in quarters.\nSince George will receive 3 pennies, the amount of change he receives in cents must be $x = 3 + 25q$, where $q$ is the number of quarters he receives. \nTherefore, possible values of $x$ are $3, 28, 53, 78$.\nNext, the denominations available to George are quarters and pennies.\nThus, for each possible value of $x$, the next person should determine the number of ways George can receive that amount of change using quarters and pennies.\nAfter listing out the ways George can receive the change in quarters and pennies for each $x$, the final step is to sum up the total number of ways George can receive his change less than one dollar from the cash register.",
    "solution": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "For $x=3$, George can receive his change as 3 pennies or 1 quarter and 1 penny, giving 2 total ways.\nFor $x=28$, George can receive his change as 1 quarter and 3 pennies, giving 1 total way.\nFor $x=53$, George can receive his change as 2 quarters and 3 pennies or 1 quarter and 28 pennies, giving 2 total ways.\nFor $x=78$, George can receive his change as 3 quarters and 3 pennies or 2 quarters and 28 pennies, giving 2 total ways.\nThe total number of ways George can receive his change less than one dollar is 7.",
