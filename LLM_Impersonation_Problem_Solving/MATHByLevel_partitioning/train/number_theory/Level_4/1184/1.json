The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe Lucas sequence is the sequence 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, $\\ldots$ where the first term is 1, the second term is 3 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms.What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 8?\nSince we are dealing with the Lucas sequence, we know that the recursive formula for the sequence is $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$ where $L_1 = 1$ and $L_2 = 3$. \n\nTo find the next term in the Lucas sequence after 11, we can calculate $L_6$ by finding the sum of $L_5$ and $L_4$. \n\nWe have $L_4 = L_3 + L_2 = 7 + 3 = 10$ and $L_5 = L_4 + L_3 = 10 + 7 = 17$. \n\nTherefore, $L_6 = L_5 + L_4 = 17 + 10 = \\boxed{27}$.",

Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $L_{100}\\equiv L_4\\pmod 8$.  Therefore the remainder when $L_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
