    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where the first and second terms are 1 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms.\n",
    "solution": "We can look at the terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 8.   \\begin{align*}\nF_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_5 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_7 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_8 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_9 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{10} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{11} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{12} &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{13} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{14} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{15} &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{16} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}.\n\\end{align*}Since $F_{13}$ and $F_{14}$ are both 1, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms.  Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $F_{100}\\equiv F_4\\pmod 8$.  Therefore the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{3}$.",

Let's analyze this observation further.",
