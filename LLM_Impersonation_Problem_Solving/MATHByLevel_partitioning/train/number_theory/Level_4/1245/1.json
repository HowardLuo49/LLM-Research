The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where the first and second terms are 1 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms.What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 8?\nGiven the Fibonacci sequence, we are asked to find a pattern or property related to the terms.\n\nFirst, let's list out the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence: \n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n\nNext, let's calculate the ratio of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence (also known as the golden ratio) to see if there is a pattern:\n1/1 = 1\n2/1 = 2\n3/2 = 1.5\n5/3 = 1.666...\n8/5 = 1.6\n13/8 = 1.625\n21/13 = 1.61538461538\n34/21 = 1.61904761905\n55/34 = 1.61764705882\n89/55 = 1.61818181818\n\nNotice that as we calculate the ratio of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence, the values are approaching a certain constant. Let's analyze this observation further.",
    "solution": "We can look at the terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 8.   \\begin{align*}\nF_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_5 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_7 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_8 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_9 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{10} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{11} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{12} &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{13} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{14} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{15} &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{16} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}.\n\\end{align*}Since $F_{13}$ and $F_{14}$ are both 1, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms.  Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $F_{100}\\equiv F_4\\pmod 8$.  Therefore the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The constant that the ratios are approaching is the golden ratio, approximately equal to 1.618. \n\nTo find the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 8, we can exploit the periodicity of remainders when dividing Fibonacci numbers by 8: the remainders cycle with a period of 6. \n\nSince the remainder of the first six terms of the Fibonacci sequence when divided by 8 are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 0, the remainder when dividing the 100th term by 8 would be the same as the remainder when dividing the 100th term by 6. \n\nSince 100 divided by 6 has a remainder of 4, we look at the fourth term in our remainder cycle, which is 3. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
