The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind $325_{8}-237_{8}$.Express your answer in base $8$.\nTo subtract $237_{8}$ from $325_{8}$, we need to convert both numbers to base 10 and then subtract. \n\nConverting $325_{8}$ to base 10:\n$3*8^2 + 2*8^1 + 5*8^0 = 3*64 + 2*8 + 5*1 = 192 + 16 + 5 = 213$\n\nConverting $237_{8}$ to base 10:\n$2*8^2 + 3*8^1 + 7*8^0 = 2*64 + 3*8 + 7*1 = 128 + 24 + 7 = 159$\n\nNow, we need to subtract $159$ from $213$. \n$213 - 159 = 54$\n\nTherefore, $325_{8} - 237_{8} = 54$.",
    "solution": "We start subtract the rightmost digits, keeping in mind that we are in base $8$.\n\nSince $5$ is less than $7$, we must borrow $1$ from the $2$, which then becomes $1$. Since $15_8-7_8=6_8$, we have $6$ in the rightmost digit. Since the $1$ left over is less than $3$, we must borrow $1$ from the $3$, which becomes a $2$. $11_8-3_8=6_8$, so we have $6$ in the second rightmost digit. Since $2-2=0$, the third rightmost digit is 0. In the usual notation, this process looks like $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\cancelto{2}{3}& \\cancelto{1}{2} & 5_8\\\\ & & - & 2 & 3 & 7_8\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & & & 6& 6_8\\\\ \\end{array}$$Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{66_8}$.",
