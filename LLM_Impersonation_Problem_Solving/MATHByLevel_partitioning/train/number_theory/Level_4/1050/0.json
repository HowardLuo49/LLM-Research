You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind $325_{8}-237_{8}$.\n",
    "solution": "We start subtract the rightmost digits, keeping in mind that we are in base $8$.\n\nSince $5$ is less than $7$, we must borrow $1$ from the $2$, which then becomes $1$. Since $15_8-7_8=6_8$, we have $6$ in the rightmost digit. Since the $1$ left over is less than $3$, we must borrow $1$ from the $3$, which becomes a $2$. $11_8-3_8=6_8$, so we have $6$ in the second rightmost digit. Since $2-2=0$, the third rightmost digit is 0. In the usual notation, this process looks like $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\cancelto{2}{3}& \\cancelto{1}{2} & 5_8\\\\ & & - & 2 & 3 & 7_8\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & & & 6& 6_8\\\\ \\end{array}$$Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{66_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To subtract $237_{8}$ from $325_{8}$, we need to convert both numbers to base 10 and then subtract. \n\nConverting $325_{8}$ to base 10:\n$3*8^2 + 2*8^1 + 5*8^0 = 3*64 + 2*8 + 5*1 = 192 + 16 + 5 = 213$\n\nConverting $237_{8}$ to base 10:\n$2*8^2 + 3*8^1 + 7*8^0 = 2*64 + 3*8 + 7*1 = 128 + 24 + 7 = 159$\n\nNow, we need to subtract $159$ from $213$. \n$213 - 159 = 54$\n\nTherefore, $325_{8} - 237_{8} = 54$.",
