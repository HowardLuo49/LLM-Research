    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe number $0.428125$ can be written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "solution": "We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Note that $428,\\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$. Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 3425}{125 \\cdot 8000}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3425}{8000}.\n\\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{3425}{8000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5^2\\cdot 137}{5^2\\cdot 320} \\\\\n&= \\frac{137}{320}.\n\\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $0.428125 = 428125 \\times 10^{-6} = \\frac{428125}{1000000}$, we have $a = 428125$ and $b = 1000000$.\nFind the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ to simplify the fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$.",
