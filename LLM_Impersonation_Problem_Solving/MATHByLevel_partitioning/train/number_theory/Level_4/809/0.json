You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the modular inverse of $11$, modulo $1000$?\n",
    "solution": "We know that the modular inverse exists because $11$ and $1000$ are relatively prime. Notice that $1000 = 10^3$ and that $11 = 10 + 1$. Since $11 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$, it follows that $(10+1) \\cdot 11^{-1} = 10^3k + 1$ for some integer $k$. We recognize the potential sum of cubes factorization: if $k=1$, then $$10^3 + 1 = 1001 = 11 \\cdot (10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 \\cdot 91.$$Thus, $11^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{91} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $11x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$.\nLet's first check if $11$ is coprime with $1000$ by finding their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm. $1000 = 90 \\times 11 + 10$, $11 = 1 \\times 10 + 1$, so $\\gcd(11,1000) = 1$. Since the gcd is 1, the modular inverse exists. \nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$. Let $a=1000$, $b=11$. Start with the equations $a=1000$, $b=11$, $x_1=1$, $y_1=0$, $x_0=0$, $y_0=1$.",
