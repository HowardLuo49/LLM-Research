The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the modular inverse of $11$, modulo $1000$?Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $999$, inclusive.\nTo find the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $11x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$.\nLet's first check if $11$ is coprime with $1000$ by finding their greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm. $1000 = 90 \\times 11 + 10$, $11 = 1 \\times 10 + 1$, so $\\gcd(11,1000) = 1$. Since the gcd is 1, the modular inverse exists. \nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$. Let $a=1000$, $b=11$. Start with the equations $a=1000$, $b=11$, $x_1=1$, $y_1=0$, $x_0=0$, $y_0=1$.",
    "solution": "We know that the modular inverse exists because $11$ and $1000$ are relatively prime. Notice that $1000 = 10^3$ and that $11 = 10 + 1$. Since $11 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$, it follows that $(10+1) \\cdot 11^{-1} = 10^3k + 1$ for some integer $k$. We recognize the potential sum of cubes factorization: if $k=1$, then $$10^3 + 1 = 1001 = 11 \\cdot (10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 \\cdot 91.$$Thus, $11^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{91} \\pmod{1000}$.",
