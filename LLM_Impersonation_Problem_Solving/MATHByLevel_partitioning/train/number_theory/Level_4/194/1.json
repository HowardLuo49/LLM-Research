The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $T$ be a positive integer whose only digits are 0s and 1s.If $X = T \\div 12$ and $X$ is an integer, what is the smallest possible value of $X$?\nSince $T$ is a positive integer, its leftmost digit cannot be a 0, so let's denote $T = 1...$ where the dots represent the remaining digits. \n\nWe know that $T$ is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Let's try to find patterns in the sums of the digits of $T$ for different values of $T$.",
    "solution": "Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.  Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4.  By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100.  Calculating, $X = \\boxed{925}$.",
