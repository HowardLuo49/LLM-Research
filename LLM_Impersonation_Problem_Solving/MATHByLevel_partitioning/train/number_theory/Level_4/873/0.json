You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTo express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$.\n",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 1562 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 1562 is $2^{10}=1024$.  The difference between 1024 and 1562 is $538$. The largest power of 2 less than 538 is $2^9=512$.  The difference between 538 and 512 is 26.  The largest power of 2 less than 26 is $2^4=16$, which leaves us with $26-16=10$. Continuing the process, we get $2^3=8$ and $2^1=2$. So, we have found that $1562=2^{10}+2^9+2^4+2^3+2^1$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{27}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing out the powers of 2 from 0 to 20: $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, ...$.\n\nNext, let's see if we can find a combination of distinct powers of 2 that add up to 20: \n\nStarting with the largest power of 2 less than 20, $2^4 = 16$, subtract this from 20 to get 4. \n\nContinue with the next largest power, $2^3 = 8$, subtract this from 4 to get -4. \n\nSince we have a negative value, we need to adjust our previous choices. \n\nLet's go back and try a different combination: \n\nThis time, start with $2^3 = 8$, subtract this from 20 to get 12. \n\nThen, use $2^2 = 4$, subtract this from 12 to get 8. \n\nNext, use $2^0 = 1$, subtract this from 8 to get 7. \n\nThen, use $2^0 = 1$ again, subtract this from 7 to get 6. \n\nThen, use $2^1 = 2$, subtract this from 6 to get 4. \n\nFinally, use $2^2 = 4$, subtract this from 4 to get 0. \n\nTherefore, one way to express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2 is $20 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 + 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2$. \n\nPlan for the next person: Verify if the previous work is correct and provide an explanation if it is not, then find another way to express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2.",
