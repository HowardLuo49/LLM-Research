The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe product of the base seven numbers $24_7$ and $30_7$ is expressed in base seven.What is the base seven sum of the digits of this product?\nThere is an error in the base seven numbers provided.\n$24_7 = 2*7^1 + 4*7^0 = 2*7 + 4*1 = 14$\n$30_7 = 3*7^1 + 0*7^0 = 3*7 + 0*1 = 21$\n\nThe product of $14$ and $21$ in base seven can be found by multiplying $14$ and $21$ in base ten.\n$14*21 = 294$\n\nConverting $294$ to base seven:\n$294 = 4*7^2 + 1*7^1 + 1*7^0 = 4*49 + 1*7 + 1*1 = 196 + 7 + 1 = 204$",
    "solution": "We can ignore the $0$ digit for now, and find the product of $24_7 \\times 3_7$. First, we need to multiply the units digit: $4_7 \\times 3_7 = 12_{10} = 15_7$. Hence, we write down a $5$ and carry-over the $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $2_7 \\times 3_7 + 1_7 = 7_{10} = 10_{7}$. Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and $1$ is carried over. Writing this out:  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & & \\stackrel{1}{2} & \\stackrel{}{4}_7 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 3_7 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & & 1 & 0 & 5_7 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$ We can ignore the $0$ in $30_7$, since it does not contribute to the sum. Thus, the answer is $1+0+5 = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nNotice that the base seven sum of the digits of a number leaves the same remainder upon division by $6$ as the number itself.",
