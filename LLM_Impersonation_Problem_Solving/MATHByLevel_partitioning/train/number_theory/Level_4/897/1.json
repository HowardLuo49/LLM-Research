The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nHow many ways can 1995 be factored as a product of two two-digit numbers?(Two factorizations of the form $a\\cdot b$ and $b\\cdot a$ are considered the same).\nGiven the number 1995, the first step is to find its prime factorization: 1995 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 19.\n\nNext, we want to find all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers that multiply to 1995.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to start by finding all the pairs of numbers that multiply to the prime factorization of 1995.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the combinations of two primes that multiply to 1995: (3, 665), (5, 399), (7, 285), (19, 105).\n\nNext, we need to check if both numbers in each pair are two-digit numbers, and if they are, we add them to our list of valid factorizations.\n\nSince we are looking for two-digit numbers, we see that only the pair (19, 105) satisfies this condition.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 way to factorize 1995 as a product of two two-digit numbers, which is 19 * 105.",
    "solution": "$1995=5\\cdot399=3\\cdot5\\cdot133=3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot19$. Since $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=105$ has three digits, in any expression of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers, $19$ must be a proper factor of one of them. $19\\cdot3=57$ and $19\\cdot5=95$ are two-digit numbers that are divisible by $19$ and divide $1995$, but $19\\cdot7=133$ and $19\\cdot3\\cdot5=285$ are three digits, so the only possible expressions of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers are $57\\cdot35$ and $95\\cdot21$. So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such factorizations.",
