You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen the two-digit integer $MM$, with equal digits, is multiplied by the one-digit integer $M$, the result is the three-digit integer $NPM$.\n",
    "solution": "$M=1$, $5$, or $6$ since no other digits have the property that the units digit of $M\\times M$ is $M$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $MM\\times M=NPM$ is $66\\times6=\\boxed{396}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $MM \\times M = NPM$:\n- We know that $MM = 10M + M = 11M$, where $M$ is a digit from 1 to 9, since $MM$ is a two-digit integer with equal digits.\n- Therefore, $11M \\times M = NPM$.",
