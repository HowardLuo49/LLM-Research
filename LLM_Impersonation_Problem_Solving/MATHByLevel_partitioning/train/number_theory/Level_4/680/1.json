The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe product of two positive three-digit palindromes is 436,995.What is their sum?\nLet's break down 436,995 into its prime factors: 436,995 = 3 * 5 * 7 * 43 * 211.\nSince the palindromes are 3 digits long, they must be between 100 and 999.\nPalindrome factors of 436,995 are 105 * 4155, 111 * 3939, 117 * 3729, 121 * 3615, 123 * 3555, 165 * 2655, 195 * 2241, 205 * 2133, 231 * 1895, 253 * 1725, 285 * 1533, 273 * 1595, 341 * 1285, 385 * 1137, 429 * 1017\nThe sum of these palindromes is 4170.",
    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 436,995: $436,995=3^4\\cdot5395=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot1079=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot83$. We see that $3^2\\cdot83=747$ is a three-digit palindrome, and the product of the remaining powers of primes is a palindrome as well: $3^2\\cdot5\\cdot13=585$. Thus, the desired sum is $747+585=\\boxed{1332}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the two palindromes, we need to determine which pair of palindromes multiply to 436,995. \n\nFrom the list of palindrome factors provided, we can see that 285 * 1533 equals 436,995. \n\nTherefore, the sum of these two palindromes is 285 + 1533 = 1818. \n\nSo, the sum of the two palindromes that multiply to 436,995 is 1818.",
