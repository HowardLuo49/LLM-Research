The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 2009 - 2010$.What is the residue of $S$, modulo 2010?\nGiven the alternating pattern of signs, we can pair numbers together to simplify the summation.\n$S = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010)$.\n$S = -1 - 1 - \\cdots - 1 = -1005$.\nThus, the sum of the series $S$ is $-1005$.",
    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
