    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen a positive integer is expressed in base 7, it is $AB_7$, and when it is expressed in base 5, it is $BA_5$.\n",
    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $AB_7 = 7A + B$ and $BA_5 = 5B + A$, we know that $7A + B = 5B + A$.\nSimplifying, we get $6A = 4B \\implies 3A = 2B$. So, $A$ must be a multiple of $2$ and $B$ must be a multiple of $3$.\nThe maximum value a digit can take in base $7$ is $6$, so $A = 2$.\nNow, we need to find the value of $B$ in base $7$.",
