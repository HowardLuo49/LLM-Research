The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind the product of $10101_2$ and $101_2$.Express your answer in base $2$.\nPrevious work: \n$10101_2 \\times 101_2$.\nConvert the binary numbers to decimal to make the multiplication easier: $10101_2 = 21$ and $101_2 = 5$. \n\nNext step: Multiply $21$ and $5$ to find the product.",
