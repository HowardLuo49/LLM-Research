    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAn $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number.(The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.)\nGiven an abundant number $n$, we know that $n$ can be written as $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime factors of $n$ and $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ are positive integers. Let's start by finding all the proper factors of $n$.\n\nTo find the proper factors of $n$, we can make use of the formula for the sum of divisors of a number. The sum of divisors of $n$ is given by $\\sigma(n) = (1+p_1+p_1^2+\\cdots+p_1^{a_1})(1+p_2+p_2^2+\\cdots+p_2^{a_2})\\cdots(1+p_k+p_k^2+\\cdots+p_k^{a_k})$. We can then find the proper factors by subtracting $n$ from $\\sigma(n)$.\n\nLet's take a specific example with $n = 24$ to illustrate this process. The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^1$. Substituting these values into the formula for $\\sigma(n)$, we get $(1+2+2^2+2^3)(1+3) = (1+2+4+8)(1+3) = 15 \\cdot 4 = 60$.\n\nNow, we subtract $24$ from $60$ to find the sum of the distinct proper factors of $24$. $60 - 24 = 36$, so the sum of the distinct proper factors of $24$ is $36$.",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $24$ is an abundant number, we have that its sum of distinct proper factors is $36$ which is greater than $24$. This means solving for the sum of distinct proper factors is a valid path to take. Let's generalize the formula for sum of divisors of $n$ to continue finding the sum of distinct proper factors for any abundant number.",
