The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAn $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number.(The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.)How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?\nGiven that $24$ is an abundant number, we have that its sum of distinct proper factors is $36$ which is greater than $24$. This means solving for the sum of distinct proper factors is a valid path to take. Let's generalize the formula for sum of divisors of $n$ to continue finding the sum of distinct proper factors for any abundant number.",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "The formula for the sum of all the divisors of a number $n$ is:\n\\[ \\sigma(n) = (1+p_1+p_1^2+\\cdots+p_1^{a_1})(1+p_2+p_2^2+\\cdots+p_2^{a_2})\\cdots(1+p_k+p_k^2+\\cdots+p_k^{a_k}) \\]\nWhere $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is the prime factorization of $n$.\nFor the sum of proper divisors of $n$, we can subtract $n$ from $\\sigma(n)$. Given that $24=2^3\\cdot3$, we have $\\sigma(24)=(1+2+4+8)(1+3)=15\\cdot4=60$. Subtracting $24$ from this gives the sum of distinct proper divisors as $36$. So, a number being abundant means that the sum of its distinct proper divisors is greater than the number itself. Let's now find how many numbers less than $25$ are abundant.",
