    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA math class has fewer than $40$ students.When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row.When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row.How many students are in this class?\nNext, we know that when the students try to sit in rows of 5, 1 student is left in the last row. This means that the total number of students is congruent to 1 modulo 5. Let's eliminate all numbers from our list that are not congruent to 1 modulo 5. This leaves us with the following numbers of students: 31. \n\nTherefore, there are 31 students in the math class.  Let's ask the next person to verify this solution and find the number of rows in the class.",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class.",
