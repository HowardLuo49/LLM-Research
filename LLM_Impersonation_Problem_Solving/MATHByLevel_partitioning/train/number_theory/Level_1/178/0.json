You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nGrady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags such that every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, but some candy was left over.\n",
    "solution": "Grady distributes his candy in groups of 9 until he no longer has any groups left.  The largest number of possible pieces left is $\\boxed{8},$ since if he has more than 8 he can distribute another group of 9.",
    "gpt_response": "Given information: Grady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags.\nLet's represent the number of pieces of candy each bag received as $p$.\nWe know that $x = 9p + r$, where $r$ is the number of left over pieces of candy.\nSince every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, we can assume that $p$ is an integer.\nWe need to find the smallest possible value of $x$ such that $p$ is an integer and $r > 0$.",
