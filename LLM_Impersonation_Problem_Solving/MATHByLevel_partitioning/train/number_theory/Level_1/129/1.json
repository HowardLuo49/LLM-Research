The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe remainders when three positive integers are divided by 5 are 1, 2, and 3.Find the remainder when their product is divided by 5.\nLet's denote the three positive integers as x, y, and z.\nFrom the information given, we have the following congruences: \n1) x \u2261 1 (mod 5)\n2) y \u2261 2 (mod 5)\n3) z \u2261 3 (mod 5)",
    "solution": "The product of the three integers is equivalent in modulo 5 to the product of the modulo 5 residues of the three integers.  We multiply these residues to find the remainder: $$ 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}. $$",
