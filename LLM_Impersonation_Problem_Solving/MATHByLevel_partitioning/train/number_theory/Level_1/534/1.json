The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nCory made a complete list of the prime numbers between 1 and 25.What is the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on his list?\nThe list of prime numbers between 1 and 25 should include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.\nNext, I will calculate the sum of these prime numbers to see if there is any pattern or relationship that can be observed. \n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 = 100\n\nSince the sum of the prime numbers between 1 and 25 is 100, the next step could involve investigating the factors of this sum to see if there are any interesting properties or relationships. If unable to find any patterns or relationships, one could explore other properties of prime numbers or look for other ways to analyze the data provided.",
    "solution": "Between 1 and 25, the smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. Thus the sum is $2+23=\\boxed{25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The sum calculated is incorrect. Let's recalculate the sum of the prime numbers between 1 and 25.\n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 = 100\n\nThe correct sum of the prime numbers between 1 and 25 is 100. Therefore, the sum of the smallest prime number (2) and the largest prime number (23) on Cory's list is 2 + 23 = 25.",
