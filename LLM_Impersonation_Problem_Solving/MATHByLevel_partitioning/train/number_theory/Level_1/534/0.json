You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nCory made a complete list of the prime numbers between 1 and 25.\n",
    "solution": "Between 1 and 25, the smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. Thus the sum is $2+23=\\boxed{25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The list of prime numbers between 1 and 25 should include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.\nNext, I will calculate the sum of these prime numbers to see if there is any pattern or relationship that can be observed. \n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 = 100\n\nSince the sum of the prime numbers between 1 and 25 is 100, the next step could involve investigating the factors of this sum to see if there are any interesting properties or relationships. If unable to find any patterns or relationships, one could explore other properties of prime numbers or look for other ways to analyze the data provided.",
