You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen three positive integers are divided by $47$, the remainders are $25$, $20$, and $3$, respectively.\n",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 25\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 20\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 3\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 25+20+3 \\\\\n&= 48\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$. This remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the three positive integers leave remainders of $25$, $20$, and $3$ when divided by $47$, we can express them as $47a + 25$, $47b + 20$, and $47c + 3$ for some integers $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nNow, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let the three positive integers be represented by $x$, $y$, and $z$. Then we have the following congruences:\n$$ x \\equiv 25 \\pmod{47} $$\n$$ y \\equiv 20 \\pmod{47} $$\n$$ z \\equiv 3 \\pmod{47} $$\n\nFrom these congruences, we can solve for the three positive integers $x$, $y$, and $z$. Thus, the next person should find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the given conditions.",
