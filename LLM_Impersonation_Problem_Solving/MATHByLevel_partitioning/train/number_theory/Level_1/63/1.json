The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen three positive integers are divided by $47$, the remainders are $25$, $20$, and $3$, respectively.When the sum of the three integers is divided by $47$, what is the remainder?\nGiven that the three positive integers leave remainders of $25$, $20$, and $3$ when divided by $47$, we can express them as $47a + 25$, $47b + 20$, and $47c + 3$ for some integers $a$, $b$, and $c$. \n\nNow, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let the three positive integers be represented by $x$, $y$, and $z$. Then we have the following congruences:\n$$ x \\equiv 25 \\pmod{47} $$\n$$ y \\equiv 20 \\pmod{47} $$\n$$ z \\equiv 3 \\pmod{47} $$\n\nFrom these congruences, we can solve for the three positive integers $x$, $y$, and $z$. Thus, the next person should find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the given conditions.",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 25\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 20\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 3\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 25+20+3 \\\\\n&= 48\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$. This remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.",
