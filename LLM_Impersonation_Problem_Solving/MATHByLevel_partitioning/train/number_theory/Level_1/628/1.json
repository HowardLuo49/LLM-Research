    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen three positive integers are divided by $12$, the remainders are $7,$ $9,$ and $10,$ respectively.When the sum of the three integers is divided by $12$, what is the remainder?\nGiven that when three positive integers, $a$, $b$, and $c$, are divided by $12$, the remainders are $7$, $9$, and $10$ respectively, we can express the integers in terms of their remainders as follows: \\begin{align*}\na &= 12k + 7 \\\\\nb &= 12m + 9 \\\\\nc &= 12n + 10,\n\\end{align*} where $k$, $m$, and $n$ are the quotients when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are divided by $12$. \n\nTo find the possible values of $a+b+c$, we can add the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$: \\begin{align*}\na + b + c &= (12k + 7) + (12m + 9) + (12n + 10) \\\\\n&= 12(k + m + n) + 26.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will be of the form $12(k + m + n) + 26$, where $k$, $m$, and $n$ are integers. \n\nThe plan for the next person is to see if any restrictions on $k$, $m$, and $n$ can be determined from the information given, in order to find possible values for the sum $a+b+c$.",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 7\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 9\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 10\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 7+9+10 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $12$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive integers, $k$, $m$, and $n$ must also be positive integers in order for $a$, $b$, and $c$ to be positive. \n\nGiven that $a = 12k + 7$, $b = 12m + 9$, and $c = 12n + 10$, we can see that $k$, $m$, and $n$ must be chosen such that when divided by 12, the remainders are 7, 9, and 10 respectively. This can be achieved by choosing $k=1$, $m=1$, and $n=1$ or any integer greater than 1 to satisfy these conditions. \n\nTherefore, the sum $a+b+c$ will be of the form $12(3) + 26 = 62$, and when divided by 12, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
