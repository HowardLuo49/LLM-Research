The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given.What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?\nGiven that $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, we can write $n = 6k + 1$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNext, consider the remainders when $n$ is divided by 3 and by 2, which may provide more insight into the properties of $n$. \n\nLet's start by finding the remainder when $n$ is divided by 3. We know that $n = 6k + 1$, so we need to find $n \\pmod{3}$. \n\nSince $n = 6k + 1$, we have $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. This means that $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\n\nNext, let's find the remainder when $n$ is divided by 2. We know that $n = 6k + 1$, so we need to find $n \\pmod{2}$. \n\nSince $n = 6k + 1$, we have $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. This means that $n$ is odd.\n\nNow that we have found the remainders when $n$ is divided by 3 and by 2, let's use this information to determine a pattern and make a conjecture about the nature of $n$ itself.",
    "solution": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, and is also odd, we know that $n$ must be of the form $n = 6k + 1$ where $k$ is an integer.\n\nTo find the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6, substitute $n = 6k + 1$ into $n + 2010$:\n\n$n + 2010 = (6k + 1) + 2010 = 6k + 2011$\n\nNow, to find the remainder when $n + 2010 = 6k + 2011$ is divided by 6, we can look at the divisibility rule for 6, which states that a number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. \n\nSince the original $n = 6k + 1$ is odd, $n + 2010 = 6k + 2011$ will also be odd. This means it is not divisible by 2, so the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6 is $\\boxed{1}$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6 is 1.",
