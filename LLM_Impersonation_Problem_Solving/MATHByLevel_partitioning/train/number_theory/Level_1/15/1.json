The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAbigail, Beatrice, and Carson combine their eggs to sell them at the market.If Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs, and if eggs can only be sold in cartons of 12, how many eggs will be left over if all cartons are sold?\nLet's assign variables to represent the number of eggs each person has: let A represent Abigail's eggs, B represent Beatrice's eggs, and C represent Carson's eggs.\nGiven that Abigail has 2 more eggs than Beatrice and Carson has 3 times as many eggs as Beatrice, we can express the relationships as A = B + 2 and C = 3B.\nIf they have a total of 90 eggs, we can write the equation A + B + C = 90.\nLet's substitute the expressions for A and C into the total eggs equation to solve for the number of eggs each person has.\nA + B + C = 90\n(B + 2) + B + (3B) = 90",
    "solution": "The remainder when $37+49+14$ is divided by $12$ is the same as the remainder when the congruences of each number mod 12 are summed and then divided by 12. In other words, since we have \\begin{align*}\n37 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}\\\\\n49 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12} \\\\\n14 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{12}\n\\end{align*}then therefore, $37+49+14 \\equiv1+1+2 \\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{12}$.",
