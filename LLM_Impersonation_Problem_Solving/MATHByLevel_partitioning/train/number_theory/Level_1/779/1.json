The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen four positive integers are divided by $11$, the remainders are $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ and $8,$ respectively.When the sum of the four integers is divided by $11$, what is the remainder?\nGiven that the integers leave remainders of 2, 4, 6, and 8 when divided by 11, we can express each integer as $11a + r$, where $r$ is the remainder and $a$ is some integer. Let's denote the four integers as $11a + 2$, $11b + 4$, $11c + 6$, and $11d + 8$.\nWe can create a system of congruences using the above expression. Let's write the system of congruences as:\n\\begin{align*}\n11a &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n11b &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n11c &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n11d &\\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n\\end{align*}",
    "solution": "We can call the four integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ $c$, and $d$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 2\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 6\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nd &\\equiv 8\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &\\equiv 2+4+6+8 \\\\\n&\\equiv 20\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c+d$ has the same remainder as $20$ upon division by $11$. This remainder is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $11 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, the system of congruences simplifies to:\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n0 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n0 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n0 &\\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\nHowever, since $0 \\not\\equiv 2, 4, 6,$ or $8 \\pmod{11}$, there is no solution to this system of congruences. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem as stated.",
