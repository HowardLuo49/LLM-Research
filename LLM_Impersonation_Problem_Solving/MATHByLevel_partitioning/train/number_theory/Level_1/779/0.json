You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen four positive integers are divided by $11$, the remainders are $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ and $8,$ respectively.\n",
    "solution": "We can call the four integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ $c$, and $d$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 2\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 6\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nd &\\equiv 8\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &\\equiv 2+4+6+8 \\\\\n&\\equiv 20\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c+d$ has the same remainder as $20$ upon division by $11$. This remainder is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the integers leave remainders of 2, 4, 6, and 8 when divided by 11, we can express each integer as $11a + r$, where $r$ is the remainder and $a$ is some integer. Let's denote the four integers as $11a + 2$, $11b + 4$, $11c + 6$, and $11d + 8$.\nWe can create a system of congruences using the above expression. Let's write the system of congruences as:\n\\begin{align*}\n11a &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n11b &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n11c &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n11d &\\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}\\\\\n\\end{align*}",
