    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nIn 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.What is the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again?\nLet's start by writing the year 2010 as $1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the digits of the year. \n\nSince the sum of the year's digits is 3, we have $a + b + c + d = 3$. \n\nWe can also express the year 2010 as $2010 = 1000(2) + 100(0) + 10(1) + 0$, which means $a=2$, $b=0$, $c=1$, and $d=0$. \n\nNext, we can look for relationships between the variables to help us solve the problem further. \n\nIt seems like we have made good progress so far and have all the necessary information to solve the problem. \n\nLet's find the product of the digits of the year 2010.",
    "solution": "The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1. So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.",
