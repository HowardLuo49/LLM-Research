The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30.If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5.What is the value of $n$?\nGiven that we know the possible prime numbers are 23 and 29, let's calculate the value of $n$ modulo 8 to verify if the remainder is 5 as indicated in the problem. \n\nFor $n = 23$, $23 \\mod 8 = 7$.\nFor $n = 29$, $29 \\mod 8 = 5$.\n\nThe value of 29 modulo 8 is indeed 5, satisfying the condition provided in the problem. \n\nThe final step is for you to confirm that 29 is a prime number between 20 and 30 and conclude that the solution to the given problem is n = 29.",
    "solution": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.",
