    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA positive two-digit number is even and is a multiple of 11.The product of its digits is a perfect cube.\nGiven that the number is even, we know that the last digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nSince the number is a multiple of 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd places and the sum of the digits in the even places must be a multiple of 11. \n\nLet's start by listing all the two-digit even multiples of 11: 22, 44, 66, 88.",
    "solution": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's calculate the sum of digits in the odd and even places for each of these numbers:\nFor 22: Odd - 2, Even - 2, Difference = 0\nFor 44: Odd - 4, Even - 4, Difference = 0\nFor 66: Odd - 6, Even - 6, Difference = 0\nFor 88: Odd - 8, Even - 8, Difference = 0\n\nSince none of these numbers have a difference that is a multiple of 11, there seems to be an issue with the approach. Let's reassess the problem statement.",
