You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA whole number, $N$, is chosen so that $\\frac{N}{3}$ is strictly between 7.5 and 8.\n",
    "solution": "$7.5<\\frac{N}{3}<8\\Rightarrow 22.5< N< 24$. Since $N$ is a whole number, $N=\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $\\frac{N}{3}$ lies strictly between 7.5 and 8, we can set up the following inequality: $7.5 < \\frac{N}{3} < 8$. Multiplying all parts by 3, we get $22.5 < N < 24$. This means $N$ could be 23. In order to ensure that this is the correct solution, we should check that $\\frac{N}{3}$ is indeed strictly between 7.5 and 8. This can be done by plugging in $N=23$ into the expression $\\frac{N}{3}$ and comparing it to 7.5 and 8. If it is indeed strictly between 7.5 and 8, then our solution is correct. The next steps for the person solving this problem is to do this check and confirm if $N=23$ is the correct choice.",
