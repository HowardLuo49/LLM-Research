You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nOne more than $11$ times a certain prime $p$ is another prime $q$.\n",
    "solution": "We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number. The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime. The value of $q$ is $\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given: $q = 11p + 1$.\n\nLet's first list out the prime numbers less than 100 to see if we can find values for $p$ and $q$.\nThe prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\nNext, we can substitute each prime number into the equation $q = 11p + 1$ and check if the resulting number is also a prime.\nFor each prime $p$, calculate $q = 11p + 1$. Then check if $q$ is prime.\n\nIf there is a mistake in the provided work, one should check the equation and calculations for errors. If the calculations are correct, the next step could be to analyze the patterns formed by the results to see if there is a systematic way to determine when the resulting number is prime.",
