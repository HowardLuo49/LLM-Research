The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nOne more than $11$ times a certain prime $p$ is another prime $q$.What is the value of $q$?\nGiven: $q = 11p + 1$.\n\nLet's first list out the prime numbers less than 100 to see if we can find values for $p$ and $q$.\nThe prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\nNext, we can substitute each prime number into the equation $q = 11p + 1$ and check if the resulting number is also a prime.\nFor each prime $p$, calculate $q = 11p + 1$. Then check if $q$ is prime.\n\nIf there is a mistake in the provided work, one should check the equation and calculations for errors. If the calculations are correct, the next step could be to analyze the patterns formed by the results to see if there is a systematic way to determine when the resulting number is prime.",
    "solution": "We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number. The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime. The value of $q$ is $\\boxed{23}$.",
