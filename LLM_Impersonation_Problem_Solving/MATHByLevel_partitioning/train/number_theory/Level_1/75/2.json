The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA total of 180 marbles (gray, white, and black) are placed in a line.The first five are gray, followed by four white, followed by three black, followed by five gray, followed by four white, followed by three black,....If this pattern continues, what is the color of the 158th marble in this line?\nTo find a pattern, let's calculate the number of marbles in each set of the sequence: 5 gray + 4 white + 3 black = 12 marbles. So, the sequence repeats after every 12 marbles.",
    "solution": "We notice that the marbles appear in strings of 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black.  These strings have 12 marbles each.  Since  \\[158=13\\cdot12+2,\\]there are 13 full strings of marbles and 2 extras.  Since the first 5 marbles in any group are gray, the two extra marbles must be $\\boxed{\\text{gray}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since 158 is not a multiple of 12, we need to find the remainder when 158 is divided by 12. \n\n158 \u00f7 12 = 13 R2\n\nThis means that the 158th marble is 2 marbles after the end of a complete pattern. \n\nStarting from the beginning, the first gray marble is followed by a white marble, so the 158th marble would be white. \n\nTherefore, the color of the 158th marble in the line is white.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response \\text{gray?: Since 158 is not a multiple of 12, we need to find the remainder when 158 is divided by 12. \n\n158 \u00f7 12 = 13 R2\n\nThis means that the 158th marble is 2 marbles after the end of a complete pattern. \n\nStarting from the beginning, the first gray marble is followed by a white marble, so the 158th marble would be white. \n\nTherefore, the color of the 158th marble in the line is white.",
