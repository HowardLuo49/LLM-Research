The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe integer $m$ is between $30$ and $80$ and is a multiple of $6$.When $m$ is divided by $8,$ the remainder is $2$.Similarly, when $m$ is divided by $5,$ the remainder is $2$.What is the value of $m$?\nLet's check each of the possible values of $m$ obtained to see which one satisfies $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nFor $m = 30$, $30 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$ is not true.\nFor $m = 36$, $36 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$ is not true.\nFor $m = 42$, $42 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$ is true.\nFor $m = 48$, $48 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ is not true.\nFor $m = 54$, $54 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{8}$ is not true.\nFor $m = 60$, $60 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$ is not true.\nFor $m = 66$, $66 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$ is true.\nFor $m = 72$, $72 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ is not true.\nFor $m = 78$, $78 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{8}$ is not true.\n\nSo, the possible values of $m$ that satisfies $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$ are $42$ and $66$.

This means there must have been an error in the previous calculations.
