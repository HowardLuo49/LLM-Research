The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen $n$ is divided by 3, the remainder is 2.What is the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3?\nGiven that $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, we know that $n = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNext, we can consider what happens when $n$ is divided by 4.\nSince $n = 3k + 2$, we can rewrite $n$ as $n = 3k - 2 + 4$ to better analyze its divisibility by 4.\n\nWe know that $3k - 2$ must be a multiple of 4.\nThis implies $3k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nTherefore, $k$ must be an odd integer for this to hold true.\n\nBased on the information we have so far, we can conclude that $n$ is of the form $n = 3(2m+1) + 2 = 6m + 5$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe next step would be to substitute $n = 6m + 5$ back into the original problem statement and verify if it satisfies the conditions given initially.",
    "solution": "Since $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Substituting $n = 6m + 5$ into $5n$, we get $5(6m + 5) = 30m + 25$.\nTo find the remainder when $30m + 25$ is divided by 3, we divide 30m by 3 to get 10m, and the remainder when 25 is divided by 3 is 1.\nThus, the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
