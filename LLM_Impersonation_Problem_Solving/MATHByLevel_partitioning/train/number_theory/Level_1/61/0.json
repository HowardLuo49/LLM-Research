    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen $n$ is divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n",
    "solution": "Since $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, we know that $n = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nNext, we can consider what happens when $n$ is divided by 4.\nSince $n = 3k + 2$, we can rewrite $n$ as $n = 3k - 2 + 4$ to better analyze its divisibility by 4.\n\nWe know that $3k - 2$ must be a multiple of 4.\nThis implies $3k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nTherefore, $k$ must be an odd integer for this to hold true.\n\nBased on the information we have so far, we can conclude that $n$ is of the form $n = 3(2m+1) + 2 = 6m + 5$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe next step would be to substitute $n = 6m + 5$ back into the original problem statement and verify if it satisfies the conditions given initially.",
