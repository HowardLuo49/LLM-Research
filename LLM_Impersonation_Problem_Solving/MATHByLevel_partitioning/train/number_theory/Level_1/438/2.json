The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen Joyce counts the pennies in her bank by fives, she has one left over.When she counts them by threes, there are two left over.What is the least possible number of pennies in the bank?\nSimilarly, if Joyce counts the pennies in her bank by threes, she has two left over, this means that N \u2261 2 (mod 3).\nTo find a number that satisfies both of these congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\nFirst, we list out numbers that are congruent to 1 modulo 5: 1, 6, 11, 16, ...\nNext, we list out numbers that are congruent to 2 modulo 3: 2, 5, 8, 11, ...\nWe need to find the first number that appears in both lists. Let's cross out numbers that don't appear in both lists.",

Then \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1\\pmod 5\\\\\na & \\equiv 2\\pmod 3\n\\end{align*} The first few positive solutions to $a\\equiv 1\\pmod 5$ are $1,6,11$.
