    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nDaniel has exactly $20$ pieces of candy.He has to divide them equally among his $3$ sisters.What is the least number of pieces he should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally?\nTo divide the $20$ candies equally among his $3$ sisters, we need to find a number that is a multiple of $3$ and also a factor of $20$. \nBy examining the factors of $20$, we see that the only factor that meets this condition is $4$. \nSo, Daniel can have $4$ sisters (including himself) to divide the $20$ candies equally among them.",
    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "The work done so far is incorrect. The least number of pieces Daniel should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally is $2$. This is because $20$ is not divisible by $3$.\n\nTo explain this further, since $20$ divided by $3$ gives a quotient of $6$ and a remainder of $2$, this means that not all $3$ sisters will get an equal share of the candy. Therefore, to distribute the candy equally, Daniel should take away $2$ pieces of candy so that he has $18$ pieces left to divide equally among his $3$ sisters, giving each sister $6$ pieces.",
