    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe time right now is 9 o'clock.\n",
    "solution": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.",
    "gpt_response": "I will consider a number theory problem related to the number 9.\n\nGiven the number 9, we can look at its factors: 1, 3, and 9.\n\nOne interesting property of the number 9 is that if you add its digits together, you get 9: 9 = 9.\n\nAnother property of the number 9 is that it is a perfect square, since 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nI will now work on finding other interesting properties or relationships involving the number 9 to present to the next person.",
