The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen Carlos divides his marbles into groups of six, seven, or eight, he has one marble left over.Assuming Carlos has more than one marble, what is the smallest possible number of marbles in Carlos's collection?\nGiven that Carlos has one marble left over when dividing into groups of 6, 7, or 8, we can write the following system of congruences:\n- x \u2261 1 (mod 6)\n- x \u2261 1 (mod 7)\n- x \u2261 1 (mod 8)\n\nTo solve the system, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nLet's first find a solution for the first two congruences (mod 6 and mod 7) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nNext, we will combine the solution from the first two congruences with the third congruence (mod 8) to find the final solution for x.\n\nAfter finding the final solution for x, we can calculate the least positive integer that satisfies the given conditions.",

We know that for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ $$N = 6a+1,\\\\N = 7b+1, \\\\N = 8c +1.$$In other words, $N-1$ is divisible by $6,$ $7,$ and $8.$ We have $$\\text{lcm}[6,7,8] = \\text{lcm}[3,7,8]= 3\\cdot 7\\cdot 8 = 168,$$and so $168$ divides $N-1.$ The smallest possible value of $N$ greater than $1$ is $N = 168+1 = \\boxed{169}.$",
