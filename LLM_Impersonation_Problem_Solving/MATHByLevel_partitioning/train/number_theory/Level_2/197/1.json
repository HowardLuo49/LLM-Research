The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe least common multiple of two integers is 36 and 6 is their greatest common divisor.What is the product of the two numbers?\nGiven that the least common multiple of two integers is 36 and their greatest common divisor is 6, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b) = a * b to find the two integers. Rearranging the formula, we have a * b = LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b).\n\nTherefore, a * b = 36 * 6 = 216. \n\nTo find the two integers, we need to find a pair of factors of 216 that have a GCD of 6.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers. We can use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{216}$.",
