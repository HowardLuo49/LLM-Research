There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose $11^5\\equiv n\\pmod 9$, where $0\\le n<9$.What is the value of $n$?\nGiven that $11\\equiv 2\\pmod 9$, we can simplify the congruence to $2^5\\equiv n\\pmod 9$.\n\nTo simplify $2^5\\pmod 9$, we first note that $2^4 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$ so $2^5 \\equiv 2\\cdot 7 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $11^5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$.",
