You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA whole number is said to be ''9-heavy'' if the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is greater than 5.\n",
    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that a number is considered ''9-heavy'' if the remainder when divided by 9 is greater than 5, we can first try to find the remainders of numbers from 1 to 9 when divided by 9 in order to see the pattern. \n1 mod 9 = 1, 2 mod 9 = 2, 3 mod 9 = 3, 4 mod 9 = 4, 5 mod 9 = 5, 6 mod 9 = 6, 7 mod 9 = 7, 8 mod 9 = 8, 9 mod 9 = 0.\nFrom this, we can see that a number is considered ''9-heavy'' if it is 6, 7, 8 or 9 (0) modulo 9.",
