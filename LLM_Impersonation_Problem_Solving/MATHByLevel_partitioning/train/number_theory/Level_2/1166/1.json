The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA whole number is said to be ''9-heavy'' if the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is greater than 5.What is the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number?\nGiven that a number is considered ''9-heavy'' if the remainder when divided by 9 is greater than 5, we can first try to find the remainders of numbers from 1 to 9 when divided by 9 in order to see the pattern. \n1 mod 9 = 1, 2 mod 9 = 2, 3 mod 9 = 3, 4 mod 9 = 4, 5 mod 9 = 5, 6 mod 9 = 6, 7 mod 9 = 7, 8 mod 9 = 8, 9 mod 9 = 0.\nFrom this, we can see that a number is considered ''9-heavy'' if it is 6, 7, 8 or 9 (0) modulo 9.",
    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
    "gpt_response": "The smallest three-digit number that leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9 is 105. However, this is not considered ''9-heavy'' since the remainder is not greater than 5. The next smallest three-digit number that leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 9 is 106. This is also not ''9-heavy.'' Continuing this pattern, the smallest three-digit number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 9 is 107. This is also not ''9-heavy.'' Finally, the smallest three-digit number that leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 9 is 108. Since 0 is greater than 5, 108 is the smallest three-digit 9-heavy whole number.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 105?: The smallest three-digit number that leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9 is 105.
