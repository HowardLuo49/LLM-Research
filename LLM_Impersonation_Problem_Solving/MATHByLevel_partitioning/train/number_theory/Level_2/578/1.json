    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe decimal representation of a fraction ends in $0.\\overline{3}$.When the decimal is changed to a common fraction and reduced to lowest terms, what is the denominator of the fraction?\nGiven that the fraction ends in $0.\\overline{3}$, we can express it as $\\frac{x}{10} + \\frac{3}{90}$ where $x$ is an integer. \n\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{x}{10} + \\frac{3}{90}$, we get $\\frac{9x + 1}{30}$.\n\nSince the decimal representation of the fraction ends in $0.\\overline{3}$, the fraction must equal $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSetting $\\frac{9x + 1}{30} = \\frac{1}{3}$ and solving for $x$, we get $x = 3$. \n\nThus, the fraction is $\\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{3}{90} = \\frac{10}{30} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{11}{30}$. \n\nTo prove this is the correct fraction with a decimal representation of $0.\\overline{3}$, the next person should convert $\\frac{11}{30}$ to a decimal and check if it indeed ends in $0.\\overline{3}$.",
    "solution": "Let $S = 0.\\overline{3}$. Then $10S = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the second equation from the first we obtain $9S = 3$, so $S = \\frac13$. The desired denominator is $\\boxed{3}$.",
