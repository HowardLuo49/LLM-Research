There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\n$100_{10}$ in base $b$ has exactly $5$ digits.What is the value of $b$?\nTo find the base $b$ in which $100_{10}$ has exactly $5$ digits, we can set up the inequality $b^4 \\leq 100 < b^5$ and solve for $b$. \n\n$1^4 \\leq 100 < 1^5$ is not true. \n\n$2^4 \\leq 100 < 2^5$ is not true. \n\n$3^4 \\leq 100 < 3^5$ is not true. \n\n$4^4 \\leq 100 < 4^5$ is true because $256 \\leq 100 < 1024$. \n\nTherefore, the base $b$ in which $100_{10}$ has exactly $5$ digits is $4$.",
    "solution": "For a base $b$ representation of $100_{10}$ to have exactly $5$ digits, the largest power of $b$ that is less than $100$ must be $4$. Therefore, we have the requirement that $b^4 \\le 100 < b^5$. We then realize that $b=3$ satisfies this requirement since $3^4 < 100 < 3^5$. We also realize that this is the only possible value of $b$ since if $b$ were equal to $2$, $b^5 = 2^5$ would be less than $100$ and if $b$ were equal to $4$, $b^4 = 4^4$ would be greater than $100$. Thus, our only solution is $b = \\boxed{3}$.",
