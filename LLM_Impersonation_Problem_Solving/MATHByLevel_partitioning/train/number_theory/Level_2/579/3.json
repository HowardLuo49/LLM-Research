    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWinnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.How many balloons does Winnie end up keeping for herself?\nTo solve this problem, we can adjust the number of balloons distributed to each friend by rounding down to the nearest whole number. This means that each of Winnie's 8 nearest and dearest friends will receive 24 balloons. Additionally, we should check if there are any remaining balloons after distributing 24 balloons to each friend in order to make sure we have accounted for all of Winnie's balloons.",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "gpt_response": "Since Winnie has a total of 17 + 33 + 65 + 83 = 198 balloons, she gives away 8 friends * 24 balloons/friend = 192 balloons. \nThis means Winnie ends up keeping 198 total balloons - 192 balloons given away = 6 balloons for herself. \nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 6 balloons for herself.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 6?: Since Winnie has a total of 17 + 33 + 65 + 83 = 198 balloons, she gives away 8 friends * 24 balloons/friend = 192 balloons. \nThis means Winnie ends up keeping 198 total balloons - 192 balloons given away = 6 balloons for herself. \nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 6 balloons for herself.",
