The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen a number is divided by 7, the remainder is 2.What is the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7?\nLet's use modular arithmetic to represent this information: \nLet the number be x, so we have x \u2261 2 (mod 7). \n\nNext, we need to express the information that when this number is divided by 5, the remainder is 4. \nSo we have x \u2261 4 (mod 5). \n\nTo find the number x that satisfies both these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This involves solving a system of congruences to find the unique solution up to modulo 35 (7*5). \n\nNow, let's set up the system of congruences using the information provided. \nFirst, x \u2261 2 (mod 7) and x \u2261 4 (mod 5). \n\nNow we can solve this system of congruences to find the number x that satisfies both conditions.",
