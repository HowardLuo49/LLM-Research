The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers.What is the sum of those five integers?\nGiven that 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers, we can set up an equation to find these integers.\nLet the smaller integer be x, then the larger integer is x + 1.\nWe have the equation x(x + 1) = 210.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get x^2 + x - 210 = 0.\n\nNext, we can solve the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 210 = 0 to find the values of x.\nThe solutions to this equation will give us the consecutive positive integers that multiply to 210.\n\nOnce we have the values of x, we can find the consecutive positive integers and check if they indeed multiply to 210.\n\nWe also know that 210 is the product of three consecutive integers, so we can set up another equation to find these integers.\nLet the middle integer be represented by x, then the three consecutive integers are x - 1, x, and x + 1.\nWe have the equation (x - 1)x(x + 1) = 210.\n\nSolving this equation will give us the three consecutive integers that multiply to 210.\n\nAfter finding the consecutive integers from both equations, we can compare the results and determine if there are any discrepancies or if the solution is consistent.",
    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
