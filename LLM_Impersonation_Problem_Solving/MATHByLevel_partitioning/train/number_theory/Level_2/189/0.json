The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor each positive integer $n$, let $n!$ denote the product $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot\\,\\cdots\\,\\cdot (n-1)\\cdot n$.\n",
