    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEach row of a seating arrangement seats 7 or 8 people.\n",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that each row of the seating arrangement seats 7 or 8 people, we can say that the total number of people seated in rows of 7 must be a multiple of 7, and the total number of people seated in rows of 8 must be a multiple of 8.\n\nLet's denote the number of rows of 7 people as x and the number of rows of 8 people as y. We can set up the following equations:\n7x + 8y = total number of people\n\nWe also know that the total number of people seated in rows of 7 or 8 must be a multiple of both 7 and 8. The least common multiple of 7 and 8 is 56. This means that the total number of people must be a multiple of 56.\n\nWe can use the information above to create a plan for finding the possible number of rows of 7 and 8 people that satisfy the conditions given.",
