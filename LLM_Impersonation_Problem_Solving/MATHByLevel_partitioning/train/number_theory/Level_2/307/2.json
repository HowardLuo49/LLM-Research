    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nIt is now 12:00:00 midnight, as read on a 12-hour digital clock.In 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds the time will be $A:B:C$.What is the value of $A + B + C$?\nThe next step is to convert 122 hours to days in order to simplify the calculation. \n\n$122 \\text{ hours} = \\frac{122}{24} \\approx 5.083 \\text{ days}$\n\nSo we have a total of 5 days and 0.083 days, which is around 2 hours. \n\nNext, we convert 39 minutes to hours in order to add it to our total hours calculated earlier. \n\n$39 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{39}{60} \\approx 0.65 \\text{ hours}$\n\nAdding this to the 122 hours, we get a total of 122.65 hours.",
    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the final time on the clock, we add 122.65 hours to the initial time of 12:00:00 midnight. \n\nThis gives us a new time of approximately 10:39:44 am. \n\nTherefore, $A = 10$, $B = 3$, and $C = 9$. \n\nAdding these values together, we get $A + B + C = 10 + 3 + 9 = 22$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $A + B + C$ is $\\boxed{22}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 85?: To determine the final time on the clock, we add 122.65 hours to the initial time of 12:00:00 midnight. \n\nThis gives us a new time of approximately 10:39:44 am. \n\nTherefore, $A = 10$, $B = 3$, and $C = 9$. \n\nAdding these values together, we get $A + B + C = 10 + 3 + 9 = 22$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $A + B + C$ is $\\boxed{22}$.",
