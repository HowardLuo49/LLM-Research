The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind the greatest common factor of 5!and 6!.(Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (n-1)\\cdot n$.)\nTo find the greatest common factor of 5! and 6!, we need to find the prime factorization of 6!. \n6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720\n\nNext, let's find the prime factors of 720 to determine the greatest common factor. \nPrime factorization of 720: 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5\n\nNow, we need to determine the shared factors between the prime factorizations of 120 and 720 to find the greatest common factor of 5! and 6!.",
