    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nKate has saved up $4444_8$ dollars for a trip to France.A round-trip airline ticket costs $1000_{10}$ dollars.In base ten, how many dollars will she have left for lodging and food?\nTo convert 2340 (from base 8) to base 10, we would multiply each digit by 8 raised to the power of its position from right to left, then sum those values. \n$2340_8 = 2 \\times 8^3 + 3 \\times 8^2 + 4 \\times 8^1 + 0 \\times 8^0 = 1024 + 192 + 32 + 0 = 1248$.\nSince Kate saved 1248 dollars and a round-trip airline ticket costs 1000 dollars, we can subtract 1000 from 1248 to find out how much money she'll have left after buying the ticket.",
    "solution": "$4444_8=4\\cdot8^3+4\\cdot8^2+4\\cdot8^1+4\\cdot8^0=2048+256+32+4=2340_{10}$. Therefore, Kate will have $2340-1000=\\boxed{1340}$ dollars for lodging and food.",
    "gpt_response": "$1248 - 1000 = 248$.\n\nAfter buying the airline ticket, Kate will have $248 left for lodging and food.",
