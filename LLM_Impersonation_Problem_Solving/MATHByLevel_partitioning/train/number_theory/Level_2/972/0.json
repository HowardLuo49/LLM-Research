    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box.\n",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's try to find the sum of the numbers on all the cards. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated by using the formula: (first term + last term) * number of terms / 2. So, the sum of the numbers on the cards should be (1 + 50) * 50 / 2 = 1275.",
