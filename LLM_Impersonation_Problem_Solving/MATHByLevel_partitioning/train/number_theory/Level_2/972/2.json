    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box.One card is randomly selected.What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7?\nThe sum of the numbers on the cards should actually be (1 + 50) * 50 / 2 = 1275, so that calculation is correct. To find the expected value of one randomly selected card, we can use the formula for the average of a continuous sequence which is (first term + last term) / 2. So, the expected value of one randomly selected card is (1 + 50) / 2 = 25.5.",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cards that are both prime and multiples of 7 between 1 and 50. We can start off by listing down prime numbers less than 50: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47. Next, identify which of these are multiples of 7.",
