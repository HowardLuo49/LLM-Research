    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nEvery bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.The Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.If the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?\nFrom the equation n*x = 138, substitute n = x + 3: (x + 3)*x = 138.\nThus, x^2 + 3x = 138.\nRearranging the equation, we get x^2 + 3x - 138 = 0.\nThis is now a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",

Therefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over is 2.",
