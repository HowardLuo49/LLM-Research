    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEvery bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.The Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\nGiven that there are n bags of Dummies, let's denote the number of pieces in each bag as x.\nThe total number of pieces of Dummies in n bags can be represented as n*x.\nWe know that the total number of pieces is equal to 138, and the number of bags is equal to 3 more than the number of pieces in each bag.\nTherefore, we can create the equation n*x = 138 and n = x + 3. \nNow we can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for x.",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "From the equation n*x = 138, substitute n = x + 3: (x + 3)*x = 138.\nThus, x^2 + 3x = 138.\nRearranging the equation, we get x^2 + 3x - 138 = 0.\nThis is now a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.",
