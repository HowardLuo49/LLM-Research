    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe base six number $53_{6}$ is equal to the base $b$ number $113_{b}$.What is the positive value of $b$?\nGiven the base six number $53_{6}$, we can convert it to a base ten number by following the formula $(5*6^{1}) + (3*6^{0}) = 33_{10}$. \n\nTo find the value of the base $b$ number $113_{b}$, we can convert it to a base ten number by following the formula $(1*b^{2}) + (1*b^{1}) + (3*b^{0}) = b^{2} + b + 3$.\n\nSince $b^{2} + b + 3 = 33$, we can set up the equation $b^{2} + b - 30 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula: $b = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4*30}}{2}$.\n\nCalculating the value inside the square root gives $1+120 = 121$.\n\nTherefore, $b = \\frac{-1 \\pm 11}{2}$ which gives two potential values for $b$: $b = 5$ or $b = -6$. \n\nThe negative value for b does not make sense in this context, so the value of $b$ that solves the equation is $b = 5$. \n\nThus, the base $b$ number $113_{b}$ is equal to $33_{10}$ when $b=5$. \n\nThe next steps for solving the problem could involve confirming the solution for b=5 by converting $113_{5}$ to base ten and verifying that it equals 33.",
    "solution": "First, we have $$53_6=5\\cdot6^1+3\\cdot6^0=33_{10}.$$ and  $$113_b=1\\cdot b^2+1\\cdot b^1+3\\cdot b^0=(b^2+b+3)_{10}.$$ Therefore, we must have $b^2+b+3=33$, so $b^2+b-30=0$. Factoring we have $(b-5)(b+6)=0$. Thus, $b=5$ or $b=-6$. The positive value is $b=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The solution provided is correct. The positive value of $b$ that makes $53_{6} = 113_{b}$ true is $b = 5$. \n\nTo confirm this, we can convert $113_{5}$ to base ten: $(1*5^{2}) + (1*5^{1}) + (3*5^{0}) = 25 + 5 + 3 = 33$. \n\nTherefore, the solution is verified, and the positive value of $b$ is indeed $5$.",

The positive value of $b$ that makes $53_{6} = 113_{b}$ true is $b = 5$. \n\nTo confirm this, we can convert $113_{5}$ to base ten: $(1*5^{2}) + (1*5^{1}) + (3*5^{0}) = 25 + 5 + 3 = 33$. \n\nTherefore, the solution is verified, and the positive value of $b$ is indeed $5$.",
