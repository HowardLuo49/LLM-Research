    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe number of students in Teresa's graduating class is more than 50 and fewer than 100 and is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5.\n",
    "solution": "Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv -1\\equiv 2\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv -2\\equiv 2\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv -3\\equiv 2\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv 2\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 2\\pmod{60}$. Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the number of students is 1 less than a multiple of 3, we can write the number of students as 3n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nSince the number of students is also 2 less than a multiple of 4, we can write the number of students as 4m - 2, where m is a positive integer.\n\nSimilarly, since the number of students is 3 less than a multiple of 5, we can write the number of students as 5k - 3, where k is a positive integer.\n\nTo find the common value for n, m, and k, we can set the three expressions equal to each other: 3n - 1 = 4m - 2 = 5k - 3.\n\nSolving the equations simultaneously will allow us to determine the number of students in Teresa's graduating class.",
