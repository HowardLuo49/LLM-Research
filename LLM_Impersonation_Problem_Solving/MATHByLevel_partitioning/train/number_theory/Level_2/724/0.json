You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\n$A, B, C$ and $D$ are distinct positive integers such that the product $AB = 60$,  the product $CD = 60$ and $A - B = C + D$ .\n",
