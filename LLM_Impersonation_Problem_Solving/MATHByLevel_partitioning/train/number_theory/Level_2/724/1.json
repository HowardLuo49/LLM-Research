The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\n$A, B, C$ and $D$ are distinct positive integers such that the product $AB = 60$,  the product $CD = 60$ and $A - B = C + D$ .What is the value of $A$?\nGiven that $AB = 60$ and $CD = 60$, we can list the possible pairs of $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$ that satisfy the conditions.\nFor $AB = 60$:\n$(1, 60), (2, 30), (3, 20), (4, 15), (5, 12), (6, 10)$\nFor $CD = 60$:\n$(1, 60), (2, 30), (3, 20), (4, 15), (5, 12), (6, 10)$\nNow, let's find all possible pairs $(A,B,C,D)$ such that $A - B = C + D$.",
