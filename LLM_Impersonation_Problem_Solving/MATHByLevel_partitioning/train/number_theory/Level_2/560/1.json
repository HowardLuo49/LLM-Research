The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe decimal expansion of $8/11$ is a repeating decimal.What is the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11?\nWe know that $8/11 = 0.\\overline{72}$ which means the decimal part is $72$. \nTo convert this decimal to a fraction, we can set $x = 0.\\overline{72}$ and multiply it by $100$ to shift the decimal two places to the right to get $100x = 72.\\overline{72}$.\nNext, we can subtract the original equation $8/11$ from $100x$ to eliminate the repeating part: $100x - x = 72.\\overline{72} - 0.\\overline{72}$.\nSolving the equation $99x = 72$, we can find the value of $x$ which is $72/99$.",
    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99.  The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To simplify the fraction $72/99$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. Dividing both 72 and 99 by 9, we get $8/11$.\nTherefore, the least number of digits in a repeating block of $8/11$ is 2.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 2?: To simplify the fraction $72/99$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. Dividing both 72 and 99 by 9, we get $8/11$.\nTherefore, the least number of digits in a repeating block of $8/11$ is 2.",
