You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe decimal expansion of $8/11$ is a repeating decimal.\n",
    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99.  The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $8/11 = 0.\\overline{72}$ which means the decimal part is $72$. \nTo convert this decimal to a fraction, we can set $x = 0.\\overline{72}$ and multiply it by $100$ to shift the decimal two places to the right to get $100x = 72.\\overline{72}$.\nNext, we can subtract the original equation $8/11$ from $100x$ to eliminate the repeating part: $100x - x = 72.\\overline{72} - 0.\\overline{72}$.\nSolving the equation $99x = 72$, we can find the value of $x$ which is $72/99$.",
