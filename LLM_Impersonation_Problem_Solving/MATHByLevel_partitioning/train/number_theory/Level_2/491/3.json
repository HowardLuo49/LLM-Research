    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nMarcus has two numbers, $a$ and $b$.When he divides $a$ by 45 he gets a remainder of 37.When he divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of $9$.What remainder does he get when he divides $a+b$ by 15?\nTo solve this congruence, we can rewrite it as $15 - b \\equiv 37 \\pmod{45}$. Substituting $37 \\equiv -8 \\pmod{45}$, we get $15 - b \\equiv -8 \\pmod{45}$. Therefore, $15 - b = 45k - 8$ for some integer $k$.\nThe next steps would involve simplifying this equation and finding possible values for $b$ within a certain range.",
    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
