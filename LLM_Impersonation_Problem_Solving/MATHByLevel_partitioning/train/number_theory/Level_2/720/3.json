    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWinnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?\nBased on the fact that the GCD of the number of each type of lollipop is 1, and there are no common factors among them, we should focus on finding a common divisor between the total number of lollipops and the number of friends Winnie has (11).\nTo do this, we will calculate the remainder when the total number of lollipops (394) is divided by the number of friends (11). This will help us determine if each friend can indeed receive an equal number of lollipops. If the remainder is 0, then it is possible for each friend to receive an equal number of lollipops.",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the remainder when 394 is divided by 11, we perform the division 394 \u00f7 11 = 35 with a remainder of 9.\nSince the remainder is not 0, it means that it is not possible for each of Winnie's 11 friends to receive an equal number of lollipops.\nTo find out how many lollipops Winnie ends up keeping for herself, we need to find the total number of lollipops that Winnie gives to her friends. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of friends (11) by the number of lollipops each friend receives:\n11 friends \u00d7 35 lollipops = 385 lollipops given away.\nTo find out how many lollipops Winnie keeps for herself, we subtract the lollipops given away from the total number of lollipops:\n394 total lollipops - 385 lollipops given away = 9 lollipops kept by Winnie.\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself.",
