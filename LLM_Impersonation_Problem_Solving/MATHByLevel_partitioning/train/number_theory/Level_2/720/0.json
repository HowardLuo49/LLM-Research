    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWinnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.\n",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of lollipops that Winnie has, we need to add the number of each type of lollipop she has: 45 + 116 + 4 + 229 = 394 lollipops in total. \n\nNext, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of each type of lollipop to see if there is a common factor among them. \n\nAfter finding the GCD, we can then look for any patterns or relationships between the different types of lollipops to see if there are any interesting number theory properties at play.",
