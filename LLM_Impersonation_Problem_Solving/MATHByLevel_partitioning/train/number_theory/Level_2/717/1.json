    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA bag of grapes is to be distributed evenly to 5 kids in a class, and the grapes that are left over will be thrown out.If each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, what is the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out?\nGiven that the bag has a total of 37 grapes, we can first determine how many grapes each kid will receive if they are distributed evenly. Let's do that first. \n\n37 grapes / 5 kids = 7 grapes per kid with 2 grapes left over. \n\nTo distribute the grapes evenly, each kid will receive 7 grapes from the bag. This means that there are 2 grapes left over that will be thrown out. \n\nNext, we can find an equation to determine the total number of grapes in the bag based on the number of grapes left over when evenly distributing them to the 5 kids. \n\nLet x be the total number of grapes in the bag, and using the equation:\n\nx mod 5 = 2\n\nWe can solve for x by finding the smallest positive integer that satisfies the equation. This will give us the solution to the problem. \n\nNow, it's up to you to solve the equation x mod 5 = 2 to determine the total number of grapes in the bag.",
    "solution": "If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number.  On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student.  So $\\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the equation x mod 5 = 2, we need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition.\nThe remainder when x is divided by 5 must be 2, so the possible values of x are 7, 12, 17, 22, ... since adding multiples of 5 will keep the remainder same.\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies the equation x mod 5 = 2 is 7. Therefore, the total number of grapes in the bag is 7. \n\nSince each student receives 7 grapes and 2 grapes are left over to be thrown out, the answer to the problem is: the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out is 2.",
