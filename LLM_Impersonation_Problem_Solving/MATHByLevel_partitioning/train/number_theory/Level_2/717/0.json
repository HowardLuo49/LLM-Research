You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA bag of grapes is to be distributed evenly to 5 kids in a class, and the grapes that are left over will be thrown out.\n",
    "solution": "If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number.  On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student.  So $\\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the bag has a total of 37 grapes, we can first determine how many grapes each kid will receive if they are distributed evenly. Let's do that first. \n\n37 grapes / 5 kids = 7 grapes per kid with 2 grapes left over. \n\nTo distribute the grapes evenly, each kid will receive 7 grapes from the bag. This means that there are 2 grapes left over that will be thrown out. \n\nNext, we can find an equation to determine the total number of grapes in the bag based on the number of grapes left over when evenly distributing them to the 5 kids. \n\nLet x be the total number of grapes in the bag, and using the equation:\n\nx mod 5 = 2\n\nWe can solve for x by finding the smallest positive integer that satisfies the equation. This will give us the solution to the problem. \n\nNow, it's up to you to solve the equation x mod 5 = 2 to determine the total number of grapes in the bag.",
