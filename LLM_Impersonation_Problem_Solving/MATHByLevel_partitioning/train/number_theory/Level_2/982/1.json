The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTo prepare for her half-marathon, Mary ran a total of $2847_9$ miles.How many miles (in base ten) did Mary run?\nConverting $2847_9$ to base 10, we get $2(9^3) + 8(9^2) + 4(9^1) + 7(9^0) = 2(729) + 8(81) + 4(9) + 7(1) = 1458 + 648 + 36 + 7 = 2149$ miles.",
    "solution": "$2847_9=2\\cdot9^3+8\\cdot9^2+4\\cdot9^1+7\\cdot9^0=1458+648+36+7=\\boxed{2149}$ miles.",
    "gpt_response": "The correct calculation for converting $2847_9$ to base 10 should be: $2(9^3) + 8(9^2) + 4(9^1) + 7(9^0) = 2(729) + 8(81) + 4(9) + 7(1) = 1458 + 648 + 36 + 7 = 2149$ miles. Therefore, Mary ran a total of 2149 miles in base ten.",
