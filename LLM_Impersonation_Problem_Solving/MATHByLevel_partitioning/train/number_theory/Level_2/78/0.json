    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThere are 54 chips in a box.\n",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips. From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $2l+p=54$. We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$. Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Based on the fact that there are 54 chips in the box, we can work with the number 54 in our calculations. Let's first try to find the prime factorization of 54 to see if it provides any insights into the problem. The prime factorization of 54 is 2 x 3 x 3 x 3. Therefore, 54 can be written as 2^1 x 3^3.",
