    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThere are 54 chips in a box.Each chip is either small or large.If the number of small chips is greater than the number of large chips by a prime number of chips, what is the greatest possible number of large chips?\nGiven that each chip in the box is either small or large, it means that there are two options for each chip. Let's define the number of small chips in the box as x and the number of large chips as y. Therefore, we have the equation x + y = 54.\n\nTo make further progress in solving this problem, let's consider the fact that each chip can be either small or large, leading to a binary choice for each chip. This concept can be related to the prime factorization of 54 as 2^1 x 3^3, with the powers representing the possible choices for each factor.",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips. From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $2l+p=54$. We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$. Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Next, we are given that the number of small chips is greater than the number of large chips by a prime number. Since 2 is the only even prime number, the number of small chips x must be 2 more than the number of large chips y. This gives us the equation x = y + 2.\n\nSubstitute x = y + 2 into the equation x + y = 54: (y + 2) + y = 54\nCombine like terms: 2y + 2 = 54\nSubtract 2 from both sides: 2y = 52\nDivide by 2: y = 26\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of large chips is 26.",
