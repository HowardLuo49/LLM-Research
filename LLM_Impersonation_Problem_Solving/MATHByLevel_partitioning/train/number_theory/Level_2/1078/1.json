The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen an integer is divided by 15, the remainder is 7.Find the sum of the remainders when the same integer is divided by 3 and by 5.\nGiven information: \\( \\text{Integer} \\equiv  7 \\pmod{15} \\)\n\nTo solve for the integer, we can represent it as \\( 15n + 7 \\) where \\( n \\) is some integer.\n\nWe can start by listing out a few possible values of \\( n \\) and calculating the corresponding integer:\n- For \\( n = 0 \\), the integer is \\( 15(0) + 7 = 7 \\)\n- For \\( n = 1 \\), the integer is \\( 15(1) + 7 = 22 \\)\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), the integer is \\( 15(2) + 7 = 37 \\)\n\nThe next person can continue this pattern to find the integer corresponding to larger values of \\( n \\) until a general formula is derived.",
    "solution": "We let our integer be $n$.  the first sentence tells us that  \\[n\\equiv 7\\pmod {15}.\\] Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 15 we deduce \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv7\\equiv2\\pmod5.\n\\end{align*} Therefore the remainders in question are 1 and 2, and their sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
