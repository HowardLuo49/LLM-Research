    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFor the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.Every 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\nLet's first determine how many fans entered the stadium for the opening game. We know that every 75th fan gets a free hot dog, so we need to find the smallest multiple of 75 that is greater than the total number of fans. Let's denote the total number of fans as F.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many fans actually received a coupon for a free hot dog. To do this, we will divide the total number of fans by 75 and take the floor of the result. Let's denote this number as D.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the number of coupons given out by multiplying D by 1, since each of the D fans received one free hot dog coupon. Let's denote this final number as C. \n\nYour task is to find the total number of fans who entered the stadium for the opening game of the season, given that C = 32.",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first denote the total number of fans as F. We know that the number of coupons given out for free hot dogs is C = F/75. Since C = 32, we can set up the equation 32 = F/75 and solve for F. Multiplying both sides by 75, we get F = 32 * 75 = 2400. Therefore, the total number of fans who entered the stadium for the opening game of the season is 2400.",
