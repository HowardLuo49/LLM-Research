    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.Every 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.Every 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.The stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game.How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?\nTo calculate the number of fans who received a coupon for a free bag of popcorn, we first need to find the number of fans who received either a hot dog coupon, a soda coupon, or a popcorn coupon. \n\nLet's start by finding the number of fans who received either a hot dog coupon, a soda coupon, or a popcorn coupon by summing the number of fans who received each type of coupon. \n\nNumber of fans who received a hot dog: F/75 = 4000/75 = 53 fans\nNumber of fans who received a soda: F/30 = 4000/30 = 133 fans\nNumber of fans who received a popcorn: F/50 = 4000/50 = 80 fans\n\nTotal number of fans who received at least one coupon = fans who received a hot dog + fans who received a soda + fans who received a popcorn\n= 53 + 133 + 80\n= 266\n\nSo, 266 fans received at least one coupon. \n\nNext, let's calculate the number of fans who received a coupon for a free bag of popcorn. We can do this by finding the number of fans who received only a popcorn coupon and the number of fans who received both a popcorn coupon and another type of coupon.",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of fans who received only a popcorn coupon, we need to find the least common multiple of 30, 50, and 75. \nLCM(30, 50, 75) = 150\n\nThe number of fans who received only a popcorn coupon is F/150 = 4000/150 = 26 fans. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of fans who received both a popcorn coupon and another type of coupon. \nTo do this, we need to find the number of fans who received both a hot dog and popcorn coupon, both a soda and popcorn coupon, and both a hot dog and soda coupon. \n\nNumber of fans who received both a hot dog and popcorn coupon: F/(75*50) = 4000/(75*50) = 10 fans\nNumber of fans who received both a soda and popcorn coupon: F/(30*50) = 4000/(30*50) = 26 fans\nNumber of fans who received both a hot dog and soda coupon: F/(75*30) = 4000/(75*30) = 17 fans\n\nTotal number of fans who received both a popcorn coupon and another type of coupon = 10 + 26 + 17 = 53 fans\n\nTherefore, the total number of fans who were lucky enough to receive all three free items is the sum of fans who received only a popcorn coupon and fans who received both a popcorn coupon and another type of coupon, which is 26 + 53 = 79 fans.",
