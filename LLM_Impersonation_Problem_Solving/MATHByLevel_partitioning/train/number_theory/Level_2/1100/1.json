    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor a certain natural number $n$, $n^2$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, and $n^3$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.What remainder does $n$ give when divided by 5?\nGiven that $n^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, we can rewrite this as $n^2 = 5a + 4$ for some integer $a$. Similarly, $n^3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ implies $n^3 = 5b + 2$ for some integer $b$. Now, we can expand $n^3 = (5a + 4)n = 5(5an) + 4n = 5b + 2$.\nThus, we have $5an = b - \\frac{2n}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}$. Since $5an$ is an integer, the right side must be an integer as well.\nWe can proceed by solving for $n$ using the equations $n^2 = 5a + 4$ and $n^3 = 5b + 2$, and then substituting the expression for $n$ into the equation $5an = b - \\frac{2n}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}$ to find possible values of $a$ and $b$.\nThis approach will help determine the values of $n, a, b$ that satisfy the given conditions, allowing us to find the natural number $n$ requested in the problem.",
    "solution": "If two numbers give the same remainder when divided by 5, they are said to be equivalent, modulo 5.  From $n^2$ to $n^3$, we have multiplied by $n$.  Since $n^2$ is equivalent to 4 (modulo 5), and $n^3$ is equivalent to 2 (modulo 5), we are looking for an integer $n$ for which $4\\cdot n$ is equivalent to 2, modulo 5.  Notice that if $n$ is greater than 4, then we can replace it with its remainder when divided by 5 without changing whether it satisfies the condition. Therefore, we may assume that $0\\leq n <5$.  Trying 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we find that only $\\boxed{3}$ times 4 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.",
