    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe sum of the digits of the year 2004 is 6.\n",
    "solution": "To find the first year after $2000$ for which the sum of the digits is $12$, take the greatest possible units digit, $9$. $2+9=11$, so take $1$ as the tens digit and $0$ as the hundreds digit. The answer is therefore $\\boxed{2019}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the sum of the digits of the year 2004 is 6, we can calculate the remainder when dividing 2004 by 9 to see if it is a multiple of 9. \n2004 divided by 9 is 222, with a remainder of 6. \nSince the remainder is 6, 2004 is not a multiple of 9. \n\nPlan for the next person: \n1. Determine if 2004 is a prime number.\n2. Find the prime factors of 2004.\n3. Check if any of the prime factors are congruent to 1 (mod 4) to determine if 2004 can be expressed as sum of two squares.",
