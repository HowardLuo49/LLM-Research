You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSuppose $77\\cdot 88\\cdot 99 \\equiv n\\pmod{20}$, where $0\\le n<20$.\n",
