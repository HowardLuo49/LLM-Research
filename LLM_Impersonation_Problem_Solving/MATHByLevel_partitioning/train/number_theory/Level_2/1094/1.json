The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose $173\\cdot 927\\equiv n\\pmod{50}$, where $0\\le n< 50$.What is the value of $n$?\nGiven $173\\cdot 927\\equiv n\\pmod{50}$, we can calculate the value of $173\\cdot 927$ and then find the remainder when divided by $50$. \n\nFirst, we calculate $173\\cdot 927$:\n\n$173\\cdot 927 = 160071$\n\nNow, find the remainder when divided by $50$:\n\n$160071 \\mod 50 = 21$\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ in the congruence $173\\cdot 927\\equiv n\\pmod{50}$ is $n = 21$.",
