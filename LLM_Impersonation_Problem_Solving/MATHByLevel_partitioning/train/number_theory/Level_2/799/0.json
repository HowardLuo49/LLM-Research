You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFour consecutive positive integers have a product of 840.\n",
    "solution": "We have $840=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot7=4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The largest of the four integers is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding the prime factorization of 840: 840 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7.\n\nNow, since we are looking for four consecutive positive integers, let's call the first integer x. Then the second integer would be x+1, the third x+2, and the fourth x+3.\n\nSince the product of the four integers is 840, we can set up the following equation: x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = 840.",
