The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFour consecutive positive integers have a product of 840.What is the largest of the four integers?\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of 840: 840 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7.\n\nNow, since we are looking for four consecutive positive integers, let's call the first integer x. Then the second integer would be x+1, the third x+2, and the fourth x+3.\n\nSince the product of the four integers is 840, we can set up the following equation: x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = 840.",
    "solution": "We have $840=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot7=4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The largest of the four integers is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Expanding the left side of the equation, we get x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = x^4 + 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x = 840.\n\nNow, let's substitute the prime factorization of 840 into the equation: x^4 + 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7.\n\nBy looking at the prime factorization on the right side, we can see that x=5 satisfies the equation: 5^4 + 6(5)^3 + 11(5)^2 + 6(5) = 625 + 750 + 275 + 30 = 1680.\n\nTherefore, the largest of the four integers is x+3 = 5+3 = 8. So, the largest integer is 8.",
