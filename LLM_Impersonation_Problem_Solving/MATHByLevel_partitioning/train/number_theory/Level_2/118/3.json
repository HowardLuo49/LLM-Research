The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nYou have a number of gold coins that you were going to distribute equally among your 11 best friends.However, after dividing your gold coins into 11 equal piles, you realize that if you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin.You have less than 100 gold coins.What is the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen?\nTo find the total number of gold coins x that satisfies the condition x = 11k + 2, we need to check values of k starting from 0 and increasing by 1 until we find a value that is less than 100. \n5. Start with k = 0, plug into the equation x = 11k + 2 to find x: x = 11(0) + 2 = 2.\n6. Check if x = 2 is less than 100. Since 2 is less than 100, x = 2 is a valid solution.\n7. Increment k by 1 and repeat the process until you find other valid solutions for x.",
    "solution": "If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11. However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$. We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \\frac{98}{11}$. Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "8. For k = 1, plug into the equation x = 11k + 2 to find x: x = 11(1) + 2 = 13.\n9. Check if x = 13 is less than 100. Since 13 is less than 100, x = 13 is a valid solution.\n10. Continue this process by incrementing k by 1. \n11. For k = 2, x = 11(2) + 2 = 24, which is less than 100. Thus, x = 24 is a valid solution.\n12. For k = 3, x = 11(3) + 2 = 35, which is less than 100. Thus, x = 35 is a valid solution.\n13. For k = 4, x = 11(4) + 2 = 46, which is less than 100. Thus, x = 46 is a valid solution.\n14. For k = 5, x = 11(5) + 2 = 57, which is less than 100. Thus, x = 57 is a valid solution.\n15. For k = 6, x = 11(6) + 2 = 68, which is less than 100. Thus, x = 68 is a valid solution.\n16. For k = 7, x = 11(7) + 2 = 79, which is less than 100. Thus, x = 79 is a valid solution.\n17. For k = 8, x = 11(8) + 2 = 90, which is less than 100. Thus, x = 90 is a valid solution.\n18. For k = 9, x = 11(9) + 2 = 101, which is not less than 100. Thus, the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen is 90.",
