    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nYou have a number of gold coins that you were going to distribute equally among your 11 best friends.However, after dividing your gold coins into 11 equal piles, you realize that if you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin.You have less than 100 gold coins.\n1. Let's denote the total number of gold coins as x. \n2. To distribute the gold coins equally among 11 friends, each friend will receive x/11 coins.\n3. Since 2 people will receive an extra gold coin, we can represent this situation mathematically as x = 11k + 2 for some integer k.\n4. Now, we need to find the total number of gold coins x that satisfies the condition x = 11k + 2 where k is an integer.",
    "solution": "If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11. However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$. We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \\frac{98}{11}$. Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of gold coins x that satisfies the condition x = 11k + 2, we need to check values of k starting from 0 and increasing by 1 until we find a value that is less than 100. \n5. Start with k = 0, plug into the equation x = 11k + 2 to find x: x = 11(0) + 2 = 2.\n6. Check if x = 2 is less than 100. Since 2 is less than 100, x = 2 is a valid solution.\n7. Increment k by 1 and repeat the process until you find other valid solutions for x.",
