    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nJason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard.\n",
    "solution": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's assume that Jason borrowed x dollars from his parents. \n\nTo make the repayment process easier, Jason decides to pay back the money in monthly installments over a certain period of time. \n\nLet's say he pays p dollars each month, so the total number of months it will take to repay the loan is x/p. \n\nThe problem now is: if Jason wants to pay back the loan in a whole number of months and still pay an integer amount of money each month, what are all the possible values for p? \n\nFor the next person: Start by setting up the equation x = p * n, where n is the total number of months it will take to repay the loan.",
