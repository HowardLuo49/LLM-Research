    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIn a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises.\n",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "gpt_response": "Previous work done:\n- Let n be the total number of students in the class.\n- Let r be the number of students in each row.\n- Then, the total number of rows can be represented as n/r.\n- Let x be the number of rows with a perfect square number of students.\n- Let y be the number of rows with a prime number of students.\n\nPlan for the next person:\n1. Express n as a product of its prime factors.\n2. Calculate the possible values for r by considering the factors of n.\n3. Calculate the total number of rows based on the values of r obtained in step 2.\n4. Find the values of x and y based on the total number of rows calculated in step 3.\n5. Solve for x and y to determine the number of rows with a perfect square number of students and the number of rows with a prime number of students.",
