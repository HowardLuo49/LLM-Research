The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA number $n$ has $3$ divisors.How many divisors does $n^2$ have?\nLet's first recall what it means for a number to have 3 divisors. \nA number has exactly 3 divisors if it is a perfect square of a prime number. \nTherefore, we can express $n$ as $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number.\nSo, $n = p^2$.",
    "solution": "If $n$ has $3$ divisors, since it is divisible by both $1$ and $n$, the only possibility for a third unique divisor is $\\sqrt{n}$, which must be prime. Therefore, $n$ is the square of a prime number. As a result, $n^2$ is the fourth power of a prime. Let $n^2 = p^4$ for the prime $p$. There are $\\boxed{5}$ divisors of $p^4$, namely $p^0$, $p^1$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of divisors of $n^2$, we need to first express $n^2$ in terms of its prime factors. \nSince $n = p^2$, then $n^2 = (p^2)^2 = p^4$. \nTo find the number of divisors of $n^2 = p^4$, we use the formula for the number of divisors of a number in terms of its prime factorization. \nIn this case, $p^4$ has $(4+1) = 5$ divisors, namely 1, $p$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$. \nTherefore, $n^2 = p^4$ has 5 divisors.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 5?: To find the number of divisors of $n^2$, we need to first express $n^2$ in terms of its prime factors. \nSince $n = p^2$, then $n^2 = (p^2)^2 = p^4$. \nTo find the number of divisors of $n^2 = p^4$, we use the formula for the number of divisors of a number in terms of its prime factorization. \nIn this case, $p^4$ has $(4+1) = 5$ divisors, namely 1, $p$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$. \nTherefore, $n^2 = p^4$ has 5 divisors.",
