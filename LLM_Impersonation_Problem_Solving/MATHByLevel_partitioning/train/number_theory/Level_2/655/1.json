    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards.One mile equals $1760$ yards.\nLet's start by converting the total distance of the marathon to yards. \n\n$26$ miles = $26 \\times 1760$ yards = $45760$ yards.\n\nAdding the $385$ yards gives a total distance of $45760 + 385 = 46145$ yards for the marathon. \n\nNext, let's consider the number $46145$ in terms of prime factorization. Let's find the prime factorization of $46145$ and see if there are any interesting patterns or properties that we can use to solve the problem.",
    "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of $46145$ is $5 \\times 29 \\times 317$. \n\nNow, let's analyze the prime factors we obtained. We have $5$, $29$, and $317$ as the prime factors of $46145$. Let's see if there is any relationship between these prime factors that can help in solving the problem related to the marathon distance.",
