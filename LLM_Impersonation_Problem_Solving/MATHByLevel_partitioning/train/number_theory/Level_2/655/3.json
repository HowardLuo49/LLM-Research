    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards.One mile equals $1760$ yards.Leila has run ten marathons in her life.If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?\nTo find a relationship between the prime factors $5, 29,$ and $317$ and the marathon distance of $26$ miles and $385$ yards, let's first convert the marathon distance to yards only. Since $1$ mile is equal to $1760$ yards, the total distance in yards would be $26 \\times 1760 + 385$. Let's calculate this value.",
    "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$.",
    "gpt_response": "$26\\times1760+385 = 45760+385 = 46145$ yards.\nSince $46145 = 5\\times29\\times317$, the prime factors of $46145$ are $5, 29,$ and $317$.\nTherefore, the value of $y$ is $\\boxed{385}$.",
