    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA Mersenne prime is defined to be a prime number of the form $2^n - 1$, where $n$ must itself be a prime.For example, since $2^3 - 1 = 7$, and 3 is a prime number, 7 is a Mersenne prime.What is the largest Mersenne prime less than 200?\nNow that we have some background information on Mersenne primes, we will start by finding prime numbers for different values of $n$ and then calculating $2^n - 1$ to see if we land on a Mersenne prime. Let's start with $n = 2$, which is a prime number. $2^2 - 1$ = 3, which is also a prime number. This makes 3 a Mersenne prime according to the definition.\nNext, let's move to $n = 3$. $2^3 - 1$ = 7. 7 is a prime number, hence 7 is also a Mersenne prime as per the definition. \nSo far, we have found Mersenne primes for $n = 2$ and $n = 3$. This is a good starting point to continue our exploration for more Mersenne primes. We will now move forward with a more challenging case of $n = 5$.",
    "solution": "The largest Mersenne Prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = \\boxed{127}$. The next possible Mersenne Prime, $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$, is much too large (and is not prime).",
    "gpt_response": "Let's calculate $2^5 - 1$ = 31. 31 is a prime number, so 31 is a Mersenne prime according to the definition. \nWe now have identified Mersenne primes for $n = 2$, $n = 3$, and $n = 5$. \nTo find the Mersenne prime less than 200, we need to continue with larger values of $n$. Let's try $n = 7$.\nCalculating $2^7 - 1$ = 127. 127 is a prime number, thus making it a Mersenne prime as well.\nContinuing with $n = 11$, we get $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$. However, 2047 is not a prime number, so it is not a Mersenne prime.\nMoving to $n = 13$, we find $2^{13} - 1 = 8191$. This is a prime number, making 8191 a Mersenne prime.\nLastly, for $n = 17$, we get $2^{17} - 1 = 131071$. 131071 is also a prime number, making it a Mersenne prime.\nThe largest Mersenne prime less than 200 is 127.",
