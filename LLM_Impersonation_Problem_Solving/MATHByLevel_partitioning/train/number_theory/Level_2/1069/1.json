    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA Mersenne prime is defined to be a prime number of the form $2^n - 1$, where $n$ must itself be a prime.For example, since $2^3 - 1 = 7$, and 3 is a prime number, 7 is a Mersenne prime.\nGiven the definition of a Mersenne prime, we are looking for prime numbers of the form $2^n - 1$ where $n$ is itself a prime number. \n\nOne approach to find Mersenne primes is to start by finding prime numbers, and then checking if $2^n - 1$ is also prime.\n\nIt might be useful to use a primality test to check if numbers of the form $2^n - 1$ are prime. One popular primality test is the Miller-Rabin test.\n\nTo narrow down the search for Mersenne primes, we can start by looking at small prime numbers $n$ and then checking if $2^n - 1$ is prime.\n\nTo verify if a Mersenne number $2^n - 1$ is prime, we can use algorithms such as Lucas-Lehmer test which is specific to Mersenne numbers. \n\nIt's important to note that not all numbers of the form $2^n - 1$ are prime, so it's crucial to have a reliable primality test.",
    "solution": "The largest Mersenne Prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = \\boxed{127}$. The next possible Mersenne Prime, $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$, is much too large (and is not prime).",
    "gpt_response": "Now that we have some background information on Mersenne primes, we will start by finding prime numbers for different values of $n$ and then calculating $2^n - 1$ to see if we land on a Mersenne prime. Let's start with $n = 2$, which is a prime number. $2^2 - 1$ = 3, which is also a prime number. This makes 3 a Mersenne prime according to the definition.\nNext, let's move to $n = 3$. $2^3 - 1$ = 7. 7 is a prime number, hence 7 is also a Mersenne prime as per the definition. \nSo far, we have found Mersenne primes for $n = 2$ and $n = 3$. This is a good starting point to continue our exploration for more Mersenne primes. We will now move forward with a more challenging case of $n = 5$.",
