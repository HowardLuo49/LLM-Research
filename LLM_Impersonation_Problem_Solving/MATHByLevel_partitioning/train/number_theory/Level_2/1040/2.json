The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the greatest common divisor of $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}?$ Express your answer as an integer.(Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (n-1)\\cdot n$.)\nThe common factors between $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}$ are $2^3, 3, 5$. \nThe highest power of each common prime factor in the two numbers are $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. \nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$. \n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "solution": "First, we factor $5!$ into primes: \\begin{align*} 5! &= 5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1\\\\ &= 2^{3}\\cdot3\\cdot5. \\end{align*} Then, we factor $\\frac{8!}{3!}.$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{8!}{3!} &= 8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\\\ &= 2^{6}\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7. \\end{align*} We can find the greatest common factor by taking the lowest exponent of each common prime factor. We get $2^{3}\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{120}.$",
