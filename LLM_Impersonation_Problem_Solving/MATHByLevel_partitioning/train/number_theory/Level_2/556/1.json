The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nOne year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube.How many years old is Jane?\nGiven:\n- One year ago, Jane's age was a perfect square, so let's denote her current age as x and set up the equation x - 1 = a^2 where a is an integer.\n- One year from now, Jane's age will be a perfect cube, so let's set up the equation x + 1 = b^3 where b is an integer.\n\nPlan:\n1. From x - 1 = a^2, we can rewrite it as x = a^2 + 1 and substitute this into x + 1 = b^3 to solve for a and b.\n2. After solving for a and b, determine Jane's current age x by plugging the values back into the equations.",
    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's continue with the plan:\n\n1. From x - 1 = a^2, we can rewrite it as x = a^2 + 1 and substitute this into x + 1 = b^3:\n\na^2 + 1 + 1 = b^3\na^2 + 2 = b^3\n\nWe need to find integer values of a and b that satisfy this equation.\n\n2. One possible solution is a = 1 and b = 2, because 1^2 + 2 = 3 = 2^3.\n   So, Jane's current age x = a^2 + 1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2 years old.\n\nThus, Jane is 2 years old.",
