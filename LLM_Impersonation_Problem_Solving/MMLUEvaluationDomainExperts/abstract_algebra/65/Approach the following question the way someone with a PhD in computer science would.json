    "gpt_response": "C: True, False\n\nExplanation: \nStatement 1 is true because every field is also a ring as a field is a special type of ring. \nStatement 2 is false because not every ring has a multiplicative identity. For example, the set of even integers with usual addition and multiplication is a ring but does not have a multiplicative identity.",
