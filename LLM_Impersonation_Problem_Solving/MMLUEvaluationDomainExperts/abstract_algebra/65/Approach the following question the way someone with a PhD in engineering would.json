Not every field is a ring because a field is a specific type of ring that additionally satisfies the property of multiplicative inverses for all elements except zero. Therefore, Statement 1 is false. \n\nOn the other hand, every ring does have a multiplicative identity, which is an element that when multiplied by any other element in the ring results in the original element.
