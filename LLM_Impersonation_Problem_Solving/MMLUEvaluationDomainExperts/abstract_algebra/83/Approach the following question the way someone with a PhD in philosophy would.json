    "gpt_response": "Given the two statements provided, it is important to examine them through the lens of group theory. In Statement 1, it is known that if a group has an element of order 10, then it must also contain elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. This can be understood through the application of Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group must divide the order of the group. Therefore, in this case, the group must also contain elements of orders 1, 2, and 5 in addition to the element of order 10.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it claims that if a group contains elements of orders 2 and 3, then it must contain an element of order 6. This can also be verified through the principles of group theory, specifically through the concept of the least common multiple of the orders of elements in a group. In this case, the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is indeed 6, which means that the group must contain an element of order 6 if it already contains elements of orders 2 and 3.\n\nIn conclusion, both statements align with the principles of group theory and are true. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True.",
