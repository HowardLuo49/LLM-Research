    "gpt_response": "To analyze this question from the perspective of someone with a PhD in engineering, we must apply our knowledge of group theory. \n\nStatement 1 states that if a group has an element of order 10, then it must also have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. This statement is true because the orders of elements in a group must divide the order of the group itself (Lagrange's theorem). Therefore, if an element has order 10, then the group must have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.\n\nStatement 2 states that if a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it must have an element of order 6. This statement is false. For example, consider the group Z6, the integers modulo 6 under addition. In this group, the element 2 has order 3, the element 3 has order 2, but there is no element of order 6. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
