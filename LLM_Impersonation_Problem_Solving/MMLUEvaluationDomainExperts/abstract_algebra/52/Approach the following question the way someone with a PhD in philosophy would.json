An identity element is an element within a group that, when combined with any other element in the group using the group operation, leaves the other element unchanged.\n\nIn the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8} under multiplication modulo 10, we are looking for an element that, when multiplied by any other element in the group modulo 10, leaves the other element unchanged.
