This statement aligns with the foundational principles of linear algebra, where linear independence is determined by the absence of nontrivial linear combinations that equal the zero vector. In the context of R^2, which represents a two-dimensional Euclidean space, any two non-collinear vectors will indeed be linearly independent. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that if V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k. In this statement, V represents the span of the vectors v1 through vk, and dim(V) denotes the dimension of this subspace. The condition that {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent guarantees that the set forms a basis for V, as linear independence is a necessary condition for a set to be a basis. In this case, the dimension of V would indeed be equal to the number of vectors in the set, k. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer would be A: True, True.",
