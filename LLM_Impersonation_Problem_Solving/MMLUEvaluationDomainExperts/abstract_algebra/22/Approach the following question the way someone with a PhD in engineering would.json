Since these two vectors span R^2, they are linearly independent.\n\nRegarding Statement 2, if V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k. This is true because the dimension of a vector space is equal to the number of vectors in a basis for that vector space, which is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors that span the space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
