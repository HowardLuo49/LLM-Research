    "gpt_response": "When considering the first statement, it is important to note that a set of two vectors in R^2 is indeed linearly independent if and only if the two vectors are not scalar multiples of each other. This is because in a two-dimensional vector space, any two non-collinear vectors will be linearly independent. Therefore, Statement 1 is indeed true.\n\nMoving on to the second statement, we are given that V is the span of vectors v1 through vk, and that {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent. In this case, the dimension of V, denoted as dim(V), is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in its span. Since {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, the number of vectors in this set, which is k, is also the dimension of V. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nIn conclusion, both statements are true, leading to the correct answer being A: True, True.",
