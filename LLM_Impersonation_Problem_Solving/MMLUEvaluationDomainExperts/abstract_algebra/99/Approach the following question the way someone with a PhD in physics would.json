In other words, an ideal is a subring that is also an absorbing subset. \n\nA subring of a ring is a subset that is itself a ring under the same operations of addition and multiplication. \n\nBased on these definitions, Statement 1 is true because every ideal in a ring is by definition a subring of the ring. However, Statement 2 is false because not every subring of a ring is necessarily an ideal of the ring. Therefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
