    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I can confidently say that Statement 1 is true. This is because by definition, an ideal in a ring is a subset of the ring that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of the ring. Therefore, it satisfies all the requirements to be a subring of the ring.\n\nHowever, Statement 2 is false. Not every subring of a ring is necessarily an ideal of the ring. For example, consider the ring of integers Z. The subring 2Z (the set of all even integers) is indeed a subring of Z, but it is not an ideal of Z since it is not closed under multiplication by all elements of Z. This counterexample illustrates that Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
