    "gpt_response": "To find T(-3,2), we must first understand that T is a function that takes two integer inputs and returns an integer output. Given that T(1, 0) = 3 and T(0, 1) = -5, we can infer that the function involves some form of addition or multiplication.\n\nTo find T(-3,2), we can express (-3,2) as a linear combination of (1,0) and (0,1):\n(-3,2) = -3 * (1,0) + 2 * (0,1).\n\nUsing the given values, we can now calculate T(-3,2) as follows:\nT(-3,2) = T(-3 * (1,0) + 2 * (0,1))\n= T(-3 * (1,0)) + T(2 * (0,1))\n= -3 * T(1,0) + 2 * T(0,1)\n= -3 * 3 + 2 * (-5)\n= -9 - 10\n= -19.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: -19.",
