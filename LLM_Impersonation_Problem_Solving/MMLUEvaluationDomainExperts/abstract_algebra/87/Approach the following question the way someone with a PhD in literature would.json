    "gpt_response": "To find T(-3,2) using the provided information, we need to consider the properties of the given function T.\n\nIt is evident that T is a function that takes two integer inputs and outputs an integer. The given values T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5 show that the function behaves non-linearly and does not follow a simple pattern such as addition or multiplication.\n\nTo find T(-3,2), we must consider how to manipulate the provided inputs (1,0) and (0,1) to arrive at (-3,2). Since (1,0) and (0,1) constitute the basis vectors of the space Z x Z, it can be deduced that any integer pair (a,b) can be represented as a linear combination of these basis vectors, i.e., (a,b) = a(1,0) + b(0,1).\n\nIn order to represent (-3,2) as a linear combination of (1,0) and (0,1), we note that (-3,2) = -3*(1,0) + 2*(0,1). By linearity of the function T, we can then express T(-3,2) as T(-3,2) = -3*T(1,0) + 2*T(0,1). Substituting the given values, we obtain T(-3,2) = -3*3 + 2*(-5) = -9 - 10 = -19.\n\nTherefore, the value of T(-3,2) is -19, corresponding to option A.",
