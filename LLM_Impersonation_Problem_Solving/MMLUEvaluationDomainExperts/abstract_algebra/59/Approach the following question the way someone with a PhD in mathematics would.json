In this case, if either H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then the product HK is indeed a subgroup of G. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, we need to consider groups of order p^2 where p is prime. Groups of order p^2 are classified into two types: cyclic groups and non-cyclic groups. It can be proven that all groups of order p^2 are Abelian.
