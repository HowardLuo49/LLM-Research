    "gpt_response": "In response to Statement 1, it is true that if H and K are subgroups of G and one of them is a normal subgroup of G, then their product HK is a subgroup of G. This can be proven by showing that HK is closed under the group operation, contains the identity element, and contains inverses for all elements. This property is due to the fact that normal subgroups have a special relationship with conjugation in the group.\n\nRegarding Statement 2, it is false that all groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian. A counterexample to this statement is the group of 3x3 unipotent upper triangular matrices with entries in a finite field of order 2. This group has order 8, which is 2^3, but is not Abelian since matrix multiplication is not commutative in general. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
