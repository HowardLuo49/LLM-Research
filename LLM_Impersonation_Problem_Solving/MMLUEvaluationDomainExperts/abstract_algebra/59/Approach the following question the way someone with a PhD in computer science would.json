This is a straightforward result in group theory, where the normality of one subgroup ensures that the product of the subgroups is closed under multiplication and inversion.\n\nFor the second statement, it is false that all groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian. This can be seen by considering the non-Abelian group of order 4, such as the group of symmetries of a square. In general, there are non-Abelian groups of order p^2 for any prime p, so the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
