A field is a commutative ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. \n\nFirst, let's consider the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c in Z_3[x]. For Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) to be a field, the ideal generated by x^3 + x^2 + c must be maximal. \n\nIn Z_3, there are only three possible values for c: 0, 1, and 2. \n\nLet's first consider c = 0. In this case, the polynomial x^3 + x^2 is irreducible in Z_3[x], as it has no roots in Z_3. Therefore, the ideal generated by x^3 + x^2 is maximal and Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2) is a field.\n\nNext, let's consider c = 1. In this case, the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + 1 is reducible, as it factors as (x+2)(x^2 + 2x + 2) in Z_3[x]. Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + 1) is not a field.\n\nFinally, let's consider c = 2.
