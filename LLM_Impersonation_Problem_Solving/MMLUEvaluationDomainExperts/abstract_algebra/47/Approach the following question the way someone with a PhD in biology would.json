It is known that an ideal in a commutative ring is maximal if and only if the quotient ring is a field.\n\nTo find all values of c that satisfy this condition, we need to analyze the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c in Z_3[x].

If the polynomial has a root in Z_3, then the ideal generated by the polynomial will not be maximal and hence the quotient ring will not be a field.\n\nAfter evaluating the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c for c = 0, 1, 2 in Z_3, we find that only c = 1 results in a root in Z_3.
