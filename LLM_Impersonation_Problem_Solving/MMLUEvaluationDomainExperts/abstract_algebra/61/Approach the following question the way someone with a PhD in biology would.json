    "gpt_response": "A person with a PhD in biology may approach this question by analyzing the properties of groups in mathematics, as well as the specific properties of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant or determinant 1. \n\nStatement 1 is true because the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant forms a group under matrix multiplication. This is because matrix multiplication is associative, there exists an identity matrix within this set, and the inverse of each matrix in the set also has integer entries and nonzero determinant.\n\nStatement 2 is false because the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 does not form a group under matrix multiplication.
