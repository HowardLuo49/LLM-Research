    "gpt_response": "In order to assess the truth values of the two statements provided, we must analyze each individually through the lens of group theory. A group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set together with an operation that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses. \n\nStatement 1 claims that the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinants forms a group under matrix multiplication. To verify this, we must examine the properties of a group. \n\n1. Closure: Matrix multiplication of two matrices with nonzero determinants results in a matrix with a nonzero determinant, hence closure is satisfied. \n2. Associativity: Matrix multiplication is known to be associative, thus this property is also satisfied. \n3. Identity element: The identity matrix with determinant 1 exists in this set, as it is 2x2 and has an integer determinant. \n4. Inverses: Multiplicative inverses exist for all elements with nonzero determinants, as the determinant of the inverse is the reciprocal of the original determinant. \n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is indeed true. \n\nMoving on to Statement 2, which states that the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 forms a group under matrix multiplication. This set fails to meet the requirement of closure, as the product of two matrices with determinant 1 may result in a matrix with determinant other than 1. Hence, Statement 2 is false. \n\nIn conclusion, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, yielding the final answer of (C) True, False.",
