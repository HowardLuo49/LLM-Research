    "gpt_response": "To determine the correctness of the statements, we need to examine the properties of a group. A group is a set equipped with an operation that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. Closure: The product of any two elements in the group is also in the group.\n2. Associativity: The group operation is associative.\n3. Identity: There exists an identity element in the group such that when combined with any element in the group, it leaves the element unchanged.\n4. Inverse: Every element in the group has an inverse element such that when combined with the element, it produces the identity element.\n\nFor Statement 1:\nThe set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is indeed a group under matrix multiplication. The closure property holds as the product of two matrices with nonzero determinant will also have a nonzero determinant. As for the identity element, the identity matrix is in this set, and the inverse of a matrix with nonzero determinant also has a nonzero determinant.\n\nFor Statement 2:\nThe set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is not a group under matrix multiplication. While the closure property holds as the product of two matrices with determinant 1 will also have determinant 1, the set does not contain the identity matrix in this case. Additionally, not all matrices in this set have inverses within the set.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC: True, False",
