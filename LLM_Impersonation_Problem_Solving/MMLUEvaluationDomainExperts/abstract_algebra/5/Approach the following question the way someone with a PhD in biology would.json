    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by recognizing that it pertains to group theory in mathematics, specifically regarding the order of elements within a group. Statement 1 states that if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. This statement is true because the order of an element divides the order of the group, and in this case, 15 divides 120 (the order of the group). Therefore, there must be at least 8 elements of order 15 in a group with an element of order 15.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, states that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This statement is false because the number of elements of order 15 in a group cannot exceed the number of elements in the group. Therefore, it is not necessary for a group with more than 8 elements of order 15 to have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
