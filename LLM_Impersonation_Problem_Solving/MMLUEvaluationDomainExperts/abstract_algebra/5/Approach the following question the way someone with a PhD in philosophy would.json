    "gpt_response": "To address this question with rigor, we must carefully examine the implications of each statement within the context of group theory. In group theory, the order of an element is defined as the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the power of n is equal to the identity element of the group.\n\nStatement 1 asserts that if a group contains an element of order 15, then it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. This statement is indeed true. This can be seen by considering cyclic groups, where every element generates a cyclic subgroup. In a cyclic group of order 15, each element other than the identity has order 15. Therefore, there must be at least 8 elements of order 15 in a group with an element of order 15.\n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 posits that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This statement is false. To see this, consider a non-cyclic group such as the symmetric group on 4 elements, denoted as S4. This group contains 8 elements of order 3 (cycles of length 3), but it only has 6 elements of order 2 (permutations with two disjoint cycles of length 2). Therefore, it is possible for a group to have more than 8 elements of order 15 without necessarily having at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: True, False. The first statement is true, while the second statement is false. This analysis showcases the complexity and nuance involved in determining properties of groups based on the orders of their elements.",
