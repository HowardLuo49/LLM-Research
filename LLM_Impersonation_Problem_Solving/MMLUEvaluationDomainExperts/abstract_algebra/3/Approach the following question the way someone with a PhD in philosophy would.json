    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in philosophy, we must consider the fundamental concepts and principles of group theory. \n\nIn group theory, a factor group is a group derived from another group by picking a normal subgroup and \"factoring out\" its elements. If the original group is non-Abelian, meaning its operation does not commute, then the factor group will also be non-Abelian. This is because the quotient group inherits the non-commutative property from the original group. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is not necessarily a normal subgroup of G. This is because being a normal subgroup is not transitive, meaning just because K is normal in H and H is normal in G does not guarantee that K is normal in G. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
