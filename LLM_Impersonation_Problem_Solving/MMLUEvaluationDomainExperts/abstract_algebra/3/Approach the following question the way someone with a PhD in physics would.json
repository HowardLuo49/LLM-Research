    "gpt_response": "Let's start by analyzing statement 1:\n\nA factor group is formed by taking a normal subgroup N of a group G, and then forming the set of left cosets of N in G. The factor group is denoted as G/N.\n\nFor a factor group to be Abelian, we need all left cosets of N to be equal to their corresponding right cosets. In the case of an Abelian group, this is true and the factor group is also Abelian.\n\nHowever, in the case of a non-Abelian group, the left cosets may not be equal to the right cosets, leading to a non-Abelian factor group. Therefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nNow let's move on to statement 2:\n\nIf K is a normal subgroup of H, then for any h in H and k in K, the element hk = kh must also be in K. \n\nIf H is a normal subgroup of G, then for any g in G and h in H, the element ghg^-1 must be in H.\n\nNow, if we consider K as a normal subgroup of H and H as a normal subgroup of G, then for any g in G and k in K, we have gkg^-1 in K (since K is normal in H). Also, for any h in H, we have ghg^-1 in H (since H is normal in G).\n\nTherefore, since K is normal in H and H is normal in G, we have K is normal in G. Thus, statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A: True, True.",
