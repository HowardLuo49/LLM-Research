    "gpt_response": "A PhD in mathematics would approach this question by analyzing the definitions and properties of factor groups and normal subgroups.\n\nStatement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\nThis statement is true. A factor group is formed by taking a normal subgroup of a group and considering the set of left (or right) cosets. Since the factor group is formed from the group and its normal subgroup, the properties of the original group are inherited by the factor group. If the original group is non-Abelian, then the factor group will also be non-Abelian.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nThis statement is also true. If K is a normal subgroup of H, then for all g in G and k in K, the product gkg^(-1) is also in K. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, for all h in H and g in G, the product ghg^(-1) is also in H. Therefore, combining these two properties, we have for all g in G and k in K, the product gkg^(-1) is also in K, which implies that K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA: True, True.",
