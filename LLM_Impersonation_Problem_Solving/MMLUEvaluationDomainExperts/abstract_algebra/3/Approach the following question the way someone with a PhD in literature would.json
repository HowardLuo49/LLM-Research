However, based on my understanding of the statements provided, I would approach it logically and analytically.\n\nStatement 1 posits that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian. This aligns with my knowledge that the properties of a group can be inherited by its factor groups. Therefore, I would consider Statement 1 to be true.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. From my limited mathematical understanding, I would interpret this as consistent with the properties of normal subgroups and their relationships within a group. Therefore, I would also consider Statement 2 to be true.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my analysis and logical reasoning, I would choose option A: True, True.",
