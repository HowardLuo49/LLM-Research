However, based on my understanding of logical reasoning and the principles of mathematics, I would approach this question by analyzing the statements provided.\n\nStatement 1 asserts that every group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian. This statement is a known result in group theory, specifically related to the classification of finite groups. A group of order p^2 is necessarily a cyclic group or a direct product of cyclic groups, both of which are Abelian. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it states that a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G. This statement is also grounded in the theory of Sylow subgroups and their properties. The condition for a Sylow p-subgroup to be normal is that it is the unique subgroup of its order in G. Therefore, Statement 2 is true as well.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the statements provided and my limited understanding of group theory, I would posit that the correct answer is A: True, True.",
