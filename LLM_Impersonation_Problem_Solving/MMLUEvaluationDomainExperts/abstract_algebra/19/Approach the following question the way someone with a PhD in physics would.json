    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would approach the question by first analyzing each statement separately and then evaluating the truth of each statement based on known theorems and definitions in group theory.\n\nStatement 1: Every group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian. This statement can be supported by the fact that groups of prime order are always cyclic and therefore Abelian. Additionally, a group of order p^2 has a nontrivial center, which implies that it is Abelian. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G. This statement aligns with the Sylow theorems, which state that if a Sylow p-subgroup is the unique subgroup of its order, then it is normal in the group. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
