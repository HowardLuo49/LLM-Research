    "gpt_response": "Let G be a group of order p^2 where p is a prime. By the Sylow theorems, G must have at least one Sylow p-subgroup of order p^2. Since G is of prime power order, this Sylow p-subgroup must be normal in G. Therefore, every group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If a Sylow p-subgroup of G is the only one in G, then it must be normal in G. This is because any conjugate of a Sylow p-subgroup is also a Sylow p-subgroup, so if there is only one Sylow p-subgroup it is normalized by all elements in G. On the other hand, if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G, then it is the only one in G since any other Sylow p-subgroup would also be normal and therefore not in the same conjugacy class. \n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is True.
