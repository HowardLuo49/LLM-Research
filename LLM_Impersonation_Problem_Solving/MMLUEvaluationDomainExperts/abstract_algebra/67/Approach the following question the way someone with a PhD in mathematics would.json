The second axiom states that for every element a in H, its inverse a^-1 must also be in H. This guarantees the existence of inverses for every element in H. The third axiom states that for all elements a,b in H, the product a * b^-1 must be in H. This ensures closure under taking inverses. Lastly, the fourth axiom states that the identity element must be contained in H. Only if all four of these axioms are satisfied can we conclude that H is a group in its own right.",
