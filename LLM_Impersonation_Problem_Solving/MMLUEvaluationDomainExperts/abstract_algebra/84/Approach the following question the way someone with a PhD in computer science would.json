In this case, g being injective is not necessary for g(f(a)) = a to hold true. This is because even if g is not injective, it can still map the output of multiple elements from B back to a single element in A. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: The function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\nFor g to be surjective, it must map every element of B to an element in A. However, the given information implies that g only needs to map back the elements in A that were originally produced by f. g does not need to map all elements in B back to A for g(f(a)) = a to hold true for all a in A.
