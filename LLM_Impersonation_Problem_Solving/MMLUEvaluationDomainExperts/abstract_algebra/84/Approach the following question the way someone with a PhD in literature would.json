However, I can provide insight into the logical reasoning and implications of the given statements.\n\nStatement 1 asserts that the function g must necessarily be injective. In other words, no two elements in set B should map to the same element in set A. This can be understood by considering that if g were not injective, there would be multiple elements in set B that map to the same element in set A, which would violate the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. Therefore, Statement 1 is likely true.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, claims that the function g must necessarily be surjective. This means that every element in set A must have a corresponding element in set B that maps back to it. However, it is possible for g to be a partial function, meaning it does not map every element in set B to set A. Therefore, Statement 2 is likely false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is likely option C: True, False.",
