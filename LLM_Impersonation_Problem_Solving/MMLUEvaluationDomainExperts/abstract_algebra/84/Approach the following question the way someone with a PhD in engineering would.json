    "gpt_response": "First, let's analyze statement 1: \"The function g must necessarily be injective.\"\n\nInjectivity means that each element in the domain has a unique corresponding element in the codomain. In this case, since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, g is the inverse function of f. Therefore, for g to be the inverse of f, it must be injective. This statement is true.\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2: \"The function g must necessarily be surjective.\"\n\nSurjectivity means that every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. In this case, g is the inverse function of f, so g must necessarily be surjective in order for all elements in A to have a unique inverse mapped to them in B. Therefore, this statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A: True, True\n\nAs someone with a PhD in engineering, I would consider the definitions of injectivity and surjectivity, and understand the implications of g being the inverse function of f in relation to these properties.",
