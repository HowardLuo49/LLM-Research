If g maps elements from set B back to set A such that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, then it implies that no two different elements in B can map to the same element in A. This corresponds to the definition of an injective function, where each element in the domain (set B) maps uniquely to an element in the codomain (set A).\n\nStatement 2 is false. The function g does not need to be surjective in this context.
