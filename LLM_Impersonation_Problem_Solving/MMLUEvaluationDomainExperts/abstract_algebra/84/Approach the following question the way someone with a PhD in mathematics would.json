    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze each statement in turn:\n\nStatement 1: The function g must necessarily be injective.\nTo show this statement is true, we need to consider the definition of injective functions. A function g is injective if distinct elements in the domain map to distinct elements in the co-domain. In this case, we are given that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. This means that every element in A is mapped to a unique element in B by the function f, and then these elements in B are mapped back to A by g. If g was not injective, then it would mean that two different elements in B would map to the same element in A, contradicting the given condition. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: The function g must necessarily be surjective.\nTo show this statement is true, we need to consider the definition of surjective functions. A function g is surjective if every element in the co-domain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. In this case, we are given that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. This means that every element in A is mapped to by an element in B through f, and then these elements are mapped back to A by g. If g was not surjective, there would be elements in A that are not mapped to by any element in B, which would violate the given condition. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
