    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, we need to determine how many linearly independent basis elements there are for this field extension over Q. \n\nSince both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are algebraic over Q (they are roots of the polynomials x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively), Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a finite extension of Q. \n\nFirst, note that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) contains elements of the form a + b*sqrt(2) + c*sqrt(3) + d*sqrt(6), where a, b, c, d are rational numbers. This means that the basis must have at least 4 elements (1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(6)).\n\nNow, we can show that these 4 elements are linearly independent over Q. Suppose there exist rational numbers u, v, w, z such that u + v*sqrt(2) + w*sqrt(3) + z*sqrt(6) = 0. \n\nIf we square both sides of this equation and simplify, we get u^2 + 2v^2 + 3w^2 + 6z^2 + 2uw - 3v^2 - 6vw = 0. \n\nThis equation implies that u = v = w = z = 0, since the coefficients of these terms must be 0 for the whole equation to be 0, due to the linear independence of the basis elements.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is the number of basis elements, which is 4. \n\nThe correct answer is B: 4.",
