    "gpt_response": "To assess the statements in question, we must consider the properties of injectivity and surjectivity in the context of the given functions f and g. \n\nBegin with Statement 1, which posits that the function f must necessarily be injective. Injectivity refers to a function mapping distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain. In this case, we are given that for all elements a in set A, g(f(a)) is equal to a. This highlights that for each element a in set A, the composition of functions f and g leads to the original element a. This condition does not explicitly necessitate that f is injective, as it is possible for distinct elements in A to map to the same element in B under f, but still result in g(f(a)) = a by the nature of the functions. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, which asserts that the function f must necessarily be surjective. Surjectivity pertains to a function such that for every element in the codomain, there exists at least one element in the domain that maps to it. In this case, the given equation g(f(a)) = a implies that every element in A has a corresponding element in B such that g applied to that element maps back to the original element in A. However, the statement does not guarantee that every element in B is mapped onto by f, as some elements in B may not have a pre-image in A. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct assessment for the statements is False, False.",
