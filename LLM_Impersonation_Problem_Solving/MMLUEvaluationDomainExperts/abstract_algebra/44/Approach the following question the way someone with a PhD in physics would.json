This is because if two elements in set A map to the same element in set B under function f, then g(f(a)) will not uniquely determine a, contradicting the given property. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no necessity for function f to be surjective. The only requirement is that for each element in set A, there exists a unique element in set B that maps to it under function f. The element in B that is not mapped to by any element in A can stay unmapped, and this does not impact the property g(f(a)) = a. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
