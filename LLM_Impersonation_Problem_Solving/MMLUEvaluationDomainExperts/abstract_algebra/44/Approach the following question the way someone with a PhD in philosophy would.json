    "gpt_response": "To properly evaluate the statements presented, we must consider the properties of injectivity and surjectivity typically associated with functions. \n\nInjectivity, or one-to-one mapping, ensures that each element from the domain A maps to a unique element in the codomain B. Surjectivity, on the other hand, guarantees that every element in the codomain B has at least one corresponding element in the domain A mapped to it. \n\nGiven the composite function g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, we can deduce that f is injective because if it were not, there would be multiple elements in A that map to the same element in B, resulting in g not being able to uniquely map back to the original element in A. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\nHowever, the same reasoning does not necessitate that f must be surjective. It is possible for some elements in B to not have a corresponding element in A mapped to them by f, as long as all elements in A are uniquely mapped to elements in B.
