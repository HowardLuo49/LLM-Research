This is a fundamental property of quotient rings and can be proven using the definition of the operations on quotient rings.\n\nIn statement 2, if an ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R, then it must contain the multiplicative identity element 1. This is because any ideal containing the multiplicative identity element will end up generating the entire ring through multiplication by elements in the ring.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A: True, True.",
