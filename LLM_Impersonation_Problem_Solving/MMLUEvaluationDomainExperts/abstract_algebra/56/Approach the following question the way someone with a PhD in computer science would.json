In general, a polynomial is said to be irreducible over a field if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials over that field.\n\nIn Statement 1, the polynomial 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z, the set of integers. This is because 4x - 2 = 2(2x - 1), and since 2 is a unit in Z (it has multiplicative inverse 1), the polynomial can be factored into non-constant polynomials over Z.\n\nIn Statement 2, the polynomial 4x - 2 is also irreducible over Q, the set of rational numbers. This is because the polynomial cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials over Q.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: C: True, False.",
