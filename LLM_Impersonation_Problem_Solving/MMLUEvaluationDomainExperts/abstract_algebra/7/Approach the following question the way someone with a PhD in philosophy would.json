This statement correctly captures a fundamental property of ring homomorphisms, emphasizing the significance of the kernel in determining injectivity.\n\nIn statement 2, the assertion that Q is an ideal in R is false. It contradicts the definition of an ideal in ring theory, as the set of rational numbers is not an ideal in the set of real numbers. This falsity can be deduced through rigorous examination of the properties that an ideal must satisfy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: False, False. This conclusion emerges from a careful philosophical analysis of the mathematical concepts involved, highlighting the importance of precision and logic in both disciplines.",
