A ring homomorphism is a function between two rings that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication).

In the context of rings, an ideal is a subset of the ring that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of the ring. If Q is an ideal in R, it means that Q is a subset of R, and both R and Q satisfy the properties of an ideal.\n\nNow, to analyze the statements:\n\n1.
