    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in engineering, first, we must understand the concepts being discussed. \n\nIn Statement 1, it is posited that if a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2. This statement essentially discusses the properties of elements within a group when squared. \n\nIn Statement 2, it is stated that the set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup. This statement pertains to the properties of rotations within a specific type of group.\n\nHaving a deep understanding of group theory, we can analyze these statements logically. Firstly, Statement 1 is true based on the properties of groups and the fact that if a = b, then a^2 = b^2. Secondly, Statement 2 is also true based on the properties of dihedral groups and cyclic subgroups, where rotations can indeed form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
