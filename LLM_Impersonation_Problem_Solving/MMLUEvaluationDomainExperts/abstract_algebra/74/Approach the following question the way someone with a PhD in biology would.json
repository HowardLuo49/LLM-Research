    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze each statement individually from a mathematical perspective:\n\nStatement 1: If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2.\n\nIn group theory, if a and b are elements of a group, then a^2 and b^2 are not necessarily distinct. For example, in the group of integers with addition, both 1^2 and (-1)^2 result in 1. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nIn a dihedral group, the rotations do form a cyclic subgroup. This is because the rotations in a dihedral group are generated by a single element, typically denoted as r, which corresponds to a rotation of the minimum angle. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
