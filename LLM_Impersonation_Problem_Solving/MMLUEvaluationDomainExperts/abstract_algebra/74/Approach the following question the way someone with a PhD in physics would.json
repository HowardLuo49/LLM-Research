Statement 1 | If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2.

    "gpt_response": "The first statement can be proven using the definition of a group and the properties of group elements. Since a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, it follows that a^2 is not equal to b^2. This is because if a^2 were equal to b^2, then multiplying both sides by the inverse of b twice would give a = b, contradicting the given premise.\n\nThe second statement can also be proven using the properties of dihedral groups. The set of rotations in a dihedral group forms a cyclic subgroup because the rotations can be generated by a single element (the reflection). This reflection element, when composed with itself repeatedly, generates all the rotations in the dihedral group. Therefore, the statement that the set of rotations in a dihedral group forms a cyclic subgroup is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
