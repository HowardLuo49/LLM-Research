    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q, we first need to determine the minimal polynomial of the field extension. \n\nLet x = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). So x^2 = 2*3 = 6. Thus, x is a root of the polynomial f(t) = t^2 - 6. \n\nSince the degree of the minimal polynomial equals the degree of the field extension, the degree is 2.
