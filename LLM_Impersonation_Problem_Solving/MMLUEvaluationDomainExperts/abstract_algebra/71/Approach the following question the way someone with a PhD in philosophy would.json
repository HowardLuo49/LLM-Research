    "gpt_response": "To determine the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q, we first note that Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is contained in the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q. \n\nSince Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a splitting field for the polynomials x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3 over Q, it follows that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a degree 4 extension of Q. \n\nSince Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is contained in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q must divide 4. \n\nTo determine the exact degree, we consider the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) over Q. We have that (sqrt(2)*sqrt(3))^2 = 6, so the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 6. \n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q is 2, and the correct answer is C.",
