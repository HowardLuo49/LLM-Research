    "gpt_response": "Let us first address Statement 1. An abelian group is considered free if it can be generated by a set of elements with no relations between them, i.e., it can be expressed as a direct sum of copies of the integers Z. A torsion-free abelian group is one where no non-trivial element has finite order. \n\nIt is a well-known fact in group theory that every free abelian group is torsion-free. This can be proven by considering the structure of free abelian groups and their elements.\n\nNow, let us consider Statement 2. A finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is one that can be generated by a finite set of elements, all of which have infinite order. This implies that the group is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the integers Z, making it a free abelian group.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is also true.
