An abelian group is free if it can be generated by a set of elements with no relations among them other than those forced by the group axioms.\n\nStatement 1: Every free abelian group is torsion free.\nThis statement is true. A free abelian group has a basis set of elements that are linearly independent, meaning no non-trivial element can be written as a finite sum of other elements. Therefore, there are no non-zero elements of finite order in a free abelian group, making it torsion free.\n\nStatement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\nThis statement is also true. A finitely generated abelian group is one that can be generated by a finite set of elements. If this group is torsion free, then it can be shown that it must in fact be free. This is because any finitely generated torsion-free abelian group must have a basis set of elements that are linearly independent, meaning they can generate the group without any relations among them other than those forced by the group axioms. Thus, the group is free.",
