In other words, there are no non-zero elements such that raising them to a certain power yields the identity element.\n\nStatement 1 asserts that every free abelian group is torsion free. This statement holds true because in a free abelian group, the elements can be expressed as finite linear combinations of the generators without any relations imposing finite order.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group. This statement is false. While it is true that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is free, it may not necessarily be a free abelian group.
