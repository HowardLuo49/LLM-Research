A free abelian group is defined as a group that can be generated by a set of elements without any relations among them except for the group operation. Since there are no non-trivial relations among the elements in a free abelian group, there can be no non-trivial torsion elements (elements whose order is finite) in the group. Therefore, every free abelian group is torsion-free.\n\nStatement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\nThis statement is also true. A finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a finite set of elements with no non-trivial torsion elements. By the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, such a group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finitely many copies of the integers. This is precisely the definition of a free abelian group, as it is generated by a linearly independent set of elements.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, and the correct answer is (A) True, True.",
