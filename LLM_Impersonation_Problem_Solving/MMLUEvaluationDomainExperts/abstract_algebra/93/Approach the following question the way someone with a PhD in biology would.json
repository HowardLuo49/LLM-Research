    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 6, we need to consider the different cycle types that can be formed in S_6. The order of an element in a symmetric group is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n\nFor n = 6, the possible cycle types are:\n1. 6-cycle\n2. 5-cycle and 1-cycle\n3. 4-cycle and 2-cycle\n4. 3-cycle and 3-cycle\n5. 3-cycle, 2-cycle, and 1-cycle\n6. 2-cycle, 2-cycle, and 2-cycle\n7. 2-cycle and 1-cycle repeated thrice\n\nThe order of a 6-cycle is 6, the order of a 5-cycle is 5, the order of a 4-cycle is 4, and the order of a k-cycle is k. Therefore, the maximum possible order for an element of S_6 is the least common multiple of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, which is 60.
