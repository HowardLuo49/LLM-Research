    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z, we need to first clarify the definitions involved. A subgroup H of a group G partitions G into left cosets, which are sets of the form gH = {gh : h \u2208 H} for g in G. The left cosets of H in G form a partition of G. In this case, G = 2Z and H = 4Z.\n\nGiven that G = 2Z, the elements of G are multiples of 2. The subgroup 4Z consists of multiples of 4. Therefore, the left cosets of 4Z in 2Z are of the form g + 4Z, where g is an element of 2Z, i.e., multiples of 2.\n\nTo find all cosets, we can consider the elements in 2Z modulo 4Z. The cosets will be all possible remainders when dividing elements of 2Z by 4.\n\nSo the cosets of 4Z in 2Z are:\n- 4Z (which consists of all multiples of 4), and\n- 2 + 4Z (which consists of all multiples of 4 plus 2).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 4Z, 2 + 4Z.",
