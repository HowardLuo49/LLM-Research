    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I must approach this question from a mathematical perspective, specifically in the realm of group theory.\n\nTo find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z, we first need to understand the structure of these groups. In this case, Z represents the integers and 2Z represents the even integers, while 4Z denotes the multiples of 4 within the even integers.\n\nTo find the cosets of 4Z within 2Z, we must consider all possible translates of the form a + 4Z, where a is an element of 2Z. In other words, we are looking for all possible remainders when dividing by 4 within the even integers.\n\nUpon calculation, we find that the cosets of 4Z in 2Z are 4Z and 2 + 4Z.
