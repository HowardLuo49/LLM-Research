    "gpt_response": "To find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z, we first need to understand the concept of cosets. Cosets are sets formed by multiplying every element of a subgroup by a fixed element of the larger group.\n\nIn this case, we are looking at the subgroup 4Z of the group 2Z. The elements of 4Z are all multiples of 4, and the elements of 2Z are all even numbers. \n\nTo find the cosets of 4Z in 2Z, we consider the elements of 2Z modulo 4. The possible remainders when dividing an even number by 4 are 0 and 2. \n\nTherefore, the two possible cosets of 4Z in 2Z are:\n- 0 + 4Z = 4Z\n- 2 + 4Z\n\nSo the correct answer is B: 4Z, 2 + 4Z.",
