    "gpt_response": "Both statements are true. \n\nFor Statement 1: \nA maximal ideal by definition is an ideal that is not properly contained in any other nontrivial ideal of the ring. If an ideal is maximal, it means that it cannot be extended by adding any more elements from the ring without becoming the entire ring. In other words, if I is a maximal ideal, then R/I is a field. \n\nFor Statement 2: \nIn a commutative ring, every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. This is a fundamental result in ring theory. So, if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
