This can be proven using basic properties of ring theory.\n\nThe second statement is also true. If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field. This follows from the fact that a maximal ideal is by definition an ideal that is not properly contained in any larger ideal, and therefore the quotient ring R/I is a field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
