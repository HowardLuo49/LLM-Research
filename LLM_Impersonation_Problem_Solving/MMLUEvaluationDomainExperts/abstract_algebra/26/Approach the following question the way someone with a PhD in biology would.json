    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question from a mathematical perspective. \n\nIn group theory, two groups are said to be isomorphic if there exists a bijective group homomorphism between them. The order of a group is the number of elements in the group. A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by any element of the group.\n\nGiven that the order of the group is 42, it can be shown that there exists a normal subgroup of order 7. This is because 42=2*3*7, where 2, 3, and 7 are prime numbers. It can be proven using Sylow theorems that there exists a subgroup of order 7, and since this subgroup is of prime order, it is normal.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no guarantee that a group of order 42 will have a normal subgroup of order 8. This is because 8 is not a prime factor of 42, so there is no guarantee that a subgroup of order 8 will be normal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
