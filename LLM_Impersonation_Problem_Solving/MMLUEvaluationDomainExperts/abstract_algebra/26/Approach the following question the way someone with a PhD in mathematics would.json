    "gpt_response": "A group of order 42 can be written as 2*3*7. According to Sylow's theorems, there exists a subgroup of order 7 due to the prime factor 7. This subgroup must be normal because there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup since it is the only prime factor to have only one subgroup. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that a group of order 42 will have a normal subgroup of order 8. As 8 is not a prime factor of 42, there may not be a normal subgroup of order 8. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
