    "gpt_response": "In order to address this question, it is important to consider the properties of groups and their subgroups. \n\nStatement 1 claims that every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. This statement is true due to the fact that any group of order p*q, where p and q are primes, has a normal subgroup of order p. In the case of a group of order 42, which can be factored as 2*3*7, there is a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nOn the other hand, statement 2 asserts that every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8. This statement is false because the prime factorization of 42 does not include 8. In fact, a group of order 42 cannot have a normal subgroup of order 8 because there are no integers greater than 1 that can divide 42 and yield a subgroup of order 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
