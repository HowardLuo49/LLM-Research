    "gpt_response": "To address this question from a philosophical perspective, we must first consider the concepts of group theory and the properties of normal subgroups. In group theory, a normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by elements of the group. This concept plays a crucial role in the study of group structure and can help us determine the validity of the given statements.\n\nStatement 1 claims that every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. This statement is true, as it corresponds to the fact that any group of order p^2, where p is a prime number, must have a normal subgroup of order p. In this case, 42 = 2 * 3 * 7, so there exists a normal subgroup of order 7 in any group of order 42.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, asserts that every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8. This statement is false, as there is no requirement for a group of order 42 to have a normal subgroup of order 8. In fact, it is not possible for a group of order 42 to have a normal subgroup of order 8, as this would require a subgroup with an order that does not divide the order of the group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False. This understanding comes from a deep analysis of group theory and the properties of normal subgroups within the context of the given statements.",
