This statement is false, as 8 does not divide 42 evenly and there is no requirement for a group of order 42 to have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nTherefore, as a physicist with a PhD in physics, I would assert that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, leading to the answer choice of C: True, False.",
