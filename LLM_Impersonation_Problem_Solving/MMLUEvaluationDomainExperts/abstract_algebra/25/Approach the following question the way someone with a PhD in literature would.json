The set G encompasses all non-singular matrices of size n x n with rational number entries, suggesting a relationship between the matrices that is defined by their invertibility and the rationality of their components.\n\nIn the realm of group theory, a subgroup is a subset of a group that forms a group itself, satisfying the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. Considering the operation of matrix multiplication within the set G, it is evident that the product of two non-singular matrices is also non-singular, establishing closure under multiplication. Additionally, the presence of the identity matrix in G ensures the existence of an identity element, meeting another requirement of a subgroup.\n\nAs for the abelian nature of G under multiplication, a group is considered abelian if its elements commute under the group operation. In the context of matrix multiplication, not all matrices necessarily commute, meaning that G may not be an abelian group. The possibility of G being finite or infinite further adds complexity to its group structure, as the size of the set may affect the properties of its elements and operations.\n\nIn summary, the set G of non-singular matrices with rational entries under multiplication displays characteristics of a subgroup due to closure and the existence of an identity element. However, the abelian nature of G is ambiguous given the non-commutativity of matrices in general. The finite or infinite nature of G does not inherently determine its group structure, although it may influence the complexity of its properties.\n\nTherefore, with an understanding of matrix theory and group theory, it can be concluded that G is a subgroup under multiplication, denoted by option A.",
