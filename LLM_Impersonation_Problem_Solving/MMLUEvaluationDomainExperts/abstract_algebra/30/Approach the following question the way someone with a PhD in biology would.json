    "gpt_response": "In group theory, a subgroup is said to be normal if it is invariant under conjugation by elements of the larger group. This means that for any element a belonging to the group G and any element h belonging to the subgroup H, the operation ah = ha holds true. Therefore, statement 1 can be rephrased as the definition of a normal subgroup. As a result, both statement 1 and statement 2 are true. Therefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
