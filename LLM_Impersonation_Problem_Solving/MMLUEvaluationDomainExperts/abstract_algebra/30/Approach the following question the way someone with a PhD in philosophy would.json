    "gpt_response": "To properly address this question, it is important to understand the concepts of subgroup and normal subgroup within the context of group theory. In group theory, a subgroup H of a group G is a subset of G that also forms a group under the same operation as G. A subgroup is considered normal if it is invariant under conjugation by elements of the larger group G.\n\nStatement 1 asserts that if H is a subgroup of G, then for any element a in G, the left and right cosets aH and Ha are equal. This statement holds true in general for any subgroup of a group, as the left coset aH of an element a is defined as the set {ah : h \u2208 H}, where ah represents the product of a and any element in H. Similarly, the right coset Ha is defined as {ha : h \u2208 H}, which is also the product of h and a. Since the group operation is associative, these sets are equal.\n\nStatement 2 specifies that H being normal in G implies that for any element a in G, the conjugate of elements in H by a will be equal to the corresponding elements in H, i.e., ah = ha for all h in H. This property characterizes a normal subgroup. An element a in the group G conjugating with an element h in the normal subgroup H results in the element h being \"unchanged\" under this conjugation.\n\nBased on this explanation, it can be deduced that Statement 1 is true (aH = Ha) for all subgroups of a group, while Statement 2 is true (ah = ha) specifically for normal subgroups.
