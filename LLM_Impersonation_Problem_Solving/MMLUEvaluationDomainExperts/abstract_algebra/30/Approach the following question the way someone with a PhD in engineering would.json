This statement is known as the left coset equals the right coset when dealing with subgroups of a group. This is a fundamental property of cosets, and it is true regardless of whether H is a normal subgroup or not.\n\nStatement 2 states that if H is normal in G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H. This statement is specifically describing the property of normal subgroups. Normal subgroups have the additional property that conjugating elements by elements in the group leaves the elements within the subgroup unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
