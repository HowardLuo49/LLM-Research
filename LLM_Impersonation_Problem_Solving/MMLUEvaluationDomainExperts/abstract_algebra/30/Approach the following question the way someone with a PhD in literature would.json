In this case, both statements involve the concept of subgroups and normal groups within a group.\n\nStatement 1 states that if H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha. This statement is true because in group theory, the left and right cosets of a subgroup H are equivalent if and only if H is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nStatement 2 states that if H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H. This statement is also true because the definition of normal subgroup includes the condition where for all elements a in G and h in H, ah = ha.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: True, True.",
