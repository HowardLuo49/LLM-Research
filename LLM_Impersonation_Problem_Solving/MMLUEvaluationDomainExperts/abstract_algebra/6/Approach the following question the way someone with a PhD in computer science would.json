This statement is true. A homomorphic image of a group is essentially a group that is obtained by \"compressing\" or \"mapping\" elements of the original group, while a factor group is obtained by modding out a normal subgroup. Since the concept of homomorphic image can be used to construct factor groups, it follows that every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\n\nStatement 2 states that the homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. This statement is also true. Any factor group of G is a homomorphic image of G, as the factor group is constructed by modding out a normal subgroup and hence can be viewed as the image of a homomorphism from G. Conversely, any homomorphic image of G can be viewed as a factor group of G by considering the subgroup that acts as the kernel of the homomorphism. Additionally, any two factor groups of G that are isomorphic will have the same homomorphic image of G, as isomorphism implies preservation of structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
