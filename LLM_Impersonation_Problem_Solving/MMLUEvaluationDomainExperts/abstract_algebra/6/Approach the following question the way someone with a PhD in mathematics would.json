    "gpt_response": "Let us first define the terms involved. A group homomorphism is a function between two groups that respects the group operations. A homomorphic image of a group G under a homomorphism \u03c6 is the image \u03c6(G) of G under \u03c6. A factor group of G is a group formed by taking a normal subgroup N of G and considering the cosets of N as the elements of the new group.\n\nNow, let us analyze the two statements.\n\nStatement 1: Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\nThis statement is true. If \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a group homomorphism, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that G/ker(\u03c6) is isomorphic to \u03c6(G), where ker(\u03c6) is the kernel of the homomorphism \u03c6. Therefore, every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\nThis statement is false. While every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G, there may be different homomorphisms that give rise to isomorphic factor groups. Therefore, the homomorphic images of G are not necessarily the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. The correct answer is option C: True, False.",
