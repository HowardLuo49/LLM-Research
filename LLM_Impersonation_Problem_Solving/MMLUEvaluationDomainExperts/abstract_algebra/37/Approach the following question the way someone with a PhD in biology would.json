    "gpt_response": "In order to determine whether the polynomial x^2 - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q, we need to consider whether there exists a prime number p such that the polynomial can be written in the form f(x) = x^2 - 12 = g(x) + ph(x), where g(x) and h(x) are polynomials in Z[x] and h(x) has degree at most n-1 (where n is the degree of f(x)).\n\nLet us consider p=5.

Since h(x) is a constant polynomial, it has a degree less than n-1=1, and therefore, the polynomial x^2 - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility at p=5.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C: Yes, with p=5.",
