    "gpt_response": "To determine if the polynomial in Z[x], x^2 - 12, satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q, we need to find a prime number p such that p divides all coefficients of the polynomial except the leading coefficient, and p^2 does not divide the constant term of the polynomial.\n\nLet's analyze the polynomial x^2 - 12 = 0. Here, the coefficient of x^2 is 1, which is not divisible by any prime.\n\nFor the constant term -12, we need to find a prime number p that divides -12. As we can see, p=2 divides -12, and p^2=4 does not divide -12. Hence, by the Eisenstein criterion with p=2, the polynomial x^2 - 12 is irreducible over Q.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Yes, with p=2.",
