    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25, we need to determine the order of 25 in Z_30. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where a is the element and e is the identity element of the group.\n\nIn this case, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that 25^n is congruent to 1 mod 30. Since 25^1 = 25, 25^2 = 25*25 = 625 = 5 mod 30, 25^3 = 25*5 = 125 = 5 mod 30, and 25^4 = 25*5 = 5 mod 30, we see that the order of 25 is 4.\n\nTherefore, the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25 contains 4 elements (25, 5, 25^2 = 5, 25^3 = 5).
