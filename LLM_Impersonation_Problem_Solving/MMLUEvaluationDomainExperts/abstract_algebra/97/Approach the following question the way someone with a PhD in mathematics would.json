    "gpt_response": "In order to find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25, we must consider the order of the element 25 in Z_30. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the smallest positive integer n such that 25^n is congruent to 1 modulo 30. We can observe that 25^2 is congruent to 25 modulo 30, 25^3 is congruent to 25*25 = 625 which is congruent to 25 modulo 30, and so on.\n\nIt turns out that the order of 25 in Z_30 is 6, because 25^6 is congruent to 1 modulo 30. Therefore, the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 has 6 elements. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 6",
