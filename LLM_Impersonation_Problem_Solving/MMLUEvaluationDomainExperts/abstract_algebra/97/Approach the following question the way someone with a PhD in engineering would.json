    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25, we need to look at the powers of 25 within the group Z_30.\n\nThe elements of the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 will be of the form {25, 25^2, 25^3, ...}. Since we are working within Z_30, we need to consider the remainders of these powers when divided by 30.\n\nStarting with 25, we have:\n25^1 = 25 (mod 30)\n25^2 = 625 = 25 (mod 30)\n25^3 = 15625 = 25 (mod 30)\n\nWe see that the powers of 25 within Z_30 repeat every 2 elements. So the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 has a total of 2 elements: {25, 25^2}.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2.",
