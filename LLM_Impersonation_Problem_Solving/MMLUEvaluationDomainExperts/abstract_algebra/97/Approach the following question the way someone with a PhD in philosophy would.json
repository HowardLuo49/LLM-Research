    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25, we need to consider all integer powers of 25 modulo 30. This is equivalent to finding all integers k such that 25^k \u2261 1 (mod 30).\n\nFirst, we note that 25^1 \u2261 25 (mod 30), 25^2 \u2261 25 * 25 \u2261 625 \u2261 25 (mod 30), 25^3 \u2261 25 * 25 * 25 \u2261 625 * 25 \u2261 25 (mod 30).\n\nSince every further power of 25 will be a multiple of 25, the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in Z_30 has only one element, which is 25 itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 25.",
