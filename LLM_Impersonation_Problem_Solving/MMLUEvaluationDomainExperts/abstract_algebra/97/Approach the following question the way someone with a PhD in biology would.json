    "gpt_response": "The cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25 consists of all integer multiples of 25 that are congruent to 0 modulo 30. In other words, this subgroup contains all integers of the form 25k, where k is an integer and 25k \u2261 0 (mod 30). \n\nTo find the number of elements in this subgroup, we need to find the smallest positive integer k such that 25k \u2261 0 (mod 30). This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple of 25 and 30, which is 150. \n\nTherefore, the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in Z_30 consists of 150/25 = 6 elements.
