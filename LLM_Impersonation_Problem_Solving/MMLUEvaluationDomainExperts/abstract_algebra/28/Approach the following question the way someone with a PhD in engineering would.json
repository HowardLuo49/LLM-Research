A homomorphism is a mathematical function between two groups that preserves the algebraic structure of the groups. In other words, it maps the group operation of one group to the group operation of another group. \n\nNext, I would analyze the given statements. Statement 1 says that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements. This statement is true because under a homomorphism, the number of elements in the image group may be different than the number of elements in the original group.\n\nStatement 2 says that there is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. This statement is also true because it is possible to define a homomorphism between groups of different sizes. In this case, a group of 6 elements can be mapped into a group of 12 elements using a homomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: True, True.",
