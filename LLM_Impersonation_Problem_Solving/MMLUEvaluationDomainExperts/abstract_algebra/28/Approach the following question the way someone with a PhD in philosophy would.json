This statement correctly illustrates that the image of a group under a homomorphism is a subgroup of the codomain group. Therefore, it is indeed possible for the image of a group of 6 elements to have 12 elements, as the homomorphism may map elements of the group to multiple elements in the codomain group.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that there is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. This statement aligns with the general concepts of group theory, as it is mathematically feasible for a group of 6 elements to be homomorphically mapped into a group of 12 elements.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the correct answer to this question is option A: True, True. Both statements are accurate and reflective of the principles of group theory and homomorphisms.",
