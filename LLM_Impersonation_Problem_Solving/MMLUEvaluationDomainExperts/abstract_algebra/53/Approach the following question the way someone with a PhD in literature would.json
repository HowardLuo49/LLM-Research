    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a literary perspective, one must examine the statements through the lens of group theory and its implications on isomorphism. \n\nStatement 1 asserts that if groups G, H, and K are of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic. This can be proven by considering the properties of groups of order 4, specifically the possible isomorphisms that can exist between them. Given that there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (namely, the cyclic group of order 4 and the Klein four-group), it follows that if three groups of order 4 are present, at least two of them must be isomorphic. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, which posits that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n. This statement relates to the structure of direct sums of cyclic groups and their isomorphisms with subgroups. In group theory, the direct sum of cyclic groups is a fundamental concept that provides insight into the structure of larger groups. The statement articulates that for two direct sums of cyclic groups to be isomorphic, there must be a relationship between the orders of the cyclic groups involved. Specifically, the orders of the cyclic groups within each direct sum must exhibit a divisibility relationship. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nIn conclusion, a thorough examination of the statements in the context of group theory confirms that both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. The correct answer is A: True, True.",
