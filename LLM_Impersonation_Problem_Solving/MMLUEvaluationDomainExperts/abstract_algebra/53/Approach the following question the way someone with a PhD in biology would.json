    "gpt_response": "To address this question as a person with a PhD in biology, it is important to understand the concepts of group theory and isomorphism in mathematics. \n\nStatement 1 states that if G, H, and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic. This statement is true because there are only two possible groups of order 4, which are the cyclic group of order 4 (Z_4) and the Klein four-group (V). Therefore, if G, H, and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them must be isomorphic to either Z_4 or V.\n\nStatement 2 states that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n. This statement is true as well. In the direct sum of two cyclic groups Z_r + Z_s, the order of the resulting group is the product of the orders of the individual groups, which is rs. Similarly, in Z_m + Z_n, the order of the resulting group is mn. For these two groups to be isomorphic, it is necessary that r divides m and s divides n, as the orders of the individual groups must be compatible for an isomorphism to exist.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True.",
