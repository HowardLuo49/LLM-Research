    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we will analyze the statements using the concepts of group theory and isomorphism. \n\nStatement 1 states that if G, H, and K are groups of order 4, then at least two of them are isomorphic. This statement is true. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, any group of order 4 is isomorphic to either Z_4 or Z_2 + Z_2. Since there are only two possibilities for isomorphism, if there are three groups of order 4, at least two of them must be isomorphic.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it states that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n. This statement is also true. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, any subgroup of Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_d where d is a divisor of the order of the group. Therefore, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
