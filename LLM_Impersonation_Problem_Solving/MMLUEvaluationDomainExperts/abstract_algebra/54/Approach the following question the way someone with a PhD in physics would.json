    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q, we need to determine the dimension of Q(sqrt(2)) as a vector space over Q. \n\nFirst, note that Q(sqrt(2)) is the smallest field containing both Q and sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2, we can see that Q(sqrt(2)) is the same as the field extension Q[x]/(x^2 - 2), where Q[x] is the polynomial ring over Q and (x^2 - 2) is the ideal generated by x^2 - 2.\n\nBy the degree of a field extension theorem, the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q. Since the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, the degree of the extension is 2. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2.",
