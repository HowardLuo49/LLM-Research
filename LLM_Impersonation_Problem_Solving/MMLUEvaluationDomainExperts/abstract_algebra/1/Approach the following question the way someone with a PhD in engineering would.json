    "gpt_response": "To find the index of <p> in S_5, we first need to determine the order of the permutation p.

In this case, p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2,3). The disjoint cycles here are (1, 2, 5, 4) and (2, 3). \n\nThe order of a cycle is its length, so the order of (1, 2, 5, 4) is 4 and the order of (2, 3) is 2. The order of p is the least common multiple of the orders of its disjoint cycles, so in this case, the order of p is lcm(4, 2) = 4.\n\nSince the order of p is 4, the index of <p> in S_5 is given by |S_5| / order of p = 5! / 4 = 120 / 4 = 30. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the given choices.
