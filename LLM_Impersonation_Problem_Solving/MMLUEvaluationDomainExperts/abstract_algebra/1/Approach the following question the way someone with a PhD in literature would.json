    "gpt_response": "To find the index of the subgroup generated by p in the symmetric group S_5, we must first determine the order of the group generated by p. \n\nThe order of the permutation (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) can be found by considering the disjoint cycles in its cycle decomposition. The cycle decomposition tells us that there are two cycles: (1, 2, 5, 4) and (2, 3). The order of a cycle is equal to its length. Therefore, the order of (1, 2, 5, 4) is 4 and the order of (2, 3) is 2. \n\nThe order of a permutation that is a product of disjoint cycles is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles. In this case, the least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4. Therefore, the order of p is 4.\n\nKnowing that the order of the group generated by p is 4, we can calculate the index of <p> in S_5 by dividing the order of S_5 (which is 5 factorial, or 120) by the order of <p>. \n\nTherefore, the index of <p> in S_5 is:\n\n120 / 4 = 30\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed in the options provided.",
