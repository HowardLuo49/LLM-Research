    "gpt_response": "To find the index of <p> in S_5, we need to determine the number of elements in S_5 that are equivalent to p under group conjugation. Since p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), we can see that p consists of a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle.\n\nThe index of <p> in S_5 is given by |S_5| / |C(p)|, where |S_5| is the order of the symmetric group S_5 and |C(p)| is the size of the centralizer of p.\n\nTo find the size of the centralizer of p, we recall that the centralizer of a permutation consists of all permutations that leave p fixed. Since p consists of a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle, it can be fixed by permuting the elements within each cycle independently.\n\nThe 4-cycle (1, 2, 5, 4) has 4! ways it could be permutated internally, and the 2-cycle (2, 3) can be permutated in 2! ways. Therefore, the centralizer of p has size 4! * 2! = 48.\n\nThus, the index of <p> in S_5 is given by |S_5| / |C(p)| = 5! / 48 = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / 48 = 5 * 3 * 2 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the multiple-choice options and should be 30.",
