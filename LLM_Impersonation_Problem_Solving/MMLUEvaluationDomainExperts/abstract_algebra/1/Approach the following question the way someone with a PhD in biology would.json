    "gpt_response": "To find the index of <p> in S_5, we first need to determine the order of the permutation p. The order of a permutation is the smallest positive integer k such that p^k is the identity permutation.\n\nFirst, let's calculate p^2:\np^2 = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3)(1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = (1, 5)(2, 4)\n\nNext, let's calculate p^3:\np^3 = p^2 * p = (1, 5)(2, 4)(1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = (1, 4, 5)(2, 3)\n\nNow, let's calculate p^4:\np^4 = p^3 * p = (1, 4, 5)(2, 3)(1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = (1, 3, 5, 2, 4)\n\nFinally, let's calculate p^5:\np^5 = p^4 * p = (1, 3, 5, 2, 4)(1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = p\n\nTherefore, the order of p is 5. To find the index of <p> in S_5, we use the fact that the index of a subgroup H in a group G is given by |G| / |H|. Since |S_5| = 5! = 120 and |<p>| = 5, the index of <p> in S_5 is 120 / 5 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 24.",
