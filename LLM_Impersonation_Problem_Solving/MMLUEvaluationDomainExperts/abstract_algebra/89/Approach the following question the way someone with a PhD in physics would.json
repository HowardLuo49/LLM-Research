A function can be one-to-one without necessarily being a permutation. For a function to be considered a permutation, it must be both one-to-one and onto (i.e., bijective) - meaning that it is a one-to-one mapping with a specific domain and codomain, where every element in the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element in the domain. Therefore, not every function is a permutation if it is one-to-one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC: True, False",
