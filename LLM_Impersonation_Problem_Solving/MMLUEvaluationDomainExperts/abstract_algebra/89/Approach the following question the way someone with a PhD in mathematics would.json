Therefore, Statement 1 correctly asserts that every permutation is a one-to-one function. This is because being one-to-one is a necessary condition for a function to be a permutation.\n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 states that every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one. This is not true because not every one-to-one function is necessarily onto, and thus not every one-to-one function is a permutation.
