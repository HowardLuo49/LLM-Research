Therefore, Statement 1 is true as every permutation is indeed a one-to-one function.\n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 is false. Not every function is a permutation just because it is one-to-one. A permutation requires not only being one-to-one but also covering all elements in the codomain without duplication. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
