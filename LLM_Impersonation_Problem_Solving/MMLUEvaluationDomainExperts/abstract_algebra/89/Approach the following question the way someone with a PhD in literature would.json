In mathematics, a permutation is a bijective function, meaning it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Therefore, it can be inferred that a permutation is indeed a one-to-one function. This statement is true.\n\nOn the other hand, Statement 2 posits that every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one. This statement is not accurate. A function can be one-to-one (injective) without being onto (surjective), and therefore not a permutation. This means that not every one-to-one function is a permutation. Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
