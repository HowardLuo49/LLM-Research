This rearrangement can be represented as a function. \n\nStatement 1 is false because not every function represents a permutation. A function can be many-to-one, which means that multiple elements in the domain can map to the same element in the codomain. Therefore, not every function is a permutation.\n\nStatement 2 is true because every one-to-one function is also a permutation. A one-to-one function is a function where each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain. This type of function can be represented as a rearrangement of elements, making it a permutation.",
