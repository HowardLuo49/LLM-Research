    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by looking at the definitions and properties of cyclic groups. \n\nA cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. It is known that for every positive integer n, there is a cyclic group of order n. This means that Statement 1 is true, as it follows directly from the definition of cyclic groups.\n\nNext, I would consider the second statement which states that every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This property is also true for cyclic groups. In fact, for any positive integer n, a cyclic group of order n will contain an element of every order that divides n. This is because any element in a cyclic group raised to the power of n will yield the identity element, and the order of an element is the smallest positive integer m such that element raised to the power of m is the identity element. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True",
