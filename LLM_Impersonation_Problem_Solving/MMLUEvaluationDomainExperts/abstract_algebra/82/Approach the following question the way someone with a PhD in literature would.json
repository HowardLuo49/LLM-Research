    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I must clarify that my expertise lies in the field of literature and not mathematics. However, based on my understanding of the terminology used in the given statements, I would approach the question by analyzing the definitions and properties of cyclic groups and orders.\n\nStatement 1 asserts that for every positive integer n, there is a cyclic group of order n. This statement is mathematically accurate and aligns with the definition of cyclic groups, which are groups generated by a single element. Since every positive integer can generate a cyclic group of that order, this statement can be considered true.\n\nStatement 2 states that every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This statement also appears to be correct based on the properties of cyclic groups. In a cyclic group of order n, there exist elements of orders 1, 2, 3, ..., n that can generate the group. Therefore, this statement can be deemed true as well.\n\nIn conclusion, both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true based on the properties of cyclic groups and the definition of orders in mathematics. Thus, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
