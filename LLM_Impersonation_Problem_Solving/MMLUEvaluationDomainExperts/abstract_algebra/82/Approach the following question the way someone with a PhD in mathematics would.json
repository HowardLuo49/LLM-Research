A cyclic group of order n is a group that can be generated by a single element, defined as g^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group. Therefore, for every positive integer n, there exists a cyclic group of order n.\n\nNext, I would consider the second statement which states that every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This is also true because in a cyclic group, every element has an order that divides the order of the group. This property is a consequence of the cyclic nature of the group, where the order of an element is the smallest positive integer k such that g^k = e.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
