A cyclic group of order n is a group that can be generated by a single element, called a generator, and this group contains elements raised to powers of the generator modulo n.\n\nStatement 2 is true as well. Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This is a fundamental property of cyclic groups - for any divisor of the order of the cyclic group, there exists an element in the group that has that order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
