    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze both statements using concepts from algebraic group theory.\n\nStatement 1 states that for every positive integer n, there exists a cyclic group of order n. This is true because cyclic groups are defined as groups generated by a single element, and the order of the group is determined by the order of the generator. Therefore, for every positive integer n, we can construct a cyclic group of order n.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it claims that every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This is also true for cyclic groups. Since a cyclic group is generated by a single element, any power of the generator will yield an element of that order. Furthermore, since the order of the subgroup generated by an element is equal to the order of the element itself, we can find elements of every order that divides the order of the group within a finite cyclic group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
