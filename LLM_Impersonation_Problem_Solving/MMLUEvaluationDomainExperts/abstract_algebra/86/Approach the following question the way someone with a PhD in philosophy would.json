    "gpt_response": "In considering the statements presented, one must first recognize the established definitions and properties of group theory within the realm of abstract algebra. The notion of subgroups, their intersections, and the order of groups are paramount in this analysis.\n\nStatement 1 asserts a relationship between the orders of the subgroups H and K within the group G. This relationship is framed in terms of the cardinality of the product set HK and the intersections of H and K. By the fundamental theorem of cosets in group theory, it is known that the cardinality of the set HK divided by the cardinality of the intersection of H and K is equivalent to the product of the orders of H and K. Thus, Statement 1 holds true within the context of group theory.\n\nStatement 2 posits a claim regarding groups of specific orders, specifically groups of order 2p where p is an odd prime. It suggests that such groups are either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group of order p. This statement aligns with established results in group theory, particularly the classification of groups of order p and 2p. Consequently, Statement 2 is also true within the confines of group theory.\n\nIn conclusion, both Statement 1 and Statement 2 hold true when viewed through the lens of group theory. Hence, the correct response is A: True, True.",
