The size of the product of two subgroups H and K, denoted as HK, is equal to the product of their sizes divided by the size of their intersection. This is a fundamental result in group theory.\n\nStatement 2:\nA group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\nThis statement is false. A group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, can either be cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 2p. The dihedral group of order 2p is denoted as D_2p, not D_p. So, statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC: True, False",
