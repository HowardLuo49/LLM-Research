    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first understanding the concepts of groups, subgroups, and their properties. In Statement 1, we are given information about the cardinality of the product of two subgroups in a group. The formula provided is known as the formula for the cardinality of the product of two subgroups, which is a well-known result in group theory.\n\nGiven my expertise in computer science, I understand that group theory is a fundamental area of mathematics that has important applications in cryptography, error-correcting codes, and algorithms. Therefore, I am familiar with the concept of subgroup intersections and their relationships to the cardinality of the product of subgroups.\n\nIn Statement 2, we are given information about the structure of a group of a specific order, 2p where p is an odd prime. The statement mentions that the group is either cyclic or isomorphic to D_p, where D_p is the dihedral group of order 2p. Based on my knowledge of group theory, I know that this statement is a well-known result in the classification of groups of a particular order.\n\nTherefore, as a computer scientist with a PhD in computer science, I would confidently say that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is True. The correct answer is A: True, True.",
