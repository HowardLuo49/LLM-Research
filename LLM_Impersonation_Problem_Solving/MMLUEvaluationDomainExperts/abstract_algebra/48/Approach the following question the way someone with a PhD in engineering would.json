An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where no zero divisors exist. In this case, R[x] is the polynomial ring over the ring R. The proof of this statement relies on the fact that if R is an integral domain, then clearly R[x] is also an integral domain.

This statement is false. In general, the degree of the product of two polynomials is not equal to the sum of their degrees. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
