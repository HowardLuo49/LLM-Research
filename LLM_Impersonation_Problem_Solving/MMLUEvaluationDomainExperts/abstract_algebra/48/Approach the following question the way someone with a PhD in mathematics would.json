    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to use our knowledge of integral domains and polynomial rings.\n\nStatement 1:\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with identity where there are no zero divisors. If R is an integral domain, then R[x], the polynomial ring in one variable over R, is also an integral domain. This is because the structure of R[x] ensures that no zero divisors exist due to the properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2:\n\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable with a non-zero coefficient. In the context of polynomial multiplication, the degree of the product of two polynomials is not necessarily the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n\nFor example, consider f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3x. The product f(x)g(x) = 6x^2. The degrees of f(x) and g(x) are both 1, but the degree of the product is 2.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
