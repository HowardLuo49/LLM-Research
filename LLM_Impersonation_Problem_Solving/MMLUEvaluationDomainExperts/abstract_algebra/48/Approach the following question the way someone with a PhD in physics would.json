This statement is true because if R is an integral domain, then every polynomial in R[x] will also have no zero divisors, making R[x] an integral domain as well. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 states that if f(x) and g(x) are polynomials in R[x], then the degree of their product is equal to the sum of their degrees. This statement is false because the degree of the product of two polynomials is actually the product of their degrees, not the sum. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
