    "gpt_response": "In considering the provided statements, it is important to first recognize the definitions and implications of each. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. R[x] denotes the ring of polynomials with coefficients in the ring R, and deg(f(x)) represents the degree of a polynomial f(x) with non-negative integer coefficients.\n\nIn assessing statement 1, it is crucial to note that the ring R[x] is constructed by adjoining an indeterminate x to the ring R. Since R is assumed to be an integral domain, it follows that any non-zero elements in R[x] would result in their product also being non-zero, satisfying the criteria for an integral domain. Therefore, Statement 1 is indeed true.\n\nMoving on to statement 2, the assertion made is that the degree of the product of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) is equal to the sum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x). However, this statement is false. A counterexample can be provided by considering f(x) = x and g(x) = x in the ring Z[x], where Z denotes the ring of integers. In this case, deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg(x^2) = 2, while deg f(x) + deg g(x) = 1 + 1 = 2, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct assessment based on a philosophical approach would be option C: True, False.",
