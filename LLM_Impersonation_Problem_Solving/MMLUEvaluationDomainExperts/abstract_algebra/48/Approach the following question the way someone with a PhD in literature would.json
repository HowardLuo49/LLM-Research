    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question from a theoretical and analytical perspective. \n\nStatement 1 claims that if R is an integral domain, then R[x] is also an integral domain. This statement is true in the context of ring theory. An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors, meaning that if the product of two elements is zero, then at least one of the elements must be zero. Adding the variable x to the ring does not change this property, so R[x] remains an integral domain if R is one. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 claims that if f(x) and g(x) are polynomials in R[x], then the degree of their product is equal to the sum of their individual degrees. This statement is false. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial. When multiplying two polynomials, the degree of the product is not simply the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials being multiplied. For example, consider f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3x. The product of f(x) and g(x) is 6x^2, which has a degree of 2, not 1+1=2 as implied in Statement 2. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
