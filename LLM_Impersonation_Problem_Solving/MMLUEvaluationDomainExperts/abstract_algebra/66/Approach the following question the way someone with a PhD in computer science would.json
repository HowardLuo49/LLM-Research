This is a basic result in abstract algebra, stating that the degree of the sum of two polynomials in a ring is equal to the maximum of the degrees of the two polynomials.\n\n- Statement 2 is false. In general, not every ideal of a polynomial ring over a field is principal. For example, the ideal generated by x and 2x in the polynomial ring Q[x] is not principal.",
