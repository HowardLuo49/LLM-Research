    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by carefully analyzing each statement utilizing my knowledge and expertise in the field of ring theory.\n\nFor statement 1, I would recall that in the polynomial ring R[x], the degree of a sum of two polynomials is at most the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. This is a fundamental property of polynomial rings and can easily be proven using basic algebraic manipulation.\n\nFor statement 2, I would acknowledge that in a field F, every non-zero element is invertible, allowing for easy generation of multiples of any element. This implies that every ideal in F[x] can be generated by a single polynomial, making it principal. This statement is also a well-known result in abstract algebra and does not require advanced mathematical concepts to understand.\n\nBased on my analysis, I would confidently select option A: True, True as the correct answer to the question.",
