    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the order of the element (4, 2) in Z_12 x Z_8, we first need to understand the concept of order in the context of group theory.\n\nIn group theory, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that raising the element to the power of n gives the identity element. The order of an element is denoted by ord(x).\n\nGiven that we are working in the direct product group Z_12 x Z_8, where Z_n is the cyclic group of integers modulo n, we can calculate the order of an element by finding the least common multiple of the orders of the individual components of the element.\n\nIn this case, the element (4, 2) consists of two components: 4 from Z_12 and 2 from Z_8. The order of 4 in Z_12 is 3 (since 4^3 = 1 mod 12) and the order of 2 in Z_8 is 2 (since 2^2 = 1 mod 8). \n\nTherefore, the order of the element (4, 2) in Z_12 x Z_8 is the least common multiple of 3 and 2, which is 6. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 6.",
