    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by considering the definitions of free abelian groups and bases in the context of abstract algebra. \n\nIn abstract algebra, a free abelian group is a specific type of group that is freely generated by a set of elements, which means that it can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups. A basis for a free abelian group is a subset of its generating set that is both linearly independent and spans the group. \n\nStatement 1 asserts that every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases. This statement is true because in a free abelian group, every element can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of the basis elements, and since there are infinitely many ways to choose a basis for a free abelian group, there are indeed infinitely many bases.\n\nStatement 2 states that every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases. This statement is also true, as a group of rank at least 2 has at least 2 linearly independent elements that can form the basis. Since the group is free, any subset of its generating set that is linearly independent can potentially form a basis, and there are infinite possibilities for choosing such subsets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
