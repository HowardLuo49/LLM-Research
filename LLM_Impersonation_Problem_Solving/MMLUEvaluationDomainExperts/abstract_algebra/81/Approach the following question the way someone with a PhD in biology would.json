This is a fundamental property of free abelian groups.\n\nStatement 2 is also true because a free abelian group of rank at least 2 is a direct sum of at least 2 copies of Z (the integers). Since Z has infinitely many generating sets, a free abelian group of rank at least 2 will also have infinitely many bases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
