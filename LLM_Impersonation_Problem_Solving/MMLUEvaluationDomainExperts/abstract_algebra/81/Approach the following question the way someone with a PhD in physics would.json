    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in physics, it is important to understand the concepts of free abelian groups and bases. A free abelian group is a group that is isomorphic to the direct sum of a finite number of copies of the integers. A basis for a free abelian group is a subset of elements that generate the entire group without any redundancy.\n\nStatement 1 states that every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases. This statement is true because a free abelian group can have an infinite number of generators, which can lead to an infinite number of bases. This is a fundamental property of free abelian groups.\n\nStatement 2 states that every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases. This statement is also true because a free abelian group of rank at least 2 has at least 2 independent generators, which can be combined in different ways to form an infinite number of bases. This is a consequence of the definition of rank in a free abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A) True, True.",
