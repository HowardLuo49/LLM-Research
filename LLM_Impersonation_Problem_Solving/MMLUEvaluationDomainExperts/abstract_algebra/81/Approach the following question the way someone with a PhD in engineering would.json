    "gpt_response": "To address these statements as someone with a PhD in engineering, we consider the definitions and properties of free abelian groups. \n\nA free abelian group is a group that can be built from a set of elements without any relations other than those required by the group structure. In other words, it is a group that is generated by a set of elements that are not subject to any constraints beyond the group axioms.\n\nStatement 1 states that every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases. This statement is true because a nonzero free abelian group with only one element does not have any basis. However, for groups with more than one element, there are infinitely many ways to choose a set of elements that generate the group as a basis.\n\nStatement 2 states that every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases. This statement is also true because a free abelian group of rank at least 2 has at least two linearly independent elements. We can then continuously extend a basis by adding multiples of these elements to form new bases. Since there are infinitely many choices for these multiples, the group has an infinite number of bases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: True, True.",
