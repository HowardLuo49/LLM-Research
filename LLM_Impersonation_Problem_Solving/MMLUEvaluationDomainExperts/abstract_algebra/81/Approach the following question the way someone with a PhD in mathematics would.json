This statement is indeed true. One way to see this is to consider a free abelian group of rank n, where n is a positive integer. Any nontrivial combination of the n basis elements can be a basis for the group, so there are an infinite number of possible bases.\n\nStatement 2 claims that every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases. This statement is false. Consider, for example, the free abelian group of rank 2, which is isomorphic to Z^2. In this case, any two linearly independent vectors within Z^2 form a basis, so there are only a finite number of bases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: False, True (option D).",
