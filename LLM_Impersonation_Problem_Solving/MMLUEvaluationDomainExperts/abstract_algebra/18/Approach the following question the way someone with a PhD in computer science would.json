An inverse element for a given element in a group is an element that, when combined with the original element under the group operation, yields the identity element. Since there is no real number that, when multiplied by zero, gives 1 (the identity element for multiplication), zero does not have an inverse in the set of real numbers. Therefore, the set of all real numbers under multiplication is not a group.",
