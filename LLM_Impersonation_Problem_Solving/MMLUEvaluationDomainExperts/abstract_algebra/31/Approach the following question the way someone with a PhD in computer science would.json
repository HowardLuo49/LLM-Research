    "gpt_response": "To approach this question with a PhD in computer science, we need to consider the properties of groups and the given equation. \n\nIn group theory, a group is said to be commutative (or abelian) if the group operation is commutative, meaning that for all elements a and b in the group, a*b = b*a. On the other hand, a non-abelian group is one where the group operation is not commutative, i.e., there exist elements a and b such that a*b \u2260 b*a.\n\nGiven that (ab)^-1 = a^-1 * b^-1 for all a, b in G, we can rewrite this equation as (ab) * (a^-1 * b^-1) = e, where e is the identity element of the group. \n\nExpanding the left side of the equation using the group properties, we get:\nab * a^-1 * b^-1 = e\na * b * a^-1 * b^-1 = e\na * (b * a^-1) * b^-1 = e\n\nNow, we can see that this equation resembles the definition of the product of conjugate elements in a group. If the group operation is commutative, then we can simplify this equation further to show that (ab)^-1 = b^-1 * a^-1, which would imply that the group is abelian. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: abelian group.",
