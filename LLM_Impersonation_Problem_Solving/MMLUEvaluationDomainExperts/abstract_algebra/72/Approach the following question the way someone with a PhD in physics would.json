    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can use Fermat's little theorem which states that if p is a prime number and \"a\" is any integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p.\n\nIn this case, we have p = 23 which is a prime number and a = 3 which is not divisible by 23. Therefore, using Fermat's little theorem, we can write:\n\n3^(23-1) \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\n3^22 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 3^47 as (3^22)^2 * 3^3. From our previous equation, we know that 3^22 is congruent to 1 mod 23. So, we can simplify 3^47 as:\n\n(3^22)^2 * 3^3 \u2261 1^2 * 3^3 \u2261 27 \u2261 4 (mod 23)\n\nTherefore, the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is 4. So, the correct answer is D: 4.",
