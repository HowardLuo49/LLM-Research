    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. \n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is any integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 (mod p). \n\nIn this case, we have p = 23, a = 3, and we want to find 3^47 (mod 23). \n\nFirst, we need to find the value of (p-1) which is 22. \n\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem, we can reduce the exponent 47 (mod 22) to simplify the calculation: \n47 mod 22 = 3 \n\nSo, 3^47 is congruent to 3^3 (mod 23). \n\nCalculating 3^3 = 27 = 1 (mod 23). \n\nTherefore, the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23 is 1. \n\nThus, the answer is A: 1.",
