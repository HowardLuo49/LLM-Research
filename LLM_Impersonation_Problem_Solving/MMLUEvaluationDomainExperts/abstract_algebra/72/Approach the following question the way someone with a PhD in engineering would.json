    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can use Fermat's theorem. Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is any integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p. In this case, 23 is a prime number and 3 is not divisible by 23.\n\nTherefore, we can reduce 3^47 to (3^22)^2 * 3. Since 3^22 is congruent to 1 mod 23 (from Fermat's little theorem), we can simplify the expression to 3 * 1 (mod 23), which equals 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is 3. So the correct answer is:\n\nC: 3.",
