    "gpt_response": "To determine the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can use Fermat's little theorem. Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. \n\nIn this case, 23 is a prime number, and since 3 is not divisible by 23, we have:\n\n3^(23-1) \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\n3^22 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can rewrite 3^47 as (3^22)^2 * 3^3. Since 3^22 is congruent to 1 modulo 23, we have:\n\n3^47 \u2261 1^2 * 3^3 \u2261 3^3 \u2261 27 \u2261 4 (mod 23)\n\nTherefore, the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is 4.
