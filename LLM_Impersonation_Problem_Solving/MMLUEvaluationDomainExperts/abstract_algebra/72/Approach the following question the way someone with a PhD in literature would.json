    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first consider Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any prime number p and any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. In this case, since 23 is a prime number, we know that:\n\n3^(23-1) \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\n3^22 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 22. We can rewrite 3^47 as (3^22) * 3^25. From Fermat's theorem, we know that 3^22 \u2261 1 (mod 23), so we have:\n\n3^47 \u2261 1 * 3^25 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can simplify further by finding the remainder of 3^25 when divided by 23:\n\n3^25 = (3^22) * 3^3\n\nUsing Fermat's theorem again, we can reduce this to:\n\n3^3 \u2261 27 \u2261 4 (mod 23)\n\nTherefore, the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is the same as the remainder of 1 * 4 when divided by 23, which is:\n\n1 * 4 \u2261 4 (mod 23)\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 4.",
