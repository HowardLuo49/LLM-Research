    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can use Fermat's little theorem. \n\nFermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p. \n\nIn this case, p = 23, so we have 3^22 \u2261 1 (mod 23). \n\nWe can rewrite 47 as 22*2 + 3. \n\nTherefore, 3^47 = (3^22)^2 * 3 \u2261 1^2 * 3 \u2261 3 (mod 23). \n\nTherefore, the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is 3. \n\nSo the answer is C: 3.",
