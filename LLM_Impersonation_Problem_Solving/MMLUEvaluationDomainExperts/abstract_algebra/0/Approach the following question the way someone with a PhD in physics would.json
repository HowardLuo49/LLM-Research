    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to determine the dimension of the field extension as a vector space over Q.\n\nSince each radical extension involves a square root, we can consider the degree of each radical extension individually. \n\nThe degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2, as the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, which is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nSimilarly, the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is also 2, as the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3.\n\nFinally, the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(18)) over Q can be computed by considering the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) over Q. We can write sqrt(18) as sqrt(2*3*3) = 3sqrt(2), which is the product of its quadratic and linear factors. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) over Q is x - 3sqrt(2), which is of degree 1.\n\nSince the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q can be considered as the compositum of these individual field extensions, the degree of the field extension is the product of the individual degrees. \n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 2 * 2 * 1 = 4. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B: 4.",
