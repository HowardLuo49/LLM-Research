    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's express all square roots in terms of their simplest forms. We know that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*3*3) = 3sqrt(2). Therefore, the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is equivalent to Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, let's determine the degree of the extension by finding a basis. Consider the elements 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3sqrt(2). It is clear that these four elements are linearly independent over Q. Therefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 4.",
