    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to determine how many linearly independent elements are needed to generate this field extension.\n\nFirst, note that sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both contained in the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). Therefore, we only need to consider the degree of the extension of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.\n\nSince both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are algebraic over Q, we know that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is contained within the field extension Q(sqrt(2))(sqrt(3)) over Q(sqrt(2)). \n\nBoth sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are irreducible over the rationals, and because they are coprime, the degree of the extension is the product of the degrees of the two extensions: the degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2, and the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q(sqrt(2)) is 2.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 2*2 = 4. \n\nThus, the correct answer is B: 4.",
