    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to determine how many linearly independent basis elements are needed to generate this field extension over the rational numbers.\n\nFirst, note that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*3*3) = 3*sqrt(2). So, the field extension can be rewritten as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3*sqrt(2)) over Q.\n\nNow, we need to consider the degrees of each individual field extension. The degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2 because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, which has degree 2.\n\nSimilarly, the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is 2 because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3, which has degree 2.\n\nSince sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2), we know that sqrt(18) is in the field generated by sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). Therefore, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is the same as the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q. This is calculated by taking the product of the degrees of the individual field extensions, which is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 4.",
