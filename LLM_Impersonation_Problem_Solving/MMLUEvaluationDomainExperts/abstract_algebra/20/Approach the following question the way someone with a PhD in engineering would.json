Statement 1 states that the order of the internal direct product of two finite groups G and H is equal to the product of the orders of G and H, which is a known property of the internal direct product.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it asserts that if r divides m and s divides n, then the group Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. This statement involves the direct sum of cyclic groups and the existence of a subgroup isomorphic to another direct sum.\n\nBased on my knowledge and understanding of group theory and direct products, I would determine that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is True.
