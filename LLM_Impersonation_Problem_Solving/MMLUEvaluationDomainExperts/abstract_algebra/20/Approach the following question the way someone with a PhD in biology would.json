This is a fundamental property of direct products in group theory and can be easily proven.\n\nStatement 2 introduces the concept of Z_m and Z_n, which are cyclic groups of order m and n, respectively. The statement claims that if r divides m and s divides n, then the direct product of Z_m and Z_n will have a subgroup isomorphic to the direct product of Z_r and Z_s.
