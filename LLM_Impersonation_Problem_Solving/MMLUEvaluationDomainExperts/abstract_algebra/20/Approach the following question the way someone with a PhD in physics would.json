    "gpt_response": "In group theory, the internal direct product of two groups G and H is denoted as G + H and is defined as the set of all elements gh where g is in G and h is in H. \n\nStatement 1 is true for finite groups G and H, as the order of the internal direct product |G + H| is the product of the orders of the individual groups |G| and |H|. This can be proven using the fact that if G and H are finite groups, then the number of elements in the internal direct product G + H is equal to the product of the number of elements in G and the number of elements in H. \n\nStatement 2 is also true, as if r divides m and s divides n, then the group Z_m + Z_n will have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.
