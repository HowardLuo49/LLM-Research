    "gpt_response": "To approach this question like someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to analyze the statements in a rigorous and logical manner.\n\nStatement 1: For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|. This statement is true when G and H are finite groups and G + H denotes the internal direct product of G and H. The direct product of finite groups is defined as the Cartesian product of the underlying sets with a specific group operation. In the case of finite groups, the order of the direct product is equal to the product of the orders of the individual groups. Therefore, Statement 1 is true for finite groups G and H.\n\nStatement 2: If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. This statement is also true. The direct sum of cyclic groups Z_m and Z_n is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_mn if and only if the greatest common divisor of m and n is 1. If r divides m and s divides n, then the greatest common divisor of r and s is 1, so Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_rs. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A: True, True.",
