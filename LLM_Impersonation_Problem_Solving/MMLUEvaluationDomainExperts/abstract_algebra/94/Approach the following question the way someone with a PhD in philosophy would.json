An extension field of a field F is a field that contains F and that has a larger dimension over F. In this case, Z_2 is the field of integers modulo 2, and Q is the field of rational numbers. It is known that Q is an extension field of Z_2 because Z_2 is a subfield of Q, and Q has a larger dimension over Z_2.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is known as the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial over the field of complex numbers has at least one complex root. This implies that every non-constant polynomial over any field has a zero in some extension field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: True, False",
