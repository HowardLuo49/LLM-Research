    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of extension fields and zero elements for polynomials over fields.\n\nStatement 1 is true because Q, the field of rational numbers, is an extension field of Z_2, the field of integers modulo 2. This means that Q contains Z_2 as a subfield.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. This result, known as the existence of algebraic closures, states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This follows from the fact that every polynomial of degree n over a field has at most n roots, and so there always exists an extension field containing all the roots of a given polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
