This means that Q contains Z_2 as a subfield, and therefore Q is a field that extends Z_2. This statement is true.\n\nStatement 2 states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. This statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
