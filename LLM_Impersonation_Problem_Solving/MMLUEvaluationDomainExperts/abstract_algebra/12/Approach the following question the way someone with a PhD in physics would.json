    "gpt_response": "To find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>), we start by determining the orders of Z_11 and Z_15. \n\nZ_11 has order 11, as it consists of integers modulo 11. Similarly, Z_15 has order 15.\n\nThe element <1,1> generates the subgroup of (Z_11 x Z_15), and the factor group is the cosets of this subgroup. \n\nSince the element <1,1> generates the subgroup, the order of the factor group is the quotient of the orders of (Z_11 x Z_15) and the subgroup generated by <1,1>. \n\nTherefore, the order of the factor group is (11 * 15) / 1 = 165. \n\nHowever, if we're looking for the order of the factor group modulo the subgroup, we would factor out the order of the subgroup.
