    "gpt_response": "To find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>), we need to determine the number of elements in the coset space. The factor group is defined as the set of left cosets of the subgroup generated by (1,1) in the direct product Z_11 x Z_15.\n\nThe order of the factor group is equal to the index of the subgroup in the direct product group.\n\nThe index of a subgroup is given by the formula: [G:H] = |G| / |H|, where G is the whole group and H is the subgroup. In this case, G is Z_11 x Z_15 and H is the subgroup generated by (1,1).\n\nThe order of Z_11 x Z_15 is 11 * 15 = 165.\n\nSince the subgroup generated by (1,1) is a cyclic group of order 1, the order of the factor group is 165 / 1 = 165.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options given.",
