    "gpt_response": "To find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>), we need to first understand the structure of the group.\n\nHere, Z_11 represents the additive group of integers modulo 11, and Z_15 represents the additive group of integers modulo 15.\n\nThe element <1, 1> represents the subgroup generated by (1, 1) in the direct product Z_11 x Z_15.\n\nSince both Z_11 and Z_15 are cyclic groups, their direct product Z_11 x Z_15 is also cyclic. The order of the factor group is equal to the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1) in Z_11 x Z_15.\n\nTo find the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1), we need to find the least common multiple of the orders of (1) in Z_11 and Z_15.\n\nThe order of (1) in Z_11 is 11, and the order of (1) in Z_15 is 15. Therefore, the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1) is the least common multiple of 11 and 15, which is 55.\n\nTherefore, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) is 55.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed in the options provided.",
