    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the order of the factor group, we need to find the order of the elements of (Z_11 x Z_15) that are equivalent to the element <1, 1> under the equivalence relation defined by the subgroup <1, 1>. \n\nFirst, we need to find the element in (Z_11 x Z_15) that is equivalent to <1, 1>. Let's call this element (a, b). We need to find (a, b) such that (a, b) + <1, 1> = <0, 0> in (Z_11 x Z_15) / <1, 1>.\n\n(a, b) + (1, 1) \u2261 (0, 0) (mod 11, 15)\n\nThis means a + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 11) and b + 1 \u2261 0 (mod 15). \n\nFrom the first equation, we can see that a = 10 satisfies the condition. \nFrom the second equation, we can see that b = 14 satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the element that is equivalent to <1, 1> is (10, 14).\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the group of all elements equivalent to (10, 14) under the equivalence relation defined by <1, 1>. The order of this factor group will give us the answer.\n\nThe order of an element (a, b) under the equivalence relation is the smallest positive integer n such that n(a, b) = (na, nb) \u2261 (0, 0) (mod 11, 15).\n\nIn this case, the element (10, 14) has order 5. Therefore, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15) / <1, 1> is 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 5.",
