    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of -i within the group {1, -1, i, -i}. The multiplicative inverse of a complex number is a complex number which, when multiplied with the original number, results in the multiplicative identity, which is 1.\n\nIn this case, the inverse of -i is the complex number that, when multiplied with -i, will result in 1. We can find this by performing the multiplication:\n\n(-i) * x = 1\nx = 1 / -i\nx = (-i) / (-i) * (i / i)\nx = 1\n\nTherefore, the inverse of -i in the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i} is 1.
