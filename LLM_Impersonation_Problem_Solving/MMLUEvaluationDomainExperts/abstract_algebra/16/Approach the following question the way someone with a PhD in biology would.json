    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the inverse of -i in the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i}, we must find the element within the group such that the product of -i and that element equals 1. This involves finding an element x such that -i * x = 1.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by -i: x = 1 / -i. Since the complex number -i can be represented as 0 - 1i, we can rewrite this expression as x = 1 / (0 - 1i). Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get x = 1 * (0 + 1i) / (0 - 1i) * (0 + 1i), which simplifies to x = i / (1).\n\nTherefore, the inverse of -i in the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i} is i. The correct answer is C: i.",
