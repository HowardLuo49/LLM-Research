Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, let's move on to Statement 2, which claims that every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. \n\nTo prove this statement, we can consider the fact that the prime factorization of 102 is 2 * 3 * 17. By Sylow's Theorems, we know that there exists a Sylow 17-subgroup which must be normal in the group of order 102. This subgroup is a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, so Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
