    "gpt_response": "To address these statements, we must consider the properties of groups and their orders. \n\nStatement 1 states that every group of order 159 is cyclic. This can be analyzed using Sylow's theorems, which state that for any group G with order p^n * m where p is a prime and gcd(p,m) = 1, there exists subgroups of G of order p, p^2, p^3, ..., p^n. In this case, the order 159 can be factored as 3^2 * 17. Since 3 and 17 are primes, according to Sylow's theorems, there exist Sylow 3-subgroups and Sylow 17-subgroups in the group of order 159. Since 3 and 17 are both primes, the group must be cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 claims that every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. Given a group of order 102, we can consider the prime factorization of 102, which is 2 * 3 * 17. By Sylow's theorems, there are Sylow 2-subgroups (of order 2), Sylow 3-subgroups (of order 3), and Sylow 17-subgroups (of order 17) present in the group. Since 2, 3, and 17 are all primes, the group must be cyclic by a similar argument to Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
