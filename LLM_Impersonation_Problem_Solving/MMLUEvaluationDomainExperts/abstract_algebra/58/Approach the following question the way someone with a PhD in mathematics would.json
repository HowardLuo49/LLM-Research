    "gpt_response": "To determine the truth values of the given statements, one must apply knowledge about the properties of groups and their orders. \n\nStatement 1: Every group of order 159 is cyclic.\nThis statement is false. The order of a group does not determine whether it is cyclic. In fact, a group of prime order is always cyclic, but for composite orders it is not necessarily true. 159 can be factorized as 3 x 53, which are both prime numbers. Since 3 and 53 are both prime, it follows that a group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\nThis statement is true. By the Sylow theorems, since 102 = 2 x 3 x 17, we have Sylow 3-subgroups, Sylow 17-subgroups, and Sylow 2-subgroups in any group of order 102. Furthermore, since 2 does not divide 3 x 17, the Sylow 2-subgroup is normal. Therefore, any group of order 102 has a normal subgroup of order 2, which is nontrivial and proper. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
