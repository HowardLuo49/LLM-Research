This is a well-known result in algebraic topology and is true due to the existence of free abelian groups with any specified rank, which can be constructed using generators and relations.\n\nStatement 2 states that a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. Betti numbers are a topological invariant associated with the homology groups of a space. For finitely generated abelian groups, the Betti number can be related to the number of elements in a generating set.\n\nBased on the definitions and properties of free abelian groups and Betti numbers, we can conclude that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is also true.
