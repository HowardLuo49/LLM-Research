    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the concepts of free abelian groups, rank, finitely generated abelian groups, and Betti numbers.\n\nA free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements without any relations between them, while an abelian group is a group where the group operation is commutative. The rank of a free abelian group is the dimension of the group when considered as a vector space over the integers.\n\nFinitely generated abelian groups are those that can be generated by a finite number of elements. The Betti number of a group is a measure of its complexity and is related to the group's homology.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can see that Statement 1 is true because it is a well-known fact in group theory that there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.\n\nStatement 2 is also true because a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.
