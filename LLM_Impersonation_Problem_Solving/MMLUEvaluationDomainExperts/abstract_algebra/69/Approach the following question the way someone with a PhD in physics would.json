    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in physics, we must first understand the definitions of the terms mentioned in the statements. An abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative. A free abelian group is an abelian group that can be generated by a set of elements with no relations between them except the identity element. The rank of a free abelian group is the number of elements in its generating set. A finitely generated abelian group is an abelian group that can be generated by a finite set of elements.\n\nStatement 1 says that there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank. This is a well-known fact in group theory, as the set of integers with addition forms a free abelian group of rank 1. This statement is true.\n\nStatement 2 says that a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. The Betti number of a group is the rank of its first homology group, which is a measure of the number of \"holes\" in the group. In the context of abelian groups, the Betti number is also equal to the rank of the group. So, this statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
