    "gpt_response": "To address these statements with the expertise of a PhD in engineering, one must consider the definitions and properties of both free abelian groups and finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nA free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements with no relations imposed on them, meaning there are no non-trivial linear combinations that equal the identity element. This definition implies that there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.\n\nOn the other hand, a finitely generated abelian group is a group that can be generated by a finite set of elements. The Betti number of a finitely generated abelian group is the number of elements in any minimal generating set of that group. For a finitely generated abelian group to be free abelian, its Betti number must equal the number of elements in some generating set. This is because a free abelian group is characterized by having a minimal generating set with the same number of elements as its Betti number.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true as there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank. Statement 2 is also true, as a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. The correct answer is A: True, True.",
