Associativity: Multiplication of complex numbers is associative, so the set satisfies this property.\n\n3. Identity element: The identity element of the group is 1, as multiplying any nth root of unity by 1 will result in the same value.\n\n4. Inverse element: For every nth root of unity z, its inverse element is its complex conjugate, which is also an nth root of unity.
