A group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of elements together with an operation that satisfies certain properties, such as closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for every element.\n\nSpecifically, in this case, the set of all nth roots of unity forms a group because it includes the identity element (1), has closure under multiplication (the product of two nth roots of unity is also an nth root of unity), has associativity (the operation of multiplication is associative), and each element has an inverse (the inverse of an nth root of unity is its complex conjugate).\n\nFurthermore, since the nth roots of unity under multiplication also satisfy the property of commutativity (the order of multiplication does not affect the result), the set can be understood as a commutative group, or more formally, an abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is D: abelian group.",
