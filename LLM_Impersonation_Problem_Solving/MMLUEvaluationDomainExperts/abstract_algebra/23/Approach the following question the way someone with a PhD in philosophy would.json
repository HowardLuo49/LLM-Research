    "gpt_response": "In considering the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers, we must examine the properties and structure of this set in order to determine its classification. \n\nFirstly, the set of all nth roots of unity forms a commutative semigroup with identity. This is because the multiplication operation is associative, closure under multiplication is preserved, and the identity element (1) exists within the set. \n\nFurthermore, the set of all nth roots of unity also forms a group. This is because every element in the set has an inverse (which is also an nth root of unity), satisfying the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and inverse. \n\nLastly, we can conclude that the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers form an abelian group. This is because the group is commutative, as multiplication of complex numbers is commutative, and therefore the operation of the group is also commutative. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: D) abelian group.",
