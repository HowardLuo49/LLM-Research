A group is a set equipped with an operation that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses. In this case, the set of all nth roots of unity forms a group because it is closed under multiplication, associative, contains an identity element (1), and each element has an inverse. Additionally, since multiplication of complex numbers is commutative, the group is also abelian. Therefore, the correct answer is C: group.",
