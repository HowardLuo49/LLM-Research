The size of a basis is called the dimension of the vector space. \n\nThe first statement is saying that every linearly independent set of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space is contained in a basis. This is true because in a finite-dimensional vector space, any linearly independent set with the same number of vectors as the dimension of the vector space is automatically a basis.\n\nThe second statement is saying that if B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then they have the same size. This is also true because all bases for the same vector space will have the same size, which is the dimension of the vector space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
