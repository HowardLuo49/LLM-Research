This statement is true because in a finite dimensional vector space, a basis can be formed by extending any linearly independent set of vectors until it has a sufficient number of vectors to span the entire space.\n\nStatement 2 states that if B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then the cardinality of B_1 is equal to the cardinality of B_2.
