    "gpt_response": "An individual with a PhD in literature may not have the same level of expertise in mathematics as in literature. However, they may still be able to analyze and interpret the question using their critical thinking skills.\n\nIn analyzing the two statements provided, we can see that Statement 1 deals with the concept of homomorphism and the condition for it to be one-to-one. This statement is true in the context of group theory, which is a fundamental concept in abstract algebra. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that are mapped to the identity element of the target group. If the kernel consists only of the identity element, then the homomorphism is one-to-one.\n\nRegarding Statement 2, it states that the image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements. This statement is false because the image of a homomorphism is a subgroup of the target group, and the number of elements in the image must divide the number of elements in the group being mapped from. Therefore, the image of a group of 6 elements cannot have 4 elements.\n\nIn conclusion, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
