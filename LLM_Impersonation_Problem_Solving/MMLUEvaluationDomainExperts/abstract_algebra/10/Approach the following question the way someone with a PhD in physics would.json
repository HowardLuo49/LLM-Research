    "gpt_response": "To analyze Statement 1, we will use the concept of left and right cosets. Let H be a subgroup of G. The left coset of H containing element a in G is denoted by aH and is defined as aH = {ah : h \u2208 H}. Similarly, the right coset of H containing element a in G is denoted by Ha and is defined as Ha = {ha : h \u2208 H}.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G, the left coset aH and the right coset Ha contain the same number of elements. This can be proven by considering the map f : aH \u2192 Ha defined by f(ah) = ha for all h in H. This function is a bijection, showing that the two cosets have the same cardinality.\n\nTherefore, |aH| = |Ha| is true.\n\nTo analyze Statement 2, we will consider the left coset aH and the right coset Hb. If aH and Hb are identical, then aH = Hb, which implies that ab^(-1) is an element of H for all b in G. This means that aH = Hb for all b in G, indicating that a belongs to the left coset of every element in G. Therefore, a must belong to H, since H is the left coset of the identity element e.\n\nIf a and b belong to G, and a does not belong to H, then aH and Hb are disjoint, as they do not share any common elements. This is true because if a did not belong to H, then aH would not intersect with Hb.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
