If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then the left coset of a with respect to H (denoted by aH) has the same number of elements as the right coset of a with respect to H (denoted by Ha).

The left and right cosets of a subgroup H need not be identical nor disjoint in general. For example, in a group with non-commutative elements, such as the symmetric group S3, the left coset of an element a (e.g. (1 2)) with respect to a subgroup H (e.g. {(1)} ) can be different from the right coset of another element b (e.g. (1 3)) with respect to the same subgroup H.
