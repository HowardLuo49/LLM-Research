    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we would carefully analyze the given statements using our knowledge of group theory and permutation cycles.\n\nStatement 1 states that S_n is non-Abelian for all n greater than or equal to 3. This statement is true, as the symmetric group S_n for n greater than or equal to 3 is non-Abelian. This is a fundamental result in group theory and can be proven through examining specific permutations and their properties.\n\nStatement 2 states that if a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then the product of a and b has order equal to the least common multiple of m and n. This statement is also true and can be proven by considering the properties of cycle notation and how cycle lengths interact when composing permutations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
