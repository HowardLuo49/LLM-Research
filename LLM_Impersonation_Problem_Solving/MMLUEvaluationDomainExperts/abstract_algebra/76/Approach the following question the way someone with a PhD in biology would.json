This statement is indeed true, as the symmetric group is non-Abelian for n greater than or equal to 3.\n\nStatement 2 states that if a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then the order of the product ab is equal to the least common multiple of m and n. This statement is false. The correct relationship is that the order of the product ab is equal to the least common multiple of m and n divided by their greatest common divisor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
