    "gpt_response": "In analyzing the given statements, it is important to consider the properties of non-Abelian groups and permutations. \n\nStatement 1 asserts that S_n is non-Abelian for all n \u2265 3. This statement is true, as the symmetric group S_n, which consists of all permutations of n elements, is non-Abelian for n \u2265 3. This can be demonstrated by showing that not all permutations in S_n commute with each other, thus violating the Abelian property.\n\nStatement 2 discusses permutations a and b, where a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle. The statement claims that the order of the product ab is equal to the least common multiple (lcm) of the lengths of the cycles m and n. This statement is also true, as the order of a permutation is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. \n\nTherefore, based on the analysis provided, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
