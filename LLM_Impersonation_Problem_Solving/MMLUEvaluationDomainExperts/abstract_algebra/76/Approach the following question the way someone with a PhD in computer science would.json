    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must understand the concepts of non-Abelian groups and permutations in group theory. \n\nStatement 1 asserts that S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3. This is true because the symmetric group S_n, which consists of all permutations of n elements, is non-Abelian for n >= 3. This is a well-known result in group theory.\n\nStatement 2 states that if a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then the order of the product of a and b (|ab|) is equal to the least common multiple (lcm) of m and n. This statement is also true. When dealing with permutations, the order of a product of permutations is equal to the least common multiple of the orders of the individual permutations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A) True, True.",
