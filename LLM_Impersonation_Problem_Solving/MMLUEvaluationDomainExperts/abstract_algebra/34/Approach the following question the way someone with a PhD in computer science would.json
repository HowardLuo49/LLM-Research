    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in computer science, we will need to apply our understanding of linear transformations and fundamental concepts in linear algebra.\n\nFor Statement 1, if dim(V) < dim(W) and dim(W) < 1, it implies that dim(V) < 1. However, the dimension of a vector space cannot be less than 1, as it must contain at least the zero vector. Therefore, the given condition is not possible and Statement 1 is false.\n\nFor Statement 2, if T is injective (one-to-one), it means that distinct vectors in V map to distinct vectors in V under T. This implies that the dimension of the output space is equal to the dimension of the input space, and T is a bijection (both injective and surjective). Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
