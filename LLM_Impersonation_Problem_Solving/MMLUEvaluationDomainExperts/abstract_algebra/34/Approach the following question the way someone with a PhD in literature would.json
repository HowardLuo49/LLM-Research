    "gpt_response": "As a scholar of literature with a PhD, I must point out that this question pertains to the field of mathematics, specifically linear algebra. In analyzing the statements provided, it is essential to approach them with a rigorous mathematical mindset.\n\nStatement 1 suggests that if a linear transformation T from vector space V to vector space W where the dimension of V is less than the dimension of W and both dimensions are less than 1, then T must be injective. This statement is true. This is because if dim(V) < dim(W), there will always be more vectors in W than in V, meaning that T must map distinct vectors in V to distinct vectors in W, making T injective.\n\nStatement 2 discusses a linear transformation T from a vector space V to itself, where the dimension of V is n. It states that if T is injective, then it must be a bijection. This statement is false. While injectivity guarantees that distinct vectors in V map to distinct vectors under T, it does not necessarily ensure surjectivity, which is required for a function to be a bijection.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option C: True, False.",
