If dim(V) < dim(W), then there are more elements in the range W than in the domain V, which would imply that T cannot be surjective (onto). However, this does not necessarily mean that T must be injective. Therefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\nFor Statement 2, I would recall that a linear transformation T: V -> V that is injective implies that every element in the domain V maps to a unique element in the range V. If T is also surjective (onto), then it is a bijection. Hence, Statement 2 is True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: False, True.",
