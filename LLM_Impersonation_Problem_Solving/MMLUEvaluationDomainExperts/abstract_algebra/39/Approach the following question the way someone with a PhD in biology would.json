In mathematics, a permutation is a rearrangement of a set of elements, while a cycle is a specific type of permutation in which elements move in a cyclic manner.\n\nStatement 1, \"Every permutation is a cycle,\" is false. Not every permutation is a cycle because permutations can take various forms, including cycles, transpositions, or a combination of both.\n\nStatement 2, \"Every cycle is a permutation,\" is true. Every cycle is a specific type of permutation where elements move in a cyclic manner.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
