A cycle is a special type of permutation that can be represented as a product of disjoint cycles of length 2 or more.\n\nStatement 1 says that every permutation is a cycle. This statement is false because not every permutation is a cycle. For example, the permutation (1 2) is a cycle, but the permutation (1 2)(3 4) is not a cycle.\n\nStatement 2 says that every cycle is a permutation. This statement is true because a cycle is a specific type of permutation as defined in group theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: D) False, True.",
