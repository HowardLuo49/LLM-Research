    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in literature, we must first understand the concepts of symmetry and anti-symmetry in relation to sets and their elements. \n\nIn mathematics, a relation R on a set A is said to be symmetric if for every pair (a, b) in R, the pair (b, a) is also in R. On the other hand, a relation R is said to be anti-symmetric if for every pair (a, b) in R, the pair (b, a) is not in R whenever a is not equal to b.\n\nIn the given relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}, we see that for every pair (a, b) in S, the pair (b, a) is also present in S. Therefore, the relation S is symmetric. However, since the elements of the set A are distinct (1 and 2 are not equal), the relation S is not anti-symmetric.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} is symmetric only. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: symmetric only.",
