This implies that S is symmetric.\n\nTo determine if S is anti-symmetric, we need to check if for any elements a and b such that (a, b) is in S and (b, a) is in S, a must be equal to b. In this case, since there are no pairs like (a, b) and (b, a) where a is not equal to b, S meets the definition of anti-symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the relation S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric.
