    "gpt_response": "Let's first define the terms symmetric, anti-symmetric, and equivalence relation in the context of relations. \n\nA relation R on a set A is said to be symmetric if for any x, y in A, if (x, y) is in R then (y, x) must also be in R.\n\nA relation R on a set A is said to be anti-symmetric if for any x, y in A, if (x, y) is in R and (y, x) is also in R, then x must equal y.\n\nAn equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\nIn the given relation S, we have S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}. \n\n1. Symmetric: Since (1, 1) is in S, we would also need (1, 1) to be in S for it to be symmetric. However, (1, 1) is not in S, so S is not symmetric.\n\n2. Anti-symmetric: Since (1, 1) and (2, 2) are the only elements in S, there is no pair (x, y) such that both (x, y) and (y, x) are in S. Therefore, S is anti-symmetric.\n\n3.
