Moreover, an ideal in a polynomial ring is maximal if and only if the corresponding polynomial is irreducible over the base ring.\n\nIn our case, we are looking for values of c in Z_3 such that the polynomial x^3 + cx^2 + 1 is irreducible over Z_3. By the definition of irreducibility, a polynomial is irreducible over a field F if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials in F[x].\n\nWe examine x^3 + cx^2 + 1 = 0 in Z_3[x] for c in Z_3. For c = 0, we have x^3 + 1 = 0, which factors as (x + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2) in Z_3. Thus, for c = 0, the polynomial is reducible, implying that Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is not a field.\n\nNext, we consider c = 1. We have x^3 + x^2 + 1 = 0, an irreducible polynomial in Z_3[x]. Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a field for c = 1.\n\nFor c = 2, we get x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 = 0, which can be factored as (x + 1)(x^2 + x + 2) in Z_3.
