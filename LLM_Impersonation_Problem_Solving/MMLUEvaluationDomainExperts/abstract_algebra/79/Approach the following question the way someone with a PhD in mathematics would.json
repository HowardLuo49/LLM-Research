A subgroup is a subset of a group that is also a group under the same operation.\n\nStatement 1 says that if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian. This statement is true. This is because any subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group is also free abelian. This follows from the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups, which states that any finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups.\n\nStatement 2 says that if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian. This statement is false. The quotient group G / K may not necessarily be free abelian.
