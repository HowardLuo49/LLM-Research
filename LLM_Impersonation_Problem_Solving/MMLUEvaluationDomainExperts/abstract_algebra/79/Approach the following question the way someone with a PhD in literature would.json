Upon careful examination of the statements provided, I would analyze the definitions and properties of the terms involved.\n\nIn the first statement, it is stated that if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian. This statement aligns with the definition and properties of free abelian groups, as a subgroup of a free abelian group is also free abelian. Therefore, I would conclude that Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to the second statement, it states that if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian. This statement can also be supported by the properties of free abelian groups, as the factor group G / K of a free abelian group G by a nonzero subgroup K is also free abelian. Thus, I would conclude that Statement 2 is true as well.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my analysis and understanding of the properties of free abelian groups and subgroups, I would select option A: True, True as the correct answer to this question.",
