    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by analyzing the mathematical properties of subgroups in free abelian groups. \n\nLet's break down the statements: \n- Statement 1: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian. \n- Statement 2: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian.\n\nFirstly, we know that any subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian if and only if it is a direct summand. Therefore, Statement 1 is true. \n\nSecondly, if K is a subgroup of a free abelian group, then G/K is also free abelian. This is because the quotient of a free abelian group by a subgroup is again a free abelian group. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
