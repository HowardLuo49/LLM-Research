The ring is defined by addition and multiplication modulo 3. \n\nLet's consider the element (1, 1) in Z_3 x Z_3. Multiplying this element by 3 gives us (3, 3) = (0, 0) in Z_3 x Z_3, as we are working modulo 3. \n\nTherefore, the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x Z_3 is 3, making the correct answer B: 3.",
