    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand the concept of homomorphisms. In the context of algebra, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures. More specifically, in the case of groups, a homomorphism is a map that preserves the group operation.\n\nIn this case, we are asked about the number of homomorphisms from the integers (Z) to the integers modulo 2 (Z_2). Since Z is a group under addition and Z_2 is a group under addition modulo 2, a homomorphism f from Z to Z_2 must satisfy the property f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) for all integers a and b.\n\nNow, consider the group Z_2 = {0, 1} under addition modulo 2. There are two possible choices for the image of any integer in Z under a homomorphism to Z_2: it can be mapped to either 0 or 1. Let us calculate the number of homomorphisms.\n\nFor f(1), since f(1) = f(1+0) = f(1) + f(0), it follows that f(0) = 0. This means that f(2) = f(1+1) = f(1) + f(1) = 0 + 0 = 0. Continuing this pattern, we see that f(n) = 0 for all n in Z.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 homomorphism from Z to Z_2, which maps all integers in Z to 0 in Z_2. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 1",
