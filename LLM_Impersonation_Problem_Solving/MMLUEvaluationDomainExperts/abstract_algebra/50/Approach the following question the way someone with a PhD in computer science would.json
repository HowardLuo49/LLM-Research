A group is called solvable if it has a subnormal series where each factor group is abelian. It has been proven in group theory that every solvable group is of prime-power order.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. A group is said to have prime-power order if its order is a power of a prime number. It has been established in group theory that every group of prime-power order is solvable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A) True, True.",
