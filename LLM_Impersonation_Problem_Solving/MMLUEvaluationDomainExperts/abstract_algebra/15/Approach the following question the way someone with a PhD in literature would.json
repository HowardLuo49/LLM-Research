    "gpt_response": "This question pertains to the relationship between field theory and algebraic structures. Statement 1 is true, as a splitting field of a polynomial over Q is a field extension that contains all the roots of the polynomial and is generated by adjoining these roots to the base field Q. Therefore, R, being a splitting field of some polynomial over Q, is a valid statement.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, is false. The number of elements in a finite field of order q is given by q = p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. Therefore, a field with 60 elements would have to be a finite field of order 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, but no such field exists as a finite field of order 60 is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
