    "gpt_response": "A PhD in philosophy may approach this question by analyzing the concepts of field theory and polynomial theory as they pertain to mathematical logic. \n\nIn Statement 1, it is well-known in field theory that if a field extension R over the base field Q is a splitting field of some polynomial, then it contains all the roots of that polynomial. Therefore, if R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q, it must have a finite number of elements. This information supports the existence of a field with 60 elements as mentioned in Statement 2.\n\nFurthermore, in Statement 2, it is stated that there is a field with 60 elements. This is possible because there exist finite fields of prime power order, and it is known that a finite field has a power of a prime number of elements. Thus, there can exist a field with 60 elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C: True, False.",
