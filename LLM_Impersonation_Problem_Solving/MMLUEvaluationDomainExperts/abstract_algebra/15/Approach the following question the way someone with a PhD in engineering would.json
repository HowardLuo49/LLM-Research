    "gpt_response": "A PhD in engineering would likely approach this question from a mathematical perspective rather than an engineering perspective. \n\nStatement 1 is true because a splitting field of a polynomial is a field extension in which every polynomial in the base field splits into linear factors. If R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q, then it is true.\n\nStatement 2 is false. This is because there is no field with 60 elements. The number of elements in a finite field is always of the form q^n, where q is a prime power and n is a positive integer. Since 60 cannot be expressed in this form, there is no field with 60 elements. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
