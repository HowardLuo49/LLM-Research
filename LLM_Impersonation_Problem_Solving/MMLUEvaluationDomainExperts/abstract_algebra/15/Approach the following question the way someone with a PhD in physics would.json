    "gpt_response": "Statement 1 is true because a splitting field is defined as an extension field of a base field in which a given polynomial splits into linear factors. Therefore, if R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q, then Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 is false because there is no field with 60 elements. This is because the number of elements in a finite field must be of the form p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. Since 60 is not of this form, there cannot be a field with 60 elements. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
