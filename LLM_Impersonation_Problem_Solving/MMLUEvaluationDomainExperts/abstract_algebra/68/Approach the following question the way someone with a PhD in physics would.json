    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To factor the polynomial x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x], we first note that 4 is equivalent to -1 mod 5. Therefore, we have x^4 + 4 = x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) in Z_5[x]. \n\nNow, let's find the roots of x^2 + 1, x + 1, and x - 1 in Z_5. For x^2 + 1 = 0, we see that x^2 = 4 is equivalent to x = 2 or x = 3 in Z_5. Thus, x = 2, 3 are the roots of x^2 + 1. \n\nFor x + 1 = 0, we have x = 4 in Z_5. Therefore, x = 4 is the root of x + 1. \n\nFor x - 1 = 0, we have x = 1 in Z_5. Therefore, x = 1 is the root of x - 1. \n\nTherefore, the factorization of x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x] is (x \u2212 2)(x + 2)(x \u2212 1)(x + 1), which is option A.",
