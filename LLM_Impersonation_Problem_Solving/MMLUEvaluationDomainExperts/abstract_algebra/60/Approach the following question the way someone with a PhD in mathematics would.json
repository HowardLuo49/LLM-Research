    "gpt_response": "To analyze the first statement, we must consider the definition of a subring. A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring under the same operations. In particular, a subring must contain the same unity element as the ring itself in order for it to be closed under multiplication. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nRegarding the second statement, we need to understand the definitions of a field and an integral domain. A field is a commutative ring with multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements, while an integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. Every field is an integral domain because the property of having multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements implies that there are no zero divisors. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
