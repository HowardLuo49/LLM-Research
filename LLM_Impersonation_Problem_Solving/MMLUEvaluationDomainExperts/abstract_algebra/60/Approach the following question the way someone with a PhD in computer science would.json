The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring. This statement is true because the unity (or multiplicative identity) of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring because the unity is required to be preserved under subring operations.\n\n2. Every field is an integral domain. This statement is false because while every field is an integral domain, not every integral domain is a field. A field is a specific type of integral domain with additional properties such as having multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: True, False.",
