    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(\u221a2 + \u221a3) over Q, we first need to determine a basis for this field extension. \n\nLet \u03b1 = \u221a2 + \u221a3. Note that (\u03b1 - \u221a2)\u00b2 = 3, which means that \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, \u03b1\u00b2 - 2\u03b1 - 1 = 0. \n\nThis polynomial is irreducible over Q as it does not have rational roots. Therefore, Q(\u221a2 + \u221a3) = Q(\u03b1). \n\nNow, consider the basis {1, \u03b1} over Q. Any element in Q(\u03b1) can be represented as a linear combination of 1 and \u03b1. Therefore, the degree of Q(\u03b1) over Q is 2. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 2.",
