Statement 1 asserts that for any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism from G to G'. This statement is true based on the fundamental definition of a group homomorphism.\n\nA group homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. In other words, it maps the group elements in such a way that the group operation in the domain group is preserved in the codomain group. This assertion is a fundamental concept in group theory and is widely accepted.\n\nStatement 2 claims that every homomorphism is a one-to-one map. This statement is false. A homomorphism does not necessarily need to be one-to-one. In group theory, a one-to-one (injective) homomorphism is referred to as an isomorphism. Not all homomorphisms are isomorphisms, as there can be homomorphisms that map distinct elements of a group onto the same element in another group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: False, True.",
