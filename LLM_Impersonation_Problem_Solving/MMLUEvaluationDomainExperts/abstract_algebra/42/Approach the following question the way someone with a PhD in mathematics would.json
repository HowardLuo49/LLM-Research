A subgroup is a subset of a group that is also a group under the same operation.\n\nIn statement 1, it is given that some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.

An abelian group of order 45 can be decomposed into subgroups of order 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, or 45 by Lagrange's theorem, but not necessarily 10.\n\nStatement 2 deals with normal subgroups, which are subgroups that are invariant under conjugation by elements of the group.
