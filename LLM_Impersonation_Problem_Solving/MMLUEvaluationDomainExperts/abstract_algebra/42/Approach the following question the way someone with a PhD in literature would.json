    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I approach the given question by using my knowledge of abstract algebra and group theory. \n\nStatement 1 asserts that some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10. This statement is true, as it is a known fact in group theory that any group of prime-power order must have a subgroup of order equal to any divisor of its order. Therefore, for an abelian group of order 45, which can be factored as 3^2 * 5, it must have a subgroup of order 3 and a subgroup of order 5. \n\nStatement 2 states that a subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H. This statement is also true, as the defining property of a normal subgroup is that it is invariant under conjugation by elements of the group. This means that the left and right cosets of a normal subgroup will coincide, leading to an equal number of left and right cosets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
