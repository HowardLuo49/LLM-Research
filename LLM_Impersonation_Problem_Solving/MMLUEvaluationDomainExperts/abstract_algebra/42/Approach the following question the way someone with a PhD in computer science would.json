    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, we can approach this question by applying our knowledge of group theory. \n\nStatement 1 pertains to the existence of a subgroup of order 10 within an abelian group of order 45. Since 45 is not a prime number, the only groups of order 45 up to isomorphism are cyclic groups of order 45. Any cyclic group of order n contains a unique subgroup of order d for every divisor d of n. Therefore, it is true that some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10. \n\nStatement 2 relates to the normality of subgroups based on the equality of the number of left and right cosets. This statement is also true - a subgroup H of a group G is normal if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
