    "gpt_response": "An abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative, meaning the order in which elements are multiplied does not affect the result. In an abelian group of order 45, let's denote it as G, there exists a subgroup of order 10, denoted as H.\n\nFor Statement 1, it is true that some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10. This is because the number 45 can be factored into 3 * 3 * 5, and using the fundamental theorem of abelian groups, we know that abelian groups of order pq have subgroups of order p and q for any prime numbers p and q that divide the order of the group.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, a subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H. This is a fundamental property of normal subgroups and the definition of normality. Normal subgroups have the property that both left and right cosets are the same, leading to the equality mentioned in the statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True.",
