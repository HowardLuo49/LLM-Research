This implies that the condition of aH being a subgroup is contingent on the presence of a in H. However, the statement does not provide any information about the converse implication \u2013 whether the presence of a in H guarantees that aH is a subgroup of G. This lack of symmetry in the statement indicates that it is likely to be false.\n\nFor Statement 2, it claims that aH = bH if and only if ab is in H. This suggests that the equality of the sets aH and bH is determined by the product ab belonging to H. Again, this statement is asymmetric \u2013 it only considers one direction of implication and does not address the other implication. This lack of balance in the statement also signals that it is likely to be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the logical structure of the statements, my conclusion would be that both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are false.",
