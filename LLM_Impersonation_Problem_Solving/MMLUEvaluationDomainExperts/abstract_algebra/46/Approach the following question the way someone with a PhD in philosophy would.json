The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity element of the target group. An empty kernel would imply that no elements in the domain group map to the identity element in the target group.

This statement is false. While it is true that the image of a nontrivial homomorphism of a finite group into an infinite group cannot be the entire infinite group (as the image must be a subgroup of the target group), it is certainly possible to have such a homomorphism. The nontriviality of the homomorphism depends on the mapping of elements from the finite group to the infinite group, which can preserve the group operation without mapping all elements to the identity.\n\nIn conclusion, Statement 1 is true while Statement 2 is false.
