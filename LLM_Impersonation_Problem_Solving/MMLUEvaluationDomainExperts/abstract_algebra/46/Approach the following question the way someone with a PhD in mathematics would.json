    "gpt_response": "To address the first statement, we note that a homomorphism is a map between two algebraic structures that preserves the operations of the structures. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity element in the codomain. It is indeed possible for a homomorphism to have an empty kernel. For example, the trivial homomorphism from a group to itself always has an empty kernel. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nFor the second statement, we consider the definition of a homomorphism between groups. A homomorphism from a group G to a group H is a function f: G -> H that preserves the group operation. If the group G is finite and the group H is infinite, it is still possible to define a nontrivial homomorphism between them. For example, consider the group of integers under addition and the group of real numbers under addition. The map that sends every integer to 0 in the real numbers is a nontrivial homomorphism. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nIn summary, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
