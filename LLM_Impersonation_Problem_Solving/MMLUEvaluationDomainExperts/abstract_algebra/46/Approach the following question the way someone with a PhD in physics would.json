This statement is true, as a homomorphism may indeed have an empty kernel. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the identity element in the co-domain. If there are no elements in the domain that map to the identity element, then the kernel is empty.\n\nStatement 2 claims that it is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group. This statement is false. It is indeed possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. For example, consider the group of integers under addition and the group of real numbers under addition. The map that sends every element of the integers to the real number 1 is a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
