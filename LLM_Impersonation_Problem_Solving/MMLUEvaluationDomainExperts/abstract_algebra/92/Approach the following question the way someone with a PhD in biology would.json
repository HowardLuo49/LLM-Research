    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question from a mathematical perspective, specifically in terms of set theory and relation properties. \n\nAnalyzing the statements one by one:\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation. \nThis statement is false. While an equivalence relation and a partial ordering relation both satisfy the transitive property, an equivalence relation also satisfies the reflexive and symmetric properties, which are not necessarily satisfied by a partial ordering relation.\n\nB: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\nThis statement is also false. The number of relations from a set A with 3 elements to a set B with 2 elements can be calculated as 2^(3*2) = 64, not just 64. \n\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive\nThis statement is false. An empty relation cannot be reflexive because in order for a relation to be reflexive, every element in the set must be related to itself. In an empty relation, there are no elements to relate, so it cannot be reflexive.\n\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\nThis statement is false. The properties of a relation being symmetric and being unsymmetric are not opposites of each other. A symmetric relation means that for any elements (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is also in the relation. An unsymmetric relation means that if (a, b) is in the relation, it does not necessarily mean that (b, a) is also in the relation. \n\nTherefore, the only true statement out of the options presented is none of the above.",
