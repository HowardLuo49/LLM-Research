Which of the following statements is true?\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nB: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.",

    "gpt_response": "As a computer science expert with a PhD, I can analyze the given statements with precision.\n\nA: The statement \"Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation\" is false. While every partial-ordering relation is also a preorder (transitive and reflexive), not every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation because equivalence relations are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, while partial-ordering relations are reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.\n\nB: The number of relations from set A = {x, y, z} to set B = {1, 2} is calculated as 2^(n*m), where n is the number of elements in set A and m is the number of elements in set B. In this case, n=3, m=2, so the total number of relations is 2^(3*2) = 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the statement \"Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 64\" is true.\n\nC: The statement \"Empty relation _ is reflexive\" is false. An empty relation does not contain any elements and therefore cannot exhibit reflexivity, as it must have at least one element to relate to itself.\n\nD: The statement \"Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other\" is false. Symmetric relations are such that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) must also be in the relation. On the other hand, asymmetric relations are such that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) cannot be in the relation. These two properties are distinct and not simply negative versions of each other.\n\nIn summary, the correct statement among the given options is B: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2) is 64.",
