    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by breaking down each statement and determining its validity based on the definitions of equivalence relations, partial-ordering relations, the number of relations between sets, reflexivity of relations, and the properties of symmetry and antisymmetry.\n\nStatement A: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nThis statement is false. While every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation, not every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation. A partial-ordering relation must satisfy antisymmetry, while an equivalence relation does not necessarily have this property.\n\nStatement B: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\nTo determine the number of relations from a set A to a set B, we use the formula 2^(|A| * |B|), where |A| represents the number of elements in set A and |B| represents the number of elements in set B. In this case, |A| = 3 and |B| = 2, so the number of relations would be 2^(3*2) = 2^6 = 64. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement C: Empty relation _ is reflexive.\nAn empty relation is a relation that contains no elements, meaning it does not satisfy the reflexivity property of containing all elements from a set related to themselves. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStatement D: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\nThis statement is false. The properties of symmetry and antisymmetry are not negatives of each other. A relation being symmetric means that for any elements a and b in the relation, if a is related to b, then b is also related to a. In contrast, a relation being antisymmetric means that if a is related to b and b is related to a, then a = b. These properties are not opposites of each other.\n\nIn conclusion, statement B is true while statements A, C, and D are false.",
