    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by systematically evaluating each statement based on principles of mathematics and logic.\n\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nThis statement is false. An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A partial-ordering relation is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. While both types of relations share the property of transitivity, the other properties differ.\n\nB: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2), is 64.\nThe number of relations from a set A with m elements to a set B with n elements is 2^(m*n). In this case, A = {x, y, z} has 3 elements and B = {1, 2} has 2 elements, so the number of relations is 2^(3*2) = 64. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive.\nAn empty relation is a relation with no elements. For a relation to be reflexive, it must contain the identity element of the set it is defined on. Since the empty relation contains no elements, it cannot contain the identity element, and thus it cannot be reflexive. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being asymmetric are negative of each other.\nThis statement is false. The properties of a relation being symmetric and antisymmetric are not necessarily negative of each other. A relation can be symmetric, meaning for all a and b, if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is also in the relation. An antisymmetric relation is one where if (a, b) is in the relation and (b, a) is also in the relation, then a = b. These properties are not opposites of each other.",
