    "gpt_response": "A: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nThis statement is not true. While both equivalence relations and partial-ordering relations are types of binary relations, they have different properties. An equivalence relation must satisfy the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. A partial-ordering relation, on the other hand, must satisfy the properties of reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\n\nB: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2) is 64.\nIn this case, the statement is asking about the number of relations that can be formed from a set A with 3 elements to a set B with 2 elements. The number of relations that can be formed from a set with m elements to a set with n elements is given by 2^(m*n), where ^ denotes exponentiation. So, in this specific case, the number of relations that can be formed from A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2) would indeed be 2^(3*2) = 64. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive.\nThis statement is false. An empty relation is one where there are no pairs of elements related to each other. For a relation to be reflexive, every element in the set must be related to itself. Since there are no pairs of elements related in an empty relation, it cannot be reflexive.\n\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\nThis statement is not entirely accurate. Symmetry and asymmetry are indeed mutually exclusive properties of a relation. A relation is symmetric if, for every pair (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is also in the relation. A relation is asymmetric if, for every pair (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is not in the relation. However, it is more common to refer to the property as \"asymmetric\" rather than \"un-symmetric.\" Thus, the wording in this statement is not commonly used in the context of relations.",
