    "gpt_response": "In assessing the truth value of the statements presented, it is important to approach them with a critical and analytical mindset. Let us carefully consider each statement in turn:\n\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nAn equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A partial-ordering relation, on the other hand, is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. While it is true that every partial ordering relation is an equivalence relation, the inverse statement does not hold true. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\nB: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2), is 64.\nThe number of relations from a set A with n elements to a set B with m elements can be calculated as 2^(n*m). In this case, A has 3 elements and B has 2 elements, so the number of relations would be 2^(3*2) = 64. Therefore, statement B is true.\n\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive.\nA relation is reflexive if every element in the set is related to itself. An empty relation, by definition, does not contain any elements, and thus cannot satisfy the criterion for reflexivity. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being unsymmetric are negative of each other.\nThis statement is a bit ambiguous in its phrasing, but if we interpret \"unsymmetric\" to mean \"not symmetric,\" then the statement could be rephrased as \"the properties of a relation being symmetric and not being symmetric are negations of each other.\" This would indeed be true, as a relation either satisfies the symmetric property (aRb implies bRa) or it does not. Therefore, statement D is true.\n\nIn conclusion, statements B and D are true, while statements A and C are false.",
