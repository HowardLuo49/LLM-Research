This property simplifies the algebraic structure of the group and allows for certain conclusions to be drawn.\n\nGiven that the group G is known to be abelian, we can confidently eliminate options B, C, and D as potential answers. Option B suggests that g = g^2 for every g in G, which is not a valid statement for an abelian group. Option C introduces a property that does not necessarily hold for all abelian groups. Option D is related to the order of the group, which may or may not be finite for an abelian group. \n\nThis leaves us with option A: g = g^-1 for every g in G. In an abelian group, this statement is indeed true.
