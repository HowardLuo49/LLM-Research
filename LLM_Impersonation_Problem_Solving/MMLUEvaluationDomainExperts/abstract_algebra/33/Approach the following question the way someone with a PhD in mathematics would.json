    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics, the question can be approached by considering the properties of an abelian group.\n\nIn an abelian group, the operation is commutative, meaning that for all elements g, h in G, gh = hg. This property is the defining characteristic of an abelian group.\n\nOption A: In an abelian group, it is not necessarily true that g = g^-1 for every g in G. This property holds true for elements in a cyclic group or in a group of order 2, but not necessarily in an abelian group.\n\nOption B: Similarly, in an abelian group, it is not necessarily true that g = g^2 for every g in G. This property holds true in groups of order 2, but not in general in an abelian group.\n\nOption C: Given that G is an abelian group, we can determine the validity of this statement by expanding (g o h)^2 and g^2 o h^2 and comparing them. By the commutativity of the group operation, (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 is true in an abelian group.\n\nOption D: The statement that G is of finite order is not necessarily true just based on the fact that G is an abelian group. An abelian group can be of infinite order, so this option is not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, for an abelian group G, the correct statement from the options provided is C: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G.",
