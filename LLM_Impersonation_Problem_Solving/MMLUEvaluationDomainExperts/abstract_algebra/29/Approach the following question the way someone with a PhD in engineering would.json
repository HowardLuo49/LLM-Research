A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element, and an Abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative. \n\nBased on the definitions of a homomorphic image, a cyclic group, and an Abelian group, we can determine that Statement 1 | The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic is true. This is because if we take a homomorphic image of a cyclic group, the properties of the original group will be preserved, and therefore the resulting group will also be cyclic. \n\nFurthermore, Statement 2 | The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian is also true. This is because the commutative property of an Abelian group is preserved under homomorphisms, so the resulting group will also be Abelian. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A: True, True.",
