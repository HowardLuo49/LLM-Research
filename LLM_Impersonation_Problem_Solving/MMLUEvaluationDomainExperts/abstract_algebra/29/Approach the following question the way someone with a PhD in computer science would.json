If a group has a single generator, its homomorphic image will also have a single generator, making it cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nAn Abelian group is a group in which the order in which the elements are multiplied does not affect the result. In other words, the group operation is commutative. When a homomorphism is applied to an Abelian group, the resulting group will also have a commutative group operation, making it Abelian. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nCombining these explanations, we can conclude that both statements are true. Therefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
