    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the definitions and properties of cyclic groups and Abelian groups, as well as the concept of homomorphisms.\n\nA cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. This means that all elements of the group can be expressed as powers of a single element. In other words, if a group G is cyclic, there exists an element g such that G = {g, g^2, g^3, ...}. A homomorphic image of a group is obtained by applying a homomorphism, which is a map between two groups that preserves the group structure. In other words, if f: G -> H is a homomorphism between groups G and H, then f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a,b in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements:\n1. The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic: This statement is true. If G is a cyclic group generated by g, and f: G -> H is a homomorphism, then f(G) is a subgroup of H that is generated by f(g). Since f(g) can be expressed as powers of itself, f(G) is also cyclic.\n2. The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian: This statement is also true. If G is an Abelian group and f: G -> H is a homomorphism, then for all a,b in G, we have f(ab) = f(a)f(b) = f(b)f(a) = f(b)f(a). This means that f(G) is Abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA: True, True",
