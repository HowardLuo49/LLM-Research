    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I can apply my knowledge of group theory to address this question. \n\nStatement 1 is true. A cyclic group is a group generated by a single element, and the homomorphic image of a cyclic group under a homomorphism is also generated by the image of the generator of the original group. This implies that the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. An Abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative. When a homomorphism is applied to an Abelian group, the image of the group operation will still be commutative, preserving the property of being Abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
