This can be proven by considering that the image of a homomorphism is a subgroup of the codomain group, and any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.\n\nStatement 2 claims that the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian. This statement is also true. Since the group operation is preserved under homomorphisms, if the original group is Abelian (meaning its group operation is commutative), then the homomorphic image will also have a commutative group operation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
