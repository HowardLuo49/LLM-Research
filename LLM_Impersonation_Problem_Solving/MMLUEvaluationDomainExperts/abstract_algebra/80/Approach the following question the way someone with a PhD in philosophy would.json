This statement is a well-known result in group theory, specifically in the context of the direct product of groups. The direct product of two cyclic groups is indeed cyclic, as it is a fundamental property of cyclic groups and their direct product.\n\nStatement 2 posits that the external direct product of the dihedral group of order 3 (D_3) and the dihedral group of order 4 (D_4) is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 12 (D_12). This statement involves the concept of group isomorphism, which is a fundamental concept in group theory. \n\nUpon reflection and examination of the two statements, I can confidently confirm that Statement 1 is true. Additionally, Statement 2 is false. The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 does not result in a group isomorphic to D_12. \n\nTherefore, my philosophical analysis leads me to the conclusion that the correct answer is C: True, False.",
