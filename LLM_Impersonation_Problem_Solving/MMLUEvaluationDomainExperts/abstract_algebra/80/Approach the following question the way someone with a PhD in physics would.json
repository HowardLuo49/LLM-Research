    "gpt_response": "To address the statement that the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic, we need to consider the properties of cyclic groups and their external direct product. A cyclic group is a group generated by a single element, and any group that is generated by a single element is itself cyclic. When taking the external direct product of cyclic groups, the resulting group is also cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, which asserts that the external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12, we need to examine the properties of the dihedral groups involved. The dihedral group D_n is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. In this case, D_3 is the dihedral group of order 6, and D_4 is the dihedral group of order 8. The external direct product of these groups is not isomorphic to D_12, as D_12 is the dihedral group of order 24 corresponding to the symmetries of a regular dodecagon. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
