    "gpt_response": "To address this question, let's first define some terms. The external direct product of two groups G and H, denoted as G x H, is the set of all possible ordered pairs (g, h) where g is an element of G and h is an element of H. The operation on G x H is defined component-wise, meaning (g1, h1) * (g2, h2) = (g1 * g2, h1 * h2) for all g1, g2 in G and h1, h2 in H.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\nThis statement is true. If G and H are cyclic groups of order m and n respectively, then G x H is isomorphic to Zmn, the cyclic group of order mn. Therefore, the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12.\nThis statement is false. The dihedral group D_n is defined as the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. The order of D_3 is 6 and the order of D_4 is 8. The order of the external direct product of D_3 and D_4 would be 6 * 8 = 48, which is not isomorphic to D_12.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
