This statement is true because a characteristic of 0 implies that the multiplication of any nonzero element by 0 is always zero, leading to an infinite number of distinct elements within the domain.\n\nStatement 2 states that every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite. This statement is false because in an integral domain with prime characteristic, the subring generated by the multiplicative identity is a field, and fields are infinite by definition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
