    "gpt_response": "A PhD in philosophy would likely approach this question by analyzing the definitions of integral domain, characteristic, prime characteristic, and the implications of each in the context of the statements provided.\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors. The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n * 1 = 0 (where 1 is the multiplicative identity in the ring). A prime characteristic is a characteristic that is a prime number.\n\nStatement 1 claims that every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite. This is because if the characteristic is 0, the multiplicative identity 1 is not equal to 0, and therefore there are infinitely many distinct elements in the integral domain.\n\nStatement 2 claims that every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite. This is because in a ring with prime characteristic p, p * 1 = 0, and therefore the ring only has p elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., p-1.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is true.
