This directly implies that there exists a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n.\n\nStatement 2, on the other hand, is false. The order of an element a in a group may not necessarily divide the order of the group G. For example, consider the group Z6 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} under addition modulo 6.
