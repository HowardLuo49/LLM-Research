In the case of Z_7, which is a finite field with 7 elements, we need to find an element that, when raised to various powers mod 7, produces all non-zero elements in the field.\n\nTo find the generator, we start by testing each element in the field raised to different powers:\n\n1^1 mod 7 = 1\n1^2 mod 7 = 1\n1^3 mod 7 = 1\n...\n\n2^1 mod 7 = 2\n2^2 mod 7 = 4\n2^3 mod 7 = 1\n2^4 mod 7 = 2\n2^5 mod 7 = 4\n...\n\n3^1 mod 7 = 3\n3^2 mod 7 = 2\n3^3 mod 7 = 6\n3^4 mod 7 = 4\n3^5 mod 7 = 5\n...\n\n4^1 mod 7 = 4\n4^2 mod 7 = 2\n4^3 mod 7 = 1\n4^4 mod 7 = 4\n...\n\nBy testing the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can see that the element 3 is a generator for the finite field Z_7.
