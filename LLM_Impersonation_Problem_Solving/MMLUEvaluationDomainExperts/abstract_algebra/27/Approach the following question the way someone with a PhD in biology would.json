    "gpt_response": "To determine whether the polynomial 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q, we need to find a prime number p such that all the coefficients of the polynomial except for the leading coefficient are divisible by p^2, and the leading coefficient is not divisible by p^2 but is divisible by p.\n\nUpon inspection, we can see that the prime number p=3 satisfies these conditions. The coefficients of the polynomial are 8, 6, -9, and 24. All coefficients except the leading coefficient (8) are divisible by 3^2=9, and the leading coefficient is divisible by 3 but not by 3^2.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q with p=3.
