The order of a permutation is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n\nFor n = 10, the maximum possible order for an element of S_10 can be achieved by considering the permutation that consists of cycles of lengths 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2. This permutation can be written as (1 2)(3 4)(5 6)(7 8)(9 10). The LCM of the lengths of these cycles is LCM(2, 2, 2, 2, 2) = 2.2.2.2.2 = 32.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible order for an element of S_10 is 32.
