    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze each statement separately. \n\nStatement 1: To determine if the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} forms a group under multiplication modulo n, we need to check the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse existence. \n\n1. Closure: The set is closed under multiplication modulo n because for any two elements a and b in the set, a*b mod n is also in the set. \n2. Associativity: Multiplication modulo n is associative, so this condition holds. \n3. Identity element: The identity element for multiplication modulo n is 1, which is in the set. \n4. Inverse existence: For every element a in the set (except 0), there exists an inverse b such that (a*b) mod n = 1. \n\nTherefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: To determine if there is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100. This is equivalent to solving the congruence 63x \u2261 1 (mod 100).
