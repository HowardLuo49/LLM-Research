    "gpt_response": "To address the first statement, we must verify the four group axioms for the given set {1, 2, ..., n-1} under multiplication modulo n. The group axioms are closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element.\n\n1. Closure: For any two elements a, b in the set, their product (a * b mod n) is still within the set. This is true for multiplication modulo n, as the result will always be between 1 and n-1.\n\n2. Associativity: Multiplication modulo n is associative. This property holds for any set.\n\n3. Identity Element: The identity element for multiplication modulo n is 1. In this set, 1 serves as the identity element, as 1 * a = a * 1 = a mod n for all a in the set.\n\n4. Inverse Element: In a group, for every element a, there exists an element b such that a * b = b * a = 1. For each element a in this set, an inverse element can be found such that a * b mod n = b * a mod n = 1, satisfying the requirement for being a group.\n\nThe first statement is true based on the verification of the group axioms.\n\nMoving on to the second statement, we are asked whether there exists an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. This statement is equivalent to asking if the number 63 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 100.\n\nTo determine this, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd(63, 100) and check if it is equal to 1. If it is, then 63 does have a multiplicative inverse modulo 100, and statement 2 is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nCombining the analysis of both statements, the correct choice is C: True, False.",
