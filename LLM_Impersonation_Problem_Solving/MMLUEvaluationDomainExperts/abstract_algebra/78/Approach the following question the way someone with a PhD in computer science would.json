    "gpt_response": "To address statement 1, it is important to note that in order for a set to be considered a group under a given operation, it must satisfy certain properties such as closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses for each element. In this case, the given set {1,2, ..., n-1} is indeed a group under multiplication modulo n for any n that is greater than 1. This is because multiplication modulo n always results in a value within the set {1,2, ..., n-1}, and the other group properties are preserved. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to statement 2, we are tasked with determining if there exists an integer x such that 63x is congruent to 1 modulo 100. This can be rephrased as asking whether there exists an integer x such that 63x = 1 + 100k for some integer k. This essentially boils down to solving a linear congruence of the form ax \u2261 b (mod m), where a = 63, b = 1, and m = 100. To address this, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100. Through this process, it can be determined that there indeed exists an integer x such that 63x is congruent to 1 modulo 100. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we conclude that the correct answer is A: True, True.",
