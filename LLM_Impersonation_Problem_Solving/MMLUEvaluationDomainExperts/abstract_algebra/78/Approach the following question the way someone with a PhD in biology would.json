    "gpt_response": "To determine the validity of Statement 1, we must consider the properties of groups. A group must satisfy four fundamental properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element. In the set {1,2, ..., n-1} under multiplication modulo n, closure is satisfied because the product of two elements will still be within the set. Associativity is also satisfied because multiplication is inherently associative. The identity element is 1 because multiplying any element by 1 will result in the same element. Finally, every element in the set has an inverse, as for any element x, the modular multiplicative inverse is given by x^(n-2) modulo n. Therefore, Statement 1 is indeed true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, we are asked to determine if there exists an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. This statement pertains to modular arithmetic and the existence of a multiplicative modular inverse. To find x, we need to solve the equation 63x \u2261 1 (mod 100). This equation is equivalent to finding the multiplicative modular inverse of 63 modulo 100. This involves solving for x in the equation 63x + 100y = 1. Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find that the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100 is 67. Therefore, there exists an integer x (67) such that 63x mod 100 = 1. Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
