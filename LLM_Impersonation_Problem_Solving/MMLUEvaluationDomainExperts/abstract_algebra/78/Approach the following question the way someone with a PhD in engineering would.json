    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing the two statements provided. \n\nStatement 1 states that the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n for n > 1. In order for a set to form a group under multiplication modulo n, it must satisfy the following properties: closure (the product of any two elements in the set is also in the set), associativity (the product is independent of the way the elements are grouped), identity element (there exists an element such that multiplying it with any element in the set results in the same element), and invertibility (every element has an inverse within the set). \n\nUpon further analysis, it can be concluded that the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} satisfies all the properties of a group under multiplication modulo n for n > 1, making Statement 1 true.\n\nStatement 2 states that there is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. In order for this statement to be true, x must be the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100. In other words, x must be such that when multiplied by 63 modulo 100, the result is 1. \n\nUpon solving the congruence equation 63x \u2261 1 (mod 100), we find that the solution is x = 47. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
