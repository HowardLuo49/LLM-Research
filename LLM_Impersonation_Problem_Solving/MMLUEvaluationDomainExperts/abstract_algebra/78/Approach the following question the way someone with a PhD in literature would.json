    "gpt_response": "As a literature PhD, I must approach this question with a careful and analytical mind, even though it involves mathematical and logical reasoning that may not be my area of expertise.\n\nStatement 1 discusses the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} and its group structure under multiplication modulo n. A group is a mathematical structure that satisfies certain properties such as closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses. In this case, {1, 2, ..., n-1} is said to form a group under multiplication modulo n for n > 1. This statement appears to be true based on the definition of a group.\n\nStatement 2 states that there exists an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. This involves modular arithmetic, where the remainder of a division operation is considered. The statement asserts the existence of an integer x that, when multiplied by 63 and divided by 100, leaves a remainder of 1. This statement is also likely to be true since modular arithmetic allows for such solutions to exist.\n\nTherefore, from my understanding of the statements and their mathematical implications, I would say that the correct answer is A: True, True.",
