    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I may not be an expert in linear algebra, but I can still analyze the question posed. \n\nTo determine the truth of the statements, we need to consider the properties of the given matrix A and the information provided in the form of the characteristic polynomial det(A - \u03bbI).\n\nFrom the characteristic polynomial det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3, we can deduce the eigenvalues by setting the polynomial to zero:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3 = 0\n\nBy examining the factors of this polynomial, we can see that it can be factored as follows: -(\u03bb - 1)(\u03bb + 1)(\u03bb - 3) = 0\n\nThis indicates that the eigenvalues of matrix A are 1, -1, and 3.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements:\n\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal. In this case, since A is a 3x3 matrix, the trace of A is the sum of its three diagonal elements. It is not clear from the information provided whether the sum of the diagonal elements is 3, so statement I cannot be definitively determined to be true or false based solely on the given information.\n\nII. The determinant of A is -3.\nThe determinant of a matrix is given by the constant term in its characteristic polynomial when expanded. In this case, the constant term is -3, indicating that the determinant of A is indeed -3. Therefore, statement II is true.\n\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues -3 and 1.\nAs derived earlier, the eigenvalues of matrix A are 1, -1, and 3. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given information and calculations, only statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is B: II only.",
