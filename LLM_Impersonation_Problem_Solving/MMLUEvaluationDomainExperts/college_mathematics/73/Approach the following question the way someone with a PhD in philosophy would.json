Suppose A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix such that det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, where I is the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix. Which of the following are TRUE of A?\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nII. The determinate of A is \u22123.\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues \u22123 and 1.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To determine which statements are true of matrix A, we must first find the eigenvalues of the matrix by solving the characteristic equation det(A - \u03bbI) = 0. The characteristic polynomial is given by -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3.\n\nSetting this polynomial equal to zero and solving for \u03bb, we find the roots to be \u03bb = -3, 1, and 1. Therefore, statement III is true as matrix A has eigenvalues of -3 and 1.\n\nNext, we can calculate the trace of A by summing the diagonal elements of the matrix. The trace of a matrix is equivalent to the sum of its eigenvalues. Therefore, the trace of A would be -3 + 1 + 1 = -1, not 3 as stated in statement I. Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the determinant of matrix A. The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Therefore, the determinant of A would be -3 * 1 * 1 = -3, not -3 as stated in statement II. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the only true statement about matrix A is statement III. Therefore, the correct answer is C: III only.",
