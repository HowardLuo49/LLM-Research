The trace of A is 3.\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. Since the eigenvalues are -1, 1, and 3, the sum of the eigenvalues (trace) is -1 + 1 + 3 = 3. Therefore, statement I is true.\n\nII. The determinant of A is -3.\nThe determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Since the eigenvalues are -1, 1, and 3, their product is -1 * 1 * 3 = -3. Therefore, statement II is true.\n\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues -3 and 1.\nHowever, the eigenvalues of A are -1, 1, and 3, not -3 and 1. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
