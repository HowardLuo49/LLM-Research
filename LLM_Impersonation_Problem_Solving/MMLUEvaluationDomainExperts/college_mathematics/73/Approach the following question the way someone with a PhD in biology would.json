Suppose A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix such that det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, where I is the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix. Which of the following are TRUE of A?\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nII. The determinate of A is \u22123.\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues \u22123 and 1.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the statements are true, we need to analyze the characteristic polynomial det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3. This polynomial represents the eigenvalues of matrix A.\n\nBy comparing the characteristic polynomial to the standard form of a characteristic polynomial, we can see that the coefficients correspond to the trace and the determinant of A. Specifically, the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues and is represented by the coefficient of \u03bb^2 in the characteristic polynomial (in this case, 3), and the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues and is the constant term in the characteristic polynomial (in this case, -3).\n\nTherefore, statement I is true because the trace of A is 3. Statement II is false because the determinant of A is -3, not -3. Statement III is not definitively true or false based on the information given, as there could be other eigenvalues present in matrix A. Therefore, the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
