    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in literature, we would use our expertise in analyzing and interpreting complex texts to break down the problem logically and methodically.\n\nFirst, let's consider statement I. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then any matrix X in M(V) can be diagonalized with respect to this basis. This means that X commutes with T, since T only acts by scalar multiplication on these eigenvectors. Therefore, U would consist of all matrices in M(V) that commute with T, which is the set of all matrices in M(V). So, statement I is true.\n\nNext, let's consider statement II. The dimension of U is the space of all matrices that commute with T, which is the space of all matrices in M(V). So dim(U) = n^2. W consists of all matrices of the form TX - XT for X in M(V). This can be thought of as the space of all matrices that can be written as commutators of T, where the commutator of two matrices A and B is defined as AB - BA. Since every matrix in M(V) can be written as a linear combination of commutators, dim(W) = n^2. Therefore, dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2 + n^2 = 2n^2, which is not necessarily equal to n^2. So, statement II is false.\n\nLastly, let's consider statement III. Since dim(U) = n^2, it follows that dim(U) is not less than n. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis above, the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
