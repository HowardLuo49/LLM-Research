Call the set of matrices from V into itself M(V). Let T be in M(V). Consider the two subspaces U = {X \u2208 M(V) : TX = XT} and W = {TX \u2212 XT : X \u2208 M(V)}. Which of the following must be TRUE?\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).\nII. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\nIII. dim (U) < n\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To analyze this question, we will first consider the properties of the subspaces U and W.\n\nThe subspace U consists of matrices X such that TX = XT. This means that X commutes with T, which is a characteristic property of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Therefore, if V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then any matrix X in M(V) will satisfy TX = XT, making U equal to M(V). This establishes that statement I must be TRUE.\n\nOn the other hand, the subspace W is defined as {TX \u2212 XT : X \u2208 M(V)}. This means that W consists of all matrices of the form TX \u2212 XT, where X ranges over all matrices in M(V). Since the dimension of M(V) is n^2, the dimension of W must also be n^2.\n\nNow, we can examine statement II: dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2. Since dim (U) = n^2 and dim (W) = n^2, the sum of their dimensions is indeed equal to n^2. Therefore, statement II must be TRUE as well.\n\nFinally, statement III asserts that dim (U) < n. From our previous analysis, we have determined that dim (U) = n^2, which is greater than n. Therefore, statement III is FALSE.\n\nIn conclusion, statements I and II are both TRUE, while statement III is FALSE. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: I and II only.",
