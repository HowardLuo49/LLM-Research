Call the set of matrices from V into itself M(V). Let T be in M(V). Consider the two subspaces U = {X \u2208 M(V) : TX = XT} and W = {TX \u2212 XT : X \u2208 M(V)}. Which of the following must be TRUE?\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).\nII. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\nIII. dim (U) < n\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in biology, one would need to have a solid understanding of linear algebra concepts and be able to apply them to the given scenario. Specifically, one would need to understand vector spaces, matrices, subspaces, and dimensions.\n\nFirstly, if V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then the matrix T is diagonalizable. In this case, T commutes with all matrices in M(V) and therefore U = M(V), making statement I true.\n\nSecondly, the dimension of U is equal to the dimension of the centralizer of T, which is the set of all matrices that commute with T. This is known as the commutant of T. The dimension of the commutant of T plus the dimension of W is equal to the total dimension of M(V), which is n^2. Therefore, statement II is also true.\n\nLastly, the dimension of U may be less than n if the centralizer of T is lower dimensional. Therefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nCombining all the information, statements I and II must be true, so the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
