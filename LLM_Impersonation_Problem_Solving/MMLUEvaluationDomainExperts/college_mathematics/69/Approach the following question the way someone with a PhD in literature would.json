    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which day of the week it will be 10^(10^(10)) days from now, we need to consider that there are a total of 7 days in a week. Therefore, any multiple of 7 days will bring us back to the same day of the week.\n\nConsidering that 10^(10^(10)) is an astronomically large number, the remainder when dividing by 7 will determine which day of the week it will be. In this case, we can simplify the problem by working with the exponential tower from the inside out.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression, 10^10 is equivalent to 10 billion. Dividing 10 billion by 7 gives a remainder of 3. Therefore, 10^(10) days from now will be 3 days from today, which will be Saturday.\n\nMoving to the next level of the exponential tower, we calculate 10^3, which is 1000. Dividing 1000 by 7 gives a remainder of 6. Therefore, 10^(10^(10)) days from now will be 6 days from Saturday, which is Monday.\n\nIn conclusion, 10^(10^(10)) days from today will fall on a Monday. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Monday.",
