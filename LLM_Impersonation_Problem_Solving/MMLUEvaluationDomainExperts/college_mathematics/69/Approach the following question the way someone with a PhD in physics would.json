    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which day of the week it will be 10^(10^(10)) days from now, we must first note that the day of the week repeats in a cycle of 7 days. Therefore, we can reduce 10^(10^(10)) modulo 7 to find the day of the week.\n\nSince 10^(10) is a very large number, taking it modulo 7 will simplify the problem. We know that 10 mod 7 is equal to 3, so 10^(10) mod 7 will also be equal to 3. Therefore, 10^(10^(10)) mod 7 = 10^3 mod 7.\n\nFurther simplifying, 10^3 mod 7 = 1000 mod 7 = 6. \n\nTherefore, the day of the week 10^(10^(10)) days from now will be 6 days after Wednesday, which is Tuesday. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: Tuesday",
