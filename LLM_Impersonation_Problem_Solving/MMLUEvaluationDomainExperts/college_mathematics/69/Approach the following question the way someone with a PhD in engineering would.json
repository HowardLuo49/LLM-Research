Each week consists of 7 days, so after every multiple of 7 days, the day of the week repeats itself.\n\nSince 10^(10^(10)) is an extremely large number, we can simplify the problem by taking the exponent modulo 7. This is equivalent to finding the remainder when dividing 10^(10^(10)) by 7.\n\n10^(10^(10)) mod 7 = (10^(10^(10) mod 6)) mod 7 = (10^4) mod 7 = 6\n\nTherefore, 10^(10^(10)) days from today will be 6 days from now, which corresponds to Sunday.
