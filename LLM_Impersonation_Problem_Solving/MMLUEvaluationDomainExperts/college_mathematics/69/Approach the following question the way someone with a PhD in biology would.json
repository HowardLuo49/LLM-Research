    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week 10^(10^(10)) days from now, we must consider the cyclical nature of the days of the week. Each week is composed of 7 days, so we can simplify 10^(10^(10)) by finding the remainder when divided by 7.\n\n10^(10^(10)) = 10^(10000000000) = 10^9999999990\n\nNow, it is well known that the remainder when a number is divided by 7 is the same as the remainder when the sum of the digits is divided by 7. In this case, the sum of the digits of 9999999990 is 9, which leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7.\n\nTherefore, 10^(10^(10)) days from now will be 2 days from Wednesday, which corresponds to Friday. \nSo, the correct answer is not listed, but we now know that the day will be Friday.",
