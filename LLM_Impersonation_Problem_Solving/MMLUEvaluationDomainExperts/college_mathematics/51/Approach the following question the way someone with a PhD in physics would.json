    "gpt_response": "To determine for which values of p the norm ||x||_p is expressible as an inner product, we must consider the definition of an inner product and the properties of the various p-norms.\n\nAn inner product on a vector space V is a bilinear, symmetric, positive definite form that satisfies certain properties such as linearity in the first argument, positive-definiteness, and the property that the inner product of a vector with itself is non-negative.\n\nThe p-norm of a vector x, denoted as ||x||_p, is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the vector components raised to the power of p, and then taking the pth root of the result.\n\nGiven these definitions, it can be shown that for p = 2, the p-norm ||x||_2 can be expressed as an inner product of the vector x with itself, specifically as <x, x> = x^T * x.\n\nFor p = 1, ||x||_1 does not satisfy the properties of an inner product due to the lack of symmetry in the absolute values of the vector components.\n\nFor p = infinity, ||x||_infinity also does not satisfy the properties of an inner product as it does not result in a positive definite form.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2, for which the norm ||x||_p is expressible as an inner product.",
