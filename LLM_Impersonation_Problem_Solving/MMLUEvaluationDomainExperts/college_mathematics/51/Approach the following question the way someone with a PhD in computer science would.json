In standard Euclidean space, the inner product is defined as:\n\n<x, y> = x^T y\n\nwhere x^T denotes the transpose of vector x.\n\nIn order for the norm ||x||_p to be expressable as an inner product, we must have a function f such that:\n\n||x||_p = f(<x, x>)\n\nBy substituting the definitions of the p-norm and inner product, we get:\n\n(||x||_p)^p = f(x^T x)\n\nUsing the definition of the p-norm and inner product, we can infer that the only p value for which the above equation holds true is when p=2, which corresponds to option B.
