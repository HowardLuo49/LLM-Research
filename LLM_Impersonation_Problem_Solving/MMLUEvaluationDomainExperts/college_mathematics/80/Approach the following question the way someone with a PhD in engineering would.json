The cardinality of the set of real numbers is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, which is denoted by c and represents the same cardinality as the set of all subsets of natural numbers.

This cardinality is greater than the cardinality of the set of real numbers or the set of functions from Z to Z.\n\nSet D represents the set of all finite subsets of the set of real numbers (R). The cardinality of this set is less than the cardinality of the set of real numbers because it consists of countably infinite subsets.\n\nTherefore, the set with the greatest cardinality among the options given is set C, the set of all functions from R to {0,1}.",
