I would begin by noting that the classification of finite simple groups provides a deep insight into the possible groups of prime order.\n\nFor prime numbers, by Lagrange's theorem, any group of prime order must be cyclic. Therefore, there is only one group of order n (up to isomorphism) for n = 3, 5, 7, and 11. This is because these numbers are primes, and hence the only possible groups of that order are cyclic groups.\n\nHowever, for the integers 9, 4, 6, 8, and 10, there exist multiple non-isomorphic groups of those orders. For example, for n = 4, there are non-isomorphic groups of order 4, such as the cyclic group of order 4 and the Klein four-group. Similarly, for n = 6 there are non-isomorphic groups such as the cyclic group of order 6 and the dihedral group of order 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is C: For 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 only.",
