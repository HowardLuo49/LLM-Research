    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integers k for which k! ends in exactly 99 zeros, we need to first consider the factors that contribute to the number of trailing zeros in a factorial.\n\nIn a factorial k!, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 10 in k! Since 10 = 2 * 5, the number of factors of 10 in a factorial depends on the number of factors of 2 and 5 in the factorial.\n\nIt is well known that the number of factors of 2 in the factorial is always greater than the number of factors of 5. Therefore, to determine the number of trailing zeros in k!, we only need to consider the number of factors of 5 in k!.\n\nEach multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor of 5, multiples of 125 contribute another factor of 5, and so on.\n\nTo end in exactly 99 zeros, we need at least 99 factors of 5 in k!. So, let's find how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, 625, and 3125 are present in k! for various values of k.\n\nFor k = 100, we have 100/5 + 100/25 + 100/125 + 100/625 + 100/3125 = 20 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 24 factors of 5.\n\nFor k = 200, we have 200/5 + 200/25 + 200/125 + 200/625 + 200/3125 = 40 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 48 factors of 5.\n\nFor k = 300, we have 300/5 + 300/25 + 300/125 + 300/625 + 300/3125 = 60 + 12 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 74 factors of 5.\n\nFor k = 400, we have 400/5 + 400/25 + 400/125 + 400/625 + 400/3125 = 80 + 16 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 100 factors of 5.\n\nFor k = 500, we have 500/5 + 500/25 + 500/125 + 500/625 + 500/3125 = 100 + 20 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 124 factors of 5.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 5 positive integers k (namely 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500) for which the ordinary decimal representation of k! ends in exactly 99 zeros. The correct answer is D: Five.",
