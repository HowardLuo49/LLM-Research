    "gpt_response": "When determining the number of zeros at the end of the decimal representation of a factorial k!, we need to consider the prime factors of 10, which are 2 and 5. The number of zeros is determined by the number of times 10 divides the factorial, which is equivalent to the number of times 5 and 2 appear as factors in the factorial. Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in the prime factorization of k!, the number of zeros is ultimately dictated by the number of 5s in the prime factorization.\n\nTo find the number of zeros at the end of k!, we can divide k by powers of 5 and sum up the quotients. However, the number of zeros at the end of k! will be equal to the number of occurrences of the factor 5 in the prime factorization of k, so we can simply count the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to k. \n\nIn this case, we are interested in finding the number of positive integers k for which the decimal representation of k! ends in exactly 99 zeros. Since each factor of 5 in k! contributes to a zero at the end of the decimal representation, the number of 5s in the prime factorization of k! must be at least 99. Therefore, we need to find the maximum value of k such that it contains at least 99 factors of 5 in its prime factorization. \n\nSince the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to k is given by \u230ak/5\u230b, we need to find the maximum value of k such that \u230ak/5\u230b \u2265 99. Solving this inequality, we find k \u2265 495. Therefore, the number of positive integers k for which the decimal representation of the integer k! ends in exactly 99 zeros is 5 - (495/5) = 5 - 99 = -94, which is not a positive integer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: None.",
