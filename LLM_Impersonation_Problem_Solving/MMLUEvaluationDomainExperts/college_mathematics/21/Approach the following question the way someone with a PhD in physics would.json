    "gpt_response": "To determine how many positive integers k result in exactly 99 zeros in the decimal representation of k!, we must consider the prime factorization of 10 and the prime factorization of k!. \n\nIn the decimal representation of k!, a zero is created by a factor of 2 and a factor of 5.
