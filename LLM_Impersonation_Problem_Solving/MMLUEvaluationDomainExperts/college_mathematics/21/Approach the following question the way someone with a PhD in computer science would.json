    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To analyze how many positive integers, k, result in k! ending in exactly 99 zeros, we must consider the factors that contribute to the number of zeros in the factorial k!. The number of zeros at the end of k! is determined by the number of pairs of factors 2*5 in the prime factorization of k!\n\nSince factors of 10 contribute to zeros at the end of a number, we need to look carefully at the prime factorizations of the numbers in question. The number of factors 2 in the prime factorization of k! will always be greater than or equal to the number of factors 5. Therefore, we only need to examine the power of 5 in the prime factorization of k!.\n\nTo end in exactly 99 zeros means that we need a total of 99 factors of 5 in the prime factorization of k!. Thus, we need to determine how many positive integers k result in a prime factorization containing at least 99 factors of 5.\n\nWe know that every 5th positive integer is divisible by 5. Therefore, the number of multiples of 5 in the factorial must be greater than or equal to 99. Let's calculate this:\n\nk/5 + k/25 + k/125 + k/625 + ... >= 99\n\nFrom this inequality, we can calculate the value of k that satisfies this condition. Since this calculation may result in a non-integer value for k, it signifies that there are no positive integers k where k! ends in exactly 99 zeros.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: None.",
