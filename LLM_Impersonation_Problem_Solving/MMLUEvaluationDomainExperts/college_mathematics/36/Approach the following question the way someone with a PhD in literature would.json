    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, we need to calculate the slope of the tangent line at that point. \n\nThe slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point is given by the derivative of the function at that point. So, we find the derivative of y = x + e^x with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = d/dx(x) + d/dx(e^x) = 1 + e^x\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at x = 0:\n\ndy/dx |x=0 = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is 2. The equation of a line with slope m passing through the point (0, f(0)) is given by y = mx + f(0).\n\nSubstitute m = 2 and f(0) = 0 + e^0 = 1 into the equation:\n\ny = 2x + 1\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x + 1. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: y = 2x + 1.",
