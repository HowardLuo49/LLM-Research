    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, we must first find the derivative of the function y = x + e^x. The derivative of y with respect to x will give us the slope of the tangent line at any given point.\n\nThe derivative of y = x + e^x with respect to x is dy/dx = 1 + e^x.\n\nSubstitute x = 0 into the derivative to find the slope at x = 0:\ndy/dx = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, at x = 0, the slope of the tangent line is 2. The equation of a line can be written in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line. Therefore, the correct equation among the options is the linear equation y = 2x + b. \n\nTo determine the y-intercept 'b', substitute the point (0, 0) into the equation:\n0 = 2(0) + b\n0 = 0 + b\nb = 0\n\nThus, the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x. Therefore, the correct answer is B: y = 2x.",
