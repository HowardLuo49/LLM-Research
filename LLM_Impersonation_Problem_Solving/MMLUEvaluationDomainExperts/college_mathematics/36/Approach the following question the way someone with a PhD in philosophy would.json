    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, one must first calculate the derivative of the function y = x + e^x with respect to x. \n\nThe derivative of y = x + e^x with respect to x is given by y' = 1 + e^x. Evaluating this derivative at x = 0 gives y' = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nThus, the slope of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is 2. In slope-intercept form, the equation of a line with slope m passing through the point (x_1, y_1) is given by y = m(x - x_1) + y_1. \n\nPlugging in the values m = 2 and (x_1, y_1) = (0, 0) into the equation, we get y = 2(x - 0) + 0 = 2x. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: y = 2x.",
