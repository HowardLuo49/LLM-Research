    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at that point. The slope of the tangent line is equal to the derivative of y with respect to x evaluated at x = 0.\n\nThe derivative of y = x + e^x is y' = 1 + e^x. \n\nEvaluating y' at x = 0 gives y'(0) = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is 2.\n\nThe equation of a line tangent to a curve at a given point is given by y = mx + c, where m is the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept.\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x + c. \n\nTo find the value of c, we substitute x = 0 into the original equation: y = x + e^x. \n\ny = 0 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the y-coordinate of the point where the tangent line touches the graph is y = 1.\n\nSubstitute this point (0, 1) and the slope m = 2 into the equation y = mx + c to get:\n\n1 = 2(0) + c\n1 = c.\n\nThus, the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x + 1. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: y = 2x + 1.",
