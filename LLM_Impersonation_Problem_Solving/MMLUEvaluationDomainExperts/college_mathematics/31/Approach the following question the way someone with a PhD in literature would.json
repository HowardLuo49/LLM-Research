    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin, one must consider the distance between the origin and the point on the plane. Let P be the point on the plane that is closest to the origin. By definition, the shortest distance between two points is along a straight line, hence, the line connecting the origin to point P is perpendicular to the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3.\n\nConsider the vector v = [2,1,3]. This vector points in the direction of the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3. The normal vector to this plane is n = [2,1,3]. Since the line connecting the origin to point P is perpendicular to the plane, the direction vector of this line is the normal vector n.\n\nTherefore, the line connecting the origin to point P is of the form [x,y,z] = [0,0,0] + t[2,1,3] where t is a parameter.\n\nThe coordinates of point P can be found by solving the system of equations:\n2t = x\nt = y\n3t = z\nsubject to the constraint 2x + y + 3z = 3.\n\nSubstitute the expressions for x, y, and z into the equation of the plane:\n2(2t) + t + 3(3t) = 3\n4t + t + 9t = 3\n14t = 3\nt = 3/14\n\nSubstitute t = 3/14 back into the expressions for x, y, and z:\nx = 2(3/14) = 3/7\ny = 3/14\nz = 3(3/14) = 9/14\n\nSo the coordinates of the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin are (3/7, 3/14, 9/14).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: (3/7, 3/14, 9/14).",
