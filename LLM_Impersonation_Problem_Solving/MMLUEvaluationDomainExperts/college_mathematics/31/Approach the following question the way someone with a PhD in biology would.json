    "gpt_response": "To find the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin, we need to minimize the distance between the origin and the point on the plane. The distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is given by the formula \u221a((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 + (z2-z1)^2).\n\nLet (x, y, z) be the coordinates of the point on the plane that is closest to the origin. Since the point lies on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3, we can express y and z in terms of x as follows:\n\ny = 3 - 2x - 3z\nz = (3 - 2x - y)/3\n\nNow, we can express the distance between the origin and the point (x, y, z) as a function of x:\n\nf(x) = \u221a(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \u221a(x^2 + (3 - 2x - 3z)^2 + ((3 - 2x - y)/3)^2)\n\nIn order to find the minimum distance between the origin and the point on the plane, we must minimize the function f(x). We can do this by taking the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, setting it equal to 0, and solving for x.\n\nAfter finding the value of x that minimizes f(x), we can substitute it back into our expressions for y and z to find the corresponding y and z coordinates. The resulting coordinates should match one of the answer choices provided.",
