    "gpt_response": "To find the coordinates of the point on the plane closest to the origin, we first need to define the distance between the origin and any point (x, y, z) in xyz-space. The distance formula from the origin (0, 0, 0) to a point (x, y, z) is given by the Euclidean distance formula:\n\ndistance = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\n\nGiven the equation of the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3, we can define the point on the plane as (x, y, z) with respect to the origin, where the distance from the origin to this point is minimized. The point (x, y, z) on the plane that minimizes the distance to the origin can be expressed by the orthogonal projection of the origin onto the plane.\n\nBy minimizing the distance between the origin and any point on the plane (x, y, z), we can express the coordinates of this point by solving the system of equations consisting of the equation of the plane and the distance formula.
