    "gpt_response": "To determine the coordinates of the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin in xyz-space, we need to find the vector from the origin to the plane that is orthogonal to the plane. This vector will point from the origin to the point on the plane that is closest to the origin.\n\nThe general form of the equation of a plane in xyz-space is given by ax + by + cz = d. In this case, the equation of the plane is 2x + y + 3z = 3.\n\nThe normal vector to the plane is given by the coefficients of x, y, and z, which in this case is <2, 1, 3>. To find the vector from the origin to the plane, we normalize this vector by dividing it by its magnitude:\n\n||<2, 1, 3>|| = sqrt(2^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(14)\n\nSo the normalized normal vector is <2/sqrt(14), 1/sqrt(14), 3/sqrt(14)>, which is the direction of the vector from the origin to the plane.\n\nWe now need to find the intersection of this direction vector with the plane. Setting x = t, y = t, and z = t, we get:\n\n2t + t + 3t = 3,\n6t = 3,\nt = 1/2\n\nSubstitute t = 1/2 into the parametric equations for x, y, and z:\n\nx = 1/2, y = 1/2, z = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), which is equivalent to option D: (5/6, 1/3, 1/3).",
