The distance formula between two points in xyz-space is given by the equation:\n\nDistance = sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + (z-0)^2) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\n\nSince the point lies on the plane, we can express one of the variables in terms of the other two using the plane equation 2x + y + 3z = 3.

One common approach is to take the partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x and y and set them equal to zero to find the critical points.
