    "gpt_response": "To solve this differential equation, we first recognize that it is exact. The equation can be rewritten as (xdy - ydx) + xe^xdx = 0. Identifying M(x, y) = x and N(x, y) = -y + xe^x, we can compute the partial derivatives to verify if the equation is exact. \n\n\u2202M/\u2202y = 0 and \u2202N/\u2202x = -1 + e^x\n\nSince these are not equal, the equation is not exact.

The integrating factor is 1/u = \u2202N/\u2202x - \u2202M/\u2202y = -1 + e^x, so u = e^x(1-x)\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by u gives us xe^xdy - ye^xdx + xdx = 0\n\nThis can be rewritten as d(xy - e^x) + xdx = 0\n\nIntegrating both sides yields xy - e^x + C = 0\n\nUsing the initial condition y(1) = 0, we find C = e.
