The dimension of the sum of two subspaces is at most the sum of their dimensions, and the dimension of their intersection is at least the sum of their dimensions minus the dimension of their sum. In this case, the subspaces U and V are 3-dimensional subspaces of R^5, so the maximum dimension of their sum is 6.
