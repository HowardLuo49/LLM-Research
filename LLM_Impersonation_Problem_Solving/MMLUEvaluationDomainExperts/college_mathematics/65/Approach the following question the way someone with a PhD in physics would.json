    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the given expressions will also be divisible by 11, we need to analyze the initial condition provided: 3x + 7y being divisible by 11.\n\nLooking at the original expression, we see that it can be written as 3x + 7y = 11n, where n is an integer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the first given expression: 4x + 6y. We can rewrite this as 4x + 6y = 4x + 6y - 4y + 4y = 4(x + 5y/2) = 4(x + 2y - y/2). Since x and y are positive integers, x + 2y - y/2 will also be an integer. Therefore, 4(x + 6y) can be written as 4m, where m is an integer. This means that this expression is not necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nMoving on to the second given expression: x + y + 5. We can rewrite this as x + y + 5 = x + y + 3 - 2 + 4 = x + y + 3 + 4 - 2, which simplifies further to x + y + 4 + 3 - 2, showing that the expression is not necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nNext, we consider the third given expression: 9x + 4y. We can rewrite this as 9x + 4y = 9x + 4x - 4x + 4y = 13x - 5x + 4y = 11x + 2x - 5x + 4y = 11(x + 2x) + 4y = 11(x + 2x) + 11y - 7y + 11y  -7y = 11(x + 2x + 11y - 7y), showing that this expression is divisible by 11.\n\nFinally, for the fourth given expression: 4x - 9y, we can rewrite it as 4x - 9y = 4x - 10y + y = 11x - y, which still leaves a remainder when divided by 11, and therefore is not necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nIn conclusion, the only expression that must be divisible by 11 when 3x + 7y is divisible by 11 is C: 9x + 4y.",
