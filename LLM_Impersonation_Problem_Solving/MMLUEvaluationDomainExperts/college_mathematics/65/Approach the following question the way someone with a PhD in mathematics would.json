    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Let x and y be positive integers such that 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. Since 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, we have that 3x + 7y = 11k for some integer k. \n\nTo determine which of the following expressions must also be divisible by 11, we can analyze each expression separately:\n\nA: 4x + 6y. This expression can be written as 4x + 6y = 4x + 6(3x + 7y) = 4x + 18x + 42y = 22x + 42y = 11(2x + 4y). Since 2x + 4y is an integer, we see that 4x + 6y is divisible by 11.\n\nB: x + y + 5. This expression cannot be easily proven to be divisible by 11 in general, as adding 5 to x + y does not necessarily preserve divisibility by 11.\n\nC: 9x + 4y. This expression can be written as 9x + 4y = 9x + 4(3x + 7y) = 9x + 12x + 28y = 21x + 28y = 11(2x + 4y). Since 2x + 4y is an integer, we see that 9x + 4y is divisible by 11.\n\nD: 4x - 9y. This expression can be written as 4x - 9y = 4x - 9(3x + 7y) = 4x - 27x - 63y = -23x - 63y = 11(-2x - 7y). Since -2x - 7y is an integer, we see that 4x - 9y is divisible by 11.\n\nTherefore, the expressions A, C, and D must also be divisible by 11.",
