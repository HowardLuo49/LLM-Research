    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by recognizing that in order for 3x + 7y to be divisible by 11, the sum of the coefficients of x and y must also be divisible by 11. In this case, 3 + 7 = 10, which is not divisible by 11. Therefore, none of the given expressions must be divisible by 11 based on the information provided.",
