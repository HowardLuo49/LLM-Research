    "gpt_response": "First, let's analyze Statement 1:\n\nIn topology, a set is said to be connected if it cannot be divided into two nonempty sets that are disjoint and open relative to the original set. The closure of a set is defined as the set together with all its limit points.\n\nNow, suppose A is a connected set. If we take the closure of A, denoted as cl(A), then by definition, cl(A) includes A and all its limit points. Since A is connected, it means that there are no nonempty disjoint open sets in A. Therefore, since cl(A) contains A and its limit points, it must also be connected.\n\nNext, let's analyze Statement 2:\n\nA fixed point of a function f is a point x such that f(x) = x. In the context of this statement, we are considering functions from the open interval (0, 1) to itself.\n\nAn example of a continuous function that does not have a fixed point on the interval (0, 1) is f(x) = x/2. If we take any x in (0, 1), then f(x) = x/2 < x. This means that f(x) is always less than x and never equal to x, so there is no fixed point in this case.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: True, False.",
