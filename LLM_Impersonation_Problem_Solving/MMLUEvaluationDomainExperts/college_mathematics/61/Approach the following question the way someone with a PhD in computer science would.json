A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?\nA: 20!/2^(10)\nB: 10!/2^9\nC: 10^(20) - 2^(10)\nD: 10^(20) - 100",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first think of it as selecting 10 pairs of professors from 20 courses to teach. This can be done in 20 choose 2 ways for the first pair, 18 choose 2 ways for the second pair, and so on. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to assign professors to courses is:\n(20 choose 2) * (18 choose 2) * ... * (4 choose 2) * (2 choose 2).\n\nThis can be calculated as (20! / (2! * 18!)) * (18! / (2! * 16!)) * ... * (4! / (2! * 2!)) * (2! / (2! * 0!)).\n\nThis simplifies to 20!/2^10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 20!/2^10.",
