A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?\nA: 20!/2^(10)\nB: 10!/2^9\nC: 10^(20) - 2^(10)\nD: 10^(20) - 100",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can think of it as a matching problem where we need to assign each of the 10 professors to teach 2 of the 20 courses. \n\nThere are 20 choices for the first assignment of a professor, then 19 choices for the second assignment (as they cannot teach the same course). This gives a total of 20*19 = 380 ways to make the first two assignments. \n\nFor the third assignment, there are 18 remaining courses to choose from, then 17 for the fourth assignment, and so on. The total number of ways to make all the assignments is:\n20*19*18*17*16*15*14*13*12*11 = 20!/10! = 20!/(2^10) = 20!/1024\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 20!/2^10.",
