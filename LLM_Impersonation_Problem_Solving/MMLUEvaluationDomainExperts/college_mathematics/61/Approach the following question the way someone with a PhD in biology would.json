A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?\nA: 20!/2^(10)\nB: 10!/2^9\nC: 10^(20) - 2^(10)\nD: 10^(20) - 100",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to consider the concept of permutations and combinations. \n\nFirstly, we have 10 professors and 20 courses. We can think of this problem as assigning each professor to teach a course, which is essentially a one-to-one mapping between professors and courses. This is a permutation problem because the order in which the assignments are made matters. \n\nFor the first professor, there are 20 choices of courses; for the second professor, there are 19 remaining choices of courses, and so on. Therefore, the total number of possible assignments is 20 x 19 x 18 x ... x 11, which can be represented as 20!.\n\nHowever, since the order in which professors are assigned to courses does not matter, we need to divide by the number of ways we can arrange the professors within the assignments. Each professor will be assigned exactly 2 courses, so there are 2 ways that each pair of assignments can be ordered. Since there are 10 professors, this gives us 2^10 ways to arrange the assignments within the pairs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses is given by 20! / 2^10, which corresponds to answer choice A.",
