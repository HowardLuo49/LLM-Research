    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. A large class is to be divided into teams and each student must be a member of exactly one team. However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, we can approach this problem by constructing a mathematical model to determine the minimum number of teams required to ensure that no student is on the same team as someone they dislike.\n\nLet n be the total number of students in the class. Each student dislikes exactly 3 other students, which means that they cannot be on the same team. Therefore, each student must be on a team with n - 3 other students.\n\nEach team must have at least 2 students (since a team of 1 student would be isolated and unable to meet the requirement of not being on the same team as someone they dislike). Therefore, the number of teams required can be expressed as:\n\nn = k * (n - 3), where k is the number of teams\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = n / (n - 3)\n\nSince k must be a whole number (as each team is a distinct group of individuals), n must be divisible by (n - 3) such that k is an integer. This implies that n - 3 must be a divisor of n.\n\nTesting out the options given in the question:\n\nFor n = 4, n - 3 = 1. 4 is not divisible by 1, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n\nFor n = 7, n - 3 = 4. 7 is divisible by 4, so this satisfies the condition. Therefore, the answer is B: 7 teams.",
