A large class is to be divided into teams and each student must be a member of exactly one team. However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use a graph theory approach. Let each student be represented by a vertex in a graph, and there is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding students dislike each other. We want to divide the vertices into teams such that no two connected vertices are on the same team.\n\nWe can think of this problem as a graph coloring problem, where we want to color the vertices of the graph with as few colors as possible, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nIn this case, if each vertex represents a student who dislikes three other students, then each vertex would have degree 3 in the graph. The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. In this case, the chromatic number of the graph would be 4.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 4 teams to ensure that no student is on the same team as someone they dislike. \n\nSo the correct answer is A: 4.",
