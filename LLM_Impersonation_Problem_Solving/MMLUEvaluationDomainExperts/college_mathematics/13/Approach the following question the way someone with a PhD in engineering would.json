    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. A large class is to be divided into teams and each student must be a member of exactly one team. However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the minimum number of teams needed so that no student is on the same team as someone they dislike, we can approach this problem mathematically.\n\nLet's denote n as the number of students. Each student dislikes 3 classmates, so there are 3n total dislikes in the class. This means there must be 3n different teams in order for each student to not be on the same team as someone they dislike.\n\nNow, we want to find the minimum number of teams so that there are no common students between teams. This can be accomplished by creating a graph where each node represents a student and each edge represents a dislike relationship between two students.\n\nIn order to have no common students between teams, the graph must be a disjoint union of complete graphs, also known as a complete k-partite graph. In this case, the graph must be divided into sets where each student within a set dislikes each other student, and students from different sets do not dislike each other.\n\nSince each student dislikes 3 classmates, the minimum number of teams needed is determined by the maximum number of sets (or teams) in a complete 4-partite graph. This can be achieved by setting up the teams so that each student is in the same set as their dislikes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of teams needed to ensure that no student is on the same team as someone they dislike is 4. So the answer is A: 4.",
