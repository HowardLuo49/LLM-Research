    "gpt_response": "The total number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices can be calculated using the formula for tree enumeration given by Cayley's formula. \n\nThe formula states that there are n^(n-2) possible labeled trees with n vertices. So, for 5 vertices, the number of nonisomorphic trees would be 5^(5-2) = 125. \n\nHowever, since the question is asking for nonisomorphic trees, we need to divide this number by the number of automorphisms of a tree with 5 vertices, which is 5!=120. \n\nTherefore, the number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices is 125/120 = 1. \n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 1.",
