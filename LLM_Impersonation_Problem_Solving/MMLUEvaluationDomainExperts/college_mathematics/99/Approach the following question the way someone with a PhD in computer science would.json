    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first represent the linear transformation T as a 2x2 matrix. \n\nLet the matrix representing T be denoted as A. We can express the linear transformation T as follows:\n\n| a b |   | 1  -1 |   | 2   2 |\n| c d | * | 2   2 | = | 3  -3 |\n\nFrom this, we can equate the matrices and solve for the components of matrix A:\n\na + 2b = 2\nc + 2d = 3\na - b = -1\nc - d = -3\n\nSolving these equations, we find a = 1, b = 1, c = 2, d = 1. Therefore, the matrix representing T is:\n\n| 1 1 |\n| 2 1 |\n\nNow, we can apply this matrix transformation to the point (2, 1) to find the resulting point:\n\n| 1 1 |   | 2 |   | 1*2 + 1*1 |\n| 2 1 | * | 1 | = | 2*2 + 1*1 |\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n| 1 1 |   | 2 |   | 2 + 1 |\n| 2 1 | * | 1 | = | 4 + 1 |\n\nThus, the point (2, 1) is mapped to the point (3, 5).
