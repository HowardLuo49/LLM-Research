    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon, we first need to understand the properties of a convex polygon. \n\nA convex polygon is a polygon in which all the interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the line segments connecting any two points on the interior of the polygon are contained entirely within the polygon. \n\nFor a 10-gon, the sum of the interior angles can be found by using the formula (n-2) * 180, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. In this case, the sum of the interior angles of a 10-gon would be (10-2) * 180 = 1440 degrees. \n\nTo maximize the number of acute angles in a convex polygon, we can try to maximize the number of obtuse angles by minimizing the number of acute angles. The maximum number of obtuse angles in a 10-gon would occur if all the angles except one were obtuse. \n\nIf nine angles were obtuse, each with a measure greater than 90 degrees, then the total angle sum contributed by the obtuse angles would be at least 810 degrees (9 * 90 = 810). This value subtracted from the total sum of 1440 degrees leaves no room for any additional obtuse angles. Therefore, the remaining angle must be acute. \n\nThus, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon in the Euclidean plane is 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1.",
