    "gpt_response": "To address this question as a philosopher with a PhD, we must first consider the nature of a convex 10-gon within the confines of Euclidean geometry. By definition, a convex polygon is a simple polygon in which no line segment between two points on the boundary ever goes outside the polygon. In the case of a 10-gon, we have 10 sides and 10 vertices, all enclosed within the polygon itself. \n\nIn Euclidean geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees. Substituting 10 for n in this formula, we find that the sum of the interior angles of a 10-gon is 8 * 180 = 1440 degrees. \n\nTo determine the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon, we must consider that an acute angle is defined as an angle that measures less than 90 degrees. Given that the sum of the angles in the 10-gon is 1440 degrees, we can assess that in order for an angle to be considered acute, it must be less than 90 degrees. Therefore, the 10-gon can have at most 4 acute angles, as any more would result in exceeding the total sum of 1440 degrees.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon in the Euclidean plane is 4, making option D: 4 the correct choice.",
