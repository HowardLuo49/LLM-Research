    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first identify the definition of an acute angle in Euclidean geometry. An acute angle is an angle that measures less than 90 degrees.\n\nFor a convex 10-gon, we know that the sum of the interior angles is given by the formula (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. In this case, n=10, so the sum of the interior angles of the 10-gon is (10-2)*180 = 1440 degrees.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon, we need to consider the possible configurations of acute angles in the polygon. Since an acute angle measures less than 90 degrees, the maximum number of acute angles that can fit within the total sum of interior angles of the 10-gon (1440 degrees) is 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 4.",
