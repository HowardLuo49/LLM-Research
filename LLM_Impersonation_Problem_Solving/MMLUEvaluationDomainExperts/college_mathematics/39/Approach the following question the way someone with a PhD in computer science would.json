    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon in the Euclidean plane, we must consider the properties of a convex polygon. \n\nIn a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees.\n\nFor a 10-gon, the sum of the interior angles is (10-2) * 180 = 8 * 180 = 1440 degrees.\n\nTo maximize the number of acute angles in the 10-gon, we must minimize the number of obtuse angles. If we have a 10-gon with 9 angles measuring 179 degrees each, the remaining angle would have to be very small to keep the total sum of angles at 1440 degrees. This remaining angle would be acute.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is 9. This results in 1 obtuse angle. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1.",
