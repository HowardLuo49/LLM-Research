    "gpt_response": "First, we are given that A = A^(-1). This means that A is its own inverse, which implies that A^2 = I, where I is the identity matrix. Let's express matrix A in terms of its elements:\n\nA = [a b]\n    [c d]\n\nwhere a, b, c, and d are real numbers.

If b is equal to 0, then a^2 = 1, which implies a = 1 or -1. If a = 1, then d = -1, and if a = -1, then d = 1. Since we are given that I != A != -I, this means neither a = 1 nor a = -1.
