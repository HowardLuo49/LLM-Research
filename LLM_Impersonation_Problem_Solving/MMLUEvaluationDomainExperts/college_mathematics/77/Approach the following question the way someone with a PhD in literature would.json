The notion that for a square matrix A, if A is equal to its own inverse, denoted as A = A^(-1), then A is referred to as an orthogonal matrix.\n\nIn this particular scenario, we are provided with the conditions I != A != -I, where I represents the identity matrix and A is a real 2 x 2 matrix. Given that A = A^(-1), we can infer that matrix A is orthogonal.\n\nAn important property of orthogonal matrices is that the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is either 1 or -1. In this case, let's deduce the determinant of matrix A.\n\nSince A = A^(-1), the determinant of A is either 1 or -1. The determinant of A can be computed as (det A) * (det A^(-1)) = det(AA^(-1)) = det(I) = 1. Therefore, the determinant of A is 1.\n\nNext, we are tasked with determining the trace of matrix A. The trace of a matrix is defined as the sum of the elements on the main diagonal. For a 2 x 2 matrix A, the trace is given by the sum of the two elements on the main diagonal, which are the elements in positions (1,1) and (2,2).\n\nGiven that A is orthogonal and the determinant of A is 1, we can equate the determinant of matrix A to the product of its eigenvalues. The determinant of A, being equal to 1, implies that the product of the eigenvalues of A is also 1. Since the eigenvalues of an orthogonal matrix are either 1 or -1, we can conclude that the eigenvalues of A are 1 and 1 (as the product must equal 1).\n\nThe trace of matrix A is defined as the sum of its eigenvalues. As both eigenvalues are 1, the trace of matrix A equals 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the trace of matrix A, given the conditions provided, is 2. This aligns with option A as the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, approaching the question with a thorough understanding of matrix algebra principles and properties allows for a comprehensive analysis that leads to the determination of the trace of matrix A as requested.",
