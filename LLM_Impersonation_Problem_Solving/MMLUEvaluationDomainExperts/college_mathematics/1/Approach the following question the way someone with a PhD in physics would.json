This means that the order of each element in G divides 4.\n\nSince the group is of order 16, by considering the possible orders of elements in finite abelian groups, we can deduce that there are two possibilities: either G has exactly one element of order 2 and all other elements have order 4, or G has exactly four elements of order 4.\n\nIn the first case, we have an abelian group isomorphic to Z/4Z x Z/4Z.
