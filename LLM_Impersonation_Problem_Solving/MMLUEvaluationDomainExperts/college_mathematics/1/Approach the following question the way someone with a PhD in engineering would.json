    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible structures of additive abelian groups of order 16. An additive abelian group is a group in which the group operation is denoted by addition and is commutative. \n\nSince the order of the group is 16, we know that the group G must be isomorphic to Z\u2084 x Z\u2084 (direct product of cyclic groups of order 4). \nLet's denote the elements of the two cyclic groups as a and b. \nThen the elements of G can be written as {0, a, 2a, 3a, b, a+b, 2a+b, 3a+b, 2b, a+2b, 2a+2b, 3a+2b, 3b, a+3b, 2a+3b, 3a+3b}. \n\nWe need to find the number of such groups G that satisfy the property x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G. \nThis property is equivalent to 4x = 0 for each x in G. \n\nIn Z\u2084 x Z\u2084, we can see that only the element 0 satisfies the property 4x = 0, as 4x = 4(0,0) = (0,0). \n\nTherefore, there is only 1 additive abelian group up to isomorphism of order 16 that satisfies the given property. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 1.",
