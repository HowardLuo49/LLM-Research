In this case, the map x -> axa^2 is a homomorphism if and only if it satisfies this condition.\n\nLet's consider the map x -> axa^2:\n\nf(xy) = a(xy)a^2 = axya^2 (expanding the middle term)\nf(x)f(y) = axa^2ay a^2 = axya^2 (expanding the middle terms)\n\nTherefore, the map x -> axa^2 is a homomorphism if and only if f(xy) = f(x)f(y), or in other words, f(xy) = axya^2 = axa^2ay = f(x)f(y).\n\nComparing this with the group operation, we see that in an abelian group G, the group operation is commutative, i.e., xy = yx for all x, y in G.
