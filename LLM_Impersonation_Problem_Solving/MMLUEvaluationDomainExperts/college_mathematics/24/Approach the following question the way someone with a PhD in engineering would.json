This property holds true for complex numbers as well, as the limit laws for complex numbers are analogous to those for real numbers. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, the existence of a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence is plausible. This is because boundedness alone does not guarantee convergence. A sequence can be bounded without having a convergent subsequence, as exhibited by oscillating or diverging sequences. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nConsidering the implications of the two statements together, it is possible to have sequences of complex numbers that converge to specific values and their product also converges to the product of those values. At the same time, there can exist a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. This results in the combined answer of Option A: True, True.",
