    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we must carefully analyze each statement.\n\nStatement 1 deals with the product of the limits of two sequences. If the limits of two sequences exist, then the limit of the product of those sequences is equal to the product of the limits. This is a fundamental property of limits in mathematics.\n\nStatement 2 asserts the existence of a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. This statement is true based on the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that any bounded sequence in Euclidean space has a convergent subsequence. However, this theorem only applies to sequences in Euclidean space, and the statement does not specify the space in which the sequence exists. Therefore, it is possible for a bounded sequence of real numbers to have no convergent subsequence if it is not in Euclidean space.\n\nCombining these analyses, we find that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, leading to the correct answer: B) True, False.",
