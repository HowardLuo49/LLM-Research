    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by carefully analyzing the properties of similar matrices and the given matrices A, B, and I. \n\nFirst, let's recall the definition of similar matrices. Matrices A and B are similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^(-1)AP.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\nI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices:\nGiven A and B are similar matrices, we have B = P^(-1)AP. Therefore, B - 2I = P^(-1)AP - 2P^(-1)IP = P^(-1)(A - 2I)P. This shows that A - 2I and B - 2I are indeed similar matrices. Hence, Statement I is true.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace:\nSince A and B are similar matrices, they have the same trace. This is because the trace of a matrix is invariant under similarity transformations. Therefore, Statement II is true.\n\nIII. A^(-1) and B^(-1) are similar matrices:\nSince A and B are similar matrices, we have B = P^(-1)AP. Taking the inverse of both sides, we get B^(-1) = P^(-1)A^(-1)P. This shows that A^(-1) and B^(-1) are similar matrices. Hence, Statement III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",
