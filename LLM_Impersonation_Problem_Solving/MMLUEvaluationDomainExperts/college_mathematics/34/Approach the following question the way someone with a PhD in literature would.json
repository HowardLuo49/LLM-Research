    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand the concept of similar matrices. Two n x n matrices A and B are said to be similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that A = P^-1BP.\n\nGiven that A and B are similar matrices, we know that there exists an invertible matrix P such that A = P^-1BP. \n\nI. To determine if A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices, we need to find an invertible matrix Q such that A - 2I = Q^-1(B - 2I)Q. Multiplying both sides by Q, we get A - 2I = Q^-1BQ - 2Q^-1Q = Q^-1BQ - 2I. Therefore, A - 2I and B - 2I are also similar matrices and statement I is true.\n\nII. To find out if A and B have the same trace, we know that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. Since similar matrices have the same trace, statement II is also true.\n\nIII. To determine if A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices, suppose there exists a matrix R such that A^-1 = R^-1B^-1R. Taking the inverse of both sides, we get A = RBR^-1. This implies that A and B are similar matrices, which we already know to be true. Hence, statement III is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",
