The product of two nonzero elements in a ring will be zero if there exists zero divisors in the ring.\n\nA. The ring of complex numbers does not have zero divisors, as every nonzero complex number has a multiplicative inverse.

The ring of integers modulo 11 (denoted by Z/11Z) does have zero divisors, as for example, 3 * 4 \u2261 0 (mod 11).

The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1] also does not have zero divisors, as the product of two nonzero continuous functions will always be nonzero.

In the ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}, it is not possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero. This is because rational numbers are closed under multiplication, and the product of two nonzero rational numbers will always be nonzero.
