    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the veracity of the statements provided, we must analyze the function f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^3. \n\nTo identify the relative extrema points, we need to compute the gradient of the function f(x,y) and set it to zero to solve for critical points. The gradient of f(x,y) is given by (\u2202f/\u2202x, \u2202f/\u2202y) = (2x - 2y, -2x + 3y^2). Setting this gradient to zero yields the critical points which are (x,y) = (2/3, 2/3) and (0,0).\n\nNext, we consider the second derivative test to determine the nature of the critical points. Computing the Hessian matrix of f evaluated at the critical points, we obtain:\nH(2/3, 2/3) = [2 -2; -2 6] which is positive definite, indicating a local minimum at (2/3, 2/3).\nH(0, 0) = [2 -2; -2 0] which is a saddle point.\n\nTherefore, given the analysis conducted thus far, statement D that asserts f has an absolute minimum at (2/3, 2/3) is indeed true based on the critical point evaluation and second derivative test. Statements A and B are false as the critical point (2/3, 2/3) does not lie on x = y or x = y^2. Statement C is also false as the relative minimum for f is at (2/3, 2/3) and not at (0, 0).",
