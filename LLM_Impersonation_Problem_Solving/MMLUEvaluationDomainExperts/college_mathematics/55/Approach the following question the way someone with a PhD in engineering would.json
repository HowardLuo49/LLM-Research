While it is true that the absolute value of a real number is zero if and only if the number is zero, this may not hold for vectors in \u211d^k. For instance, a zero vector can have a non-zero magnitude in multi-dimensional space.\n\nStatement D: |x + y| = |x| + |y|\nThis statement is not always true. The triangle inequality states that the magnitude of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of their magnitudes. Therefore, the equality |x + y| = |x| + |y| is not always guaranteed.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is not always true for x, y, z \u2208 \u211d^k is statement D: |x + y| = |x| + |y|.",
