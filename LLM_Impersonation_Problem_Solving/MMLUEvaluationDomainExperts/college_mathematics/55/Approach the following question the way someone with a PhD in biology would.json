When considering vectors x, y, z that are elements in the real space R^k, we must analyze the properties of the absolute value (magnitude) of vectors.\n\nOption A: |x| \u2265 0 is always true for all vectors x in R^k, as the absolute value of any vector will never be negative.\n\nOption B: |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y| is always true due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in mathematics, which states that the absolute value of the dot product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of the magnitudes of the vectors. Therefore, this option is always true.\n\nOption C: |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0 is true for all vectors x in R^k, as the magnitude of a vector is zero if and only if the vector itself is the zero vector.\n\nOption D: |x + y| = |x| + |y| is not always true for vectors x, y in R^k. This equation represents the triangle inequality, which holds true for Euclidean norms, where the length of a side of a triangle is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. However, in other norms, such as the Taxicab norm, this equation may not hold true for all vectors.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not always true for x, y, z \u2208 R^k is Option D: |x + y| = |x| + |y|.",
