If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing the definitions and properties of rings, ideals, and division rings. \n\nAn ideal of a ring is a subring that is closed under multiplication by elements of the ring. If R has exactly two right ideals, then the only possibility is that R is a division ring because a ring always has at least two right ideals - the zero ideal and the entire ring itself. \n\nHowever, not all division rings are commutative. Therefore, the statement that R must be commutative (option I) is not necessarily true. \n\nSimilarly, the statement that R must be infinite (option III) is also not necessarily true. Division rings can be finite as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: II only.",
