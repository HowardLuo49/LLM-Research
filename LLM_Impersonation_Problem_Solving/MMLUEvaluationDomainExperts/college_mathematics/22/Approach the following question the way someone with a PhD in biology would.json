If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

R is a division ring\nA division ring is a ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. The presence of exactly two right ideals might suggest specific conditions within R that guarantee the existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements.\n\nIII. R is infinite\nThe requirement for R to be infinite is not directly related to the existence of two right ideals. The size or cardinality of R does not necessarily determine the number of right ideals it has.\n\nConsidering the implications of the given condition, it is evident that Option A: \"I only\" is the most plausible choice.
