This implies that if U is an additive subgroup satisfying these conditions, it is a right ideal of R. Furthermore, we are told that R has exactly two right ideals.\n\nIf R has exactly two right ideals, this implies that U is the trivial right ideal {0} and that R is the only other right ideal. Therefore, U must be a subset of {0}. This means that all elements of U must multiply any element of R to produce another element in U. From this, it becomes clear that U must contain the additive identity of R, which is 0.\n\nThis condition restricts the structure of R, as any element r in R multiplied by 0 must result in 0, which introduces the commutative property. Simply put, if R is not commutative, then there would be infinite possibilities for the right ideals in R, contradicting our initial assumption that R has exactly two right ideals. Therefore, it follows that R must be commutative. \n\nRegarding the other options provided:\n\nII. R being a division ring is not necessarily true in this scenario. The fact that R only has two right ideals does not imply that all elements in R except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses. \n\nIII. The size of R being infinite is not a necessary condition for this situation. The structure and properties of R determining the number of right ideals is not contingent on R being infinite.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given conditions and the concept of right ideals in R, the only statement that must be true is that R is commutative (Option A).",
