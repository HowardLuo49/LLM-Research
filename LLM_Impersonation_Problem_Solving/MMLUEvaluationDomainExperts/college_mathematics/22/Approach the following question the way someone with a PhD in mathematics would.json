If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "A right ideal of a ring is a subset that is closed under addition and also absorbs multiplication from the right by elements of the ring. \n\nIf R has exactly two right ideals, this implies that R has some special properties since usually rings have more than two right ideals. \n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\nI. If R is commutative, then every ideal is automatically a two-sided (both left and right) ideal. However, the fact that R has exactly two right ideals doesn't necessarily imply that R is commutative.
