    "gpt_response": "To calculate (1+i)^10, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that (a + b)^n = \u2211(n choose k) * a^(n-k) * b^k from k=0 to n, where n is a non-negative integer and (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = i, and n = 10. Therefore, the expansion becomes (1 + i)^10 = \u2211(10 choose k) * 1^(10-k) * i^k from k=0 to 10.\n\nExpanding this out gives us:\n\n(10 choose 0) * 1^10 * i^0 + (10 choose 1) * 1^9 * i^1 + ... + (10 choose 10) * 1^0 * i^10\n\nCalculating each term using the binomial coefficient formula (n choose k = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)), we get:\n\n1 + 10i - 45 - 120i + 210 + 252i - 210i - 120i^2 + 45i - 10i^3 + i^4\n\nSimplifying this further, the terms containing i^2, i^3, and i^4 can be rewritten using the fact that i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, and i^4 = 1. This gives us:\n\n1 + 10i - 45 - 120i + 210 + 252i - 210i + 120 + 45i - 10i + 1\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n1 - 45 + 210 + 120 + 1 + 10i - 120i + 252i - 210i + 45i - 10i\n\n= 32 + 32i\n\nTherefore, (1+i)^10 = 32 + 32i, which is option D.",
