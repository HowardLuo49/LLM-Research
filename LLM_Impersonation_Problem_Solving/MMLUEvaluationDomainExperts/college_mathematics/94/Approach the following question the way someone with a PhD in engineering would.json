    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use De Moivre's Theorem, which states that for any complex number z = r(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8), raising it to the power of n results in z^n = r^n (cos n\u03b8 + isin n\u03b8).\n\nIn this case, the complex number is 1 + i, which we can rewrite in polar form as \u221a2 (cos(\u03c0/4) + isin(\u03c0/4)). Therefore, (1 + i)^10 = (\u221a2)^10 (cos(\u03c0/4 * 10) + isin(\u03c0/4 * 10).\n\nCalculating (\u221a2)^10 = 32, and simplifying the angle to (\u03c0/4) * 10 = 5\u03c0/2 = \u03c0/2, we get (1 + i)^10 = 32(cos(\u03c0/2) + isin(\u03c0/2)). As cos(\u03c0/2) = 0 and sin(\u03c0/2) = 1, the result is 32i.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 32i.",
