    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum value of the expression x + 4z subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2, we must use the method of Lagrange multipliers. \n\nLet's define our function F(x, y, z) = x + 4z and our constraint g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2.\n\nThe Lagrangian L(x, y, z, \u03bb) is given by L(x, y, z, \u03bb) = F(x, y, z) - \u03bbg(x, y, z).\n\nTaking the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, and \u03bb and setting them equal to zero, we get:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 1 - 2\u03bbx = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 4 - 2\u03bbz = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = -(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2) = 0\n\nFrom the first and third equations, we can solve for x and z in terms of \u03bb:\n\nx = 1/(2\u03bb)\nz = 2/(2\u03bb) = 1/\u03bb\n\nSubstitute these back into the constraint equation to solve for y:\n\n(1/(2\u03bb))^2 + y^2 + (1/\u03bb)^2 = 2\n1/(4\u03bb^2) + y^2 + 1/\u03bb^2 = 2\ny^2 = 2 - 1/(4\u03bb^2) - 1/\u03bb^2\ny^2 = (8\u03bb^2 - 1)/(4\u03bb^2)\n\nThe constraint allows for multiple solutions for y, but the values of q correspond to the minimum and maximum points of the function, so we have to consider the minimum value of the objective function F(x, y, z) = x + 4z.\n\nPlugging the values of x and z back into the objective function, we get:\n\nF(x, y, z) = 1/(2\u03bb) + 4/(\u03bb) = (2 + 8)/2\u03bb = 10/(2\u03bb) = 5/\u03bb\n\nThus, the minimum value of the expression x + 4z is obtained when \u03bb takes the highest possible value within the range permitted by the constraint. In this case, the maximum allowed value for \u03bb would be 1, as it corresponds to y = 0. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression x + 4z is -5. \n\nHowever, because the closest answer is given in terms of square root, we can also express -5 as -5 = -\u221a(25) = -\u221a(25) = -\u221a(5^2) = -5. \n\nTherefore, the minimum value is -\u221a(25), which corresponds to option C: -\u221a(25) = -5.",
