    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum value of the expression x + 4z subject to the given constraint, we need to utilize Lagrange multipliers. \n\nLet f(x, y, z) = x + 4z and g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 be the objective function and constraint equation, respectively.\n\nThe Lagrangian function L(x, y, z, \u03bb) is defined as L(x, y, z, \u03bb) = f(x, y, z) - \u03bb(g(x, y, z)).\n\nTaking the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, and \u03bb and setting them equal to zero, we get:\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 1 - 2\u03bbx = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = -2\u03bby = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 4 - 2\u03bbz = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we get that y = 0.
