    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the properties of Lebesgue integrable functions and their relationship with Riemann integrable functions.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that not all Lebesgue integrable functions are Riemann integrable. There exist functions that are Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable, such as the indicator function of the rational numbers on the interval [0,1]. Therefore, statement A: f is Riemann integrable, does not necessarily have to be true.\n\nNext, we consider statements B and C. Both statements discuss the existence of sets where the function is nondifferentiable at every point in the set. It is known that Lebesgue integrable functions can be discontinuous at a set of points of measure zero. However, the set E in statement B is countably infinite, while the set E in statement C is uncountable. It is not necessarily true that a Lebesgue integrable function cannot be nondifferentiable at every point in a countably infinite set or an uncountable set. Therefore, both statement B and C may or may not be true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer would be D: None of the above. It is not possible to definitively state which of the statements must be true based solely on the information provided.",
