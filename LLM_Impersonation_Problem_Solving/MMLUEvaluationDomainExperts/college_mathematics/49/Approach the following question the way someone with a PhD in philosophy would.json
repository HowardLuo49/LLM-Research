If f: R -> R is a bounded function that is Lebesgue integrable, then which of the following must be true?\nA: f is Riemann integrable.\nB: There does not exist a countably infinite E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nC: There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nD: None of the above.",

    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must consider the relationship between Lebesgue integrability, Riemann integrability, and nondifferentiability. \n\nFirstly, it is important to note that not all Lebesgue integrable functions are Riemann integrable. There exist functions that are Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable, such as the Dirichlet function. Therefore, statement A is not necessarily true.\n\nNext, we must consider the concept of nondifferentiability of a function. A function is nondifferentiable at a point if it fails to have a derivative at that point. It is possible for a function to be nondifferentiable at a countably infinite set of points, such as the Weierstrass function. Therefore, statement B is not necessarily true.\n\nMoving on to statement C, the assertion that there does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x in E is indeed true. This follows from Baire's category theorem, which states that the set of points of differentiability of a continuous function is a dense set.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question is C: There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x in E.",
