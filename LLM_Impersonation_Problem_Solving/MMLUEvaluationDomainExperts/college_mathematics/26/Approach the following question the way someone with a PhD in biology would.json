    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. It takes Kate k days to write a GRE math practice test. It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we have to consider the rates at which Kate and John work. Let's represent Kate's rate as 1/k and John's rate as 1/j.\n\nWhen Kate starts, in 10 days, she completes 5/k of the practice test. Similarly, when John starts, in 10.5 days, he completes 5/j of the practice test. \n\nWhen they work on alternating 2-day shifts, Kate and John together complete 1/k + 1/j of the practice test in 2 days. However, we are given that when Kate starts, they complete 1 in 10 days and when John starts, they complete 1 in 10.5 days. This information can be used to set up an equation:\n\n5/k + 5/j = 1/10\n5/j + 5/k = 1/10.5\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we get k = 5 and j = 7. Now that we know Kate and John's rates, we can find their combined rate when working simultaneously:\n\n1/k + 1/j = 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35\n\nSo, Kate and John can complete the practice test when working simultaneously in 35/12 days, which simplifies to 2.91666... or approximately 2.75 or 41/8 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 41/8 days.",
