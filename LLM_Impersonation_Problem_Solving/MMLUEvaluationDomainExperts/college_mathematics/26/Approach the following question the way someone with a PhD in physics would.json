It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can set up equations to represent the scenarios when Kate starts and when John starts.\n\nLet's denote the time it takes Kate to write the practice test as k days and the time it takes John to write the practice test as j days.\n\nWhen Kate starts:\nKate completes the first shift in k days, then John completes the second shift in j days.\nIn 10 days, they complete 5 shifts (Kate writes 3 shifts and John writes 2 shifts). Therefore, 3k + 2j = 10.\n\nWhen John starts:\nJohn completes the first shift in j days, then Kate completes the second shift in k days.\nIn 10.5 days, they complete 5 shifts (John writes 3 shifts and Kate writes 2 shifts). Therefore, 3j + 2k = 10.5.\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of k and j.\n\nSolving these equations will give us:\nk = 1.5 days\nj = 2 days\n\nTo find the time it takes for Kate and John to complete a practice test simultaneously, we can calculate the time for one full shift:\n1.5 + 2 = 3.5 days\n\nTherefore, the two would take 3.5 days to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously, which is equivalent to 7/2 days. So, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 36/7 days.",
