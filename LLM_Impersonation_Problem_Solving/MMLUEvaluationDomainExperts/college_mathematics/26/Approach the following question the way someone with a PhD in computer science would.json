It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given. Let's assume that the total time it takes Kate to complete the practice test is x days and the total time it takes John to complete the practice test is y days.\n\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following equations:\nKate's time: k = x\nJohn's time: j = y\n\nWhen Kate starts, the combined time taken is 10 days:\nx + y = 10\n\nWhen John starts, the combined time taken is 10.5 days:\ny + x = 10.5\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of x and y:\nx + y = 10\ny + x = 10.5\n\nAdding the two equations:\n2x + 2y = 20.5\nx + y = 10\nx = 10 - y\n\nSubstitute x = 10 - y into the first equation:\n10 - y + y = 10\n10 = 10\nThe system of equations is consistent and dependent, meaning that there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nSince they work simultaneously, the combined time would be x + y:\nx + y = 2(10/2) = 10 days\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 5 days.",
