It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of days it would take Kate and John to complete a practice test if they worked simultaneously.\n\nFrom the information given, we have:\nKate completes 1/k of the practice test in one day.\nJohn completes 1/j of the practice test in one day.\nWhen Kate starts, in 10 days they completed:\n10(1/k + 1/j) = 1.\n\nWhen John starts, in 10.5 days they completed:\n10.5(1/k + 1/j) = 1.\n\nNow, if they worked simultaneously, Kate would complete 1/x of the practice test in one day and John would complete 1/x of the practice test in one day. So, in one day, they would complete 1/x + 1/x = 2/x of the practice test.\n\nSince we know that when Kate starts, in 10 days they complete 1, we can set up the equation:\n10(1/k + 1/j) = 1.\n\nUsing the given information that when John starts, in 10.5 days they complete 1, we can set up the equation:\n10.5(1/k + 1/j) = 1.\n\nLet's solve these two equations to find k and j, and then find x. \n\nAfter solving the equations, we find that k = 12 and j = 21/4.\n\nFinally, we can find x by solving the equation:\nx(1/12 + 1/(21/4)) = 1\nx(4/21 + 4/21) = 1\nx(8/21) = 1\nx = 21/8 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 41/8 days.",
