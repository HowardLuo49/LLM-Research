It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, let's first determine the amount of work each person can do in one day. We know that when Kate starts, it takes them 10 days. This means that the combined rate of Kate and John is 1/10. Similarly, when John starts, it takes them 10.5 days, so their combined rate is 1/10.5.\n\nLet's denote Kate's rate as 1/k and John's rate as 1/j.\n\nWhen Kate starts:\n1/k + 1/j = 1/10\n\nWhen John starts:\n1/k + 1/j = 1/10.5\n\nFrom these two equations, we can solve for k and j.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by j and the second equation by -k, we get:\nj/k + 1 = j/10 and -k/j - 1 = -k/10.5\n\nRearranging the equations:\nj/k = j/10 - 1 and k/j = 1 - k/10.5\n\nSolving algebraically for k and j, we get:\nk = 21/2 and j = 42/5\n\nNow, to find the time it takes for them to complete the test together, we can use the formula:\n1/k + 1/j = 2/(k+j)\n\nPlugging in the values of k and j, we get:\n1/(21/2) + 1/(42/5) = 2/((21/2) + (42/5))\n\nSolving this equation gives us:\n2/21 + 5/42 = 2/(21/2 + 42/5)\n(4/42 + 5/42) = 2/(21/2 + 42/5)\n9/42 = 10/((21*5+42*2)/10)\n9/42 = 10/(105)\n9/42 = 10/105\n9(105) = 42(10)\n945 = 420\n\nTherefore, Kate and John working simultaneously would take 945/420 = 9/2 days to complete the practice test. The correct answer is A: 9/2 days.",
