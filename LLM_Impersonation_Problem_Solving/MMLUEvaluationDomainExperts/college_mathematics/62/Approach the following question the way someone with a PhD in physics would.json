This is because the complex numbers cannot be totally ordered in a way that is consistent with the algebraic operations of addition and multiplication, as shown by the existence of non-trivial automorphisms of C as a field.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement (b) is false. It is not possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers C which makes (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) an ordered field, as the complex numbers do not have a natural total order that is compatible with their algebraic structure.
