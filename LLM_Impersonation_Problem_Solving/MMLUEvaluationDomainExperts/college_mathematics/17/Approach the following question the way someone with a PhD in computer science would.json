What is the work done by F on a particle that moves along the path given by (t, t^2, t^3) between time t=0 and time t=1?\nA: -1/4\nB: -1/(4sqrt(2))\nC: 0\nD: sqrt(2)",

    "gpt_response": "To find the work done by the force on the particle, we first need to calculate the dot product of the force vector F and the path vector r(t) = (t, t^2, t^3).\n\nThe dot product of two vectors is given by the formula A dot B = |A||B|cos(theta), where A and B are the vectors, |A| and |B| are their magnitudes, and theta is the angle between them.\n\nIn this case, the force vector F = (-1, 0, 1) and the path vector r(t) = (t, t^2, t^3).\n\nThe dot product F dot r(t) = (-1, 0, 1) dot (t, t^2, t^3) = -t + t^3\n\nNow, we need to integrate the dot product with respect to time t from 0 to 1 to calculate the work done by the force on the particle:\n\nWork = \u222b[F dot r(t)] dt from 0 to 1\n      = \u222b(-t + t^3) dt from 0 to 1\n      = [-t^2/2 + t^4/4] from 0 to 1\n      = [-(1/2) + 1/4] - [0] \n      = -1/2 + 1/4\n      = -1/4\n\nTherefore, the work done by the constant unit force F on the particle moving along the specified path between time t=0 and time t=1 is -1/4.
