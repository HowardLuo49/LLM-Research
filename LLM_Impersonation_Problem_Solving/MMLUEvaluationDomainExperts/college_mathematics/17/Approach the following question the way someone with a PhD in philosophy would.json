What is the work done by F on a particle that moves along the path given by (t, t^2, t^3) between time t=0 and time t=1?\nA: -1/4\nB: -1/(4sqrt(2))\nC: 0\nD: sqrt(2)",

    "gpt_response": "To address the given question, one must first acknowledge that work, in the context of classical mechanics, is defined as the dot product of force and displacement. In this case, the force vector F is established as a constant unit force parallel to (-1, 0, 1). This allows us to represent the force vector F as (a, 0, -a), where a is a non-zero constant.\n\nNext, with the given path represented as (t, t^2, t^3) for t in the range [0, 1], we know that the velocity vector v(t) can be derived by differentiating the position vector with respect to time. Hence, we have v(t) = (1, 2t, 3t^2). \n\nFollowing this, we calculate the dot product of the force vector and velocity vector, which gives us the formula for work W(t) = F \u00b7 v(t). Here, the dot product yields F \u00b7 v(t) = a*1 + 0*2t + (-a) * 3t^2 = a - 3at^2.\n\nTo determine the work done by the force F on the particle as it moves along the path from t=0 to t=1, we compute the total work done by integrating the above formula over this time interval. Therefore, the total work done is given by W = \u222b[0,1] (a - 3at^2) dt = a*t - a*t^3| from 0 to 1 = (a - a) - (0 - 0) = 0.\n\nHence, the work done by the constant unit force F on the particle moving along the specified path between t=0 and t=1 is 0. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 0.",
