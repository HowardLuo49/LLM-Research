X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements.

    "gpt_response": "First, let's denote the number of elements in set X as n. \n\nThe number of subsets of X that contain exactly k elements is given by the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\", denoted as \"nCk\" or \"n choose k\". This can be calculated using the formula nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nGiven that the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements, we can write the following equation:\n\nnC3 = nC2 + 14\n\nSubstitute the binomial coefficient formula into the equation:\n\nn! / (3!(n-3)!) = n! / (2!(n-2)!) + 14\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nn(n-1)(n-2)/6 = n(n-1)/2 + 14\n\nExpand and simplify further:\n\nn^3 - 3n^2 + 2n = 3n^2 - 3n + 28\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn^3 - 6n^2 + 5n - 28 = 0\n\nFactor the equation (you might use a software or calculator to obtain the values of n):\n\n(n-4)(n^2-2n+7) = 0\n\nThe roots of this equation are n=4 and the roots of the quadratic equation are not real numbers, hence n=4.\n\nNow that we know that n=4, we can find the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements by calculating nC4:\n\n4! / (4!(4-4)!) = 24\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 24.",
