X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements.

    "gpt_response": "Let X be a set with n elements. We know that the number of subsets of X containing exactly k elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n,k).\n\nAccording to the property given, the number of subsets of X containing exactly 3 elements is C(n,3) = C(n,2) + 14.\n\nWe can rewrite this as C(n,3) - C(n,2) = 14.\n\nUsing the formula for binomial coefficients, we get (n!/(3!(n-3)!) - n!/(2!(n-2)!) = 14.\n\nThis simplifies to n(n-1)/2 - n(n-1)(n-2)/6 = 14.\n\nSolving for n, we get n = 7.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets of X containing exactly 4 elements is C(7,4) = 35.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 35.",
