    "gpt_response": "As a PhD holder in biology, we can approach this problem using combinatorial methods. Let X be a finite set with n elements. \n\nThe number of subsets of X that contain exactly k elements is given by the binomial coefficient, denoted as (n choose k) or \"n choose k\". This can be calculated as n! / ((n-k)! * k!).\n\nGiven that the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(n choose 3) = (n choose 2) + 14\nn! / ((n-3)! * 3!) = n! / ((n-2)! * 2!) + 14\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\nn(n-1)(n-2)/6 = n(n-1)/2 + 14\nn(n-1)(n-2) = 3n(n-1) + 84\nn^3 - 3n^2 = 3n^2 -3n + 84\nn^3 - 6n^2 + 3n - 84 = 0\n\nBy factoring, we find that n = 7 satisfies this equation.
