X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. How many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements?\nA: 24\nB: 25\nC: 28\nD: 35",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of elements in set X as n. We know that the number of subsets of X containing exactly k elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n,k). \n\nGiven that the number of subsets of X containing exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets containing exactly 2 elements, we have:\nC(n,3) = C(n,2) + 14\n=> n! / (3!(n-3)!) = n! / (2!(n-2)!) + 14\n=> n(n-1)(n-2)/6 = n(n-1)/2 + 14\n=> n(n-1)(n-2) = 3n(n-1) + 84\n=> n(n-1)(n-2 - 3) = 84\n=> n(n-1)(n-5) = 84\n\nNow, the number of subsets of X containing exactly 4 elements can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:\nC(n,4) = n! / (4!(n-4)!)\n\nBy substituting the value of n obtained from the above equation into this formula, we can find the number of subsets containing exactly 4 elements. Calculating this gives n = 7, and substituting back in for C(7,4) gives us 35.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 35.",
