X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements.

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the number of subsets of a finite set. Let X have n elements, then the number of subsets of X is equal to 2^n.\n\nLet the number of elements in set X be n. From the given information, we have:\n\nn choose 3 - n choose 2 = 14\n(n!/(3!(n-3)!) - n!/(2!(n-2)!) = 14\n(n(n-1)(n-2)/6 - n(n-1)/2 = 14\nn(n-1)(n-2)/6 - 3n(n-1)/6 = 14\nn(n-1)(n-2-3)/6 = 14\nn(n-1)(n-5)/6 = 14\nn(n-1)(n-5)=84\n\nWe can see that n=7 satisfies this equation, as 7*6*2 = 84.\n\nTherefore, X has 7 elements. The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements can be calculated as:\n7 choose 4 = 35\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 35.",
