X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. How many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements?\nA: 24\nB: 25\nC: 28\nD: 35",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationships between the number of subsets of a set based on the number of elements in each subset. \n\nLet X have n elements. The number of subsets of X containing k elements is given by the binomial coefficient (n choose k), which is denoted as C(n,k) or \"n choose k\". This is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!), where ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nThe given information states that the number of subsets of X containing 3 elements is 14 more than the number containing 2 elements. Therefore, we have:\n\nC(n,3) - C(n,2) = 14\n(n! / (3!(n-3)!)) - (n! / (2!(n-2)!)) = 14\nn * (n-1) / 6 - n * (n-1) / 2 = 14\n(n^2 - n - 3n^2 + 3n) / 6 = 14\n-2n^2 + 2n = 84\nn^2 - n = -42\nn^2 - n + 42 = 0\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of n. The solutions are n = 7, -6. Since n must be a positive integer, n = 7.\n\nNow that we know X has 7 elements, we can find the number of subsets containing 4 elements using the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(7,4) = 7! / (4!(7-4)!) = 35\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 35.",
