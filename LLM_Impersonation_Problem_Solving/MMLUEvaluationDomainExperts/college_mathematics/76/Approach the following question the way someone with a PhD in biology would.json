    "gpt_response": "In response to Statement 1, as someone with a PhD in biology, I would say that the statement is generally true. Assuming that f is a function defined on a closed interval [a, b] and has a local maximum at some point c within that interval, then it is true that the derivative of f at that local maximum point must exist and be equal to 0. This is because at a local maximum or minimum point, the derivative of the function is equal to 0.\n\nAs for Statement 2, there is no direct correlation between the existence of non-constant continuous maps from R (real numbers) to Q (rational numbers) and a background in biology. However, based on mathematical principles, it is indeed true that there exist non-constant continuous maps from the real numbers to the rational numbers. This is due to the fact that the real numbers and rational numbers have different cardinalities, allowing for non-constant continuous maps between them.\n\nTherefore, the correct response would be option A: True, True.",
