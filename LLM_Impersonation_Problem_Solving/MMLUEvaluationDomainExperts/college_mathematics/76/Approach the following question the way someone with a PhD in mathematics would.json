    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by critically analyzing the statements using mathematical reasoning and principles. \n\nFor the first statement, we must consider the properties of a local maximum. If a function has a local maximum at a point, f'(x) may or may not exist at that point. If f'(x) exists at the point of the local maximum, then it must equal 0. However, it is important to note that the existence of f'(x) is not a necessary condition for a function to have a local maximum. Therefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\nFor the second statement, the statement refers to the existence of non-constant continuous maps from the real numbers to the rational numbers. This statement is True, as it is possible to construct such maps. One example is the floor function, which maps real numbers to their greatest integer less than or equal to them. This function is continuous and non-constant, as it takes on different values on different intervals. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\nOverall, the correct answer is C: False, True.",
