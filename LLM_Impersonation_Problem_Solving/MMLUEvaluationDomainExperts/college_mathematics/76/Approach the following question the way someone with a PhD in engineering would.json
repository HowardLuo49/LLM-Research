    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach the first statement by considering the definition of a local maximum. For a function f to have a local maximum at a point x, it must be the case that f'(x) = 0 or does not exist. This is because at a local maximum, the derivative must be either zero or undefined (as the function is neither increasing nor decreasing at that point). Therefore, the statement \"f'(x) must exist and equal 0\" is not necessarily true for a function with a local maximum.\n\nRegarding the second statement, I would consider the concept of continuous maps between two sets. In this case, the statement asserts the existence of non-constant continuous maps from the real numbers (R) to the rational numbers (Q). It is indeed possible to construct such maps, as demonstrated by functions like the Dirichlet function which maps irrational numbers to 0 and rational numbers to 1. Therefore, the statement \"There exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q\" is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: False, True.",
