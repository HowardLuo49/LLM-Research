    "gpt_response": "A linear transformation P on a finite-dimensional real vector space V satisfying P^2 = P is known as a projection. \n\nI. P is invertible: A projection is not necessarily invertible since its range may be a proper subspace of V. Therefore, option I is not necessarily true.\n\nII. P is diagonalizable: A projection always has 0 and 1 as its eigenvalues, but it may not be diagonalizable if it does not have a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. Therefore, option II is not necessarily true.\n\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation: A projection that satisfies P^2 = P must have its image equal to its kernel, and it will be the identity transformation if and only if it projects onto the entire space V. Therefore, option III is not necessarily true.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the statements must be true in all cases. Thus, the correct answer is (A) None.",
