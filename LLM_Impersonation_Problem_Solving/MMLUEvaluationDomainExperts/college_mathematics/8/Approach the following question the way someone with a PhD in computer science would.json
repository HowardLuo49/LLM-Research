Let V be a finite-dimensional real vector space and let P be a linear transformation of V such that P^2 = P. Which of the following must be true?\nI. P is invertible.\nII. P is diagonalizable.\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\nA: None\nB: I only\nC: II only\nD: III only",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To analyze this question, we need to consider the properties of the linear transformation P such that P^2 = P. \n\nFirst, let's consider option I. If P is invertible, then there exists a linear transformation Q such that PQ = QP = I, where I is the identity transformation. However, given that P^2 = P, we can rewrite this as P^2 - P = 0, which can be factored as P(P - I) = 0. This implies that P is the zero transformation or P = I. Therefore, P may or may not be invertible. Option I is not a must be true statement.\n\nNext, let's consider option II. A linear transformation is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors. In this case, since P^2 = P, the minimal polynomial of P could be x, x - 1, or x(x-1). While P could be diagonalizable if it has distinct eigenvalues, it is not a must be true statement that P is diagonalizable.\n\nLastly, let's consider option III. Given that P^2 = P, we see that P(P-I) = 0. This means that the only eigenvalues of P are 0 and 1. If P has eigenvalues 0 and 1, then P must be either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. Therefore, option III is a must be true statement.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D: III only.",
