    "gpt_response": "As a computer science PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the definitions of compactness, connectedness, and the properties of continuous functions in the context of real analysis.\n\nFirst, we know that a subset K of R^n is said to be compact if every open cover of K has a finite subcover. A set is connected if it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty separated sets. A continuous real-valued function f defined on a subset of R^n is said to be bounded if there exists some real number M such that |f(x)| <= M for all x in the domain of f.\n\nI. Let's consider the statement \"If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\" This statement is true. Since K is compact, every continuous function defined on K is bounded. This is a well-known property of compact sets in real analysis.\n\nII. Now, let's consider the statement \"If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\" This statement is false. Just because every continuous function defined on K is bounded does not imply that K is compact. For example, consider the subset K = {x in R^2: ||x|| <= 1} which is bounded and every continuous function on K is bounded, but K is not compact.\n\nIII. Finally, let's analyze the statement \"If K is compact, then K is connected.\" This statement is also true. In fact, compact sets in Euclidean space are always connected. This is a well-known property of compact sets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and III only.",
