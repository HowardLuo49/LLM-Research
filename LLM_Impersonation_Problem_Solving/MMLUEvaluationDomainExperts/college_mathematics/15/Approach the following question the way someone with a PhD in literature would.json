    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is important to approach this question with a focus on critical analysis and intellectual rigor. Let us carefully consider each statement presented in the question and evaluate them within the context of mathematical definitions and concepts.\n\nStatement I states that if K is a compact subset of R^n, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded. This statement reflects a fundamental property of compact sets, specifically that continuous functions preserve compactness. By the definition of compactness, every continuous real-valued function defined on a compact set will attain its maximum and minimum values, thus ensuring that the function is bounded. Therefore, Statement I must be true.\n\nStatement II presents the converse of Statement I, stating that if every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K must be a compact set. This statement can be seen as a reflection of the Heine-Borel theorem, which states that in Euclidean spaces, a subset is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. However, the statement in itself is not necessarily true as a bounded set may not be closed and thus not necessarily compact. Therefore, Statement II is not universally true.\n\nStatement III proposes that if K is a compact subset of R^n, then K is connected. This statement aligns with the definition of compactness, which implies that the set is closed and bounded. A connected set cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets, and a compact set in Euclidean space must be connected. Therefore, Statement III is true.\n\nIn conclusion, Statement I and III must be true, while Statement II is not universally true. The correct answer is option D: I and III only.",
