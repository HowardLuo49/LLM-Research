    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of compact sets, bounded functions, and connected sets in relation to each other in a mathematical context.\n\nFirst, let's define some key terms:\n1. A set K in R^n is said to be compact if every open cover of K has a finite subcover. In simpler terms, a compact set is a closed and bounded set in R^n.\n2. A function f: K -> R is said to be bounded if there exists a constant M such that |f(x)| <= M for all x in K.\n3. A set K in R^n is said to be connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty open sets.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\nI. If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\nThis statement is true. It is a well-known result in analysis that continuous functions on compact sets are bounded. This is a consequence of the extreme value theorem, which states that a continuous function on a closed and bounded set attains its maximum and minimum values.\nTherefore, statement I must be true.\n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nThis statement is false. While it is true that if K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded (as shown in statement I), the converse is not necessarily true. There exist sets that are not compact but have all continuous real-valued functions defined on them bounded. An example is the closed interval [0, 1) in R, which is not compact but every continuous function on it is bounded.\nTherefore, statement II is false.\n\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nThis statement is true. It is a known result that compact sets in R^n are always connected. This is a consequence of the intermediate value theorem, which states that a continuous function on a connected set takes on all values between its maximum and minimum. Since compact sets are closed and bounded, they must be connected.\nTherefore, statement III is true.\n\nIn conclusion, statement I and III must be true, so the correct answer is D: I and III only.",
