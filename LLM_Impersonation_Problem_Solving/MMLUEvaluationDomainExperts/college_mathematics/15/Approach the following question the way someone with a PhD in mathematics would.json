If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\nThis statement is a well-known result from analysis. By the extreme value theorem, any continuous real-valued function on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum values, so it must be bounded. Therefore, Statement I is true.\n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nThis statement is not true. Consider the set K = (0, 1) in R. This set is not compact, but every continuous real-valued function defined on (0, 1) is bounded. For example, the function f(x) = 1/x is continuous on (0, 1) but not bounded. Therefore, Statement II is false.\n\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nThis statement is true. In topology, it is a well-known result that compact sets are connected. This follows from the fact that if a compact set were disconnected, it could be covered by a finite number of disjoint open sets, which would contradict the definition of compactness. Therefore, Statement III is true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is D: I and III only.",
