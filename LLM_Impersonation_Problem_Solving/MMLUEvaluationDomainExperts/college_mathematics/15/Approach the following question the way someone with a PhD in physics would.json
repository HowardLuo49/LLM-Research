If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must consider the definitions and properties of compact sets, continuous functions, bounded functions, and connected sets.\n\nFor statement I, if K is compact, then by the Heine-Borel theorem, K is closed and bounded. Since continuous functions on compact sets are uniformly continuous, we can conclude that if K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded. Therefore, statement I must be true.\n\nFor statement II, if every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, this does not necessarily imply that K is compact. For example, consider the set K = (0, 1), which is not compact but every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded. Therefore, statement II does not necessarily hold and is false.\n\nFor statement III, if K is compact, then it is closed and bounded. In Euclidean space, a compact set is also necessarily connected. Therefore, if K is compact, then K is connected. Thus, statement III must be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and III only.",
