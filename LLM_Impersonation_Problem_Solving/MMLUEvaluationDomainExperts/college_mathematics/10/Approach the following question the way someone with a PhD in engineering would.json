    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The complete graph with 10 vertices can be represented by a matrix where all entries are 1, except for the diagonal entries which are 0 (since there are no self-connections in a graph). \n\nThe number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices can be calculated using the formula (n * (n-1))/2, where n is the number of vertices. \n\nSubstitute n = 10 into the formula, we get (10 * (10-1))/2 = (10 * 9)/2 = 45. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 45 edges.",
