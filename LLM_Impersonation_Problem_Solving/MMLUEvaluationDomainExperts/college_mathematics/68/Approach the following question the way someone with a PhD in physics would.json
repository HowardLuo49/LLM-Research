    "gpt_response": "To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) about the x-axis, we can use the method of cylindrical shells.\n\nThe volume V of the solid generated by rotating a curve y = f(x) about the x-axis from x = a to x = b can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = \u222b[a,b] 2\u03c0x f(x) dx\n\nIn this case, the function is f(x) = x/(1 + x^3). To find the limits of integration, we need to find the points where f(x) intersects the x-axis. Setting f(x) = 0:\n\nx/(1 + x^3) = 0\nx = 0\n\nSo the limits of integration are from x = 0 to infinity.\n\nNow we can calculate the volume:\n\nV = \u222b[0,\u221e] 2\u03c0x (x/(1 + x^3)) dx\n  = \u222b[0,\u221e] 2\u03c0x^2/(1 + x^3) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can make a substitution u = 1 + x^3, so du = 3x^2 dx. This changes the integral to:\n\nV = \u222b[1,\u221e] (2\u03c0/3) du\n  = (2\u03c0/3)u |[1,\u221e]\n  = (2\u03c0/3)(\u221e - 1)\n  = 2\u03c0/3\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) about the x-axis is \u03c0/3.
