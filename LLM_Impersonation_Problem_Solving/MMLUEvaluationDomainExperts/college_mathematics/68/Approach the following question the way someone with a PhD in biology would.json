    "gpt_response": "To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) about the x-axis, we must use the method of cylindrical shells.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a solid generated by rotating a region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) about the x-axis is given by:\n\nV = \u222b [0, a] 2\u03c0x*f(x) dx \n\nwhere a is the x-value at which the function intersects the x-axis. In this case, f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) intersects the x-axis at x = 0.\n\nNow, substitute f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) into the formula:\n\nV = \u222b [0, a] 2\u03c0x*(x/(1 + x^3)) dx\nV = \u222b [0, a] 2\u03c0x^2/(1 + x^3) dx\n\nNow, we integrate the equation from x = 0 to x = a:\n\nV = \u222b [0, a] 2\u03c0x^2/(1 + x^3) dx\nV = \u03c0/3\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) about the x-axis is \u03c0/3.
