    "gpt_response": "To begin addressing this question, let us first decipher the given functional equation: f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]. This recursive equation suggests that the value of the function at any even integer n is dependent upon the sum of the square of that integer and the value of the function at the even integer one unit less than n. The fact that the function passes through the origin suggests that f(0) = 0.\n\nGiven this information, we can deduce that:\nf(2) = 1 + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\nf(4) = 4 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5\nf(6) = 9 + f(4) = 9 + 5 = 14\n\nNow, applying the recursive formula to calculate f(8):\nf(8) = 16 + f(6) = 16 + 14 = 30\n\nTherefore, the value of f(8) is 30, which aligns with option B.",
