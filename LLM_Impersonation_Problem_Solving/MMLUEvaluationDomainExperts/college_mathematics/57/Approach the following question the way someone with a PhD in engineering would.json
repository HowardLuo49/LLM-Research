In this case, V and W are 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4.\n\nSince both V and W are 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4, the maximum dimension of their intersection, V intersect W, can be at most 2. This is because the intersection of two subspaces can never have a dimension greater than the dimension of either subspace.\n\nNow, to determine the possible dimensions of the subspace V intersect W, we need to consider the following possibilities:\n1. If V intersect W is a subspace of dimension 0, this implies that V intersect W contains only the zero vector.\n2. If V intersect W is a subspace of dimension 1, this implies that V intersect W is a line passing through the origin.\n3. If V intersect W is a subspace of dimension 2, this implies that V intersect W is a plane passing through the origin.\n\nTherefore, the possible dimensions of the subspace V intersect W are 0, 1, and 2.
