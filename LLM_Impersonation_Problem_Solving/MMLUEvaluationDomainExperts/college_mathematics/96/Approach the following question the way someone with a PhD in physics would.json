To determine this, we must examine whether the complement of S in R^2 is open. The complement of S consists of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] for which both x and y are rational. Since the rationals are dense in the reals, any open ball around a rational point in the unit square will contain both rational and irrational points. Therefore, the complement of S in R^2 is not open, which implies that S is not closed in R^2.\n\nNext, let us consider whether S is connected or totally disconnected in R^2. Connectedness in a topological space implies that the space cannot be divided into two nonempty disjoint open sets. In the case of S, removing a single irrational point from the unit square will not disconnect S, as there will still be a path between any two points in S passing through the remaining irrational points. Therefore, S is connected in R^2.\n\nIn conclusion, the subset S in R^2 consisting of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] for which x or y, or both, are irrational is not closed, is connected, and is not totally disconnected with respect to the standard topology on R^2. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: connected",
