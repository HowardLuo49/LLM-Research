A set is open if every point in the set is an interior point. A set is connected if it cannot be divided into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. A set is totally disconnected if each connected component is a single point.\n\nConsidering the nature of S, which comprises all points in the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] where at least one of the coordinates is irrational, we can infer that S is composed of irrational points. This means that S does not contain its rational limit points and is, therefore, not closed. Additionally, since S consists of irrational points, it also does not contain any open sets within the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1]. Hence, S cannot be classified as open either.\n\nFurthermore, S can be partitioned into two disjoint open sets - one containing points with irrational x-coordinates and the other comprising points with irrational y-coordinates.
