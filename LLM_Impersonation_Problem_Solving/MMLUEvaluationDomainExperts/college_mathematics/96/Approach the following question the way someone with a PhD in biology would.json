Let S be the subset of R^2 consisting of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] for which x or y, or both, are irrational.

    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the topological properties of the subset S in R^2, we first need to understand the nature of irrational numbers as a subset of the real numbers. An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers.
