The set S consists of points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] where either x, y, or both are irrational numbers.\n\n1. Closed or Open:\nFor a subset to be closed in R^2, it must contain all its limit points. In this case, since the set S consists of points with irrational coordinates in the unit square, it does not contain all its limit points. For instance, points on the boundary of the unit square with rational coordinates are limit points not in S. Therefore, S is not closed in R^2.\n\nOn the other hand, to determine if S is open in R^2, we need to evaluate if for every point in S, there exists a neighborhood contained within S. Since the presence of a single irrational coordinate allows for a neighborhood of irrationals around that point, S can be considered open. Therefore, S is open in R^2.\n\n2. Connected:\nA subset is connected if it cannot be partitioned into two nonempty subsets that are separated, i.e., there is no separation of the set into two disjoint open sets. In the case of S, since there are no two disjoint open sets that separate the points of S due to the irrational numbers filling the unit square, S is connected in R^2.\n\n3. Totally Disconnected:\nA set is considered totally disconnected if it does not contain any nonempty connected subset. Given the nature of S where every point in the unit square has irrational coordinates, it can be shown that any possible subset of S cannot be connected, as the irrational numbers prevent any subset from being contiguous or connected. Therefore, S is totally disconnected in R^2.\n\nIn conclusion, with respect to the standard topology on R^2:\nA: S is not closed\nB: S is open\nC: S is connected\nD: S is totally disconnected",
