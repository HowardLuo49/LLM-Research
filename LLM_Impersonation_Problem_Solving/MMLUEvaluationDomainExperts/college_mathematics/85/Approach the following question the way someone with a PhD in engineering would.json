    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by utilizing my knowledge of set theory and mathematical analysis. \n\nFirst, let us consider the implications of A containing each rational number. Rational numbers are countable, meaning they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. Since the real line R is uncountable, it follows that A must also be uncountable if it contains each rational number.\n\nNow, let us address the given statements:\n\nA: If A is open, then A = R.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A can be open and still not equal to R. For example, the open interval (0, 1) is a subset of R but does not equal R.\n\nB: If A is closed, then A = R.\nThis statement is also not necessarily true. A can be closed and still not equal to R. For example, the closed interval [0, 1] is a subset of R but does not equal R.\n\nC: If A is uncountable, then A = R.\nThis statement is true. If A is uncountable and contains each rational number, then it must also contain irrational numbers. Since the real line R is the union of rational and irrational numbers, A must equal R.\n\nD: If A is uncountable, then A is open.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A can be uncountable and not open. For example, the set of real numbers [0, 1] is uncountable but not open.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement that must be true is C: If A is uncountable, then A = R.",
