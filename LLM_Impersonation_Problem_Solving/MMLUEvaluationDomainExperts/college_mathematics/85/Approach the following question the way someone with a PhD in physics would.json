Therefore, the given condition that A contains each rational number implies that A must be at least countable.\n\nLet's evaluate the statements one by one:\n\nA: If A is open, then A = R.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A could be an open subset of R that contains only rational numbers and not the entire real line. Therefore, statement A is not a must be true statement.\n\nB: If A is closed, then A = R.\nThis statement is also not necessarily true. A could be a closed subset of R that contains only rational numbers and not the entire real line. Therefore, statement B is not a must be true statement.\n\nC: If A is uncountable, then A = R.\nThis statement is must be true because if A is uncountable and contains each rational number, it must also contain the irrational numbers to form the complete real line R. Therefore, statement C is a correct statement.\n\nD: If A is uncountable, then A is open.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A could be uncountable and contain all rational and irrational numbers, but still be a closed subset of R.
