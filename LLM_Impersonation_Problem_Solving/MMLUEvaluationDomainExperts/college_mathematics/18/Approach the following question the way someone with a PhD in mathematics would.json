If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\nThis statement is true. The fact that A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C implies that B cannot be written as the union of disjoint nonempty open sets (since C is connected). Therefore, B is connected.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\nThis statement is also true. In a general topological space, if A and C are compact sets, their intersection must also be compact. Since A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, their intersection is B. Therefore, B is compact.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\nThis statement is false. Being Hausdorff is not a property that can be passed on like connectedness or compactness. B being a subspace of C being Hausdorff does not guarantee that B is Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: I and II only.",
