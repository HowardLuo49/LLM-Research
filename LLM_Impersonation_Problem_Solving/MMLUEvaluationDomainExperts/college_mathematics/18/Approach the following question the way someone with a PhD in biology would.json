If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\nThis statement is true. Since A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, B must be connected if both A and C are connected. This is because any separation of B into two disjoint open sets would also separate A and C, contradicting their connectedness.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\nThis statement is also true. Any open cover of B can be extended to an open cover of C, and then to a finite subcover since C is compact. Since C is a subset of B, this finite subcover can also cover B, making B compact.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\nThis statement is false. The Hausdorff property is not preserved under the formation of subsets. Even if A and C are Hausdorff, B may not necessarily be Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: I and II only.",
