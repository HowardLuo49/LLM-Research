    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Sofia and Tess each choose an integer from 1 to 10, and then determine the number of outcomes where neither integer chosen will be the square of the other.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 10 choices for Sofia and 10 choices for Tess, resulting in a total of 10 * 10 = 100 possible outcomes.\n\nNow let's consider the outcomes where neither integer chosen will be the square of the other. There are 9 integers from 1 to 10 that are not perfect squares (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10). For each of these integers, there are 8 possible integers that are not the square of the chosen integer. Therefore, there are 9 * 8 = 72 outcomes where neither integer chosen will be the square of the other.\n\nThe probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is given by the number of favorable outcomes (72) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (100):\n\nP(neither integer chosen is a square) = 72/100 = 0.72\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: 0.72.",
