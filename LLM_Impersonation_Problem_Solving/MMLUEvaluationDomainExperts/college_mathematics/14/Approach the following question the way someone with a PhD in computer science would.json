    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes where neither integer chosen is the square of the other.\n\nThere are 10 integers from 1 to 10. The total number of possible outcomes is given by 10*10 = 100, as each person can choose any one of the 10 integers.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of favorable outcomes. There are 3 pairs of integers (1,1), (2,4), and (3,9) where one integer is the square of the other. Therefore, there are 3 unfavorable outcomes out of 100 total outcomes.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is 100 - 3 = 97.\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is 97/100, which is 0.97.\n\nThus, the correct answer is not provided in the options given.",
