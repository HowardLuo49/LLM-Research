    "gpt_response": "In considering this question, we must first recognize the parameters of the problem. Sofia and Tess have 10 integers to choose from, ranging from 1 to 10. This provides a total of 100 possible outcomes (10 choices for Sofia multiplied by 10 choices for Tess).\n\nNext, we must identify the pairs of integers that would satisfy the condition of one integer being the square of the other. These pairs are (1, 1), (2, 4), and (3, 9). There are 3 such pairs out of the 100 possible outcomes, giving us a probability of 3/100 = 0.03.\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is 1 - 0.03 = 0.97. As none of the provided answer choices match this calculated probability, it seems there may be a mistake in the options provided.",
