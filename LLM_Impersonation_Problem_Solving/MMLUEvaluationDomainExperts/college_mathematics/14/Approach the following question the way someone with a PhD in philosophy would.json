What is the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other?\nA: 0.64\nB: 0.72\nC: 0.81\nD: 0.95",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other, we must first consider the total number of possible outcomes. Since both Sofia and Tess can each choose one of the 10 integers from 1 to 10, the total number of possible outcomes is 10 x 10 = 100.\n\nNext, we must consider the number of favorable outcomes, which in this case refers to pairs of integers where neither integer is the square of the other. In other words, we cannot have pairs such as (2, 4) or (4, 2) where one integer is the square of the other.\n\nThe integers from 1 to 10 and their squares are as follows:\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100\n\nFrom this list, we can see that there are 3 pairs of integers where one is the square of the other: (1, 1), (2, 4), and (3, 9).\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 100 - 3 = 97.\n\nThe probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is then calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 97/100 = 0.97.\n\nThus, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided.",
