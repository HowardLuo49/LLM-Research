    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first determine the total number of outcomes when Sofia and Tess each choose one of the 10 integers from 1 to 10, which is 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of outcomes where one integer chosen is the square of the other. There are 3 pairs of integers where one is the square of the other: (1, 1), (4, 2), and (9, 3).\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes where one integer chosen is the square of the other is 3.\n\nFinally, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is the complement of the probability that one integer chosen is the square of the other.
