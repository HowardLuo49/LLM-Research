    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first calculate the total number of ways to select 3 suitcases out of 25, which can be done using the combination formula (nCr). This results in 25C3 = 2300 possible ways to choose 3 suitcases.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 and 1 undamaged suitcase out of the remaining 20. This can be calculated as 5C2 * 20C1 = 200.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of 3 can be calculated by dividing the number of successful outcomes (200) by the total number of possible outcomes (2300). This results in a probability of 200/2300 = 2/23.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2/23.",
