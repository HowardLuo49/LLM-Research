    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged, we first need to determine the total number of ways in which we can select 3 suitcases out of 25. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items being selected. In this case, n = 25 and k = 3:\n\nC(25, 3) = 25! / (3!(25 - 3)!) = 25! / (3!22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2300\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways in which we can select exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 damaged ones, and 1 undamaged suitcase out of the 20 undamaged ones:\n\nC(5, 2) * C(20, 1) = (5! / (2!(5 - 2)!)) * (20! / (1!(20 - 1)!)) = (5 * 4 / 2) * 20 = 40 * 20 = 800\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = 800 / 2300 = 8 / 23 = 2/23\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2/23.",
