    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the probability that exactly 2 out of 3 randomly selected suitcases are damaged, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 available, multiplied by the number of ways to choose 1 undamaged suitcase out of the remaining 20 suitcases, divided by the total number of ways to choose any 3 suitcases out of the 25 available.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25 is given by the binomial coefficient ${25 \\choose 3} = 2300$. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 is ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$. The number of ways to choose 1 undamaged suitcase out of the remaining 20 is ${20 \\choose 1} = 20$. So, the total number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 3 selected is 10 * 20 = 200.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 out of 3 randomly selected suitcases are damaged is 200 / 2300 = 2/23. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: C: 2/23.",
