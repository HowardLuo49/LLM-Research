    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and probabilities. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25. This can be represented by the combination formula C(25,3) = 25! / (3!(25-3)!) = 2300.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 available damaged suitcases, and 1 undamaged suitcase out of the 20 available undamaged suitcases. This can be represented by the product of the combinations: C(5,2) * C(20,1) = 10*20 = 200.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability of choosing exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 3 chosen suitcases. This can be done by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (200) by the total number of outcomes (2300). \n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 suitcases are damaged is 200/2300 = 2/23. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2/23.",
