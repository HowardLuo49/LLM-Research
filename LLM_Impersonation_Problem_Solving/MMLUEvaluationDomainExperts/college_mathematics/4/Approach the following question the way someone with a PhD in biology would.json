    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of selecting exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of 3 randomly selected suitcases, we can use the hypergeometric distribution formula. The hypergeometric distribution calculates the probability of drawing a certain number of successes (in this case, damaged suitcases) from a finite population without replacement.\n\nThe formula for the hypergeometric distribution is:\nP(X=k) = ( (M choose k) * (N-M choose n-k) ) / (N choose n)\n\nWhere:\n- N is the total number of suitcases\n- M is the total number of damaged suitcases\n- n is the number of suitcases selected\n- k is the number of damaged suitcases selected\n\nIn this case, N = 25, M = 5, n = 3, and we want to find the probability of k = 2 damaged suitcases selected.\n\nPlugging in the values into the formula:\nP(X=2) = ( (5 choose 2) * (20 choose 1) ) / (25 choose 3)\nP(X=2) = (10 * 20) / 2300\nP(X=2) = 200 / 2300\nP(X=2) = 20 / 230\nP(X=2) = 2 / 23\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged is 2/23, which corresponds to option C.",
