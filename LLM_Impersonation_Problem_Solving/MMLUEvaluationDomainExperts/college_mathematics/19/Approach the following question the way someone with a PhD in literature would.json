    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in literature, I must admit that my expertise lies more in the analysis of literary texts rather than mathematical equations. However, I can approach this question by drawing on my critical thinking skills and understanding of mathematical concepts.\n\nGiven the recursive formula x_1 = 1 and x_(n+1) = sqrt(3+2x_n) for all positive integers n, we are asked to find the limit of the sequence {x_n} as n approaches infinity. \n\nIf it is assumed that the sequence {x_n} converges, then the limit of the sequence is the fixed point of the recursive formula x_(n+1) = sqrt(3+2x_n) as n approaches infinity.\n\nTo find this fixed point, we can set x_(n+1) = x_n = L, where L is the limit of the sequence. Substituting L into the recursive formula, we get L = sqrt(3+2L). \n\nSolving this equation for L, we get L = sqrt(3+2L). Squaring both sides, we get L^2 = 3 + 2L. Rearranging the terms, we get L^2 - 2L - 3 = 0. \n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get L = 3 or L = -1. However, since the sequence {x_n} is defined as a sequence of positive integers, the limit must be a positive number.
