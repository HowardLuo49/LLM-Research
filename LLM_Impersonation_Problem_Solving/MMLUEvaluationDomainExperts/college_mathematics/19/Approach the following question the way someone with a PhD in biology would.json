This problem can be solved using techniques related to sequences and limits.\n\nGiven the recursive sequence x_1 = 1 and x_(n+1) = sqrt(3+2x_n), we can first examine the behavior of the sequence as n approaches infinity. This can be accomplished by analyzing how the terms of the sequence evolve and converge.\n\nWe can start by calculating the first few terms of the sequence:\nx_1 = 1\nx_2 = sqrt(3 + 2(1)) = sqrt(5)\nx_3 = sqrt(3 + 2(sqrt(5)))\nx_4 = sqrt(3 + 2(sqrt(3 + 2(sqrt(5))))\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAs we continue this process of calculating subsequent terms of the sequence, a pattern arises where x_n approaches a limit as n approaches infinity. In this case, as n approaches infinity, x_n approaches a fixed value, which we can denote as the limit of the sequence.\n\nTo find the limit of the sequence, we can set x_(n+1) = x_n = L, where L represents the limit of the sequence as n approaches infinity.
