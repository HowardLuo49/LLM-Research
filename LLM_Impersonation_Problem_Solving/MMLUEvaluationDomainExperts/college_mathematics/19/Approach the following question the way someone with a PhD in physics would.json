    "gpt_response": "To approach this question in the manner of someone with a PhD in physics, we can use the concept of fixed points and convergence in dynamical systems. This type of problem falls under the field of dynamical systems and can be analyzed using tools from nonlinear dynamics.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the recurrence relation as x_{n+1} = sqrt(3+2x_n) as a continuous map in the form of a function f(x) = sqrt(3+2x).\n\nNext, we can analyze the fixed points of this map, which are the values of x such that x = f(x). Solving the equation x = sqrt(3+2x) for x will give us the fixed points. In this case, the fixed points are the values x = 0 and x = 3.\n\nTo determine the stability of these fixed points, we can consider the derivative of the function f(x). By analyzing the sign of the derivative at the fixed points, we can determine whether they are stable or unstable. In this case, we can find that x = 0 is an unstable fixed point and x = 3 is a stable fixed point.\n\nSince we are given that the sequence {x_n} converges, we can conclude that the limit of x_n as n approaches infinity will be the stable fixed point, which is x = 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 3.",
