An abelian group is defined as a group in which the operation is commutative, meaning that for all elements a, b in the group, ab = ba. Consequently, the given property (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 can be interpreted as suggesting that the group G is abelian.\n\nMoreover, the property (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 also implies that the group satisfies the identity (ab)^2 = e, where e represents the identity element of the group.
