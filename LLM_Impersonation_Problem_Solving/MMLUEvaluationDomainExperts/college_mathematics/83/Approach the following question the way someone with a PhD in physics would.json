    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question, we need to consider the properties of the subgroup of order seven and its elements within the larger group G. \n\nSince the subgroup of order seven does not contain any element that is its own inverse (other than the identity element), we know that every non-identity element has an inverse that is not itself. This implies that every non-identity element has an order of two. \n\nTherefore, if the subgroup of order seven has elements of order two, the total number of elements in G must be a multiple of seven (including the identity element). Furthermore, since every non-identity element of G has order two, the order of the group G cannot be odd, as that would imply an odd number of elements of order two, violating the closure property of groups.\n\nGiven the options provided, the only option that satisfies these criteria is option C: 35. The group G could be of order 35 with a subgroup of order seven satisfying the given conditions.",
