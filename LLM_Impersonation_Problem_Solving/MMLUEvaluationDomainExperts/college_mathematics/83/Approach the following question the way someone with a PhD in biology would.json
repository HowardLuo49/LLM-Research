This means that the subgroup is isomorphic to the group Z7, the integers modulo 7 under addition.\n\nFurthermore, we are told that no element in G (other than the identity) is its own inverse. This condition implies that all non-identity elements in G must be of even order, as an element being its own inverse implies that its order is two. \n\nBased on these conditions, we can deduce that the order of the group G must be a multiple of 7, but not necessarily a multiple of 14 (since there could be elements of order 2 within G). \n\nLooking at the options provided, we can eliminate Option A (27) as it is not a multiple of 7. Option B (28) is a possibility, as it is a multiple of 7 and does not violate any of the conditions given. Option C (35) is also a possibility, as it is a multiple of 7 and does not violate any of the conditions given. Option D (37) can be eliminated as it is not a multiple of 7.\n\nTherefore, based on the conditions given, the order of the group G could be either 28 or 35.",
