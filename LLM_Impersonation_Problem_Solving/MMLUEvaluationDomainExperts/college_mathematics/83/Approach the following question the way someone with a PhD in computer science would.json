    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we need to consider the properties of finite groups and the subgroup of order seven provided. \n\nSince the subgroup has an order of seven, this means that it must be a cyclic group generated by an element of order seven. This subgroup would consist of the identity element and six other elements of order seven. \n\nNext, we are given that no element in this subgroup is its own inverse, other than the identity element. In a group, the inverse of an element is simply another element that, when combined with the original element, yields the identity element. This implies that each non-identity element in the subgroup cannot be its own inverse, so each element must pair up with another element in the subgroup to generate the identity.\n\nWe also know that the subgroup of order seven must divide the order of the group G. This is a consequence of Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group itself.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that the possible orders of G would be a multiple of seven greater than seven. \n\nChecking each option:\nA: 27 - Not a multiple of seven greater than seven.\nB: 28 - Not divisible by seven.\nC: 35 - The order of the group G could potentially be 35, as it is divisible by seven and greater than seven. This is a possible solution.\nD: 37 - Not divisible by seven.\n\nTherefore, the order of G could be C: 35.",
