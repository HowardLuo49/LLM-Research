    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by utilizing my knowledge of group theory. \n\nFirstly, given that G contains a subgroup of order seven, we know that there exists an element of order seven within G. Additionally, we are given that no element, other than the identity, is its own inverse. This implies that every element in G is distinct from its own inverse.\n\nTo determine the possible orders of G, we can use the Lagrange's theorem: the order of a subgroup H of a group G divides the order of G. Therefore, the order of G must be a multiple of 7.\n\nGiven the options provided, we can eliminate option A (27) since 27 is not a multiple of 7. Option B (28) is a possibility since 28 is divisible by 7. However, we must further analyze option B to verify if it satisfies the conditions given.\n\nConsidering the element of order 7 within G, it generates a cyclic subgroup of order 7. Since G contains a subgroup of order 7, this cyclic subgroup must equal the entire subgroup of order 7. Therefore, G contains elements of order 7. However, we are also given that no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse, which would imply that the elements of order 7 would need to pair up to form inverses. This is a contradiction, indicating that 28 is not a valid order for G.\n\nBy process of elimination, we find that option C (35) is the most likely order for G. This is because 35 is divisible by 7 and if G contains a cyclic subgroup of order 7, it can satisfy the conditions specified in the question. Therefore, the order of G could be 35. Option D (37) is also a possibility, but without further information, it cannot be definitively determined.",
