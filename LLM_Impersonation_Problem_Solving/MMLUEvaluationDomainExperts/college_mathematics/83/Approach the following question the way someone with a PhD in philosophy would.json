    "gpt_response": "In addressing this question from the perspective of a philosopher with a PhD, we must first understand the inherent nature of groups, subgroups, and their properties. A group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of elements and an operation that combines any two elements to produce a third element in the set, satisfying certain properties such as closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses.\n\nIn this particular scenario, the finite group G contains a subgroup of order seven. This means that there are seven elements in this subgroup. Furthermore, it is stated that no element in G (other than the identity) is its own inverse. This implies that every non-identity element in G has a distinct inverse within the group.\n\nNow, let us consider the possible orders of G given this information. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains. Since the subgroup has order seven, there are at least seven elements in G. Additionally, each element in the subgroup must have an inverse, so there must be at least fourteen elements in G (seven original elements and their respective inverses).\n\nGiven the options provided, we can eliminate option A: 27, as it does not satisfy the necessary condition that G must have at least fourteen elements. Option B: 28 is a possibility, as it satisfies the conditions mentioned so far. However, we must also consider the order of the group in relation to the subgroup. \n\nThe order of the group must be a multiple of the order of the subgroup (Lagrange's theorem). In this case, since the subgroup has order seven, the order of the group must be a multiple of seven. Option C: 35 satisfies this requirement. Therefore, C is a possible answer.\n\nOption D: 37 is not a valid option because it does not meet the condition of being a multiple of seven, the order of the subgroup. Therefore, we can conclusively state that the order of G could be C: 35 in this scenario.",
