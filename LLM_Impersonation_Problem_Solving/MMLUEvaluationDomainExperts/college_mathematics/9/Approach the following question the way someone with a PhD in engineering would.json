On the other hand, a space is considered complete if every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a point in the space.\n\nIt is not true that every compact space is complete, as compactness and completeness are two distinct properties of a space. For example, the interval [0, 1) is compact but not complete, as the Cauchy sequence {1/n} does not converge in the space.\n\nSimilarly, it is not true that every complete space is compact. For example, the real numbers are complete but not compact, as the entire real number line cannot be covered by a finite number of open intervals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Neither (a) nor (b).",
