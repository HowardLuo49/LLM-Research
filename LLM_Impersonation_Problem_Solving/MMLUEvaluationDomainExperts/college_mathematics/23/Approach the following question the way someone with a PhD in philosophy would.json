A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?\nA: 2/81\nB: 1/18\nC: 2/27\nD: 1/9",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In approaching this problem, we must first delineate the probabilistic conditions outlined within the scenario. Given that the probability of rolling an even number on this counterfeit die is twice that of rolling an odd number, we can establish that the probability of rolling an odd number is 1/3 and the probability of rolling an even number is 2/3.\n\nNow, considering the specific event in question, where the die is thrown twice and the first roll results in a 5 and the second roll results in a 6, we must calculate the probability of this sequence occurring. \n\nThe probability of rolling a 5 (an odd number) on the first roll is 1/3, and the probability of rolling a 6 (an even number) on the second roll is 2/3. To calculate the overall probability of both events occurring as specified, we simply multiply these individual probabilities.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9. This can also be represented as 2/9 = 1/(3^2).\n\nGiven that the die is thrown twice, the overall probability of both rolls resulting in a 5 followed by a 6 can be determined by squaring the calculated probability of a single instance, resulting in 4/81 or 1/18.\n\nHence, the accurate solution to the original question is option B: 1/18.",
