A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?\nA: 2/81\nB: 1/18\nC: 2/27\nD: 1/9",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a literary perspective, it is essential to first establish the probabilities associated with the counterfeit die. Given that the probability of rolling any even number is twice that of rolling any odd number, we can establish the following probabilities:\n\nLet E be the event of rolling an even number and O be the event of rolling an odd number. Therefore, P(E) = 2P(O).\n\nSince the sum of the probabilities of rolling an even number and an odd number is equal to 1:\nP(E) + P(O) = 1\n2P(O) + P(O) = 1\nP(O) = 1/3\nP(E) = 2/3\n\nNow, to find the probability of rolling a 5 followed by a 6 on the counterfeit die, we can calculate the probabilities of each event separately and then multiply them:\n\nThe probability of rolling a 5 on the counterfeit die is 1/6 (since there are 6 faces and only one has a 5).\n\nThe probability of rolling a 6 on the counterfeit die is 1/6.\n\nNow, we can multiply these probabilities to find the probability of rolling a 5 followed by a 6:\nP(5) * P(6) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n\nTherefore, the probability that if the counterfeit die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6 is 1/36 or 2/27 (the closest answer choice).",
