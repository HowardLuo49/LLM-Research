A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?\nA: 2/81\nB: 1/18\nC: 2/27\nD: 1/9",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first define the probabilities of rolling an even number and an odd number on the counterfeit die. Let p be the probability of rolling an odd number and 2p be the probability of rolling an even number.\n\nAs there are three odd numbers and three even numbers on a six-sided die, we have the following equations:\n\n3p + 3(2p) = 1\n3p + 6p = 1\n9p = 1\np = 1/9\n\nNow that we have found the probabilities of rolling an odd and even number, we can calculate the probability of rolling a 5 followed by a 6 on two rolls of the die. The probability of rolling a 5 is 1/9, and the probability of rolling a 6 is also 1/9. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 5 followed by a 6 is (1/9) * (1/9) = 1/81.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that there are two possible ways in which this sequence can occur: 5 followed by 6 or 6 followed by 5. Therefore, we multiply the probability by 2 to get the final answer:\n\n2 * (1/81) = 2/81\n\nTherefore, the probability that the first roll is a 5 and the second roll is a 6 is 2/81. So, the correct answer is A.",
