A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?\nA: 2/81\nB: 1/18\nC: 2/27\nD: 1/9",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first define the probabilities of rolling odd and even numbers using the information given. Let the probability of rolling an odd number be x and the probability of rolling an even number be 2x.\n\nSince there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a standard die, the total probability must add up to 1:\n\n3x + 6x = 1\n9x = 1\nx = 1/9\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling an odd number is 1/9 and the probability of rolling an even number is 2/9.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of rolling a 5 followed by a 6. The probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll is 1/9 and the probability of rolling a 6 on the second roll is also 1/9. Therefore, the overall probability is (1/9) * (1/9) = 1/81.\n\nHowever, there are two ways this sequence can occur: roll a 5 first and then a 6, or roll a 6 first and then a 5. Therefore, the final probability is 2 * 1/81 = 2/81.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 2/81.",
