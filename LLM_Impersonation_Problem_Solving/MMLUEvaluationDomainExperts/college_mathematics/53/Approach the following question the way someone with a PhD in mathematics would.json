    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the area of an equilateral triangle, we use the formula: Area = (side length^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4.\n\nGiven that the inscribed circle has a radius of 2, we know that the radius of the circle is also the apothem of the equilateral triangle. The apothem is a segment that joins the center of the circle to the midpoint of a side of the triangle, forming a right angle with the side.\n\nSince the apothem is 2, we know that the height of the equilateral triangle is also 2. This means that the side length of the triangle is 4 (twice the height). \n\nPlugging this into the formula, we get:\nArea = (4^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4\nArea = (16 * sqrt(3)) / 4\nArea = 4 * sqrt(3)\nArea = 12*sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 12*sqrt(3), which corresponds to option C.",
