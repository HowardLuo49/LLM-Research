    "gpt_response": "To determine the area of an equilateral triangle with an inscribed circle of radius 2, we must first recognize that an equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles, each measuring 60 degrees. The radius of the inscribed circle is essentially the distance from the center of the circle to the points where the circle is tangent to the sides of the triangle.\n\nFrom each point where the circle is tangent to a side of the triangle, we draw a perpendicular line to the opposite side. By doing so, we split the original equilateral triangle into three smaller 30-60-90 right-angled triangles. \n\nThe radius of the inscribed circle becomes the shorter leg of these smaller triangles, while the longer leg is half the length of one side of the equilateral triangle, and the hypotenuse is the radius of the circumscribed circle (or circumcircle) of the original equilateral triangle.\n\nGiven that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2, the shorter leg of each smaller triangle is 2, and the longer leg is equal to half the length of a side of the equilateral triangle. \n\nBy using trigonometry and recognizing that the sine of 30 degrees is 1/2, we can determine that the length of a side of the equilateral triangle is 4.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula: (side)^2 * sqrt(3) / 4. Substituting in the value we have calculated for the side, the area of the equilateral triangle is (4)^2 * sqrt(3) / 4, which simplifies to 4 * sqrt(3), or 4*sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 12*sqrt(3).",
