    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the area of an equilateral triangle whose inscribed circle has a radius of 2, we need to understand the relationship between the side length of the triangle and the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal in length. Let's denote the side length of the triangle as \\( s \\). The radius of the inscribed circle is also known as the inradius. The relationship between the side length of an equilateral triangle and the inradius is given by the formula: \n\n\\[ r = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\]\n\nGiven that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2, we can set up the equation: \n\n\\[ 2 = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( s \\), we find:\n\n\\[ s = 12/\\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nNow, we can find the area of the equilateral triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle: \n\n\\[ A = \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{(4\\sqrt{3})^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{48\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 12\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is \\( 12\\sqrt{3} \\), which corresponds to option C.",
