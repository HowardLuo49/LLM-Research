    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the area of an equilateral triangle whose inscribed circle has a radius of 2, we first need to determine the side length of the triangle. \n\nThe radius of the inscribed circle is equal to the apothem of the equilateral triangle, which is the perpendicular distance from the center of the inscribed circle to one of the sides of the triangle. \n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the apothem is related to the side length by the formula: apothem = side length * \u221a3 / 2\n\nTherefore, apothem = 2 * \u221a3.\n\nSince the apothem divides the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles, the height of each smaller triangle is also equal to 2. \n\nUsing Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the side length of the equilateral triangle:\n\nside length = 2 * 2 / \u221a3 = 4 / \u221a3 = 4\u221a3 / 3.\n\nNow that we have the side length of the equilateral triangle, we can calculate the area using the formula for an equilateral triangle: \n\narea = (\u221a3 / 4) * (side length)^2\narea = (\u221a3 / 4) * (4\u221a3 / 3)^2\narea = (\u221a3 / 4) * (16 / 3)\narea = 4\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 12\u221a3, which corresponds to option C.",
