    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed with a circle of radius 2, we first need to find the length of the side of the triangle. \n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the radius of the inscribed circle is perpendicular to the side of the triangle and bisects it. Therefore, it divides the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\nThe side of the equilateral triangle can be found by considering the 30-60-90 right triangle formed by one side of the equilateral triangle, the radius of the inscribed circle, and half of the side of the equilateral triangle. \n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the longer leg is \u221a3 times the length of the shorter leg. Therefore, in this case, the side of the equilateral triangle is equal to 4\u221a3.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula A = (s^2\u221a3)/4, where s is the length of the side of the triangle. Substituting s = 4\u221a3 into the formula, we have A = (16*3\u221a3)/4 = 12\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 12\u221a3, which corresponds to option C.",
