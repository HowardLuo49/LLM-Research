Let k be the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 in the interval [0, 1], and let n be the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1]. Which of the following is true?\nA: k = 0 and n = 1\nB: k = 1 and n = 0\nC: k = n = 1\nD: k > 1",

    "gpt_response": "To properly tackle this question, let us first analyze the equation \\(e^x + x - 2 = 0\\) in the context of the interval [0, 1]. Given that the interval is confined to [0, 1], it is evident that the solution set must abide by these boundary conditions.\n\nNow, in considering the function \\(f(x) = e^x + x - 2\\), we observe that it is continuous and differentiable over the real numbers. Applying the Intermediate Value Theorem, since the function is continuous on the interval [0, 1] and assumes values of opposite signs at x = 0 (f(0) = -1) and x = 1 (f(1) = e - 1), it follows that there exists at least one real root within the interval [0, 1].\n\nThus, the statement B: k = 1, n = 0 is apt in this context. The existence of one real solution within the interval [0, 1] aligns with the conditions derived from the Intermediate Value Theorem and the nature of the function \\(f(x)\\) in question.",
