    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first recognizing that the given equation is a transcendental equation involving the exponential function e^x. To determine the number of real solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the function e^x + x - 2 in the specified interval [0, 1].\n\nFirst, we note that the exponential function e^x is always positive for all real values of x. Therefore, the term e^x is strictly increasing in the interval [0, 1]. Additionally, the linear function x is also strictly increasing in this interval. By considering these two functions together with the constant term -2, we can infer that the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 has a unique real solution in the interval [0, 1].\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: k = 1 and n = 0.",
