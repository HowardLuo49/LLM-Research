    "gpt_response": "In mathematics, especially in the area of analysis, it is important to carefully consider the definitions and properties of functions and their relationships. \n\nFor Statement 1, we are given that the function f:X\u2192Y is continuous and X is compact. In mathematics, the concept of uniform continuity is closely related to the notion of continuity. Specifically, a function f:X\u2192Y is said to be uniformly continuous if for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that for all x, y in X, |x - y| < \u03b4 implies |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5.\n\nWhen f is continuous on a compact set X, it follows that f is uniformly continuous on X. This is a well-known result called the Heine-Cantor theorem. Therefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nFor Statement 2, we are given that f(x) and g(x) : R \u2192 R are everywhere differentiable. The composition of differentiable functions may or may not always be differentiable. It is a known result that if f and g are differentiable functions, then the composition f(g(x)) is differentiable if and only if g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at g(x).\n\nTherefore, if f(x) and g(x) are everywhere differentiable, it does not necessarily imply that their composition f(g(x)) will also be everywhere differentiable. Hence, Statement 2 is False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: True, False.",
