    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of continuity and differentiability in mathematical functions. \n\nFor statement 1, we are given that the function f : X \u2192 Y is continuous and that X is compact. In mathematics, a function f is said to be uniformly continuous if for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that for all x,y in X, |x - y| < \u03b4 implies that |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5.\n\nSince X is compact, we know that every continuous function defined on X is uniformly continuous. This is because compactness guarantees that any sequence in X has a convergent subsequence, so continuity implies uniform continuity. Therefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nFor statement 2, we are given that f(x) and g(x) are everywhere differentiable functions. In mathematics, if a function is differentiable at a point, it is also continuous at that point. However, the composition of two differentiable functions may not necessarily be differentiable. \n\nA classic counterexample is the function f(x) = |x|, which is not differentiable at x = 0, but the composition f(f(x)) = |f(x)| is differentiable everywhere. Therefore, statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B: True, False.",
