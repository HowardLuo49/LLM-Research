    "gpt_response": "To determine the validity of the statements, we can break them down and apply relevant mathematical concepts.\n\nStatement 1:\nGiven that f : X \u2192 Y is continuous and X is compact. We need to prove that f must be uniformly continuous.\n\nIn mathematics, a function f : X \u2192 Y is said to be uniformly continuous if for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5 for all x, y in X whenever |x - y| < \u03b4.\n\nNow, since X is compact, f(X) is also compact. And for a continuous function on a compact set, f(X) is uniformly continuous. This is a well-known result in analysis, and therefore Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2:\nIf f(x) and g(x) : R \u2192 R are everywhere differentiable, we need to determine if f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable.\n\nTo prove this, we can approach it by considering the concept of composition of functions. The chain rule states that if f and g are differentiable, then the composition f(g(x)) is also differentiable.\n\nTherefore, it follows that if f(x) and g(x) are everywhere differentiable, then f(g(x)) must also be everywhere differentiable. Thus, Statement 2 is True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
