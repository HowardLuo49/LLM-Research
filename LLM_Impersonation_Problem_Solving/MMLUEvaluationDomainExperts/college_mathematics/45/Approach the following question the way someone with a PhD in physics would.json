    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the definitions of continuity, compactness, differentiability, and uniform continuity. \n\nIn Statement 1, we are given that f:X\u2192Y is continuous and X is compact. By definition, a function is uniformly continuous if for every \u03b5>0, there exists a \u03b4>0 such that for all x, y in X, if |x-y|<\u03b4, then |f(x)-f(y)|<\u03b5. \n\nSince X is compact, every continuous function on X is uniformly continuous. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nIn Statement 2, we are given that f(x) and g(x) are everywhere differentiable functions. If f and g are differentiable functions, then the composition f(g(x)) is also differentiable by the chain rule. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
