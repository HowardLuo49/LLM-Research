If a real number x is chosen at random in the interval [0, 3] and a real number y is chosen at random in the interval [0, 4], what is the probability that x < y?\nA: 1/2\nB: 7/12\nC: 5/8\nD: 2/3",

    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that x < y, we need to consider the area where x < y in the 2-dimensional space defined by the intervals [0,3] and [0,4]. \n\nThe total area of this space is a rectangle with sides of lengths 3 and 4, so the total area is 3*4 = 12.\n\nThe area where x < y is the region below the line y = x within this rectangle. This forms a triangle with base of length 3 and height of length 3, as the line y = x intersects the sides of the rectangle at (0,0), (3,3), and (4,4), forming a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 3.\n\nTherefore, the area where x < y is 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * 3 * 3 = 9/2.\n\nSo, the probability that x < y is given by the ratio of the area where x < y to the total area, which is 9/2 / 12 = 9/24 = 3/8. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed, but it should be 3/8.",
