    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that x < y, we must first visualize the sample space for both x and y. In this case, x is chosen from the interval [0, 3] and y is chosen from the interval [0, 4]. \n\nTo calculate the probability that x < y, we can draw a square with side lengths 3 and 4 to represent the intervals [0, 3] and [0, 4]. The points in this square represent all possible pairs (x, y) that can be chosen. \n\nThe region of interest is the triangle where x < y, which lies below the line y = x and above the x-axis.
