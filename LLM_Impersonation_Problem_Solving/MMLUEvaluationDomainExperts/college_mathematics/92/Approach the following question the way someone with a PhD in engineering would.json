If a real number x is chosen at random in the interval [0, 3] and a real number y is chosen at random in the interval [0, 4], what is the probability that x < y?\nA: 1/2\nB: 7/12\nC: 5/8\nD: 2/3",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that x < y, we first need to consider the possible outcomes when choosing x and y randomly in the given intervals. \n\nThe total area in the rectangular region formed by intervals [0, 3] and [0, 4] represents the total possible outcomes. This area is 3 * 4 = 12 units.\n\nNow, to find the probability that x < y, we can consider the area where x < y. This area is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), and (3,4). The area of this triangle is (1/2)*(3)*(4) = 6 units.\n\nTherefore, the probability that x < y is the ratio of the area where x < y to the total area, which is 6/12 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nA: 1/2",
