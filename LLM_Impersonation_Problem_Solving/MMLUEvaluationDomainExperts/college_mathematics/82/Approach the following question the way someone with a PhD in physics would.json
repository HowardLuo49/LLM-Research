    "gpt_response": "The answer is 4. \n\nIn general, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of a given order can be determined by analyzing the prime factorization of the order. In this case, the order of 72 can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2. \n\nAn Abelian group of order 2^3 * 3^2 can be uniquely decomposed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Therefore, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is equal to the number of ways in which the prime factorization of 72 can be partitioned. \n\nIn this case, there are 4 possible ways to partition the prime factorization of 72: \n- 2^3 * 3^2 \n- 2^3 * 3 * 3 \n- 2^2 * 3 * 3^2 \n- 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 \n\nTherefore, there are 4 structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72.",
