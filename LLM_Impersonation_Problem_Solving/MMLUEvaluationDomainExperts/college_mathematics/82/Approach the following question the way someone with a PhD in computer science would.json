    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 can be determined by factorizing 72 into its prime factors. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nFor each prime factor, we can form an Abelian group by choosing the exponent for each prime factor as the order of the corresponding cyclic group. Since each prime factor can be combined independently, the total number of possible Abelian groups is equal to the number of ways we can assign the exponents 3 and 2 to 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nIn this case, we have 2 choices for the exponent of 2 (0, 1, or 2) and 2 choices for the exponent of 3 (0 or 1). Therefore, the total number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 4.",
