    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72, we need to consider the prime factorization of 72. 72 can be factored as 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nIn an Abelian group of order p^n, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) Abelian group of that order. Therefore, we need to consider all possible combinations of the prime factors of 72 to determine the structurally distinct Abelian groups.\n\nThe possible combinations are as follows:\n- 2^3 * 3^2 = (2^3) * (3^2): This corresponds to the direct product of two cyclic groups of orders 8 and 9 respectively. There is only one structurally distinct group of this form.\n- 2^3 * 3^2 = (2^3 * 3) * 3 = (2^3) * (3^1) * (3^1): This corresponds to the direct product of three cyclic groups of orders 8, 3, and 3 respectively. There is only one structurally distinct group of this form.\n- 2^3 * 3^2 = (2^2 * 3) * (2 * 3) = (2^2) * (3^1) * (2) * (3^1): This corresponds to the direct product of four cyclic groups of orders 4, 3, 2, and 3 respectively.
