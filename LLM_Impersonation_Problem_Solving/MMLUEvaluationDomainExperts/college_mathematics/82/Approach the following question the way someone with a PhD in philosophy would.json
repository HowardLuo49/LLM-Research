We have:\n\n72 = 2^3 * 3^2\n\nNext, we must determine the number of ways we can partition these prime factors into partitions of different sizes, as each partition corresponds to a structurally distinct Abelian group.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, we can have partitions of size 1, 2, or 3. For the prime factor 3, we can have partitions of size 1 or 2. \n\nThus, the total number of partitions is given by:\n\n(3 choose 1) * (2 choose 1) = 3 * 2 = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72. \n\nOption B: 6",
