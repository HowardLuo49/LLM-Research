    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups with order 72, we must first factorize the order into its prime factors. The prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. \n\nAbelian groups of order 72 can be represented as direct products of cyclic groups of prime power order, with each factorization corresponding to a different structurally distinct Abelian group. \n\nIn this case, we have two primes, 2 and 3, each raised to a different power. Therefore, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72 is equal to the number of ways in which the prime factorization can be organized. \n\nThe possible factorizations are: \n- (2^3)(3^2) \n- (2^2)(2)(3^2) \n- (2^2)(3)(3) \n- (2)(2)(2)(3^2)\n- (2)(2)(3)(3)\n- (2)(3)(3)\n\nTherefore, there are 6 structurally distinct Abelian groups with order 72. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 6.",
