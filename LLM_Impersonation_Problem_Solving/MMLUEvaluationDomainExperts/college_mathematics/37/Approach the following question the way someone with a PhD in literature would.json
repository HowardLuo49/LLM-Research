Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the dimension of the subspace kernel of the linear transformation T, we must first understand that the kernel of T consists of all vectors in V that are mapped to the zero vector in W. In other words, the kernel of T is the set of all matrices M in V such that T(M) = 0.\n\nSince T is a linear transformation from V onto W, it is onto if and only if its range is all of W. In other words, for every vector in W, there exists a corresponding vector in V that maps to it under T. Therefore, the dimension of the range of T (dim(range T)) is equal to the dimension of W, which is 4.\n\nBy the Rank-Nullity Theorem, we know that dim(V) - dim(Kernel T) = dim(range T), where dim(V) is the dimension of V.\n\nThe dimension of V, the vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, is 2*3 = 6. \n\nTherefore, using the Rank-Nullity Theorem, we have:\n\n6 - dim(Kernel T) = 4\ndim(Kernel T) = 6 - 4\ndim(Kernel T) = 2\n\nThus, the dimension of the subspace kernel of T is 2.
