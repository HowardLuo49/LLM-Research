Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the dimension of the subspace kernel of the linear transformation T, we first need to consider the dimensions of the domain and codomain. The domain V consists of real 2x3 matrices, meaning it is a 6-dimensional vector space (2 * 3 = 6). The codomain W consists of real 4x1 column vectors, making it a 4-dimensional vector space.\n\nSince T is a linear transformation from V onto W, it must map all of V onto W. This implies that the dimension of the image of T is equal to the dimension of W, which is 4. \n\nBy the Rank-Nullity Theorem, we know that dim(V) = dim(kernel(T)) + dim(image(T)). \nTherefore, dim(kernel(T)) = dim(V) - dim(image(T)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A: 2.",
