Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the dimension of the kernel of the linear transformation T, we need to first consider the transformation itself. \n\nLet's denote the elements in V as a general 2x3 matrix A:\n\nA = [a b c]\n    [d e f]\n\nand the elements in W as a general 4x1 column vector B:\n\nB = [x]\n    [y]\n    [z]\n    [w]\n\nSince T is a linear transformation from V onto W, it can be represented by a 4x2 matrix M:\n\nM = [m11 m12]\n    [m21 m22]\n    [m31 m32]\n    [m41 m42]\n\nWhere M(A) = B.
