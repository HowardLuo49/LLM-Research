Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the dimension of the subspace kernel of a linear transformation T from V to W, we need to consider the nullity of the transformation. \n\nSince T is a linear transformation from V onto W, it means that T is a surjective (onto) mapping, which implies that the dimension of the range of T is equal to the dimension of W, which is 4.\n\nBy the Rank-Nullity Theorem in linear algebra, we know that the sum of the dimension of the image (range) of T and the dimension of the kernel of T is equal to the dimension of the domain of T. Therefore, we have:\n\ndim(V) = dim(ker(T)) + dim(range(T))\n\ndim(V) = 6 (since V is the vector space of all real 2x3 matrices)\ndim(range(T)) = 4\n\nTherefore, we can solve for the dimension of the kernel of T:\n\ndim(ker(T)) = dim(V) - dim(range(T)) = 6 - 4 = 2\n\nThus, the dimension of the subspace kernel of T is 2.
