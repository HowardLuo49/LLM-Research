Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the dimension of the kernel of T, we first need to consider the dimensions of V and W. \n\nThe vector space V consists of all real 2 x 3 matrices, which is essentially a collection of vectors in three-dimensional space. Therefore, dim(V) = 3.\n\nThe vector space W consists of all real 4 x 1 column vectors, which is essentially a collection of vectors in four-dimensional space. Therefore, dim(W) = 4.\n\nSince T is a linear transformation from V onto W, it means that T maps every vector in V to a unique vector in W. This implies that T is injective (one-to-one).\n\nNow, from the Rank-Nullity Theorem, we have dim(V) = dim(ker(T)) + dim(im(T)), where dim(im(T)) is the dimension of the image of T.\n\nSince T is onto, dim(im(T)) = dim(W) = 4.\n\nTherefore, dim(ker(T)) = dim(V) - dim(im(T)) = 3 - 4 = -1.\n\nHowever, the dimension of a subspace cannot be negative. Therefore, the dimension of the subspace kernel of T is 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not given in the choices provided.",
