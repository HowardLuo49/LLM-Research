S(n) is a statement about positive integers n such that whenever S(k) is true, S(k + 1) must also be true. Furthermore, there exists some positive integer n0 such that S(n0) is not true. Of the following, which is the strongest conclusion that can be drawn?\nA: S(n0 + 1) is not true.\nB: S(n0 - 1) is not true.\nC: S(n) is not true for any n <= n0\nD: S(n) is not true for any n >= n0",

The fact that whenever S(k) is true, S(k + 1) must also be true implies that the statement S(n) must hold for all positive integers greater than or equal to n0.\n\nGiven that S(n0) is not true, this means that the statement S(n) is not true for any integer less than n0.
