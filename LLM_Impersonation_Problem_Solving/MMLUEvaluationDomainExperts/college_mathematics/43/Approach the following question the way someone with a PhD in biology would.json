    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a PhD in biology, we need to remember that matrices and traces are mathematical concepts commonly used in fields such as bioinformatics and systems biology.\n\nI. The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. The trace of A^2 would be the sum of the squares of the diagonal elements. Since the squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, it follows that the trace of A^2 is nonnegative. Therefore, statement I is TRUE.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, this implies that A is idempotent. The trace of A is the sum of its diagonal elements, which are the eigenvalues of A. For an idempotent matrix, the eigenvalues are either 0 or 1. Since the trace of A is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues, and the only possible values are nonnegative, it follows that the trace of A is nonnegative. Therefore, statement II is TRUE.\n\nIII. The trace of a product of matrices is not necessarily equal to the product of the traces of the individual matrices. Therefore, statement III is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: I and II only.",
