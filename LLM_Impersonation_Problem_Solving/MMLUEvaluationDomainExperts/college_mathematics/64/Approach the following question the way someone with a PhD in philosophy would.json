A group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility properties.\n\nOption A: The integers under addition is a group. The set of integers, denoted by Z, under addition satisfies the group properties. It is a closed under addition, associative, has an identity element (zero), and each element has an inverse.\n\nOption B: The nonzero integers under multiplication is NOT a group. While the set of nonzero integers, denoted by Z^*, under multiplication is closed and associative, it lacks an identity element as there is no number in the set that serves as a multiplicative identity.\n\nOption C: The nonzero real numbers under multiplication is a group. The set of nonzero real numbers, denoted by R^*, under multiplication satisfies the group properties, including closure, associativity, identity (1), and invertibility.\n\nOption D: The complex numbers under addition is a group.
