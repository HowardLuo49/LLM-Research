The\ncone\u2019s height and radius are 2 cm and 1 cm, respectively. At what rate does the height of the water change\nwhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone?

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use related rates. Let's denote the height of the water in the cone as h and the rate at which this height is changing as dh/dt. We are given that the volume of the cone at any time t is V = (\u03c0/3)*r^2*h, where r is the radius of the cone and h is its height.\n\nWe are also given that water is dripping out of the hole at a constant rate of 3 cm^3/min. This means that the rate of change of the volume of water in the cone is -3 cm^3/min.\n\nFrom the formula for the volume of a cone, we can differentiate both sides with respect to t to get dV/dt = (\u03c0/3)*(2*r*dr/dt*h + r^2*dh/dt). Since the radius of the cone is half of the height (r = 0.5h), we can substitute r = 0.5h into the equation to get dV/dt = (\u03c0/3)*(2*0.5h*0.5*dh/dt*h + (0.5h)^2*dh/dt) = (\u03c0/3)*(0.5h*dh/dt*h + 0.25h^2*dh/dt) = (\u03c0/3)*(0.5h^2*dh/dt + 0.25h^2*dh/dt) = (\u03c0/3)*(0.75h^2*dh/dt) = (\u03c0/4)*h^2*dh/dt.\n\nSubstitute dV/dt = -3 cm^3/min into the equation and h = 1.5 cm (half a centimeter below the top of the cone) to find dh/dt:\n-3 = (\u03c0/4)*(1.5)^2*dh/dt\n-3 = (\u03c0/4)*2.25*dh/dt\n-3 = (9\u03c0/4)*dh/dt\ndh/dt = -3*(4/9\u03c0)\ndh/dt = -4/(3\u03c0)\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the height of the water is changing when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone is -4/(3\u03c0) cm/min.
