    "gpt_response": "To determine whether there exist distinct points P and Q such that f has a local maximum or a saddle point at each point, we must analyze the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy. \n\nFirst, we find the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y: \n\n\u2202f/\u2202x = 3x^2 + 3y \n\u2202f/\u2202y = 3y^2 + 3x \n\nSetting both partial derivatives equal to 0, we obtain the following system of equations: \n3x^2 + 3y = 0 \n3y^2 + 3x = 0 \n\nFrom the first equation, we have y = -x^2. Substituting this into the second equation, we get: \n3(-x^2)^2 + 3x = 0 \n3x^4 + 3x = 0 \nx(1 + x^3) = 0 \n\nTherefore, x = 0 or x = -1.
