As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\nA: 12*sqrt(2)\nB: 6*sqrt(2)\nC: 4*sqrt(2)\nD: 1/(2*sqrt(2))",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward, we can use related rates. Let x represent the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y represent the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. \n\nSince the ladder is 9 meters in length, we have the relation x^2 + y^2 = 9^2. Differentiating with respect to time t, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0.\n\nAt the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground, y = 3 meters. We are given that dx/dt = 2 m/s. Substituting these values, we get:\n\n2x(2) + 2(3)(dy/dt) = 0,\n4x + 6(dy/dt) = 0.\n\nTo find x at this moment, we can use another right triangle formed by the distance along the wall (x) and the distance up the wall (3). This relation gives us x = sqrt(9 - 3^2) = sqrt(9 - 9) = 0.\n\nNow, substituting x = 0 into the equation 4x + 6(dy/dt) = 0, we get:\n\n6(dy/dt) = 0,\ndy/dt = 0.\n\nTherefore, the top end of the ladder will be sliding downward at 0 m/s at the moment it is 3 meters above the ground. \n\nSo, the answer is 0, which is not one of the provided options.",
