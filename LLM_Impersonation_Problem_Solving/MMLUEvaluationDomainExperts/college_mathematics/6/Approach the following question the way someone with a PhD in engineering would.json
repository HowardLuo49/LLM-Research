As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\nA: 12*sqrt(2)\nB: 6*sqrt(2)\nC: 4*sqrt(2)\nD: 1/(2*sqrt(2))",
