As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\nA: 12*sqrt(2)\nB: 6*sqrt(2)\nC: 4*sqrt(2)\nD: 1/(2*sqrt(2))",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use related rates. Let x be the distance of the bottom end of the ladder from the wall and y be the height of the top end of the ladder above the ground. \n\nWe know that the ladder is 9 meters long, so x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 = 81. Differentiating this equation implicitly with respect to time t, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nGiven that dx/dt = 2 m/s and we want to find dy/dt when y = 3m, we can substitute these values into the equation and solve for dy/dt:\n\n2(2)(2) + 2(3)(dy/dt) = 0\n4 + 6(dy/dt) = 0\n6(dy/dt) = -4\ndy/dt = -4/6\ndy/dt = -2/3 m/s\n\nSince we want the magnitude of the velocity, the answer is |dy/dt| = 2/3 m/s = 2*(1/sqrt(3)) = 2*sqrt(3)/3 m/s \u2248 1.16 m/s\n\nTherefore, the top end of the ladder will be sliding downward at a speed of approximately 1.16 m/s. Since none of the answer choices match this result, we can conclude that the correct answer is not listed.",
