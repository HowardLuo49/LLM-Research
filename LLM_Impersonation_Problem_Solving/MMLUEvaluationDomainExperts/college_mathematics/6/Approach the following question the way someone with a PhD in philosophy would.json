    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. A ladder 9 meters in length is leaning against a vertical wall on level ground. As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\nA: 12*sqrt(2)\nB: 6*sqrt(2)\nC: 4*sqrt(2)\nD: 1/(2*sqrt(2))",

    "gpt_response": "Let us consider the ladder as a right-angled triangle, where the ladder itself represents the hypotenuse, the vertical wall represents the adjacent side, and the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall represents the opposite side. Let x be the distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, and let y be the height at which the ladder is above the ground.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 9^2\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time t, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nGiven that dx/dt = 2 meters per second (because the bottom end of the ladder is moving away from the wall at 2 meters per second), we need to find dy/dt when y = 3 meters.\n\nSubstitute x = 9 - 2t and y = 3 into the first equation:\n\n(9 - 2t)^2 + 3^2 = 81\n81 - 36t + 4t^2 + 9 = 81\n4t^2 - 36t + 9 = 0\n\nSolving for t using the quadratic formula, we get t = (18 \u00b1 3sqrt(2))/4\n\nSince we are interested in the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward, we need to evaluate dy/dt at y = 3:\n\ndy/dt = -(x(dy/dt))/(y)\n\nWhen y = 3, dy/dt = -(9(2))/(3) = -6\n\nTherefore, the top end of the ladder will be sliding downward at a rate of 6 meters per second at the moment when the top end of the ladder is 3 meters above the ground. Hence, the correct answer is B: 6*sqrt(2).",
