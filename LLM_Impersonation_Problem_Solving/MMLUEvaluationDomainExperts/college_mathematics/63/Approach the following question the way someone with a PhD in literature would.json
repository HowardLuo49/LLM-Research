In a game two players take turns tossing a fair coin; the winner is the first one to toss a head. The probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is\nA: 1/4\nB: 1/3\nC: 1/2\nD: 2/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In examining the probability of the outcome of this game, one must first acknowledge the fundamental principles of probability theory as they pertain to coin tossing. With each toss of a fair coin, the probability of flipping a head is 1/2, and the probability of flipping a tail is also 1/2. \n\nIn the scenario described, two players take turns flipping the coin until one of them achieves the desired outcome of flipping a head. Given that the coin is fair and the players take turns in a sequential manner, it is evident that the player who tosses the coin first has a distinct advantage over the other player. This advantage arises from the fact that the player who goes first has an extra opportunity to win the game compared to the second player. \n\nTo determine the probability that the first player wins the game, one can employ a systematic analysis of the possible outcomes. Let us denote the probability of the first player winning as P. The first player can win on the first toss (with a probability of 1/2), or lose on the first toss and win on the second toss (with a probability of 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4), or lose on the first two tosses and win on the third toss (with a probability of 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8), and so on. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the first player wins the game can be calculated by summing the infinite geometric series that represents the various possible outcomes. This series converges to a value of 2/3, indicating that the probability of the first player winning is 2/3.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question posed is:\nD: 2/3",
