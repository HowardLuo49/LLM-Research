In a game two players take turns tossing a fair coin; the winner is the first one to toss a head. The probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is\nA: 1/4\nB: 1/3\nC: 1/2\nD: 2/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, the outcome of each coin toss is independent and equally likely, with a 1/2 chance of landing heads and a 1/2 chance of landing tails. Thus, the player who makes the first toss has a 1/2 chance of winning on their first toss. If they do not win on their first toss, the game essentially restarts, but with roles reversed. Therefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss ultimately wins the game can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(win on first toss) = 1/2\nP(lose on first toss and win on second toss) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nP(lose on first and second toss and win on third toss) = (1/2)(1/2)(1/2) = 1/8\n...\n\nThis can be expressed as a geometric series:\nP(player 1 wins) = 1/2 + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^3 + ... = 1/2 * (1 + 1/2 + (1/2)^2 + ...) = 1/2 * (1 / (1 - 1/2)) = 1/2 * (1 / 1/2) = 1\n\nTherefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is 1.
