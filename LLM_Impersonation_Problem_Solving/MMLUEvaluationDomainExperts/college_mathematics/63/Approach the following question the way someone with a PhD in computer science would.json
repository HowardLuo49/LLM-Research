In a game two players take turns tossing a fair coin; the winner is the first one to toss a head. The probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is\nA: 1/4\nB: 1/3\nC: 1/2\nD: 2/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To analyze this situation, we can consider the possible outcomes of the game. \n\nLet's denote the players as Player A and Player B. The game can end in 1 or more tosses, with Player A making the first toss.\n\nIf the game ends in 1 toss, Player A wins with a probability of 1/2. This can happen if Player A tosses a head in the first toss. \n\nIf the game ends in 3 tosses, Player A wins with a probability of (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8. This can happen if Player A tosses a tail in the first toss, then Player B tosses a tail in the second toss, and finally Player A tosses a head in the third toss. \n\nSimilarly, if the game ends in 5 tosses, Player A wins with a probability of (1/2)^5 = 1/32. \n\nTherefore, the overall probability that Player A wins the game can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of Player A winning in 1 toss, 3 tosses, 5 tosses, and so on. \n\nThis sum can be expressed as:\n\nP(A wins) = (1/2) + (1/8) + (1/32) + ... = 1/2 + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + ... \n\nThis is a geometric series and can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\nP(A wins) = 1/2 / (1 - 1/4) = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is 2/3. Hence, the answer is option D: 2/3.",
