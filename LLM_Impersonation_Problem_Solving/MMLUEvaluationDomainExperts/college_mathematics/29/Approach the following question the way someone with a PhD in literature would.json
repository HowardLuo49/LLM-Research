    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The largest order of an element in the group of permutations of 5 objects is 15. This can be determined by considering the possible permutations of the 5 objects, which would be 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that applying that element to itself n times gives the identity element. In this case, the largest order of an element would be the least common multiple of all the orders of the individual permutations, which would be 15. So, the correct answer is D: 15.",
