    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in computer science, we need to carefully analyze each statement and determine their validity based on mathematical principles.\n\nFor Statement 1:\nThe first statement is related to rearrangements of series in mathematics. It is known that for a conditionally convergent series, the terms can be rearranged to obtain any desired sum, including infinity. The Riemann series theorem states that for a conditionally convergent series \u2211 a_n, there exists a permutation of the terms such that the rearranged series can converge to any desired real number or diverge. Therefore, the statement that there is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that \u2211 a_i_k = 4 is true, based on the Riemann series theorem.\n\nFor Statement 2:\nThe second statement involves metric spaces, closed and bounded sets, and continuous mappings. In mathematics, a continuous mapping preserves certain properties of sets. For a continuous mapping f from a closed and bounded set X to Y, the image f(X) is also expected to be closed and bounded. The statement claims the opposite, that there exists a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \"closed and bounded.\" This statement contradicts the properties of continuous mappings and closed and bounded sets in mathematics, making the statement false.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, the correct answer would be:\nB: True, False.",
