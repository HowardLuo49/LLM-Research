    "gpt_response": "To approach this question like someone with a PhD in engineering, we must utilize our knowledge of abstract concepts in mathematics and apply rigorous reasoning to analyze the statements provided.\n\nStatement 1 involves the concept of rearrangements in series. We are given that the absolute values of the terms in the series diverge, while the series itself converges to 2. This implies that the series consists of both positive and negative terms of varying magnitudes. By rearranging the terms in a specific way (a_i_k), we are able to obtain a new series that converges to 4. This result is known as Riemann's rearrangement theorem, which states that for a conditionally convergent series, its terms can be rearranged to converge to any real number or even diverge. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 pertains to the properties of metric spaces and continuous mappings. It asserts the existence of metric spaces X and Y, where X is closed and bounded, and a continuous mapping f from X to Y such that the image f(X) is not closed and bounded. This statement contradicts a fundamental result in topology, where the continuous image of a closed and bounded set is closed and bounded. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: False, True.",
