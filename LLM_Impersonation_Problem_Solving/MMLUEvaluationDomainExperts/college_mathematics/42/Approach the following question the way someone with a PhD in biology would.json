    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in biology, we can utilize our understanding of calculus and function properties. \n\nGiven that f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on the open interval (-1, 4), and f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, we can infer that the function is increasing and has a minimum rate of change of -1. \n\nSince f(3) = 5, we know that the function passes through the point (3, 5). From the properties of the function, we can deduce that the function is increasing towards the left as well. \n\nTo find the greatest possible value of f(0), we can consider that the function is continuously increasing and has a minimum rate of change of -1. Therefore, the function will reach its maximum value at the left edge of the interval (-1, 4), which is at x = -1. \n\nSince we know that f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, the maximum value of f(0) can be found by considering the distance between f(0) and f(-1). Because the function is continuously increasing with a minimum rate of change of -1, the maximum value of f(0) will occur when the function has increased by 1 unit from f(-1).\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of f(0) is 4. \n\nHence, the correct answer is B: 4.",
