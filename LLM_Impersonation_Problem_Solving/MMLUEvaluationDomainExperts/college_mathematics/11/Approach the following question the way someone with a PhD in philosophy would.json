Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",

    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the probability that the value of at least one of the random variables X and Y is greater than 3, we can first find the probability that the value of both X and Y is at most 3 and then subtract this from 1.\n\nThe probability that both X and Y take values at most 3 is given by:\n\nP(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = P(X = 1 or X = 2 or X = 3) * P(Y = 1 or Y = 2 or Y = 3)\n\n= (1/2^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3)^2\n\n= (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8)^2\n\n= (7/8)^2\n\n= 49/64\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the random variables X and Y is greater than 3 is:\n\n1 - P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB: 15/64",
