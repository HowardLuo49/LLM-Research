Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3, we can use the complementary probability. \n\nThe complementary event is that both X and Y take values of 3 or less. The probability that X = 1 or 2 or 3 is given by:\n\nP(X \u2264 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = (1/2^1) + (1/2^2) + (1/2^3) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\nSince X and Y are independent, the probability that Y = 1 or 2 or 3 is the same as that of X:\n\nP(Y \u2264 3) = P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2) + P(Y = 3) = (1/2^1) + (1/2^2) + (1/2^3) = 7/8\n\nTherefore, the probability that both X and Y take values of 3 or less is:\n\nP(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = P(X \u2264 3) * P(Y \u2264 3) = (7/8) * (7/8) = 49/64\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of X and Y is greater than 3 is:\n\nP(at least one of X and Y > 3) = 1 - P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 15/64.",
