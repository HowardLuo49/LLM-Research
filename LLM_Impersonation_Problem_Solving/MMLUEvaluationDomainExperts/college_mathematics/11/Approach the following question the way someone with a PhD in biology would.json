Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3, we need to first calculate the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nThe probability that X is less than or equal to 3 is:\nP(X \u2264 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8\n\nSimilarly, the probability that Y is less than or equal to 3 is also 7/8.\n\nSince X and Y are independent, the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3 is:\nP(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = P(X \u2264 3) * P(Y \u2264 3) = (7/8) * (7/8) = 49/64\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 is:\nP(at least one > 3) = 1 - P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64\n\nTherefore the correct answer is:\nB: 15/64",
