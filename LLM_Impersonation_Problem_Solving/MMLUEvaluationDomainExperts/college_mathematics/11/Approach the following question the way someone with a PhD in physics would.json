Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we consider the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3 and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that at least one of them is greater than 3.\n\nThe probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3 is given by:\nP(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) = P(X \u2264 3) * P(Y \u2264 3) \n= (1/2^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3)*(1/2^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3)\n= (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8)*(1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8)\n= (7/8)*(7/8)\n= 49/64\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 is:\nP(at least one of X, Y > 3) = 1 - P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) \n= 1 - 49/64 \n= 15/64\n\nSo, the answer is B: 15/64.",
