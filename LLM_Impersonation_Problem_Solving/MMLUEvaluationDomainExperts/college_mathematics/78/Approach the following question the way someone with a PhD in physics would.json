    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular yard using a total of x feet of fencing, we need to consider the properties of a rectangle. \n\nLet the length of the rectangular yard be L and the width be W. Since we are given that the total fencing is x feet and three sides of the yard are fenced, we can express the perimeter in terms of x:\n\nPerimeter = 2L + W = x\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = x - 2L\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by A = L * W. Substituting the expression for W:\n\nA = L * (x - 2L)\n\nExpanding:\n\nA = xL - 2L^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to differentiate A with respect to L and set it equal to zero to find the critical point:\n\ndA/dL = x - 4L = 0\n4L = x\nL = x/4\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for A:\n\nA = x(x/4) - 2(x/4)^2\nA = x^2/4 - x^2/8\nA = 2x^2/8 - x^2/8\nA = x^2/8\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x is x^2/8. So, the correct answer is B.",
