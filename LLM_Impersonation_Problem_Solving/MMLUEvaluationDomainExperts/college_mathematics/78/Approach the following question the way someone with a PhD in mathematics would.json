    "gpt_response": "To maximize the area of a rectangular yard given a fixed amount of fencing, we should consider that the sum of the lengths of two sides of the rectangle will be equal to the length of the fencing. Let's say the length and width of the rectangular yard are L and W respectively, then the perimeter is given by:\n\n2L + W = x\n\nSolving for W in terms of L we get:\n\nW = x - 2L\n\nThe area of the rectangular yard is given by:\n\nA = L * W\n\nSubstituting W in terms of L into the area equation, we get:\n\nA = L(x - 2L)\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\nA = xL - 2L^2\n\nTo find the maximum possible area, we differentiate the area equation with respect to L and set it to zero to find the critical points:\n\ndA/dL = x - 4L = 0\n\n4L = x\n\nL = x/4\n\nSubstitute L = x/4 back into the area equation:\n\nA = (x/4)(x - 2(x/4))\n\nA = (x^2)/4 - (x^2)/8\n\nA = (x^2)/8\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the rectangular yard in terms of x is B: x^2/8.",
