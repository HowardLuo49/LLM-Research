    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x, we must consider the relationship between the length of the fence and the area of the rectangular yard. \n\nLet the length of the yard be L and the width be W. Since there are three sides of fencing, the total length of fencing used is L + 2W = x. Solving for L in terms of W, we get L = x - 2W.\n\nThe area of the rectangular yard is given by A = L * W. Substituting the expression for L, we get A = (x - 2W) * W = xW - 2W^2.\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of A with respect to W and setting it equal to zero: dA/dW = x - 4W = 0. Solving for W, we get W = x/4. \n\nSubstitute this value back into the area formula, we get A = x * (x/4) - 2(x/4)^2 = x^2/4 - x^2/16 = 3x^2/16.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x is x^2/4. \nC: x^2/4",
