    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In relation to the given question, the task is to determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular yard that can be formed with a total of x feet of fencing for three sides. To approach this mathematically, it must first be understood that a rectangular yard requires two equal lengths for the sides, and one length for the side opposite those two equal lengths.\n\nLet the two equal lengths of the rectangular yard be represented by the variable 'a' and the length of the opposite side be represented by the variable 'b'. Given that the total length of fencing is x feet, it can be stated that:\n\n2a + b = x\n\nConsidering that it is a rectangular yard, the area of the rectangular yard (A) can be given as:\n\nA = a * b\n\nWith the constraint that the total fencing length is x, it can be solved that b = x - 2a.\n\nSubstituting b into the area equation, it yields:\n\nA = a(x - 2a)\nA = ax - 2a^2\n\nIn order to find the maximum possible area, differentiation must be carried out to determine where the area function reaches its maximum value. Taking the derivative of A with respect to 'a' and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndA/da = x - 4a = 0\n4a = x\na = x/4\n\nSubstitute the value of 'a' back into the area equation to obtain the maximum possible area:\n\nA = (x/4)(x - 2(x/4))\nA = (x/4) * (x - x/2)\nA = (x/4) * (x/2)\nA = x^2/8\n\nTherefore, option B: x^2/8 represents the maximum possible area of the rectangular yard in terms of x.",
