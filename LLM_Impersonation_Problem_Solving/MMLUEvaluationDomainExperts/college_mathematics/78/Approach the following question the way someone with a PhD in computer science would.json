    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the fencing will form three sides of a rectangle, we can first express the length of the rectangle as x/2 and the width as x/4. This is because the length will be twice the width in order to form three sides of the rectangle with x feet of fencing.\n\nNow, we can calculate the area of the rectangle using these dimensions:\nArea = length * width\nArea = (x/2) * (x/4)\nArea = x^2 / 8\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x is x^2 / 8. So, the correct answer is B: x^2 / 8.",
