    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum possible area of the yard, we can use the fact that the perimeter of the rectangular yard is equal to the sum of all three sides of the fence, which is x feet. Let the width of the yard be w and the length be l. Since the perimeter is x, we have the equation:\n\n2w + l = x\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the yard, which is given by the formula A = w * l. To do this, we need to express w or l in terms of just one variable. From the equation above, we can express one variable in terms of the other:\n\nl = x - 2w\n\nNow we substitute this back into the area formula:\n\nA = w * (x - 2w)\nA = xw - 2w^2\n\nTo find the maximum possible area, we can differentiate the area function with respect to w and set it equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\ndA/dw = x - 4w = 0\n4w = x\nw = x/4\n\nNow we substitute the value of w back into the area formula to find the maximum area:\n\nA = (x/4) * (x - 2(x/4))\nA = (x/4) * (x/2)\nA = x^2/8\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x is x^2/8. So the correct answer is B.",
