Let (Z_{10} , +, x) be the ring of integers modulo 10, and let S be the subset of Z_{10} represented by {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Which of the following statements is FALSE?\nA: (S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10.\nB: (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\nC: (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\nD: (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.",

The set S = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} is a subset of Z_{10} and contains elements that are closed under both addition and multiplication modulo 10.\n\nStatement A claims that (S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10. This is true since adding any two elements in S will result in a sum that is also in S (for example, 2 + 4 = 6).\n\nStatement B claims that (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10. This is also true since multiplying any two elements in S will result in a product that is also in S (for example, 4 x 6 = 4).\n\nStatement C claims that (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10. This is true since the identity element under addition modulo 10 is 0, which is an element of S.\n\nStatement D claims that (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10. This is false, as the identity element under multiplication modulo 10 is 1, which is not an element of S.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is D: (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.",
