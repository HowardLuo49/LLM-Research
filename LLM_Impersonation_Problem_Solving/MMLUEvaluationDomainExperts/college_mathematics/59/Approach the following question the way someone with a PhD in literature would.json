    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first understand how a linear transformation works in the context of this question. A linear transformation is a function that maps vectors from one space to another in a way that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.\n\nGiven that f is a linear transformation from the plane to the real numbers, we can represent f as f(x, y) = ax + by, where a and b are constants. \n\nUsing the given information, we have:\nf(1, 1) = 1\nf(-1, 0) = 2\n\nSubstitute the values into the function:\na(1) + b(1) = 1\na(-1) + b(0) = 2\n\nSolving these equations gives us:\na + b = 1       ...
