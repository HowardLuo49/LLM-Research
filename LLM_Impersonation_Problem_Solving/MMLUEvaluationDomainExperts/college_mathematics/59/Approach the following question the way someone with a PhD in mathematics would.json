    "gpt_response": "Given that f is a linear transformation from the plane to the real numbers, we can represent f as a matrix. Let M be the matrix representing the linear transformation f. \n\nSince f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2, we can write the following equations:\nM * [1, 1]^T = [1]\nM * [-1, 0]^T = [2]\n\nThis gives us the following system of equations:\nm11 + m12 = 1\n-m11 = 2\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get:\nm11 = -2\nm12 = 3\n\nSo, our matrix M representing the linear transformation f is:\nM = [-2, 3]\n\nTo find f(3, 5), we can multiply this matrix by [3, 5]^T:\n[-2, 3] * [3] = -6 + 15 = 9\n\nTherefore, f(3, 5) = 9.
