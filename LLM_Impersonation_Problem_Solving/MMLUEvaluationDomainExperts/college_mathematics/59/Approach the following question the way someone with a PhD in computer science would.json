    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can first express the linear transformation f in terms of a matrix. Let's denote f as f(x, y) = ax + by. Since f is a linear transformation from the plane to the real numbers, it can be represented as f(x, y) = [a, b] * [x, y]^T, where [a, b] is a 1x2 matrix.\n\nGiven f(1, 1) = 1 and f(-1, 0) = 2, we can set up the following system of equations:\na + b = 1\n-a = 2\n\nSolving the system of equations, we find that a = -2 and b = 3. Therefore, the linear transformation f can be represented as f(x, y) = -2x + 3y.\n\nTo find f(3, 5), we substitute x = 3 and y = 5 into the linear transformation:\nf(3, 5) = -2(3) + 3(5) = -6 + 15 = 9\n\nTherefore, f(3, 5) = 9.
