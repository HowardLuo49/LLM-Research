If f is one-to-one, it means that each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain. If f is onto, it means that every element in the codomain has a pre-image in the domain. In this case, since the codomain is (0, 1], f cannot be onto because there is no element in the codomain that maps to 0.\n\nII. The image of f being compact means that the range of f is closed and bounded. Since the domain is (0, 1), and the codomain is (0, 1], the image of f cannot be compact because it is not closed.\n\nIII. In order for f to be continuous, one-to-one, and onto, the function would have to be continuously increasing without any breaks or jumps. Given the interval (0, 1) and the codomain (0, 1], it is not possible for f to be continuous, one-to-one, and onto.\n\nTherefore, the only option that could be TRUE is I only.",
