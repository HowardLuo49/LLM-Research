    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, my approach to this question would involve analyzing the given system of linear equations and determining the properties of the solutions.\n\nTo start, we can rewrite the given system of equations in matrix form:\n[1   3   2   2]\n[1   4   1   0]\n[3   5  10  14]\n[2   5   5   6] \n[x1 x2  x3 x4] = 0\n\nWhere the coefficients of w, x, y, and z form the matrix on the left and the variables w, x, y, and z form the vector on the right. By solving this system using standard linear algebra techniques (e.g. Gaussian elimination), we can determine the properties of its solutions.\n\nFirstly, we need to check the consistency of the system. We can determine this by finding the rank of the coefficient matrix. If the rank of the augmented matrix (coefficient matrix + right-hand side vector) is equal to the rank of the coefficient matrix, the system is consistent. This means that statement A is true.\n\nNext, we can investigate the number of solutions the system has. By finding the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix, we can determine the number of leading variables. If the number of leading variables is less than the number of unknowns, the system has infinitely many solutions. Thus, statement B is also true.\n\nTo check statement C, we can select two arbitrary solutions (w1, x1, y1, z1) and (w2, x2, y2, z2) and sum them together to see if the resulting vector is also a solution. If it is, then statement C is true.\n\nFinally, to check statement D, we can determine if every solution is a scalar multiple of the vector (-5, 1, 1, 0). If every solution can be written in the form k(-5, 1, 1, 0), where k is a scalar, then statement D is true.\n\nIn conclusion, as a PhD in engineering, I would evaluate each statement based on the properties of the solutions of the given system of linear equations using fundamental principles of linear algebra.",
