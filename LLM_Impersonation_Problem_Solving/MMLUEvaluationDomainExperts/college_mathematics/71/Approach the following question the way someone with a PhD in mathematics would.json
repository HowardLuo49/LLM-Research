This indicates that the system may have either no solution or one unique solution.\n\nTo determine if the system is consistent, we can put it into matrix form and find the row echelon form or reduced row echelon form. By doing this, we would see if there are any conflicting equations or if the system has a unique solution or is inconsistent.\n\nTo determine if the system has infinitely many solutions, we need to check if the system reduces to an underdetermined system after row reduction and has more variables than equations. If this is the case, then the system has infinitely many solutions represented by a particular solution plus a linear combination of the free variables.\n\nThe sum of any two solutions being a solution is true for systems of linear equations as they satisfy the properties of closure under addition.\n\nFinally, to determine if every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0), we would need to check if the given solution can be written as k(-5, 1, 1, 0) for some scalar k. This would involve algebraic manipulations and solving for k.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is C: The sum of any two solutions is a solution.",
