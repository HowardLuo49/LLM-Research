This indicates that the system is inconsistent and has no solution. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\nSince the system is inconsistent, it does not have infinitely many solutions (statement B is false). The third statement, stating that the sum of any two solutions is a solution, is also false because there are no solutions to add together.\n\nFinally, let's consider statement D. Since there are no solutions to the system, it is not possible to say that every solution is a scalar multiple of any particular non-zero vector.
