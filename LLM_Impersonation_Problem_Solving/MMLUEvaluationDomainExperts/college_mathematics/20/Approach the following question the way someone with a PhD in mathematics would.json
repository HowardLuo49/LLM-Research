An eigenvector of a matrix A is a nonzero vector v such that Av = \u03bbv, where \u03bb is a scalar known as the eigenvalue corresponding to v. \n\nGiven that v is an eigenvector of an invertible matrix A, we know that Av = \u03bbv for some scalar \u03bb. \n\nI. To determine whether v is also an eigenvector of 2A, we need to check if 2Av = 2\u03bbv, which is true since 2Av = 2\u03bbv. \nTherefore, statement I is necessarily true.\n\nII. To determine whether v is also an eigenvector of A^2, we need to check if A^2v = \u03bbv. \nBy using the definition of an eigenvector, we can rewrite A^2v as A(Av) = A(\u03bbv) = \u03bb(Av) = \u03bb(\u03bbv) = \u03bb^2v. \nSince \u03bb^2v is not equal to \u03bbv (unless \u03bb = 1), v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^2. \nTherefore, statement II is not necessarily true.\n\nIII. To determine whether v is also an eigenvector of A^(-1), we need to check if A^(-1)v = \u03bbv. \nSince v is an eigenvector of A, A^(-1)v would be A^(-1)(Av) = A^(-1)(\u03bbv) = \u03bbA^(-1)v. \nUnless A^(-1)v is equal to v, v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^(-1). \nTherefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: I only.",
