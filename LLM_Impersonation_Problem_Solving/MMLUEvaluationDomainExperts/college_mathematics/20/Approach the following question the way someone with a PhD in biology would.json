    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by applying my knowledge of linear algebra. \n\nIf v is an eigenvector of an invertible matrix A, then it satisfies the following equation: Av = \u03bbv, where \u03bb is the corresponding eigenvalue. \n\nI. To determine if v is also an eigenvector of 2A, we can substitute 2A for A in the eigenvector equation: 2Av = 2\u03bbv. This simplifies to 2(\u03bbv) = 2\u03bbv, which confirms that v is an eigenvector of 2A. Therefore, statement I is necessarily true. \n\nII. To determine if v is also an eigenvector of A^2, we can substitute A^2 for A in the eigenvector equation: A^2v = A(Av) = A(\u03bbv) = \u03bb(Av) = \u03bb^2v. This shows that v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^2, as the eigenvalue is now \u03bb^2 instead of \u03bb. Therefore, statement II is not necessarily true. \n\nIII. To determine if v is also an eigenvector of A^(-1), we can substitute A^(-1) for A in the eigenvector equation: A^(-1)v = \u03bbv. This implies that v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^(-1), as the eigenvalue would have to be 1/\u03bb instead of \u03bb. Therefore, statement III is not necessarily true. \n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is A: I only.",
