    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first understand the concept of eigenvectors and eigenvalues in linear algebra. An eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that when A is multiplied by v, the result is a scalar multiple of v, denoted as Av = \u03bbv, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue corresponding to v.\n\nGiven that v is an eigenvector of an invertible matrix A, it follows that Av = \u03bbv for some eigenvalue \u03bb. \n\nI. To determine if v is also an eigenvector of 2A, we need to consider whether 2Av is also a scalar multiple of v. Since 2Av = 2(\u03bbv) = 2\u03bbv, v would still be an eigenvector of 2A with the same eigenvalue \u03bb. Therefore, statement I is necessarily true.\n\nII. To determine if v is also an eigenvector of A^2, we need to consider whether A^2v is a scalar multiple of v. Since A^2v = A(Av) = A(\u03bbv) = \u03bb(Av) = \u03bb(\u03bbv) = \u03bb^2v. Therefore, v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^2 as the eigenvalue changes to \u03bb^2. Statement II is not necessarily true.\n\nIII. To determine if v is also an eigenvector of A^(-1), we need to consider whether A^(-1)v is a scalar multiple of v. Since A^(-1)v = \u03bb^(-1)v, v would still be an eigenvector of A^(-1) with the eigenvalue \u03bb^(-1). Therefore, statement III is necessarily true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is:\n\nA: I only",
