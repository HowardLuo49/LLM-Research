    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by understanding the properties of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of matrices. An eigenvector of a matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that Av = \u03bbv, where \u03bb is a scalar known as the eigenvalue corresponding to v.\n\nGiven that v is an eigenvector of an invertible matrix A, it implies that Av = \u03bbv for some eigenvalue \u03bb. The properties of eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be used to determine which of the given statements are necessarily true.\n\nI. v is also an eigenvector of 2A:\nIf v is an eigenvector of matrix A, then for 2A, we have (2A)v = 2Av = 2\u03bbv, which means that v is also an eigenvector of 2A with eigenvalue 2\u03bb. Therefore, Statement I is necessarily true.\n\nII. v is also an eigenvector of A^2:\nFor A^2, we have (A^2)v = A(Av) = A(\u03bbv) = \u03bb(Av) = \u03bb(\u03bbv) = \u03bb^2v. Therefore, v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^2. Statement II is not necessarily true.\n\nIII. v is also an eigenvector of A^(-1):\nSince A is an invertible matrix, A^(-1) exists. If v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, then we have A(v) = \u03bbv, and multiplying both sides by A^(-1), we get A^(-1)(A(v)) = A^(-1)(\u03bbv), which simplifies to v = \u03bbA^(-1)(v). Therefore, v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^(-1). Statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A: I only.",
