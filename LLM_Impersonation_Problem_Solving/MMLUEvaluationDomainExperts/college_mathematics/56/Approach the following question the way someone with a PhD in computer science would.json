Let V be the vector space, under the usual operations, of real polynomials that are of degree at most 3. Let W be the subspace of all polynomials p (x) in V such that p (0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0.

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the dimension of V and the dimension of W.\n\nThe vector space V consists of real polynomials of degree at most 3. These polynomials can be written as ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers. Therefore, the dimension of V is 4.\n\nThe subspace W consists of all polynomials p(x) in V such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. Let's say the polynomial p(x) in W is of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Then we have:\n\np(0) = d = 0\np(1) = a + b + c + d = 0\np(-1) = -a + b - c + d = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we know that d = 0. Substituting this into the second and third equations, we get:\n\na + b + c = 0\n-a + b - c = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get a = b = c = 0. Therefore, the only polynomial in W is the zero polynomial, and the dimension of W is 0.\n\nNow, the sum of the dimensions of V and W is:\n\ndim V + dim W = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 4.",
