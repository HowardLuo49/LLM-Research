    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I will approach this question from a mathematical perspective. \n\nIn order to determine the dimension of the vector space V, we need to consider the basis elements of V. Since V consists of real polynomials of degree at most 3, the basis of V can be represented as {1, x, x^2, x^3}. Therefore, dim V = 4. \n\nNow, let's consider the subspace W consisting of polynomials p(x) such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. This implies that any polynomial in W can be written in the form p(x) = a(x-1)x(x+1), where a is a scalar constant. \n\nSince the basis of W consists of the polynomial (x-1)x(x+1), we can conclude that dim W = 1. \n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5. \n\nHence, the correct answer is B: 5.",
