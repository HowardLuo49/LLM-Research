    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I may not have the expertise to answer this question in the same depth as someone with a PhD in mathematics. However, I can still provide an approach that a mathematician might take to solve this problem.\n\nIn this question, we are considering the vector space V of real polynomials of degree at most 3 under the usual operations. We are also given the subspace W of polynomials in V where p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0.\n\nTo determine the dimensions of V and W, we need to consider the basis of each space. The basis of V is {1, x, x^2, x^3}, as any polynomial of degree at most 3 can be written as a linear combination of these basis vectors.\n\nFor the subspace W, we can see that any polynomial in W must have the form p(x) = x(x - 1)(x + 1), as it must be zero at x = 0, x = 1, and x = -1. This polynomial has degree 3, so it is a basis vector for W. Therefore, the dimension of W is 1.\n\nThe dimension of V is 4 (the number of basis vectors), and the dimension of W is 1. Therefore, the sum of the dimensions is 4 + 1 = 5. Thus, the answer is B.",
