    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem from a philosophical perspective, we must first establish a rigorous understanding of vector spaces, subspaces, and dimensions. In the context of this question, V represents the vector space of real polynomials of degree at most 3 under the usual operations. W, on the other hand, signifies the subspace of V defined as the set of all polynomials p(x) such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0.\n\nIt is important to recognize that in the realm of vector spaces and subspaces, dimensions play a pivotal role in understanding the structure and properties of these mathematical entities. The dimension of a vector space is defined as the number of linearly independent vectors needed to span the space. In the case of a subspace, the dimension is the number of linearly independent vectors necessary to span that subspace within the larger vector space.\n\nIn this specific scenario, we are tasked with determining the sum of dimensions of the vector space V and the subspace W. To calculate the dimension of V, we note that the basis for V will consist of polynomials of degree at most 3, specifically {1, x, x^2, x^3}. As these are linearly independent, the dimension of V is 4.\n\nMoving on to the subspace W, we must identify the basis for W. Here, the condition that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 implies that the polynomials x, x^2, and x^3 all belong to W. These polynomials are linearly independent, and therefore form a basis for W, resulting in a dimension of 3.\n\nThus, the sum of dimensions of V and W is 4 + 3 = 7. Therefore, in the context of this problem, the correct answer is D: 7.",
