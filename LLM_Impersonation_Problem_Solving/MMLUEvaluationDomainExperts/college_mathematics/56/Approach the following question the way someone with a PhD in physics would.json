Let V be the vector space, under the usual operations, of real polynomials that are of degree at most 3. Let W be the subspace of all polynomials p (x) in V such that p (0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. Then dim V + dim W is\nA: 4\nB: 5\nC: 6\nD: 7",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "We start by finding the basis for the vector space V. Since polynomials of degree at most 3 can be written as ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, where a, b, c, d are real numbers, a basis for V is {1, x, x^2, x^3}.\n\nNext, we find the basis for the subspace W. The condition p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 means that the polynomials in W are of the form p(x) = kx(x-1)(x+1) for some constant k. Therefore, a basis for W is {x(x-1)(x+1)}.\n\nThe dimension of V is 4 (number of elements in the basis) and the dimension of W is 1 (number of elements in the basis). Therefore, dim V + dim W is 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: 5.",
