Let V be the vector space, under the usual operations, of real polynomials that are of degree at most 3. Let W be the subspace of all polynomials p (x) in V such that p (0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0.

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the dimension of the vector space V and the subspace W.\n\nThe vector space V consists of real polynomials of degree at most 3. Therefore, a basis for V would be {1, x, x^2, x^3}, as these four polynomials span V and are linearly independent.\n\nNext, we need to determine the dimension of the subspace W. The conditions given for W are p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. This implies that any polynomial in W must have factors of (x - 0), (x - 1), and (x + 1), or in other words, must be of the form p(x) = kx(x-1)(x+1) where k is a constant. This polynomial has exactly 3 linearly independent elements, {x(x-1)(x+1)}, {x(x-1)(x+1)}, {x(x-1)(x+1)}. Therefore, dim W = 3.\n\nFinally, dim V + dim W = 4 + 3 = 7.
