    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by calculating the probabilities of each event.\n\nLet p be the probability of getting a head (which is equal to the probability of getting a tail) on each toss. Since we have a fair coin, p = 0.5.\n\nThe total number of ways 100 tosses can result in H heads and T tails is given by the binomial coefficient: C(100, H).\n\nA: The probability of H = 50 can be calculated as follows: P(H = 50) = C(100, 50) * (0.5)^50 * (0.5)^50 = C(100, 50) * (0.5)^100.\n\nB: The probability of T >= 60 can be calculated by summing the probabilities of getting 60, 61, 62, ..., 100 tails. This can be expressed as: P(T >= 60) = sum from k=60 to 100 of C(100, k) * (0.5)^100.\n\nC: The probability of 51 <= H <= 55 can be calculated by summing the probabilities of getting 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 heads.

This can be expressed as: P(H >= 48 and T >= 48) = sum from k=48 to 100 of C(100, k) * (0.5)^100.\n\nTo determine which event has the greatest probability, we would compare the probabilities of events A, B, C, and D that have been calculated above.",
