If H is the total number of heads and T is the total number of tails, which of the following events has the greatest probability?\nA: H = 50\nB: T >= 60\nC: 51 <= H <= 55\nD: H >= 48 and T >= 48",

    "gpt_response": "When approaching this question from a biological perspective, it is important to understand the concept of probability in the context of coin tosses. A fair coin has an equal chance of landing on heads or tails, which means that each toss has a probability of 0.5. In a series of 100 coin tosses, the distribution of heads and tails follows a binomial distribution.\n\nTo determine the probability of each event, we can use the binomial probability formula. The formula for the probability of getting exactly k heads in n tosses of a fair coin is given by:\n\nP(k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere \"n choose k\" is the number of ways to choose k successes from n trials, p is the probability of success (0.5 in this case), and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n\n1. Event A: H = 50\nThe probability of getting exactly 50 heads in 100 coin tosses is:\n\nP(H=50) = (100 choose 50) * 0.5^50 * 0.5^50 \n\n2. Event B: T >= 60\nThe probability of getting 60 or more tails in 100 coin tosses can be calculated using the complement rule:\n\nP(T>=60) = 1 - P(T<60)\n\n3. Event C: 51 <= H <= 55\nThe probability of getting between 51 and 55 heads in 100 coin tosses can be calculated by summing the probabilities of getting 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 heads.\n\nP(51<=H<=55) = P(H=51) + P(H=52) + P(H=53) + P(H=54) + P(H=55)\n\n4. Event D: H >= 48 and T >= 48\nThe probability of getting 48 or more heads and 48 or more tails in 100 coin tosses can be calculated by summing the probabilities of different combinations that satisfy this condition.\n\nP(H>=48 and T>=48) = P(H=48 and T=52) + P(H=49 and T=51) + ... + P(H=52 and T=48) + ...\n\nBy calculating the probabilities for each event and comparing them, a biologist with a PhD in biology would be able to determine which event has the greatest probability based on an understanding of the binomial distribution and probability theory.",
