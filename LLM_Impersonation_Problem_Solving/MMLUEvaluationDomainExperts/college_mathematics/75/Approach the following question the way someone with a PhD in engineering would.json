    "gpt_response": "To answer this question as someone with a PhD in engineering, we can approach this problem using the principles of probability and statistical analysis. \n\nGiven that a fair coin is to be tossed 100 times, we know that the probability of getting a head or a tail on each toss is 0.5. \n\nNow, let's analyze each of the events mentioned: \n\nA: H = 50\nThis event represents the case where there are exactly 50 heads in the 100 tosses. The probability of this event can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:\nP(H = 50) = (100 choose 50)*(0.5)^50*(0.5)^50 \u2248 0.0796\n\nB: T >= 60 \nThis event represents the case where there are 60 or more tails in the 100 tosses. The probability of this event can be calculated using the cumulative binomial distribution:\nP(T >= 60) = 1 - P(T < 60) = 1 - \u03a3 (i=0 to 59) (100 choose i)*(0.5)^i*(0.5)^(100-i) \u2248 0.028\n\nC: 51 <= H <= 55 \nThis event represents the case where there are between 51 and 55 heads in the 100 tosses. The probability of this event can be calculated using the sum of individual probabilities for each of these cases:\nP(51 <= H <= 55) = \u03a3 (i=51 to 55) (100 choose i)*(0.5)^i*(0.5)^(100-i) \u2248 0.083\n\nD: H >= 48 and T >= 48\nThis event represents the case where there are at least 48 heads and at least 48 tails in the 100 tosses. The probability of this event can be calculated using the intersection of these two events:\nP(H >= 48 and T >= 48) = \u03a3 (i=48 to 100) (100 choose i)*(0.5)^i*(0.5)^(100-i) \u2248 0.993\n\nTherefore, the event with the greatest probability is option D: H >= 48 and T >= 48, with a probability of approximately 0.993.",
