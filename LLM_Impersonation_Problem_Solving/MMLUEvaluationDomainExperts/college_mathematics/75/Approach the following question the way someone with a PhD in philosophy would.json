If H is the total number of heads and T is the total number of tails, which of the following events has the greatest probability?\nA: H = 50\nB: T >= 60\nC: 51 <= H <= 55\nD: H >= 48 and T >= 48",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine which of the given events has the greatest probability, we must first consider the nature of probability in a fair coin toss scenario. Each coin toss has two possible outcomes (Heads or Tails) with equal probability (0.5).\n\nFirstly, let us consider event A: H = 50. In order for this event to occur, there must be exactly 50 Heads and 50 Tails in the 100 coin tosses. This is essentially saying that there will be an equal number of Heads and Tails in the sample space.\n\nNext, let us consider event B: T >= 60. For this event to occur, there must be 60 or more Tails in the 100 coin tosses. This implies that there can be at most 40 Heads in order for Tails to be greater than or equal to 60. \n\nMoving on to event C: 51 <= H <= 55. In order for this event to occur, the number of Heads must fall between 51 and 55, with Tails making up the remainder. This implies a ratio of approximately 1:1 between the number of Heads and Tails.\n\nFinally, let us consider event D: H >= 48 and T >= 48. For this event to occur, there must be at least 48 Heads and 48 Tails in the 100 coin tosses. This event does not specify the exact number of each, only that both must be at least 48.\n\nWhen comparing the probabilities of these events, it is clear that event A (H = 50) has the greatest probability. In a fair coin toss scenario, the expected outcome of 50 Heads and 50 Tails is the most probable outcome. This is due to the symmetric nature of the coin toss and the equal probability of each outcome.",
