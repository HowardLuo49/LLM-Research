    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, we can calculate the probabilities for each of the events mentioned. \n\nTo find the probability for event A (H = 50), we can use the binomial probability formula, which is P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successful outcomes, and p is the probability of success. In this case, n=100, k=50, and p=0.5. \n\nCalculating P(X = 50), we get:\nP(X=50) = (100 choose 50) * 0.5^50 * 0.5^50 = 0.07958\n\nTo find the probability for event B (T >= 60), we can use the complementary probability, which is 1 - P(T < 60). We can again use the binomial distribution formula but calculate the sum from k=0 to 59. \n\nCalculating P(T < 60), we get:\nP(T < 60) = sum from k=0 to 59 [(100 choose k) * 0.5^k * 0.5^(100-k)] = 0.9992\n\nTherefore, P(T >= 60) = 1 - 0.9992 = 0.0008\n\nFor event C (51 <= H <= 55), we need to calculate the sum of probabilities from k=51 to 55.\n\nCalculating P(51 <= H <= 55), we get:\nP(51 <= H <= 55) = sum from k=51 to 55 [(100 choose k) * 0.5^k * 0.5^(100-k)] = 0.5746\n\nFor event D (H >= 48 and T >= 48), we need to calculate the intersection of the events H >= 48 and T >= 48. This can be solved by calculating the sum of probabilities for H=48 to H=100 and T=48 to T=100.\n\nCalculating P(H >= 48 and T >= 48), we get:\nP(H >= 48 and T >= 48) = sum from H=48 to 100 [(100 choose H) * 0.5^H * 0.5^(100-H)] = 0.6893\n\nTherefore, from the calculations, event D (H >= 48 and T >= 48) has the greatest probability of 0.6893.",
