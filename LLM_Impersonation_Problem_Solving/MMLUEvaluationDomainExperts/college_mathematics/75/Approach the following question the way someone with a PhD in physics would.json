If H is the total number of heads and T is the total number of tails, which of the following events has the greatest probability?\nA: H = 50\nB: T >= 60\nC: 51 <= H <= 55\nD: H >= 48 and T >= 48",

    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the given events has the greatest probability, we need to consider the probabilities of each event occurring in the context of tossing a fair coin 100 times.\n\nGiven that each toss of a fair coin is independent and has a probability of 0.5 for resulting in a head and 0.5 for resulting in a tail, we can model this situation using the binomial distribution.\n\nFor event A with H = 50, this corresponds to the probability of getting exactly 50 heads in 100 tosses. Using the binomial probability formula, this probability is given by:\n\nP(H = 50) = C(100, 50) * (0.5)^50 * (0.5)^50\n\nFor event B with T >= 60, this corresponds to the probability of getting 60, 61, 62, ..., 100 tails in 100 tosses. We can calculate this probability by summing the individual probabilities of each outcome.\n\nFor event C with 51 <= H <= 55, this corresponds to the sum of probabilities of getting 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 heads in 100 tosses. We can calculate this probability similarly to event A.\n\nFor event D with H >= 48 and T >= 48, this corresponds to the sum of probabilities of getting 48, 49, 50, ..., 100 heads while simultaneously getting 48, 49, 50, ..., 100 tails in 100 tosses. We can calculate this probability by summing the individual probabilities of each outcome.\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for each event using the binomial distribution formula, we can compare the results to determine which event has the greatest probability.",
