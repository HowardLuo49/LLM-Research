    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of the number 7^25, we need to understand the pattern of units digits in powers of 7. \n\nIn the standard decimal expansion of powers of 7, the units digit follows a cycle with a length of 4. This cycle is 7, 9, 3, 1. Therefore, the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of 7^25 will be the same as in 7^(25 mod 4).\n\nSince 25 mod 4 is 1, the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of 7^25 will be the same as in 7^1, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 7.",
