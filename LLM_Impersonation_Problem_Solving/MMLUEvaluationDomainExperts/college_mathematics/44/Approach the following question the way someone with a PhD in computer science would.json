    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of the number 7^25, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. \n\nWe know that the units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. In this case, we are interested in finding the units digit of 7^25. \n\nWe can simplify this problem by noting that the units digit of 7^1 is 7, the units digit of 7^2 is 9, the units digit of 7^3 is 3, and the units digit of 7^4 is 1. This pattern repeats every 4 powers of 7.\n\nSince 25 is divisible by 4 with a remainder of 1, the units digit of 7^25 will be the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 7.",
