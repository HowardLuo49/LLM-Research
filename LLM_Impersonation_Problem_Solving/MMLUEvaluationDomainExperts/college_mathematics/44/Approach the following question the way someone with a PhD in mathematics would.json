    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of 7^25, we can determine the pattern of the units digit of powers of 7. \n\nFirstly, we observe that the units digit of powers of 7 repeat in cycles of 4: 7^1 has a units digit of 7, 7^2 has a units digit of 9, 7^3 has a units digit of 3, and 7^4 has a units digit of 1. \n\nSince 25 is congruent to 1 mod 4, the units digit of 7^25 will be the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of the number 7^25 is 7. \n\nThe correct answer is D: 7.",
