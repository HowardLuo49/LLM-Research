    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The units digit of a number corresponds to the remainder when divided by 10. In the case of the number 7^25, we can analyze the pattern of units digits of powers of 7.\n\nThe units digit of powers of 7 follows a periodic pattern: 7^1 has a units digit of 7, 7^2 has a units digit of 9, 7^3 has a units digit of 3, and 7^4 has a units digit of 1. This pattern repeats every 4 powers.\n\nSince 25 is not divisible by 4, we can find the units digit of 7^25 by finding the remainder of 25 when divided by 4. 25 divided by 4 yields a remainder of 1. Therefore, the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of 7^25 is the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 7",
