Suppose P is the set of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 7. If the operator D sends p(x) in P to its derivative p\u2032(x), what are the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D?\nA: n = 1 and r = 6\nB: n = 1 and r = 7\nC: n = 2 and r = 5\nD: n = 2 and r = 6",

    "gpt_response": "To find the dimensions of the null space and range of the derivative operator D, we need to determine the number of polynomials in P that map to zero under D (null space) and the number of distinct derivatives that can be obtained (range).\n\nFirst, let's consider the null space of D. A polynomial p(x) in P will map to zero under D if and only if all of its coefficients are multiples of 5 in Z_5. Since the coefficients are taken modulo 5, this means the only polynomial that maps to zero under D is the zero polynomial. Thus, the null space of D is of dimension 1.\n\nNext, let's determine the range of D. Since the maximum degree of polynomials in P is 7, the derivative of a polynomial in P can have degree at most 6. Therefore, the range of D consists of all polynomials in P with degree at most 6. The number of such polynomials is the number of ways we can choose 7 coefficients from Z_5 (including zero) to form a polynomial with degree less than or equal to 6. This is given by the binomial coefficient C(7 + 5 - 1, 5 - 1) = C(11,4) = 330.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the null space and range of D are n = 1 and r = 330. However, since we are working in Z_5, we need to take the dimension modulo 5. The dimension of the range modulo 5 is therefore r = 330 mod 5 = 0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA: n = 1 and r = 0",
