Suppose P is the set of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 7.

    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the operator D mapping polynomials in P to their derivatives. The null space of D consists of polynomials in P whose derivative is the zero polynomial, i.e., constant polynomials. Since constant polynomials have degree less than or equal to 7, the null space n of D is 1-dimensional.\n\nTo find the range r of D, we need to consider the dimension of the image of D. Each derivative operation decreases the degree of the polynomial by 1 (unless the polynomial is a constant), so the range r of D consists of polynomials in P with degree less than or equal to 6. The dimension of such polynomials is 7 (0 to 6), so the range r of D is 7-dimensional.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: n = 1 and r = 7.",
