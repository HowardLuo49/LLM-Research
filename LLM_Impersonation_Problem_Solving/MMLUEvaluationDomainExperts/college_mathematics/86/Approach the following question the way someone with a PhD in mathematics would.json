Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the conditions is not equivalent to any of the other four, we need to analyze the relationships between the conditions.\n\nCondition A states that for any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent. This means that the columns of M are linearly independent.\n\nCondition B states that the homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution. This implies that the null space of M only contains the zero vector, which means that the columns of M are linearly independent.\n\nCondition C states that the system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This implies that the columns of M span R^5, which means that the columns of M are linearly independent.\n\nCondition D states that the determinant of M is nonzero. This implies that the columns of M are linearly independent.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that conditions A, B, C, and D are all equivalent to each other as they all relate to the linear independence of the columns of M. Therefore, the condition that is not equivalent to any of the other four is:\n\nE: The rows of M are linearly independent.\n\nThis condition is not equivalent to the other four, as they all relate to the linear independence of the columns of M.",
