Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which condition is equivalent to NONE of the other four, we need to carefully analyze each condition and their implications.\n\nCondition A states that for any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent. This means that no linear combination of u and v can equal the zero vector unless both u and v are the zero vector. \n\nCondition B states that the homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution. This implies that the columns of M are linearly independent, as a non-trivial solution would indicate linear dependence among the columns.\n\nCondition C states that the system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This implies that the columns of M span R^5, as otherwise there would be vectors b for which the system has no solution or multiple solutions.\n\nCondition D states that the determinant of M is nonzero. This implies that the columns of M are linearly independent, as the determinant being nonzero means that the matrix is invertible and thus the columns are linearly independent.\n\nCondition E is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that if none of the other conditions are equivalent to it, then it must be the condition that does not require linear independence or unique solutions for the system of equations. This means that condition E is likely related to the properties of the matrix itself, such as symmetry or diagonalizability.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Condition E is equivalent to NONE of the other four conditions.",
