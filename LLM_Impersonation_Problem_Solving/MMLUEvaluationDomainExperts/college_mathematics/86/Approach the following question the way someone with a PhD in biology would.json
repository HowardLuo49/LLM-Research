Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",

This condition implies that the columns of the matrix are linearly independent, which is a characteristic of a matrix with a nonzero determinant.\n\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution. This condition suggests that the matrix is invertible, which again relates to having a nonzero determinant.\n\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This condition also implies that the matrix is invertible, linking it to having a nonzero determinant.\n\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero. As previously mentioned, a nonzero determinant indicates that the matrix is invertible, which aligns with conditions B and C.\n\nE: The condition equivalent to NONE of the others. This means that it is a unique characteristic not shared by any of the other conditions. In this case, option D stands out as it directly relates to the fundamental property of the determinant being nonzero, which is not explicitly stated in the other conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the relationships between the conditions and the properties of matrices, the correct answer is that the determinant of M being nonzero (option D) is equivalent to none of the other conditions.",
