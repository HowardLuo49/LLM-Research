Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first understanding the definitions and implications of each of the provided conditions.\n\nCondition A states that for any two distinct column vectors u and v of matrix M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent. This means that no scalar multiples of one vector can be used to create the other vector, implying that the columns of M span the entire column space.\n\nCondition B states that the homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution, meaning that the only solution to this system is x = 0. This indicates that the columns of M are linearly independent, as the nullspace only contains the zero vector.\n\nCondition C states that the system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This implies that the columns of M form a square matrix with full rank, allowing for a unique solution to be obtained for any given input vector b.\n\nCondition D states that the determinant of matrix M is nonzero, which implies that the columns of M are linearly independent and the matrix is invertible.\n\nBased on my understanding of these conditions, I can determine that condition D is equivalent to none of the other four conditions. This is because condition D specifically references the determinant of M, while the other conditions focus on the linear independence of the columns of M and the solutions to the systems of equations involving M. This distinction sets condition D apart from the others and demonstrates its unique equivalence.",
