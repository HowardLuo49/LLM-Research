    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the intervals are valid intervals of convergence for a power series, we need to consider the radius of convergence determined by the power series.

For a power series with radius of convergence R, if the interval includes any points greater than R in absolute value, the series will diverge at those points. Thus, this interval is not valid unless the radius of convergence is equal to or greater than 3.\n\n(II) (\u2212\u221e, 0] - This interval is an open interval that includes -\u221e and 0. For a power series, the interval of convergence can extend up to the radius R without including R.
