    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, a person with a PhD in biology would likely take a mathematical perspective to apply their knowledge of geometry and spatial structures to the given scenario.\n\nGiven that the circle C in the yz-plane is defined by the equation (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1 and revolving C around the z-axis generates a torus, we need to find the equation of this torus in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nTo derive the equation of the torus, we start by considering how the shape is formed. By revolving the circle C around the z-axis, we create a torus where every point along the circumference of C traces out a circle centered at the z-axis. This implies that the radius of the torus will be 1 unit (half the diameter of the circle C). \n\nNow, since the circle is being revolved around the z-axis, the x-coordinate is not involved in the equation. Therefore, the options provided in the question that include x^2 can be eliminated.\n\nLooking at the choices, we see that option B: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 8 + 36(x^2 + z^2) does not fit the pattern of a torus since squaring variables in this manner would not result in a torus shape.\n\nOption C: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2) is incorrect as well as option D: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2) because they do not correspond to the geometric properties of a torus.\n\nThe correct answer is option A: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6y. This equation represents a torus where the cross-section formed by the revolving circle C around the z-axis is accounted for in the equation, and it is a valid representation of the torus generated by this process.",
