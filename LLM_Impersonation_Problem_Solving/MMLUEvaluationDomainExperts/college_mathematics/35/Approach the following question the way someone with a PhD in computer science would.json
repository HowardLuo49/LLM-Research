If C is revolved around the z-axis, the surface generated is a torus. What is the equation of this torus?\nA: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6y\nB: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 8 + 36(x^2 + z^2)\nC: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)\nD: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)",

    "gpt_response": "The equation of the torus generated by revolving circle C around the z-axis can be derived as follows:\n\nFirstly, we need to parameterize the circle C in the yz-plane:\nLet y = 3 + cos\u03b8 and z = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the parameter.\n\nBy revolving circle C around the z-axis, we generate a torus.

The correct answer would typically be calculated using a geometrical derivation based on parametric equations and the general equation of a torus.",
