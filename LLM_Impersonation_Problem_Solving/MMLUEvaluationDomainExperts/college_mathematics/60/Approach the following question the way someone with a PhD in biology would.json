    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I will analyze this question with a mathematical lens. The given polynomial is a fifth-degree polynomial, which means it is possible for it to have between 0 and 5 real roots according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. \n\nTo determine the number of real roots of the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7, we can use Descartes' Rule of Signs. By examining the signs of the coefficients, we can count the number of sign changes in the polynomial. \n\nIn this case, there is only one sign change from positive to negative when going from the coefficient of 8x to -7. Therefore, according to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the number of real roots of the polynomial is either one or three. \n\nTo further analyze the possible number of real roots, we can look at the graph of the polynomial. By plotting the polynomial, we can see that there is only one real root at approximately x = 0.7. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: One real root.",
