    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of real roots of the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7, we can look at its graph or use techniques such as the Intermediate Value Theorem or Descartes' Rule of Signs. \n\nThe polynomial is of odd degree (5), so it will have at least one real root. To further analyze how many real roots it has, we can observe that there is no change in sign for the coefficients of the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7. Therefore, by Descartes' Rule of Signs, there are either 0 or 2 positive real roots.\n\nTo analyze the number of negative real roots, we need to evaluate the polynomial at -x and determine the number of sign changes. Since the resulting polynomial is 2(-x)^5 + 8(-x) - 7 = -2x^5 - 8x - 7, we see that there is only one sign change. Hence, by Descartes' Rule of Signs, there is exactly one negative real root.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: One.",
