    "gpt_response": "This question pertains to a transcendental equation involving the cosine function. To determine the number of positive solutions, one must analyze the periodic nature of the cosine function and the behavior of the function x.\n\nSince the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1 infinitely, it is important to consider the intervals of the cosine function where it intersects with the function x. The function x grows linearly as x increases, while the cosine function fluctuates in a periodic manner. \n\nWe can determine the number of positive solutions by observing the number of times the cosine function intersects with the function x within the interval [0, 2\u03c0]. Additionally, we must consider the fact that the cosine function intersects with x at x = 1, where cos(97) = 1. \n\nTherefore, there is only one positive number x that satisfies the equation cos(97x) = x. This corresponds to option A: 1.",
