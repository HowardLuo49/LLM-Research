    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to consider the domain of the cosine function and the possible values of x. The function cos(97x) has a period of 2\u03c0/97, so it repeats every 2\u03c0/97 units. Since the cosine function has values between -1 and 1, the possible values of x are also bounded between -1 and 1.\n\nTo find the positive numbers x that satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x, we need to analyze the intersection points of the cosine curve and the line y = x within the interval [-1, 1]. By graphing the cosine curve and the line y = x, we can see that there is only one point of intersection at x = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 1.",
