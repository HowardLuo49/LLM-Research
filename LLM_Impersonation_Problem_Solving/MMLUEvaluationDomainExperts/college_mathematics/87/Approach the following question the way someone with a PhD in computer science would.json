    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive solutions for the equation cos(97x) = x, we need to consider the behavior of the cosine function and the function f(x) = x.\n\nThe cosine function has a range of [-1, 1], meaning that the values of cos(97x) are always between -1 and 1. On the other hand, the function f(x) = x is a linear function that increases without bound as x approaches infinity.\n\nTo visualize the solutions to cos(97x) = x graphically, we can graph the two functions and look for points of intersection within the region where x is positive. \n\nUpon visual inspection, we observe that there is only one point of intersection between the two functions in the positive x domain. Therefore, there is only 1 positive number x that satisfies the equation cos(97x) = x.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1.",
