    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The question poses an interesting mathematical problem that can be tackled using principles of trigonometry and algebra. To solve the equation cos(97x) = x for positive numbers x, we must consider the behavior of the cosine function and the behavior of the linear function y=x.\n\nCosine is a periodic function with a range of [-1, 1], meaning that the only possible values for x are within this range. Additionally, the function y=x increases linearly. \n\nTo find the points of intersection between the two functions, we need to set them equal to each other and solve for x:\n\ncos(97x) = x\n\nThis transcendental equation does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing software to find the points of intersection. By examining the graph of the two functions, we can see that there is only one intersection point for positive values of x, and that point occurs at x = 0.56 (approximately).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1.",
