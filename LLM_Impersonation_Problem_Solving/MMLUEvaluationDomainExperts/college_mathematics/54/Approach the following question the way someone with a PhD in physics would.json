    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of n for which there are exactly two abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism, we need to consider the classification of finite abelian groups. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any finite abelian group can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nLet n be a positive integer such that n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, where p1, p2, ..., pk are distinct primes and a1, a2, ..., ak are positive integers. Then, the number of abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism is given by the product of the number of ways to partition each exponent ai.\n\nFor n = 4, we have 4 = 2^2. There are 2 ways to partition the exponent 2, namely {2} and {}. This results in two abelian groups of order 4, namely Z4 and Z2 x Z2.\n\nFor n = 7, we have 7 = 7^1. There is only one way to partition the exponent 1, namely {1}. This results in one abelian group of order 7, namely Z7.\n\nFor n = 8, we have 8 = 2^3.
