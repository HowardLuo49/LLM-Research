Every finite abelian group can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order.\n\nLet the order of the abelian group be n. We need to find the value(s) of n for which there are exactly two abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism.\n\nFor a given prime number p, the number of possible abelian groups of order p^k is equal to the number of partitions of k. A partition of a positive integer k is a way of writing k as a sum of positive integers in non-increasing order.\n\nFor n = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pm^km, the number of abelian groups of order n is equal to the product of the number of partitions of each ki.\n\nTherefore, we have to find the values of n for which the number of partitions of each ki is equal to 2. This only occurs when ki = 1, i.e., each prime power appears only once in the prime factorization of n.\n\nThe only such values of n are 4 (2^2) and 8 (2^3).
