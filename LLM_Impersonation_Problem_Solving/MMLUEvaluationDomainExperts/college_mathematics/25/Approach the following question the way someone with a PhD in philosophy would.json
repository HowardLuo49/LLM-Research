We have m \u2022 e = m + e + me = m by definition of the identity element, this implies e = 0, however, 0 is not the identity element as for any m in Z we have m \u2022 0 = m + 0 + m0 = m + 0 \u2260 m, hence this structure does not have an identity element.\n\nIII.

In this case, for an integer m, we must find an integer n such that m \u2022 n = n \u2022 m = e. Since there is no identity element, not all elements in this structure have an inverse.\n\nIV.
