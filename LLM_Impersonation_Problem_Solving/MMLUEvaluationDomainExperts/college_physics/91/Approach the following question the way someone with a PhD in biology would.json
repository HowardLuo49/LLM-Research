However, I can provide a basic explanation based on my knowledge of biology and the fundamental principles of physics.\n\nThe speed of light in a medium is determined by its refractive index, which is related to the square root of the dielectric constant of the material according to the equation v = c/n, where v is the speed of light in the material, c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and n is the refractive index of the material.\n\nGiven that the dielectric constant of the material is 4.0, the refractive index (n) of the material would be the square root of 4.0, which is 2.0. Therefore, the speed of light in the material would be the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the refractive index, resulting in a speed of 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.",
