    "gpt_response": "In spectroscopy, it is important to use a laser with specific characteristics that allow for precise and accurate analysis of samples. A dye laser is commonly chosen for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths due to its tunability and broad spectral range. The ability to adjust the laser's output wavelength makes it ideal for studying different substances. \n\nHelium-neon lasers, while commonly used in general spectroscopy applications, have a more limited range of wavelengths, primarily in the red and infrared regions. Excimer lasers are typically used for more specialized applications, such as ultraviolet spectroscopy. Ruby lasers, on the other hand, emit a specific wavelength (694 nm) which may not be suitable for a range of visible wavelengths.\n\nTherefore, the best choice for performing spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths would be a dye laser. Its tunability and broad spectral range make it the most versatile option for this application.",
