    "gpt_response": "The best type of laser for conducting spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths would depend on several factors, including the spectral range desired, intensity, coherence, and tunability of the laser. \n\nIn the visible range, a dye laser would likely be the most suitable option due to its tunability over a wide range of wavelengths. Dye lasers can be tuned to cover a broad spectrum of visible wavelengths by selecting appropriate dyes. This flexibility in wavelength selection makes dye lasers well-suited for spectroscopic studies where a range of wavelengths need to be investigated.\n\nIn contrast, helium-neon, excimer, and ruby lasers are less suitable for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths. Helium-neon lasers typically emit at fixed wavelengths in the red region of the spectrum and lack the tunability required for a broad spectral range. Excimer lasers emit at specific ultraviolet wavelengths and are not commonly used for visible spectroscopy. Ruby lasers also emit at specific wavelengths in the red region and are generally less tunable than dye lasers.\n\nIn conclusion, a dye laser would be the best choice for conducting spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths due to its tunability and flexibility in wavelength selection.",
