    "gpt_response": "The best type of laser to use for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths would be a dye laser. This is due to the fact that dye lasers are tunable and can be easily adjusted to emit light at specific wavelengths within the visible spectrum. Additionally, dye lasers typically have a broad range of tunability, making them ideal for spectroscopic studies that require a wide range of wavelengths to be analyzed. Helium-neon lasers, excimer lasers, and ruby lasers do not offer the same level of tunability as dye lasers and are therefore less suitable for conducting spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths.",
