A gas cell with an optical path length of 10 cm is placed in one arm of a Michelson interferometer. If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to consider the interference pattern created by the Michelson interferometer. The fringe pattern is created due to the phase shift experienced by the light passing through the gas cell.\n\nThe phase shift, \u0394\u03c6, can be calculated using the equation:\n\n\u0394\u03c6 = 2\u03c0 * (n_gas - 1) * d / \u03bb\n\nWhere n_gas is the refractive index of the gas, d is the optical path length (10 cm in this case), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the laser (632.2 nm = 632.2 x 10^-9 m).\n\nGiven that 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated, we know that the phase shift corresponds to a full 2\u03c0 shift. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n2\u03c0 = 2 * \u03c0 * (n_gas - 1) * d / \u03bb\n\nSolving for n_gas:\n\nn_gas - 1 = \u03bb / (2 * d)\n\nn_gas = 1 + (\u03bb / (2 * d))\n\nn_gas = 1 + (632.2 x 10^-9 m / (2 * 0.1 m))\n\nn_gas = 1.00063\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1.00063.",
