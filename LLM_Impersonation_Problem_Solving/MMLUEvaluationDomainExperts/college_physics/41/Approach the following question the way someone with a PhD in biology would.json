If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the index of refraction of the original gas in the gas cell, we can use the formula:\n\nn = 1 + (\u03bb * N) / (2 * L)\n\nWhere:\nn = index of refraction of the gas\n\u03bb = wavelength of the laser (632.2 nm = 632.2 x 10^-9 m)\nN = number of fringes counted (100)\nL = optical path length (10 cm = 0.1 m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nn = 1 + ((632.2 x 10^-9) * 100) / (2 * 0.1)\nn = 1 + (6.322 x 10^-5) / 0.2\nn = 1 + 0.0003161\nn = 1.0003161\n\nTherefore, the index of refraction of the original gas in the gas cell is approximately 1.00032, which corresponds to option B.",
