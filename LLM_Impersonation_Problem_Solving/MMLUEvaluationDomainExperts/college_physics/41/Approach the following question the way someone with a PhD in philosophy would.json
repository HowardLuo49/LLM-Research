A gas cell with an optical path length of 10 cm is placed in one arm of a Michelson interferometer. If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "We can start by using the formula for the number of fringes in an interference pattern:\n\nN = 2nt / \u03bb\n\nWhere:\nN = number of fringes\nn = refractive index of the gas\nt = optical path length\n\u03bb = wavelength of the light source\n\nGiven that the optical path length is 10 cm, the wavelength of the light source is 632.2 nm, and 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the refractive index:\n\nn = N\u03bb / 2t\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nn = (100 * 632.2 * 10^-9) / (2 * 10 * 10^-2)\n\nn = 0.00006322 / 0.002\n\nn = 0.03161\n\nTherefore, the index of refraction of the original gas is 1 + 0.03161 = 1.00032\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1.00032",
