A gas cell with an optical path length of 10 cm is placed in one arm of a Michelson interferometer. If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the number of fringes observed in an interferometer:\n\nN = 2 * n * L / lambda\n\nWhere:\n- N is the number of fringes observed\n- n is the refractive index of the medium\n- L is the optical path length in the medium\n- lambda is the wavelength of the light source\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nN = 100 fringes\nL = 10 cm = 0.1 m\nlambda = 632.8 nm = 632.8 x 10^-9 m\n\nTherefore:\n100 = 2 * n * 0.1 / 632.8 x 10^-9\nn = 100 * 632.8 x 10^-9 / 2 * 0.1\nn = 0.00006328 / 0.02\nn = 0.003164\n\nSo, the refractive index of the gas is approximately 1.000316.
