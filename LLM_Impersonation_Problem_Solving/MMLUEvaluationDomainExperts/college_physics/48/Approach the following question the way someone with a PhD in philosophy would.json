A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "A philosopher with a PhD would approach this question by considering the principles of special relativity and the concept of the speed of light in different mediums. In this case, the water is moving at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame, and the speed of light in water is given by the index of refraction, which is 4/3.\n\nTo determine the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame, we can use the formula for the speed of light in a medium: v = c/n, where v is the speed of light in the medium, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nSubstituting the values given, we have v = c/(4/3) = 3c/4. Since the water is moving at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame, we can add the velocities using the relativistic addition of velocities formula: u = (v + u')/(1 + vu'/c^2), where u is the relative velocity of light in water to the lab frame (which we want to find), v is the speed of water, and u' is the speed of light in water.\n\nSubstitute the values v = 1/2 c, u' = 3c/4, and c = 1 into the formula, and we have u = (1/2 c + 3c/4)/(1 + 1/2 * 3/4) = (2/4 + 3/4)/(1 + 3/8) = 5/6 c.\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame is 5/6 c.
