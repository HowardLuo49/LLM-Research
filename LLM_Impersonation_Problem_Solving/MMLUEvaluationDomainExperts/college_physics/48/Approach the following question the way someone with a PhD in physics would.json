A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of relativity along with the concept of the speed of light in a medium. According to the principle of relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial reference frames. \n\nIn the lab frame, the water tube is moving at 1/2 the speed of light (c/2). When the beam of light enters the tube of water, its speed relative to the water will be reduced by a factor of the refractive index of water (4/3) since the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in water relative to the water tube will be (1/2) * (4/3) = 2/3 c. \n\nFinally, to find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame, we need to add the velocity of the water tube to the velocity of light in the water: \n\n1/2 c + 2/3 c = 5/6 c\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is 5/6 c.\n\nC: 5/6 c",
