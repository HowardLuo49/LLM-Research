At the present time, the temperature of the universe (i.e., the microwave radiation background) is about 3 K. When the temperature was 12 K, typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were\nA: one-quarter as distant as they are today\nB: one-half as distant as they are today\nC: separated by about the same distances as they are today\nD: two times as distant as they are today",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we need to consider the relationship between the temperature of the universe and the distances between typical objects such as galaxies. The temperature of the universe is directly related to its age and expansion according to the Big Bang theory. As the universe expands and cools, the temperature decreases over time.\n\nWhen the temperature was 12 K, the universe was hotter and denser than it is at present. This implies that typical objects like galaxies were closer together due to the higher density of matter. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC: separated by about the same distances as they are today\n\nThis is based on the understanding that as the universe expands and cools, typical objects move further apart from each other, but the relative distances between them remain similar at different temperatures.",
