At the present time, the temperature of the universe (i.e., the microwave radiation background) is about 3 K. When the temperature was 12 K, typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were\nA: one-quarter as distant as they are today\nB: one-half as distant as they are today\nC: separated by about the same distances as they are today\nD: two times as distant as they are today",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can utilize our knowledge of how the expansion of the universe affects the distances between objects. The scale factor of the universe, denoted as \"a\", is a measure of how the size of the universe changes over time. The relationship between the scale factor a and the temperature T of the universe is given by the equation a \u221d 1/T.\n\nWhen the temperature T of the universe was 12 K, the scale factor of the universe a would have been 1/12. Now that the temperature is 3 K, the scale factor a is 1/3. Using the relationship a \u221d 1/T, we can see that the scale factor has increased by a factor of 3/12 = 1/4 from the time when the temperature was 12 K to the present temperature of 3 K.\n\nTherefore, when the temperature was 12 K, objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were one-quarter as distant as they are today. Hence, the correct answer is A: one-quarter as distant as they are today.",
