The temperature of the universe is directly related to the rate of expansion, with a higher temperature corresponding to a smaller scale size of the universe due to higher energy densities in the early universe.\n\nGiven that the temperature of the universe was 12 K in the past and is currently 3 K, we can infer that the universe has expanded and cooled over time. This means that typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were closer together when the temperature was 12 K compared to now.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be:\nB: one-half as distant as they are today. This indicates that typical objects in the universe were twice as close together when the temperature was 12 K compared to the current temperature of 3 K.",
