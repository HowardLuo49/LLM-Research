    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I must first acknowledge that this question delves into the realm of cosmology and physics, beyond my expertise in literary analysis. However, I can attempt to approach this question from a theoretical standpoint.\n\nGiven the relationship between the temperature of the universe and the distances between objects, we must consider the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, objects move farther apart from each other. The temperature of the universe correlates with the rate of expansion, so a higher temperature in the past implies a denser, closer universe.\n\nTherefore, when the temperature of the universe was 12 K, objects were closer together than they are at the present temperature of 3 K. This indicates that typical objects, such as galaxies, were likely one-quarter as distant as they are today. This conclusion aligns with the understanding that the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, leading to increased distances between objects over time.",
