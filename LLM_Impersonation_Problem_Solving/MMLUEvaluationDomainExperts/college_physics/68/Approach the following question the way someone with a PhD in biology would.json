When the temperature was 12 K, the universe was in a different state compared to the present temperature of 3 K. This difference in temperature suggests a different state of cosmic evolution and expansion.\n\nBased on our understanding of cosmological theory and the relationship between temperature and the expansion of the universe, we can infer that when the temperature was 12 K, galaxies were likely closer together compared to their current distances. This is because a higher temperature typically corresponds to a denser and more compact universe, which would result in galaxies being closer to each other.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer to the question would be that at a temperature of 12 K, galaxies were A: one-quarter as distant as they are today. This is based on the assumption that the higher temperature would correspond to a denser universe with galaxies in closer proximity to each other.",
