    "gpt_response": "To analyze this question from a literary perspective, one must first understand the context of atomic emission spectra. The emission spectrum of an atom is unique to that atom and is determined by the different energy levels of its electrons. In the case of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ (Z = 3, A = 7), the emission spectrum is being compared to that of a hydrogen atom.\n\nConsidering the differences in atomic structure between lithium and hydrogen, it is evident that the wavelengths of the emission spectrum would differ. However, the question posits that the emission spectra of the doubly ionized lithium atom is identical to that of a hydrogen atom, but with a specific factor applied to the wavelengths.\n\nGiven that hydrogen has an atomic number (Z) of 1, while lithium has a Z of 3, it can be inferred that the wavelengths would be decreased when comparing the two emission spectra. To determine the specific factor by which the wavelengths are decreased, one must consider the relationship between atomic number and wavelength in the context of emission spectra.\n\nApplying the principles of atomic emission spectra and the comparison between hydrogen and doubly ionized lithium, it can be concluded that the correct answer is B: decreased by a factor of 49. This factor of 49 represents the difference in atomic number between the two atoms and the corresponding decrease in wavelengths in their respective emission spectra.",
