    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand the concept of emission spectroscopy. Emission spectroscopy is the study of the light emitted by atoms or molecules when they transition from an excited state to a lower energy state. Each element has a unique emission spectrum based on the arrangement of its electrons.\n\nIn this case, we are comparing the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ with that of the hydrogen atom. The emission spectrum of hydrogen is well-studied and has a series of lines that are known as the Balmer series. These lines correspond to transitions of the electron in the hydrogen atom between different energy levels.\n\nThe emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ would involve transitions of its electrons between energy levels specific to the lithium atom. However, the question states that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom, albeit with all the wavelengths altered.\n\nGiven that the lithium atom Li++ has a nuclear charge of Z=3, which is lower than that of hydrogen (Z=1), the corresponding wavelengths of the emission spectrum of Li++ would be smaller than those of hydrogen. This is because the energy levels and transitions in Li++ are different from those in hydrogen due to the higher nuclear charge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: decreased by a factor of 9 since the wavelengths are proportional to the inverse of the square of the nuclear charge.",
