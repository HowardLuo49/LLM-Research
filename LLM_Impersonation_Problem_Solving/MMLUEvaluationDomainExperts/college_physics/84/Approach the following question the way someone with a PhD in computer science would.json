    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to consider the emission spectra of both the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ and the hydrogen atom. The emission spectra of atoms are determined by the energy levels of their electrons.\n\nIn the case of hydrogen, the energy levels are given by the formula E = -13.6eV/n^2, where n is the principal quantum number. The hydrogen atom has a single electron, so its energy levels are determined by this formula.\n\nFor the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++, it has lost two electrons compared to neutral lithium. As a result, the effective nuclear charge is higher, leading to a different set of energy levels compared to hydrogen.\n\nWhen comparing the emission spectra of Li++ and hydrogen, the wavelengths of the emitted photons from Li++ will be different due to the difference in energy levels. The relationship between the wavelengths can be determined by comparing the energy levels of the two atoms.\n\nThe energy levels of Li++ are related to the hydrogen atom by a factor of (Z-2)^2, where Z is the atomic number of the lithium atom. In this case, Z = 3, so the factor is (3-2)^2 = 1. Therefore, the wavelengths of the emitted photons from Li++ will be decreased by a factor of 1 compared to hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: decreased by a factor of 9.",
