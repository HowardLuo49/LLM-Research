    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first consider the emission spectrum of the hydrogen atom. In the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are determined by the equation E = -13.6 eV/n^2, where n is the principal quantum number. The wavelength of the emitted photon from a transition between two energy levels can be calculated using the formula E = hc/\u03bb, where h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nFor the hydrogen atom, the emitted wavelengths are given by the Balmer series formula: 1/\u03bb = R(1/n_1^2 - 1/n_2^2), where R is the Rydberg constant and n_1 and n_2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy levels, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the doubly ionized lithium ion Li++ (Z=3, A=7). Since it is doubly ionized, it has lost two electrons and now has only one electron left. The emission spectrum of an ion with a single electron is similar to that of hydrogen, with the main difference being the effective nuclear charge experienced by the remaining electron.\n\nThe effective nuclear charge for Li++ can be calculated as Z_effective = Z - S, where Z is the atomic number and S is the screening constant. For the Li++ ion, with Z=3, the screening constant S can be approximated as 1, resulting in an effective nuclear charge of 2.\n\nTherefore, the emission spectrum of Li++ will be similar to that of hydrogen, but the energy levels will be shifted due to the different effective nuclear charge. This shift will result in changes in the wavelengths of the emitted photons.\n\nGiven that all the wavelengths in the emission spectrum of Li++ are identical to those of hydrogen, the wavelengths in the Li++ spectrum will be affected by the change in energy levels due to the effective nuclear charge. The factor by which the wavelengths will change can be estimated based on the difference in the effective nuclear charge between hydrogen and Li++.\n\nSince the effective nuclear charge for Li++ is 2, whereas for hydrogen it is 1, the wavelengths in the Li++ emission spectrum will be decreased by a factor of 2^2 = 4 compared to hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options given.",
