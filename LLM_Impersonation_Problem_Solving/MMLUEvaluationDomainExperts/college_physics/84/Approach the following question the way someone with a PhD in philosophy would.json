    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, it is important to approach this question with critical thinking and a deep understanding of atomic structure and quantum mechanics. In this case, the emission spectrum of an atom is determined by the energy levels of its electrons and the transitions between these levels.\n\nThe doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ has 3 protons and 1 electron, resulting in a total charge of +2. The emission spectrum of Li++ would differ from that of a hydrogen atom due to the different number of protons and electrons.\n\nIn the case of a hydrogen atom, the wavelengths in the emission spectrum are determined by the energy differences between the electron orbitals, which are quantized and given by the Rydberg formula. Given that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom, it suggests that the energy levels and transitions are the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: decreased by a factor of 49. This is because the wavelength of light is inversely proportional to the energy difference between electron orbitals, and the energy levels in Li++ are 49 times greater than in hydrogen due to the difference in nuclear charge.",
