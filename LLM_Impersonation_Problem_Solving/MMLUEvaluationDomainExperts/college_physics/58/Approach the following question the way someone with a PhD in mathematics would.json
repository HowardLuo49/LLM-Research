A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "To find the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced EMF is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. \n\nThe magnetic flux through the coil is given by the formula \u03a6 = B*A*N, where B is the magnetic field, A is the area of the coil, and N is the number of turns in the coil.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field is 0.01 T, so the initial magnetic flux through the coil is \u03a6i = 0.01*0.2*250 = 0.5 Wb.\n\nFinally, the magnetic field is 0.06 T, so the final magnetic flux through the coil is \u03a6f = 0.06*0.2*250 = 3 Wb.\n\nThe change in magnetic flux \u0394\u03a6 = \u03a6f - \u03a6i = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 Wb.\n\nThe time interval during which this change occurs is 0.25 s.\n\nTherefore, the average induced EMF in the coil is given by the formula EMF = \u0394\u03a6/\u0394t = 2.5/0.25 = 10 V.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10 V.",
