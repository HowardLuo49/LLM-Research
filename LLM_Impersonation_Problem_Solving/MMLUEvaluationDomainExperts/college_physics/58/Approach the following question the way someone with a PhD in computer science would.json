A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This law states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a closed circuit is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit.\n\nMathematically, the induced EMF (E) is given by the equation E = -N(d\u03a6/dt), where N is the number of turns in the coil, \u03a6 is the magnetic flux through the coil, and d\u03a6/dt is the rate of change of magnetic flux.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial magnetic flux through the coil. The magnetic flux (\u03a6) through a coil is given by the equation \u03a6 = B*A, where B is the magnetic field strength and A is the area of the coil. Therefore, the initial magnetic flux is 0.01 T * 0.2 m^2 = 0.002 Wb.\n\nNext, we calculate the final magnetic flux through the coil. The final magnetic flux is 0.06 T * 0.2 m^2 = 0.012 Wb.\n\nNow, we calculate the rate of change of magnetic flux. \u0394\u03a6 = \u03a6_final - \u03a6_initial = 0.012 Wb - 0.002 Wb = 0.01 Wb. \n\nSince the time interval is 0.25 s, the rate of change of magnetic flux is \u0394\u03a6/\u0394t = 0.01 Wb / 0.25 s = 0.04 Wb/s.\n\nFinally, we calculate the induced EMF using the formula E = -N(d\u03a6/dt). Substituting N = 250, we have E = -250(0.04) = -10 V. \n\nThus, the correct answer is D: 10 V.",
