A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "In analyzing the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a circular coil subjected to a changing magnetic field, we must invoke Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. According to this law, the induced EMF in a coil is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. The equation for calculating the induced EMF can be expressed as:\n\nEMF = -N * A * (\u0394B/\u0394t)\n\nwhere EMF is the induced electromotive force, N is the number of turns of the coil, A is the area of the coil, \u0394B is the change in magnetic field strength, and \u0394t is the time interval over which the change occurs.\n\nGiven the values in the question, we can plug in the numbers to calculate the induced EMF:\n\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.06 - 0.01) / 0.25\n\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * 0.05 / 0.25\n\nEMF = -250 * 0.04\n\nEMF = -10 V\n\nSince the negative sign in the equation denotes the direction of the induced current, we disregard it for calculating the magnitude of the induced EMF. Thus, the correct answer is D: 10 V.",
