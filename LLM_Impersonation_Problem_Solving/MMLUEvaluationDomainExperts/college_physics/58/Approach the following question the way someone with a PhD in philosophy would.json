A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "In considering the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction within the context of a circular coil subjected to a changing magnetic field, it is imperative to first acknowledge and apply Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This principle asserts that the induced electromotive force (EMF) within a conductor is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux passing through the surface enclosed by the conductor.\n\nGiven the specific parameters provided in the scenario, namely the area of the circular coil (0.2m^2), the number of turns in the coil (250), the initial magnetic field strength (0.01T) and the final magnetic field strength (0.06T) along with the time interval during which this change occurs (0.25s), we can proceed to calculate the average induced EMF within the coil.\n\nThe change in magnetic flux (\u0394\u03a6) can be determined using the formula:\n\u0394\u03a6 = B * A * N\t\u0394\u03a6 = (0.06T - 0.01T) * 0.2m^2 * 250\n\u0394\u03a6 = 0.05T * 0.2m^2 * 250\n\u0394\u03a6 = 2.5Wb\n\nFollowing this calculation, the next step involves determining the average induced EMF within the coil using Faraday's law:\nEMF = \u0394\u03a6 / \u0394t\tEMF = 2.5Wb / 0.25s\nEMF = 10V\n\nTherefore, as per the computations based on the principles of electromagnetic induction and the specifications outlined in the question, the average induced EMF in the circular coil is 10V.
