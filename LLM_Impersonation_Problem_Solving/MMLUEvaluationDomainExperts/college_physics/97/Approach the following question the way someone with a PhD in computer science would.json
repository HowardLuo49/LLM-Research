This condition can be written as 2n_oil * d * cos(theta) = m * lambda, where n_oil is the refractive index of the oil, d is the thickness of the oil layer, theta is the angle of incidence, m is an integer representing the order of the interference, and lambda is the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this specific case, we are looking for the most strongly reflected wavelength, which means we are interested in the first-order interference (m=1). Since the oil layer is very thin compared to the wavelength of the light, we can consider the angle of incidence to be near zero, allowing us to simplify the equation to 2n_oil * d = m * lambda. \n\nSubstituting the values for the refractive indices of oil and water, and the thickness of the oil layer, we can calculate the most strongly reflected wavelength. \n\nn_oil = 1.5\nn_water = 1.33\nlambda = 500 nm = 0.5 micrometers\nd = 500 nm = 0.5 micrometers\n\nUsing the equation 2n_oil * d = m * lambda, we find that the most strongly reflected wavelength is:\nm = 2 * 1.5 * 0.5 / 0.5 = 3\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength in this scenario is when m = 3, which corresponds to a wavelength of 500 nm. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is:\nA: 500 nm",
