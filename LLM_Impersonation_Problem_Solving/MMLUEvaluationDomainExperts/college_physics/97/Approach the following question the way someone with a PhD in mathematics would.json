A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to consider the conditions for constructive interference. \n\nWhen light travels from a medium with a higher index of refraction (such as oil) to a medium with a lower index of refraction (such as air), there is a phase change of 180 degrees upon reflection. This means that light waves reflected at the oil-air interface will be 180 degrees out of phase with the incident light waves. \n\nFor constructive interference to occur, the path length difference between the reflected rays and the incident rays must be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the medium with the lower index of refraction (air). \n\nThe formula for the path length difference is given by:\n\u0394L = 2ntcos\u03b8 \n\nWhere:\n\u0394L = path length difference\nn = refractive index of the medium the light is traveling through (in this case, air)\nt = thickness of the oil layer\n\u03b8 = angle of incidence\n\nSince the light is incident normally on the oil layer, \u03b8 = 0 and cos\u03b8 = 1. Therefore, the path length difference simplifies to:\n\u0394L = 2nt\n\nFor constructive interference, the path length difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength in air:\n\u0394L = m\u03bb\n\nWhere m is an integer. \n\nSubstitute in the values for the oil layer thickness (t = 500 nm = 0.5 \u03bcm) and refractive indices (n(oil) = 1.5, n(air) = 1) to get:\n2(1)(0.5) = m\u03bb\n\nTherefore,\n\u03bb = 1 \u03bcm/m = 1000 nm\n\nSince the question asks for the most strongly reflected wavelength, which corresponds to the minimum value of m, we have m = 1. \n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 1000 nm, which is not listed among the options provided.",
