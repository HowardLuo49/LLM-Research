A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The most strongly reflected wavelength in this scenario can be determined using the equation for thin film interference. When light travels from a medium with a lower index of refraction to a medium with a higher index of refraction, part of the light is reflected at the interface between the two media. The rest of the light is transmitted into the higher index medium and partially reflects back at the interface between the two media. These reflected waves interfere with each other resulting in constructive or destructive interference.\n\nThe condition for constructive interference in thin film interference is given by the equation: \n\n2nt = m\u03bb\n\nwhere n is the index of refraction of the film (1.5), t is the thickness of the film (500 nm), m is an integer representing the order of the interference (1 for the most strongly reflected wavelength), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the light in the medium of the film.\n\nBy rearranging the equation, we can solve for the wavelength (\u03bb):\n\n\u03bb = 2nt / m\n\nPlugging in the values and solving for the wavelength, we get:\n\n\u03bb = 2 * 1.5 * 500 / 1 = 1500 nm\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 1500 nm, which is not one of the options provided. However, the closest option is 650 nm (D), so that would be the correct choice in this case.",
