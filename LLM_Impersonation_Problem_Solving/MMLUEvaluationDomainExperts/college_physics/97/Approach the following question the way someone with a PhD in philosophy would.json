    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, one must first understand the principles of reflection and refraction as they apply to the interaction of light with different materials. When light passes through a medium with a different index of refraction, some of it is reflected and the rest is transmitted. The amount of light reflected depends on the angle of incidence and the difference in the indices of refraction between the two materials.\n\nIn this scenario, white light incident on the oil/water interface will result in both reflection and transmission. The specific wavelength that is most strongly reflected can be determined by applying the Fresnel equations, which describe the reflection and transmission of light at an interface between two materials.\n\nUsing the Fresnel equations and the given indices of refraction for water (1.33) and oil (1.5), one would find that the most strongly reflected wavelength corresponds to the color that is complementary to the color of the thin oil layer. \n\nSince the oil layer is 500 nm thick and has an index of refraction of 1.5, the most strongly reflected wavelength would be the color that is complementary to the color that is absorbed by the oil layer. In this case, the color absorbed by the oil layer would be around 500 nm (blue-green), so the most strongly reflected wavelength would be in the red range, around 650 nm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 650 nm.",
