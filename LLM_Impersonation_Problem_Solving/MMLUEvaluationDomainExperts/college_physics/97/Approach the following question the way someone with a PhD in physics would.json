A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength in this system, we need to consider interference effects. When light reflects off the top surface of the oil layer, there will be a phase change of \u03c0 due to the higher index of refraction of the oil compared to the surrounding water. This phase change will cause constructive and destructive interference of reflected light waves at different wavelengths.\n\nUsing the equation for constructive interference in a thin film layer: 2nt = m\u03bb, where n is the refractive index of the material, t is the thickness of the layer, m is the order of interference, and \u03bb is the wavelength of light.\n\nFor the first order of interference (m=1):\n2n\u2081t\u2081 = \u03bb\u2081\n2(1.33)(500 nm) = \u03bb\u2081\n\u03bb\u2081 = 1330 nm\n\nFor the second order of interference (m=2):\n2n\u2082t\u2082 = \u03bb\u2082\n2(1.33)(500 nm) = \u03bb\u2082\n\u03bb\u2082 = 2660 nm\n\nFor the third order of interference (m=3):\n2n\u2083t\u2083 = \u03bb\u2083\n2(1.33)(500 nm) = \u03bb\u2083\n\u03bb\u2083 = 3990 nm\n\nSince the oil layer thickness (500 nm) is much smaller compared to the wavelengths calculated above, we can see that the most strongly reflected wavelength will be the first order of interference (m=1) at 1330 nm. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed; it would be 1330 nm.",
