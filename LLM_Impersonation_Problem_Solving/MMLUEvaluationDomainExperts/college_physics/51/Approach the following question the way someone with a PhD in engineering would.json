In this context, the most suitable type of laser would be a dye laser.\n\nDye lasers are tunable over a wide range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum, making them ideal for spectroscopy applications where precise control over the laser wavelength is necessary. In contrast, helium-neon lasers emit light at a fixed wavelength and would not be suitable for this application. Excimer lasers are typically used in the ultraviolet region and would not cover the visible wavelengths required for spectroscopy.\n\nSimilarly, ruby lasers operate at a fixed wavelength in the red region of the spectrum and would not provide the flexibility needed for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths. Therefore, based on the requirements for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths, a dye laser would be the best choice among the options provided.",
