Dye lasers offer a wide tuning range in the visible spectrum, allowing for precise control over the emitted wavelength. Additionally, dye lasers can be easily tuned to specific wavelengths, making them ideal for spectroscopic studies requiring a broad range of wavelengths.\n\nHelium-neon lasers, on the other hand, typically emit at specific wavelengths within the visible spectrum and have limited tuning capabilities. Excimer lasers are typically used in ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet spectroscopy and are not well-suited for visible wavelength range studies. Ruby lasers emit at a specific wavelength in the red region of the spectrum and do not offer the tuning capabilities required for covering a wide range of visible wavelengths in spectroscopy.\n\nTherefore, based on the requirement for spectroscopy over a range of visible wavelengths, the most suitable laser would be a dye laser due to its wide tuning range and flexibility in controlling emitted wavelengths within the visible spectrum.",
