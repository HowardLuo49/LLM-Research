In this case, n=100 and p=0.1, so the expected number of photons detected is 100*0.1=10. \n\nThe root mean square deviation (rms deviation) can be calculated using the formula sqrt(np(1-p)), which in this case is sqrt(100*0.1*0.9) \u2248 3. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
