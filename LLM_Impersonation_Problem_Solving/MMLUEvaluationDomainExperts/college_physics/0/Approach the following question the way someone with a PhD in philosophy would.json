    "gpt_response": "In addressing the question concerning the quantum efficiency of a photon detector, it is imperative to recognize the fundamental principles at play. The quantum efficiency, denoted by the symbol \u03b7, represents the probability that a single photon incident on the detector will be converted into an electrical signal. In this particular scenario where the quantum efficiency is stated to be 0.1, we can infer that there is a 10% chance for a photon to be detected by the detector.\n\nGiven the information that 100 photons are sent into the detector sequentially, it follows that the expected number of photons detected by the detector is determined by the product of the number of photons sent and the quantum efficiency. Consequently, the anticipated number of photon detections is 100 * 0.1 = 10.\n\nRelative to the root mean square (rms) deviation, a statistical measure of the dispersion of values from the average, it is essential to recognize the variance associated with the number of detected photons. In the context of a photon detector with a quantum efficiency of 0.1, the standard deviation of the number of detected photons can be calculated using the formula for the standard deviation of a binomial distribution: \u221a(N * \u03b7 * (1- \u03b7)), where N represents the total number of trials (photons sent) and \u03b7 denotes the quantum efficiency.\n\nIn applying this formula to the current context, the square root of (100 * 0.1 * 0.9) equals approximately 3. Therefore, the root mean square deviation of the number of detected photons is estimated to be about 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct response to the question posed would be option B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3. This conclusion is reached by utilizing statistical principles and probability theory in conjunction with an understanding of the properties of photon detection efficiency.",
