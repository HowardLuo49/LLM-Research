The quantum efficiency of a photon detector refers to the probability that a photon incident on the detector will be detected. In this case, the quantum efficiency is given as 0.1, meaning that there is a 10% chance of each photon being detected.\n\nWhen 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, the average number of photons detected can be calculated as the product of the number of photons sent (100) and the quantum efficiency (0.1), resulting in an average of 10 photons being detected.\n\nThe root mean square (rms) deviation can be calculated using the formula sqrt(N*p*(1-p)), where N is the number of photons sent, p is the quantum efficiency (0.1 in this case).
