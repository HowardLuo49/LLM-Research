    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of quantum efficiency in photon detectors. Quantum efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of electrons produced by the detector to the number of incident photons. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, meaning that for every 10 incident photons, only 1 photon is detected by the detector.\n\nGiven that 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, with a quantum efficiency of 0.1, we can expect that the detector will detect an average of 10 photons in total. This is calculated by taking 100 photons and multiplying by the quantum efficiency of 0.1.\n\nAs for the root mean square (rms) deviation, this is a measure of how spread out the values are in a set of data. Since the quantum efficiency of the detector is 0.1, we can expect some variation in the number of detected photons around the average of 10. The rms deviation can be calculated by taking the square root of the average squared deviation from the mean. In this case, with 100 photons and a quantum efficiency of 0.1, the rms deviation would be approximately 3, as the deviation from the average of 10 is around 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
