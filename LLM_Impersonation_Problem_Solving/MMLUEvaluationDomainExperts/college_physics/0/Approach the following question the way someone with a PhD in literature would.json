    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in literature, my expertise lies in the analysis and interpretation of literary texts rather than in physics or quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, I will attempt to approach this question using my critical thinking skills and academic background.\n\nThe quantum efficiency of a photon detector refers to the fraction of incident photons that the detector is able to detect. In this case, the quantum efficiency is given as 0.1, which means that the detector is able to detect 10% of the photons that are sent into it.\n\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, the average number of photons that will be detected by the detector can be calculated as the product of the total number of photons and the quantum efficiency. In this case, the average number of photons detected would be 100 x 0.1 = 10.\n\nThe root mean square (rms) deviation is a statistical measure of the dispersion of data points around the mean. In this case, the rms deviation can be calculated using the formula for the standard deviation. Since the distribution of detected photons follows a Poisson distribution, the rms deviation can be approximated as the square root of the average number of detected photons, which is \u221a10.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
