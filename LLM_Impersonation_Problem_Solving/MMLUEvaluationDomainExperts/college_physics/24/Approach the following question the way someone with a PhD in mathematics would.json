In this context, the Hall coefficient is the most relevant property for making this determination. By measuring the Hall coefficient, one can understand the direction of the charge carriers in the material, which ultimately determines whether they are positive (holes) or negative (electrons). The other properties listed, such as magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity, are not directly related to the sign of the charge carriers in a semiconductor and would not provide the necessary information for this specific determination.",
