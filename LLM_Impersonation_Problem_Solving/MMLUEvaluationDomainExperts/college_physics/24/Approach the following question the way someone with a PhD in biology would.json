    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In a doped semiconductor, the type of charge carriers present can be determined by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a property that describes the behavior of charge carriers in a magnetic field, allowing for the determination of whether the majority charge carriers are electrons or holes. This measurement is crucial in understanding the electrical properties of doped semiconductors and can help in optimizing their performance for various applications. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity are also important properties of doped semiconductors, but they do not provide direct information about the sign of the charge carriers.",
