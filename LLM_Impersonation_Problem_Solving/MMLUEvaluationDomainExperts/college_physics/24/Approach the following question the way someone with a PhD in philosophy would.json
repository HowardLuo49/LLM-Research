One particularly useful property is the Hall coefficient, denoted by option B. The Hall coefficient is a fundamental parameter that characterizes the charged carriers, and its sign can be used to determine the sign of the majority carriers in the material.\n\nIn the Hall effect, a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the current flow in the semiconductor, resulting in a transverse voltage. By measuring this voltage and the applied magnetic field, one can calculate the Hall coefficient and infer the sign of the charge carriers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is option B: Hall coefficient. By measuring this property, one can determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor, providing crucial insight into the material's electrical behavior and conduction mechanisms.",
