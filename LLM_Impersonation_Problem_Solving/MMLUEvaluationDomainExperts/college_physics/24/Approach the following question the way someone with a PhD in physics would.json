    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor, one would typically look at the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a measure of the ratio of induced electric field to the applied magnetic field in the Hall effect. By analyzing the sign of the Hall coefficient, one can determine whether the majority charge carriers in the semiconductor are positive (holes) or negative (electrons). This information is crucial for understanding the electrical properties of the doped semiconductor and for designing electronic devices based on it. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity are important properties of materials, but they are not directly related to the sign of the charge carriers in a semiconductor.",
