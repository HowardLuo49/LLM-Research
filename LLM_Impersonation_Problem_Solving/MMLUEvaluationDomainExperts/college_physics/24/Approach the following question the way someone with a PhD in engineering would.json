    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a characteristic property of a material that describes how the sign and density of charge carriers affect the material's electrical behavior in the presence of a magnetic field. By measuring the Hall coefficient, one can determine whether the majority charge carriers in the semiconductor are electrons (negative charge) or holes (positive charge), thus indicating the sign of the charge carriers. Magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity are not typically used to determine the sign of charge carriers in doped semiconductors.",
