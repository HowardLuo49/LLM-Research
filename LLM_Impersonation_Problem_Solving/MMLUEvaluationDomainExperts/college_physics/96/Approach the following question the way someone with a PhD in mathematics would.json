In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest. If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\nA: 0\nB: 1/4\nC: 1/3\nD: 1/2",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction of initial kinetic energy lost in the collision, we first need to calculate the initial and final kinetic energies of the system.\n\nInitially, the first particle has a mass of 2m and a velocity, which we can denote as v, and the second particle has a mass of m and is at rest. The initial kinetic energy of the system can be calculated as 1/2 * (2m) * v^2 = mv^2.\n\nAfter the collision, the two particles stick together and move with a common velocity, which we can denote as V. The final kinetic energy of the system can be calculated as 1/2 * (2m + m) * V^2 = 3/2 * m * V^2.\n\nThe fraction of initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is given by (initial kinetic energy - final kinetic energy) / initial kinetic energy = (mv^2 - 3/2 * m * V^2) / mv^2.\n\nTo solve for this fraction, we need to first find the final velocity V by conserving momentum: (2m)v = (2m + m)V. Using this, we find V = v/3.\n\nSubstitute this back into the fraction equation, we get [(mv^2 - 3/2 * m * v^2/9) / mv^2] = 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1/3.",
