In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest. If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\nA: 0\nB: 1/4\nC: 1/3\nD: 1/2",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision, we first need to calculate the initial kinetic energy of the system before the collision. The initial kinetic energy is given by:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * (2m) * v_initial^2 + 0.5 * m * 0^2\n            = m * v_initial^2\n\nwhere v_initial is the initial velocity of the particle of mass 2m. \n\nAfter the collision, the two particles stick together and move with a common velocity v_final. By conservation of momentum, we have:\n\n(2m) * v_initial = (2m + m) * v_final\nv_final = (2m) * v_initial / (3m)\nv_final = (2/3) * v_initial\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the system after the collision is given by:\n\nKE_final = 0.5 * (3m) * v_final^2\n         = 0.5 * (3m) * ((2/3) * v_initial)^2\n         = (2/3) * m * v_initial^2\n\nThe fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is then given by:\n\nKE_lost_fraction = (KE_initial - KE_final) / KE_initial\n                 = (m * v_initial^2 - (2/3) * m * v_initial^2) / (m * v_initial^2)\n                 = (1/3)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 1/3",
