In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest. If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\nA: 0\nB: 1/4\nC: 1/3\nD: 1/2",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision, we can use the conservation of momentum and the conservation of kinetic energy. \n\nFirst, considering the conservation of momentum in the collision, we have:\n2m*v_initial = (2m + m)*v_final\n\nwhere v_initial is the initial velocity of the particle of mass 2m, v_final is the final velocity of the combined masses, and the initial velocity of the particle of mass m is 0.\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for v_final:\nv_final = 2m*v_initial / 3m\nv_final = 2/3 * v_initial\n\nNow, using the conservation of kinetic energy:\n1/2 * 2m * v_initial^2 = 1/2 * (2m + m) * v_final^2\n\nWe can plug in the expression for v_final in terms of v_initial and solve for the fraction of kinetic energy lost:\n1/2 * 2m * v_initial^2 = 1/2 * 3m * (2/3 * v_initial)^2\n2m * v_initial^2 = 1/2 * 3m * 4/9 * v_initial^2\n2m * v_initial^2 = 2m * v_initial^2\n0 = 0\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is 0. This means that all of the initial kinetic energy is retained in the collision. Therefore, the answer is A: 0.",
