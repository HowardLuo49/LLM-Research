In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest.

However, I will attempt to approach this question from a theoretical and analytical perspective.\n\nIn a one-dimensional collision where a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest and they stick together, the conservation of momentum and energy principles can be utilized to determine the fraction of initial kinetic energy lost in the collision.\n\nInitially, the momentum before the collision can be calculated as:\ninitial momentum = 2m * v1, where v1 is the velocity of the particle with mass 2m\n\nSince the second particle is at rest, the total momentum before the collision is equal to 2m * v1.\n\nAfter the collision, the two particles stick together and move with a common velocity v2.
