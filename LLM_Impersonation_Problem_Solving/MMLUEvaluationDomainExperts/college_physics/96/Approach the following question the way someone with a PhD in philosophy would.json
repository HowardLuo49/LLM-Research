In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest. If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\nA: 0\nB: 1/4\nC: 1/3\nD: 1/2",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision between these two particles, one must utilize the principle of conservation of energy. \n\nFirstly, in the initial state before the collision, the only form of energy present is the kinetic energy of the mass 2m particle, given by (1/2) * (2m) * v^2, where v is the velocity of the mass 2m particle. \n\nIn the final state after the collision, the total kinetic energy is given by (1/2) * (3m) * Vf^2, where Vf is the final velocity of the combined mass. \n\nSince energy is conserved, we can equate the initial kinetic energy to the final kinetic energy, yielding (1/2) * (2m) * v^2 = (1/2) * (3m) * Vf^2. Solving for the final velocity Vf in terms of the initial velocity v gives Vf = v/2. \n\nThen, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is given by (initial kinetic energy - final kinetic energy) / initial kinetic energy = [(1/2) * (2m) * v^2 - (1/2) * (3m) * (v/2)^2] / (1/2) * (2m) * v^2 = 0. \n\nTherefore, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is 0, as option A indicates.",
