Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula from special relativity. In this case, the relative velocity between the two spaceships would be the sum of their individual velocities. Assuming that the speed of light in a vacuum is denoted by 'c', and the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth is denoted by 'v', we can set up the following equation:\n\nc = (v + (-v)) / (1 + (v * -v) / (c^2))\n\nSimplifying this equation, where v represents the speed of each spaceship:\n\nc = 0 / (1 - v^2 / c^2)\n0 = 1 - v^2 / c^2\n1 = v^2 / c^2\nv^2 = c^2\nv = c\n\nThus, the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth is equal to the speed of light, 'c'. However, since they are approaching Earth from opposite directions, their relative velocity would be the sum of their individual speeds, which is 2c. Since they have equal speeds as measured by the observer on Earth, each spaceship would have a speed of c/2 or 0.5c. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 0.5c.",
