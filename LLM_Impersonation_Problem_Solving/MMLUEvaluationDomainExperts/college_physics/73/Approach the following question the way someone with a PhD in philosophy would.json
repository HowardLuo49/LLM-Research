Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "From a philosophical perspective, we must first consider the concept of simultaneity and relativity as proposed by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. The observer on Earth will measure the speed of each spaceship differently due to the relativistic effects of time dilation and length contraction.\n\nGiven that the meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship, this indicates length contraction as a consequence of their relative motion. This implies that the meterstick appears shorter to the observer on Earth due to the high velocity of the spaceship.\n\nBy applying the Lorentz transformation equations, we can calculate the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth. From the given options, the speed of each spaceship would be 0.6c (option C) since the relativistic effects of length contraction and time dilation can account for the difference in the observed length of the meterstick. This showcases the intricate relationship between space, time, and motion as explored in the theory of special relativity.",
