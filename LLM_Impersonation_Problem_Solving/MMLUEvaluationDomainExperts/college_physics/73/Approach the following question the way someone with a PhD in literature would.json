Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",

    "gpt_response": "As a scholar of literature, I must acknowledge that this question delves into the realm of physics and special relativity. In order to unravel this query, one must consider the concept of length contraction and time dilation as outlined in Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nGiven that the meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship, we can ascertain that the length contraction factor is given by the equation:\n\nL = L0 /(1 - v^2/c^2)^(1/2)\n\nWhere L is the measured length, L0 is the proper length (in this case, 1 meter or 100 cm), v is the speed of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nBy plugging in the values, we can determine that the speed of each spaceship is equal to 0.6c. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 0.6c.",
