At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the fundamental frequency of a pipe open at both ends. The fundamental frequency of a pipe open at both ends is given by the equation:\n\nf = v / (2L)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nGiven that the frequency at 20\u00b0C is 440 Hz, and assuming the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C is v0, we can write:\n\n440 = v0 / (2L)\n\nNow, on a particularly cold day, the speed of sound is 3% lower than at 20\u00b0C. Therefore, the speed of sound at the cold day is:\n\nv = v0 * (1 - 0.03) = v0 * 0.97\n\nSubstitute this into the equation for the fundamental frequency:\n\nf = v / (2L) = (v0 * 0.97) / (2L)\n\nSince the length of the pipe remains the same, the new frequency on the cold day can be written as:\n\nf_cold = (440 * 0.97) = 427 Hz\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 427 Hz.",
