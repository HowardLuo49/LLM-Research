At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between the resonant frequency of a pipe and the speed of sound in the pipe. The resonant frequency of a pipe of length L that is open at both ends is given by the formula:\n\nf = v / (2L) \n\nwhere f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nGiven that the resonant frequency at 20\u00b0C is 440 Hz and the speed of sound at that temperature, we can calculate the length of the pipe using the formula above:\n\n440 = v / (2L)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the speed of sound at the colder temperature where it is 3% lower than at 20\u00b0C. Let's denote the speed of sound at the colder temperature as v_0. Since the speed of sound decreases by 3%, we have:\n\nv_0 = 0.97v\n\nSubstitute this into the formula for the resonant frequency at the colder temperature:\n\nf_0 = v_0 / (2L)\n\nNow, substitute v_0 in terms of v into the above equation:\n\nf_0 = 0.97v / (2L)\n\nSince L is constant for the pipe, we can rewrite this in terms of the resonant frequency at 20\u00b0C:\n\nf_0 = 0.97 * (440) = 0.97 * 440 =  427 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency at which the pipe resonates on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3% lower is approximately 427 Hz, which makes the answer B: 427 Hz.",
