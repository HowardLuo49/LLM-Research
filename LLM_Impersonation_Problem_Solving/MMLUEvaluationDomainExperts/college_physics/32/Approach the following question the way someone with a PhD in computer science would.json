At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to solve this problem, we must first recognize that the frequency of resonance in a pipe is determined by the speed of sound in the air and the length of the pipe. The formula for calculating the frequency of resonance in a pipe open at both ends is:\n\nf = (v / (2L)) * n\n\nwhere:\nf = frequency of resonance\nv = speed of sound\nL = length of the pipe\nn = harmonic number\n\nGiven that the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C, we can calculate the new speed of sound as follows:\n\nv' = v * (1 - 0.03)\nv' = v * 0.97\n\nSubstitute the new speed of sound into the formula for frequency of resonance:\n\nf' = (v' / (2L)) * n\nf' = ((v * 0.97) / (2L)) * n\nf' = (0.97 * (v / (2L))) * n\nf' = 0.97 * f\n\nThis tells us that the new frequency of resonance on a particularly cold day is 97% of the original frequency. Therefore, the frequency on a particularly cold day would be:\n\nf' = 0.97 * 440 Hz\nf' = 426.8 Hz\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 427 Hz.",
