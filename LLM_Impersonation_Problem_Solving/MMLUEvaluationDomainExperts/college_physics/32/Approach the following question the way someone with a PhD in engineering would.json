At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the fundamental principles involved. The frequency at which a pipe resonates is dependent on the speed of sound within the pipe and the length of the pipe. In this case, the pipe is open at both ends, which means it resonates with a half-wavelength standing wave pattern.\n\nThe formula for the frequency of resonance in a pipe open at both ends is given by:\n\nf = (n * v) / (2 * L)\n\nWhere:\nf = frequency of resonance\nn = harmonic number (in this case, n=1)\nv = speed of sound\nL = length of the pipe\n\nGiven that the frequency of resonance at 20\u00b0C is 440 Hz, we can calculate the speed of sound at this temperature using the formula:\n\nv = 331.5 + 0.6 * T\n\nWhere:\nv = speed of sound in m/s\nT = temperature in \u00b0C\n\nPlugging in T = 20\u00b0C, we get:\n\nv = 331.5 + 0.6 * 20\nv = 331.5 + 12\nv = 343.5 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the speed of sound at the lower temperature. Since the speed of sound is 3 percent lower at this temperature, we can calculate it as follows:\n\nv' = 0.97 * v\nv' = 0.97 * 343.5\nv' = 333.195 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of resonance at this lower temperature:\n\nf' = (1 * 333.195) / (2 * L)\n\nSince the length of the pipe does not change, the new frequency of resonance at the lower temperature is 333.195 / (2 * L).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not given in the options provided.",
