At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in literature, it is essential to first recognize that acoustics is a field of study in physics and the relationship between temperature and the speed of sound is a fundamental concept in acoustics. As the temperature decreases, the speed of sound also decreases, which in turn affects the resonant frequency of a pipe open at both ends.\n\nGiven that the resonant frequency of the pipe at 20\u00b0C is 440 hertz, and the speed of sound on a particularly cold day is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C, we can calculate the new resonant frequency by using the formula:\n\nf' = f(v / v')\n\nWhere:\nf' = new resonant frequency\nf = original resonant frequency\nv = original speed of sound\nv' = speed of sound on a particularly cold day\n\nIn this case, v' is 3 percent lower than v, so v' = 0.97v\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nf' = 440 (v / 0.97v)\nf' = 440 / 0.97\nf' \u2248 453.61 Hz\n\nTherefore, the resonant frequency of the same pipe on a particularly cold day would be approximately 453.61 Hz. Since this value is not listed among the answer choices, we can choose the closest option, which is 433 Hz (option C).",
