At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the frequency at which the pipe resonates on a particularly cold day, we first need to consider the speed of sound. The speed of sound in a gas is directly proportional to the square root of the temperature of the gas. Therefore, if the temperature is 3 percent lower than 20\u00b0C, the speed of sound would also decrease by 3 percent.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the pipe at 20\u00b0C is 440 Hz, we can use the equation for the frequency of a pipe open at both ends:\n\nf = (nv)/(2L)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, n is the harmonic number (in this case, 1), v is the speed of sound in the gas, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nIf the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C is v, then the speed of sound on a particularly cold day would be 0.97v. Therefore, the new frequency (f') on a cold day would be:\n\nf' = (n(0.97v))/(2L)\n\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\n\n440 = ((0.97v)/(2L))\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv = (440 * 2L)/0.97\n\nTherefore, the frequency at which the same pipe resonates on a particularly cold day would be approximately 414 Hz.\n\nA: 414 Hz",
