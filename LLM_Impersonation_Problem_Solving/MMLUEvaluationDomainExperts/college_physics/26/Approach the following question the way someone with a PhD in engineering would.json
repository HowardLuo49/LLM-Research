An astronomer observes a very small moon orbiting a planet and measures the moon\u2019s minimum and maximum distances from the planet\u2019s center and the moon\u2019s maximum orbital speed. Which of the following CANNOT be calculated from these measurements?\nA: Mass of the moon\nB: Mass of the planet\nC: Minimum speed of the moon\nD: Period of the orbit",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD engineer, one could confidently state that all of the following values can be calculated from the given measurements except for the minimum speed of the moon. \n\nFrom the minimum and maximum distances of the moon from the planet's center and the maximum orbital speed, one can calculate the masses of both the moon and the planet using Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The period of the orbit can also be determined using the orbital speed and distance information. \n\nHowever, the minimum speed of the moon cannot be calculated directly from the provided measurements as it is dependent on a variety of factors including the shape of the orbit and the distribution of mass within the system. Additional information or assumptions would be needed to ascertain the minimum speed of the moon.",
