    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To analyze this problem with a literary lens, we must first understand the concept of work in the context of springs. Work is commonly defined as the force applied over a distance. In the case of springs, work is done when the spring is stretched by a certain distance against the restoring force of the spring.\n\nLet us denote the initial stretching distance of the first spring as x, and the force constant of the first spring as k. The work done in stretching the first spring is given by W = (1/2)kx\u00b2, where W is the work done, k is the force constant, and x is the stretching distance.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance of the first spring (i.e., x/2). Let's denote the force constant of the second spring as k\u2082. The work done in stretching the second spring is given by W\u2082 = (1/2)k\u2082(x/2)\u00b2.\n\nSince the work done to stretch the second spring is twice that of the first spring, we have:\n\n(1/2)k\u2082(x/2)\u00b2 = 2 * (1/2)kx\u00b2\n\nSolving this equation, we find:\n\n(1/2)k\u2082(x\u00b2/4) = kx\u00b2\nk\u2082x\u00b2/8 = kx\u00b2\nk\u2082 = 8k\n\nTherefore, the force constant of the second spring is 8k, which corresponds to option D.",
