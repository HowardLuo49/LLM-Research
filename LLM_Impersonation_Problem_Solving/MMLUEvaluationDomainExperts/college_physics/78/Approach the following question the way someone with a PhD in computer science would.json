    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in computer science, we first need to analyze the problem using the principles of physics and mathematical reasoning. Work, in the context of springs, is defined as the force applied multiplied by the displacement.\n\nLet's denote the force constant of the first spring as k and the displacement as x. The work done to stretch the first spring is therefore W1 = 0.5 * k * x^2.\n\nFor the second spring, we are told that it takes twice as much work to stretch it by half the distance. Let's denote the force constant of the second spring as k2 and the new displacement as x2 = x/2. The work done to stretch the second spring is W2 = 2 * 0.5 * k2 * (x/2)^2 = 0.25 * k2 * x^2.\n\nGiven that W2 = 2 * W1, we can write the equation as 0.25 * k2 * x^2 = 2 * 0.5 * k * x^2. By simplifying and solving for k2, we find that k2 = 4k.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 4k. This conclusion is reached through a rigorous mathematical analysis based on the fundamental principles of physics.",
