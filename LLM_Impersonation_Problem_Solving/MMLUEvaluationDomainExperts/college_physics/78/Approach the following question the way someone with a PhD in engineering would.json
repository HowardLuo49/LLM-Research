    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from an engineering perspective, we can apply the work-energy principle and Hooke's Law for springs.\n\nThe work done in stretching a spring by a distance x is given by the equation W = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the force constant of the spring.\n\nLet's denote the force constant of the first spring as k, and the distance it is stretched by as x. The work done to stretch the first spring is W1 = (1/2)kx^2.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance. Let's denote the force constant of the second spring as k2, and the distance it is stretched by as x/2. The work done to stretch the second spring is W2 = (1/2)k2(x/2)^2 = (1/8)k2x^2.\n\nTherefore, we have the equation W2 = 2W1, which can be written as (1/8)k2x^2 = 2*(1/2)kx^2.\n\nSolving for k2, we get k2 = 8k.\n\nTherefore, the force constant of the second spring is 8k, which corresponds to option D.",
