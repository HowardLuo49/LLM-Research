It takes twice as much work to stretch a second spring by half this distance. The force constant of the second spring is\nA: k\nB: 2k\nC: 4k\nD: 8k",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the force constant of the second spring, we can utilize the equation for the work done to stretch a spring, which is given by W = (1/2)kx^2, where W is the work done, k is the force constant of the spring, and x is the distance stretched.\n\nLet's denote the force constant of the second spring as k'. The work done to stretch the first spring a distance x is W1 = (1/2)kx^2. The work done to stretch the second spring by half this distance, which is x/2, is W2 = (1/2)k'(x/2)^2.\n\nGiven that it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring compared to the first spring, we can set up the following equation:\n\n2W1 = W2\n2[(1/2)kx^2] = (1/2)k'(x/2)^2\nkx^2 = (1/4)k'(x^2/4)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n4kx^2 = k'x^2\n4k = k'\nk' = 4k\n\nTherefore, the force constant of the second spring is 4k.
