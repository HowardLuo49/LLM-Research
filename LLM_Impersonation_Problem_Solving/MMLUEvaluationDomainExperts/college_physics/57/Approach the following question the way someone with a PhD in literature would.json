If the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area does which of the following?\nA: Decreases by a factor of 81.\nB: Decreases by a factor of 9.\nC: Increases by a factor of 9.\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",

    "gpt_response": "In order to answer this question, we must first understand the concept of blackbody radiation. Blackbody radiation is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a perfect absorber (a blackbody) at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nAccording to Stefan-Boltzmann law, the energy radiated per second per unit area (also known as the radiative flux or radiant emittance) from a blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n\nP = \u03c3T^4\n\nWhere:\n- P is the power radiated per unit area\n- \u03c3 (the Stefan-Boltzmann constant) is approximately equal to 5.67 x 10^-8 Wm^-2K^-4\n- T is the absolute temperature of the blackbody\n\nNow, if the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, we can calculate the change in energy radiated per second per unit area as follows:\n\nLet the initial temperature be T and the final temperature be 3T. Therefore, the initial radiative flux (P_initial) is:\nP_initial = \u03c3T^4\n\nThe final radiative flux (P_final) after the temperature increase is:\nP_final = \u03c3(3T)^4\nP_final = \u03c3(81T^4)\nP_final = 81\u03c3T^4\n\nTherefore, the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81.
