If the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area does which of the following?\nA: Decreases by a factor of 81.\nB: Decreases by a factor of 9.\nC: Increases by a factor of 9.\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",

    "gpt_response": "In addressing this question, we must first delve into the fundamental principles of blackbody radiation and its relationship with temperature. A blackbody, by definition, is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and emits radiation at all frequencies. The amount of radiation emitted per unit area per unit time, known as the energy radiated per second per unit area, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the energy radiated per second per unit area of a blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as E = \u03c3T^4, where E is the energy radiated per second per unit area, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nGiven this understanding, if the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area would increase by a factor of 3^4 = 81. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",
