    "gpt_response": "To approach this question like someone with a PhD in engineering, we must use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per second per unit area by a blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n\nE = \u03c3 * T^4\n\nWhere E is the energy radiated per second per unit area, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nIf the absolute temperature of the blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, then the new temperature, T', is equal to 3 times the original temperature, T. So:\n\nT' = 3T\n\nSubstitute T' = 3T into the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nE' = \u03c3 * (3T)^4\nE' = \u03c3 * 81T^4\n\nSince energy radiated per second per unit area is directly proportional to T^4, we can see that energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",
