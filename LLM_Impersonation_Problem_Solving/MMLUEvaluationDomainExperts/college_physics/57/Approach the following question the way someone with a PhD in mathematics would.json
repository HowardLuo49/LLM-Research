If the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area does which of the following?\nA: Decreases by a factor of 81.\nB: Decreases by a factor of 9.\nC: Increases by a factor of 9.\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",

    "gpt_response": "In order to determine how the energy radiated per second per unit area changes when the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, we can start by examining the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the total power radiated by a blackbody to its temperature:\n\nP = \u03c3AT^4\n\nwhere P is the total power radiated, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area of the blackbody, and T is the absolute temperature. \n\nIf the absolute temperature is increased by a factor of 3, the new temperature becomes 3T. Plugging this into the equation, we get:\n\nP_new = \u03c3A(3T)^4\nP_new = 81\u03c3AT^4\n\nTherefore, the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81, as the total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",
