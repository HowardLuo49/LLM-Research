The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question from a physics perspective. In this scenario, the elevator initially has potential energy due to its position at the top of the shaft. As the elevator falls, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. When the emergency brakes are engaged, this kinetic energy is dissipated as heat by the brakes in order to bring the elevator to a stop.\n\nTo calculate the amount of energy that the brakes must dissipate, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The initial potential energy of the elevator at the top of the shaft is given by the formula:\n\nPE = mgh\n\nWhere m is the mass of the elevator (1,000 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height the elevator falls (100 m). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nPE = 1,000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m\nPE = 980,000 J\n\nThis means that the elevator initially has 980,000 J of potential energy. When the elevator is stopped by the brakes, this energy is completely converted into heat. Therefore, the amount of heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is 980,000 J, which is closest to option D: 1,000,000 J.",
