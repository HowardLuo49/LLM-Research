The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first calculate the potential energy the elevator had before the cable snapped. The potential energy can be calculated using the formula PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the elevator (1,000 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h is the distance fallen (100 m).\n\nPE = (1,000 kg)(9.81 m/s^2)(100 m) = 981,000 J\n\nThis is the amount of potential energy that was converted into kinetic energy as the elevator fell. When the emergency brakes stop the elevator, this kinetic energy must be dissipated as heat. The heat generated is equal to the amount of kinetic energy the elevator had just before the brakes were engaged.\n\nThe formula for kinetic energy is KE = 0.5mv^2, where m is the mass of the elevator and v is its velocity. Since the elevator started from rest, its initial velocity is 0 m/s. Therefore, the kinetic energy just before the brakes were engaged is 0 J.\n\nThe brakes must dissipate the full amount of potential energy, 981,000 J, in order to bring the elevator safely to rest. Therefore, the correct answer is 981,000 J, which is not listed among the given options.",
