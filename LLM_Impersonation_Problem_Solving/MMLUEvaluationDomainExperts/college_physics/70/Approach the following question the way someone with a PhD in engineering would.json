The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, we can approach this problem by considering the energy of the falling elevator. \n\nThe potential energy of the elevator at the top of the shaft can be calculated using the formula P.E. = mgh, where m is the mass (1,000 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height (100 m). Therefore, P.E. = 1,000 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 100 m = 981,000 J.\n\nThis potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the elevator falls. Using the formula K.E. = 0.5mv^2, where v is the final velocity, we can calculate the final velocity of the elevator when it reaches the bottom of the shaft. Since the elevator comes to a stop, the final velocity is 0 m/s.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the elevator at the bottom of the shaft is therefore 0 J. This means that all the potential energy has been converted to heat by the brakes in order to bring the elevator safely to rest. Therefore, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is 981,000 J, which is option D: 1,000,000 J.",
