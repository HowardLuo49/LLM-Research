The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is evident that the question provided is rooted in principles of physics rather than literature. However, I will approach this question with the assumption that the individual posing this question is looking for a more nuanced and detailed response related to the context or literary references that can be drawn from it.\n\nIn literature, the concept of falling, particularly in the context of elevators, can be metaphorically linked to themes of descent, loss, or downfall. The sudden descent of the elevator due to the snapping of the suspension cable could symbolize a dramatic shift or reversal in fortune for the characters within a narrative. The subsequent act of the emergency brakes stopping the elevator before reaching the bottom could be seen as a moment of salvation or redemption, where disaster is averted at the last moment.\n\nNow, returning to the scientific aspect of the question, we must consider the energy that must be dissipated by the brakes to bring the elevator safely to rest. The potential energy lost by the elevator as it falls can be calculated using the formula PE = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the gravitational acceleration, and h is the height fallen. In this case, with a mass of 1,000 kg and a height fallen of 100 m, the potential energy lost would be 1,000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m = 980,000 J.\n\nThis potential energy would indeed need to be dissipated by the brakes in the form of heat to bring the elevator safely to rest. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 1,000,000 J.",
