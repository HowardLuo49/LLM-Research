A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To properly address this question, we must first consider the principle of interference in the context of the given scenario. When light reflects off the surface of the oil layer, it undergoes a phase change due to the different refractive indices of the oil and water. This phase change can lead to the phenomenon of interference, where certain wavelengths of light are reinforced (constructive interference) or canceled out (destructive interference).\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the most strongly reflected wavelength, which corresponds to a scenario of constructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when the path length difference between the two reflected rays is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength of light. The condition for constructive interference in the thin film interference is given by:\n\n2ntcos\u03b8 = m\u03bb\n\nWhere:\n- n is the refractive index of the oil layer\n- t is the thickness of the oil layer\n- \u03b8 is the angle of incidence\n- m is an integer representing the order of the interference (m = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n- \u03bb is the wavelength of light\n\nSince we are interested in the most strongly reflected wavelength, we should focus on the scenario where m = 0, as this corresponds to the first order of interference. By rearranging the equation and plugging in the given values (n = 1.5, t = 500 nm, and n = 1.33 for water), we can calculate the wavelength of light that satisfies the condition for constructive interference.\n\nThis calculation would yield the most strongly reflected wavelength, providing us with the correct answer out of the options given (A: 500 nm, B: 550 nm, C: 600 nm, D: 650 nm).",
