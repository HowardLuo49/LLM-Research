    "gpt_response": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to consider the interference of the reflected light from both interfaces (water-oil and oil-air). \n\nWhen white light is incident on the water-oil interface, a portion is reflected and the rest is transmitted into the oil layer. The transmitted light then encounters the oil-air interface where another portion is reflected and the rest is transmitted out. \n\nThe wavelengths of light that experience constructive interference will be strongly reflected. Constructive interference occurs when the path difference between the two reflected rays is an integer multiple of the wavelength. \n\nLet's calculate the phase shift at each interface and determine the most strongly reflected wavelength:\n\nFor the water-oil interface: \nPhase shift = 2\u03c0 * (index of refraction of oil) * (thickness of oil layer) / (wavelength)\n= 2\u03c0 * 1.5 * 500 nm / \u03bb\n\nFor the oil-air interface:\nPhase shift = 2\u03c0 * (index of refraction of oil) * (thickness of oil layer) / (wavelength)\n= 2\u03c0 * 1.5 * 500 nm / \u03bb\n\nFor strong reflection, the total phase shift should be n * \u03bb, where n is an integer. \nConsidering total phase shift = Phase shift (water-oil) + Phase shift (oil-air) = n * \u03bb, we solve for \u03bb:\n\n2\u03c0 * 1.5 * 500 nm / \u03bb + 2\u03c0 * 1.5 * 500 nm / \u03bb = n * \u03bb\n3 * 500 = n * \u03bb\n1500 = n * \u03bb\n\nBased on the options provided, the most strongly reflected wavelength should be 600 nm (Option C).",
