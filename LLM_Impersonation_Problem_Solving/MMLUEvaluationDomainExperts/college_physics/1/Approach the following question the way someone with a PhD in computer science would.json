A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",

When light travels from a medium with a lower index of refraction to a medium with a higher index of refraction, such as from water to oil in this case, a portion of the light is reflected at the boundary.\n\nThe reflection coefficient for light incident from air to a medium with a higher index of refraction is given by:\n\\( R = \\frac{(n_1 - n_2)^2}{(n_1 + n_2)^2} \\)\n\nWhere:\n\\( n_1 = 1 \\) (index of refraction of air)\n\\( n_2 = 1.5 \\) (index of refraction of oil)\n\nIn this case, the thickness of the oil layer is 500 nm, which corresponds to approximately half the wavelength of light.
