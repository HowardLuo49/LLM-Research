If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)\nA: 4.9 m\nB: 9.8 m\nC: 10.0 m\nD: 19.6 m",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the equations of motion for an object in free fall. Since the object is thrown horizontally, only the vertical motion needs to be considered. The equation that relates the initial vertical velocity, time, and height is:\n\nh = v0*t + (1/2)*gt^2\n\nWhere:\nh = height from which the object was thrown\nv0 = initial vertical velocity (0 m/s in this case)\nt = time of flight (2.0 s)\ng = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2)\n\nBy substituting the given values into the equation, we can solve for the height h:\n\nh = 0*2.0 + (1/2)*9.8*(2.0)^2\nh = 0 + 0.5*9.8*4.0\nh = 19.6 meters\n\nTherefore, the object was thrown from a height of 19.6 meters.
