If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)\nA: 4.9 m\nB: 9.8 m\nC: 10.0 m\nD: 19.6 m",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the equations of motion in two dimensions. Since the object is thrown horizontally, the initial vertical velocity is 0 m/s. We know that the time taken for the object to hit the ground is 2.0 s and the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nUsing the equation of motion in the vertical direction:\ny = v_0t + (1/2)at^2\n\nSubstitute the known values:\ny = 0(2.0) + (1/2)(9.8)(2.0)^2\ny = 0 + 9.8(2)\ny = 19.6 m\n\nTherefore, the object was thrown from a height of 19.6 meters. The closest answer choice is option D: 19.6 m.",
