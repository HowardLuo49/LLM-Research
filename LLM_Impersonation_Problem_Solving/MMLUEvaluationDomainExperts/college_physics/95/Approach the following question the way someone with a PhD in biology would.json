If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)\nA: 4.9 m\nB: 9.8 m\nC: 10.0 m\nD: 19.6 m",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a biologist, I would approach this question by utilizing the kinematic equations of motion to analyze the projectile motion of the object. Since the object is thrown horizontally, the initial vertical velocity is zero. \n\nThe equation we can use is y = v_0t + (1/2)at^2, where y is the vertical displacement, v_0 is the initial velocity in the y-direction (which is zero), a is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately -9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time taken for the object to hit the ground (2.0 s). \n\nSubstituting in the values, we get y = 0 + (1/2)(-9.8)(2)^2 = -19.6 m. Since the height cannot be negative, we take the magnitude of the answer which is 19.6 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 19.6 m.",
