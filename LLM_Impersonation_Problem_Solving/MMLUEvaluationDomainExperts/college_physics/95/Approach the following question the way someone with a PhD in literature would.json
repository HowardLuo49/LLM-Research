    "gpt_response": "In considering this question, a scholar with a PhD in literature would approach it from a theoretical and analytical perspective. They may draw upon their knowledge of physics and mathematical principles, such as the equations of motion, to analyze the trajectory of the thrown object.\n\nIn this scenario, the object is thrown horizontally, so its initial vertical velocity is zero. The only force acting on the object in the vertical direction is gravity, which causes the object to accelerate downwards at a rate of 9.8 m/s^2. Since the object takes 2.0 seconds to hit the ground, we can use the equation of motion for free fall: d = 0.5 * a * t^2, where d is the distance fallen, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time of fall.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: d = 0.5 * 9.8 * (2.0)^2 = 19.6 m.\n\nTherefore, the object was thrown from a height of 19.6 meters. The correct answer is D: 19.6 m.",
