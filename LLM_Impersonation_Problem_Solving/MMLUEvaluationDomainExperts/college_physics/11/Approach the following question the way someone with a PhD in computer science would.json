The coefficient of static friction between a small coin and the surface of a turntable is 0.30. The turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute. What is the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide?\nA: 0.024 m\nB: 0.048 m\nC: 0.121 m\nD: 0.242 m",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide, we need to consider the centripetal force required to keep the coin in place. The centripetal force is given by the equation F = m * r * \u03c9^2, where m is the mass of the coin, r is the distance from the center of the turntable, and \u03c9 is the angular velocity of the turntable in radians per second.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angular velocity from revolutions per minute to radians per second:\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0 * (33.3 rev/min) / (60 s/min) = 3.49 rad/s\n\nNext, we need to determine the centripetal force required to keep the coin in place:\nF = m * r * \u03c9^2\n\nThe maximum static friction force that the surface can exert on the coin without causing it to slide is given by:\nFs \u2264 \u03bcs * N\nwhere N is the normal force acting on the coin. In this case, the normal force is equal to the weight of the coin:\nN = m * g\n\nSetting the centripetal force equal to the maximum static friction force gives us:\nm * r * \u03c9^2 = \u03bcs * m * g\n\nWe can now solve for r:\nr = \u03bcs * g / \u03c9^2\n\nSubstitute the given values:\nr = (0.30) * (9.8 m/s^2) / (3.49 rad/s)^2 = 0.121 m\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is 0.121 m. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 0.121 m.",
