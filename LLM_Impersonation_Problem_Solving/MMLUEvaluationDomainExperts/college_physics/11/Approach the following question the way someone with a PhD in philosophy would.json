The turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute. What is the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide?\nA: 0.024 m\nB: 0.048 m\nC: 0.121 m\nD: 0.242 m",

    "gpt_response": "In considering the dynamics of the small coin placed on the surface of the rotating turntable, one must first understand the fundamental principles governing the interaction between the coin and the surface. The coefficient of static friction, denoted as \u03bcs, is a crucial factor in determining the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide. In this case, the given coefficient of static friction is 0.30.\n\nThe force of static friction, denoted as fs, is responsible for preventing the coin from sliding on the turntable. The maximum force of static friction that can be exerted on the coin without causing it to slide can be calculated using the formula:\n\nfs = \u03bcs * N\n\nwhere N is the normal force acting on the coin. Since there is no vertical acceleration, the net force in the radial direction must be equal to the centripetal force required to keep the coin in circular motion. This is given by:\n\nfv = mv^2 / r\n\nwhere m is the mass of the coin, v is the linear speed of the turntable in m/s (converted from the given 33.3 rpm), and r is the radial distance from the center of the turntable.\n\nSetting the force of static friction equal to the centripetal force gives:\n\n\u03bcs * N = m * v^2 / r\n\nSolving for r in terms of the given quantities yields:\n\nr = m * v^2 / (\u03bcs * N)\n\nPlugging in the values of \u03bcs = 0.30, v = (33.3 rev/min) * (2\u03c0 rad/rev) * (1 min / 60 s) = 3.49 m/s, and N = mg where g is the acceleration due to gravity, we can calculate the maximum distance as follows:\n\nr = (m * (3.49^2)) / (0.30 * mg)\n\nSimplifying, r = 0.024 m\n\nThus, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is 0.024 m. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 0.024 m.",
