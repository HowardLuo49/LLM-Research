    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide, we must consider the centripetal force required to keep the coin in circular motion. \n\nThe centripetal force is provided by the frictional force between the coin and the turntable surface. The maximum frictional force is given by:\n\nf_friction = \u03bc_s * N\n\nwhere \u03bc_s is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force acting on the coin. The normal force is equal to the weight of the coin:\n\nN = m * g\n\nwhere m is the mass of the coin and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe centripetal force required to keep the coin in circular motion is:\n\nf_centripetal = m * a\n\nwhere a is the centripetal acceleration. Given that the coin is rotating at 33.3 revolutions per minute, the angular velocity is:\n\n\u03c9 = 33.3 rev/min * 2\u03c0 rad/rev * 1 min/60 s = 11 \u03c0 rad/s\n\nThe centripetal acceleration is:\n\na = \u03c9^2 * r\n\nwhere r is the distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide. Setting the maximum frictional force equal to the centripetal force gives:\n\n\u03bc_s * m * g = m * \u03c9^2 * r\n\nSolving for r gives:\n\nr = \u03bc_s * g / \u03c9^2\n\nPlugging in the values for \u03bc_s=0.30, g=9.81 m/s^2, and \u03c9=11 \u03c0 rad/s gives:\n\nr \u2248 0.024 m\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is approximately 0.024 m. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 0.024 m.",
