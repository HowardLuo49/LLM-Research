    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide, we need to consider the centrifugal force acting on the coin. The maximum distance occurs when the centrifugal force equals the maximum static friction force that can be exerted by the surface.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the angular velocity of the turntable:\nAngular velocity (\u03c9) = 2\u03c0 x revolutions per minute / 60\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0 x 33.3 / 60\n\u03c9 = 3.49 rad/s\n\nThe centrifugal force (Fc) acting on the coin can be calculated as:\nFc = m x r x \u03c9^2\nWhere m is the mass of the coin, r is the distance from the center of the turntable to the coin, and \u03c9 is the angular velocity.\n\nThe maximum static friction force (Fs) can be calculated as:\nFs = \u03bcs x N\nWhere \u03bcs is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force acting on the coin.\n\nSince the coin is not moving outward, the centrifugal force is balanced by the static friction force, so:\nm x r x \u03c9^2 = \u03bcs x N\n\nThe normal force (N) can be related to the weight of the coin (mg) and the centripetal force (m x r x \u03c9^2):\nN = mg + m x r x \u03c9^2\n\nSubstitute N into the equation:\nm x r x \u03c9^2 = \u03bcs x (mg + m x r x \u03c9^2)\nr = (\u03bcs x g) / (\u03c9^2 - \u03bcs x g)\n\nGiven \u03bcs = 0.30, g = 9.81 m/s^2, and \u03c9 = 3.49 rad/s:\nr = (0.30 x 9.81) / (3.49^2 - 0.30 x 9.81)\nr = 0.024 m\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is approximately 0.024 m.\nA: 0.024 m",
