    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide, we need to consider the centripetal acceleration required to keep the coin in circular motion at the given angular velocity of 33.3 revolutions per minute.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angular velocity from revolutions per minute to radians per second:\n33.3 revolutions/minute * 2\u03c0 radians/1 revolution * 1 minute/60 seconds = 3.49 radians/second\n\nNext, we can calculate the centripetal acceleration required to keep the coin in circular motion using the formula:\na = r\u03c9^2 \nwhere a is the centripetal acceleration, r is the radius, and \u03c9 is the angular velocity.\n\nGiven that the coefficient of static friction between the coin and the turntable surface is 0.30, we know that the maximum static frictional force that can act on the coin is \u03bcN, where N is the normal force acting on the coin.\n\nThe normal force N is equal to the gravitational force acting on the coin, which is given by N = mg, where m is the mass of the coin and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAt the maximum distance from the center of the turntable where the coin will not slide, the frictional force will be equal to the centripetal force required to keep the coin in circular motion:\n\u03bcN = mr\u03c9^2\n0.30mg = mr(3.49)^2\n0.30g = r(12.1801)\nr = 0.0242 m\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is 0.024 m, which corresponds to option A.",
