    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the concept of length contraction in special relativity. According to the theory of special relativity, objects moving at relativistic speeds will appear contracted in the direction of motion when observed by a stationary observer.\n\nThe Lorentz contraction formula can be used to calculate the length of an object as measured by a moving observer. This formula is given by:\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L' is the contracted length as measured by the moving observer, L is the rest length of the object, v is the velocity of the observer, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the rest length of the rod is 1.00 m and the measured length is 0.80 m. We can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n0.80 = 1.00 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSolving for v, we find:\n\n0.64 = 1 - v^2/c^2\nv^2/c^2 = 0.36\nv = 0.6c\n\nTherefore, the observer must move at a speed of 0.6c (choice B) parallel to the rod in order to measure its length to be 0.80 m.",
