    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As an observer moves parallel to the rod, length contraction occurs due to the effects of special relativity. The Lorentz contraction formula describes this phenomenon, stating that the length L' of the rod as measured by a moving observer is related to its length L in the rest frame by:\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the observer and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the length L' is measured to be 0.80 m while the rest length L is 1.00 m. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n0.80 = 1.00 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSolving for v/c:\n\n0.80 = sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n0.64 = 1 - v^2/c^2\nv^2/c^2 = 0.36\nv = 0.6c\n\nTherefore, the observer must move parallel to the rod at a speed of 0.60c in order to measure its length to be 0.80 m.
