    "gpt_response": "To properly address this question, we must first understand the concept of relativistic momentum in the context of special relativity. In special relativity, the relativistic momentum of a particle is given by the expression p = \u03b3mv, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and v is its velocity. \n\nGiven that the total energy of the particle is equal to twice its rest energy, we can write this relationship mathematically as E = 2mc^2, where E represents the total energy of the particle, m represents its rest mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nThe total energy of the particle can be expressed in terms of its relativistic energy as E = \u221a(p^2c^2 + (mc^2)^2), where p is the magnitude of its relativistic momentum. Substituting this expression into E = 2mc^2, we obtain:\n\n\u221a(p^2c^2 + (mc^2)^2) = 2mc^2\n\nSquaring both sides of this equation and rearranging terms, we find:\n\np^2 = (2m^2c^4) - (m^2c^4)\np^2 = m^2c^4\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\np = mc^2\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the particle's relativistic momentum is equal to mc.
