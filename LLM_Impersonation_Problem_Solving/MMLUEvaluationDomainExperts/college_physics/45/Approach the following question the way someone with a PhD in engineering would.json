A heat pump is to extract heat from an outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heat the environment indoors to 27\u00b0C. For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately\nA: 500 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 1,100 J\nD: 2,000 J",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of thermodynamics and specifically the concept of Coefficient of Performance (COP) for a heat pump. The COP is defined as the ratio of the heat delivered to the desired heat input, which in this case is the work supplied to the heat pump.\n\nThe COP for a heat pump is given by the following equation:\nCOP = Qh / W\n\nWhere Qh is the heat delivered indoors and W is the work supplied to the heat pump.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for W:\nW = Qh / COP\n\nGiven that the heat delivered indoors is 15,000 J and we want to find the smallest amount of work supplied to the heat pump, we need to determine the COP of the heat pump.\n\nThe heat pump is extracting heat from an outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heating the indoor environment to 27\u00b0C. The efficiency of a heat pump is determined by the temperature difference between the two environments. The Carnot efficiency for a heat pump can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCOP = 1 / (1 - (Tc/Th))\n\nWhere Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir (outdoor environment) and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir (indoor environment). Converting the temperatures to Kelvin scale, we get:\nTc = 7 + 273 = 280 K\nTh = 27 + 273 = 300 K\n\nPlugging these values into the equation, we find the COP of the heat pump:\nCOP = 1 / (1 - (280/300))\nCOP = 1 / (1 - 0.9333)\nCOP = 1 / 0.0667\nCOP = 15\n\nNow, we can use this COP value to calculate the smallest amount of work supplied to the heat pump:\nW = 15,000 J / 15\nW = 1,000 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1,000 J.",
