A heat pump is to extract heat from an outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heat the environment indoors to 27\u00b0C. For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately\nA: 500 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 1,100 J\nD: 2,000 J",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of coefficient of performance (COP) for heat pumps. \n\nThe COP of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of heat delivered indoors to the work supplied to the system. In this case, we are given that for every 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, a certain amount of work must be supplied to the heat pump.\n\nWe can calculate the COP of the heat pump using the formula:\nCOP = Q_in / W_in\nwhere Q_in is the heat delivered indoors and W_in is the work supplied to the heat pump.\n\nGiven that Q_in is 15,000 J, and we want to find the smallest amount of W_in necessary, we can rearrange the formula to solve for W_in:\nW_in = Q_in / COP\n\nTo determine the COP, we need to consider the temperatures provided. The efficiency of a heat pump is affected by the temperature difference between the source (outdoor temperature) and the sink (indoor temperature).\n\nThe maximum theoretical COP for a heat pump working between two reservoirs at temperatures T_h (source) and T_c (sink) is given by:\nCOP_max = T_h / (T_h - T_c)\n\nIn this case, T_h = 27\u00b0C and T_c = 7\u00b0C. Plugging the values into the formula gives:\nCOP_max = 27 / (27 - 7)\nCOP_max = 27 / 20\nCOP_max = 1.35\n\nTherefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is:\nW_in = 15,000 J / COP_max\nW_in = 15,000 J / 1.35\nW_in \u2248 11,111 J\n\nSo, the closest option is:\nC: 1,100 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1,100 J.",
