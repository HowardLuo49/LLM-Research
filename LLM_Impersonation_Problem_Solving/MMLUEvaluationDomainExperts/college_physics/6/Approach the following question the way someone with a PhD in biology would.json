The first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery. The other two capacitors, initially uncharged and connected in series, are then connected across the first capacitor. What is the final voltage on the first capacitor?\nA: V_0/5\nB: V_0/3\nC: V_0/2\nD: 2V_0/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The final voltage on the first capacitor is V_0/3.\n\nIn this scenario, the capacitors are connected in series, which means that the charge Q will be the same across all three capacitors. The total capacitance of the series capacitors is given by 1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3, where C_total = C1/3. \n\nFrom the conservation of charge, Q = CV, where V is the final voltage on the first capacitor. By rearranging this equation, we can solve for V:\n\nQ = C1V_0 = C_total * V\nV = (C1/C_total) * V_0\nV = (3C1/C1) * V_0 = 3V_0 / 3 = V_0 / 3\n\nTherefore, the final voltage on the first capacitor is V_0 / 3.",
