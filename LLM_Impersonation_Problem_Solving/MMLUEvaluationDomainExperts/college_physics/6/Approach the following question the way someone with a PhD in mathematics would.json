The first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery. The other two capacitors, initially uncharged and connected in series, are then connected across the first capacitor. What is the final voltage on the first capacitor?\nA: V_0/5\nB: V_0/3\nC: V_0/2\nD: 2V_0/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can use the concept of charge conservation. Initially, the first capacitor is charged to a voltage V_0. Let q_0 be the charge on the first capacitor.\n\nThen, when the two uncharged capacitors are connected in series across the first capacitor, the charge distribution would be such that each of the three capacitors has the same final charge q_f. Let V be the final voltage on the first capacitor.\n\nUsing the formula relating charge, capacitance, and voltage for a capacitor (q = CV), we can write the charge on each capacitor as follows:\n\nq_0 = C * V_0\nq_f = 3C * V\n\nSince charge is conserved, we can write:\n\nq_0 = q_f\nC * V_0 = 3C * V\nV = V_0 / 3\n\nTherefore, the final voltage on the first capacitor is V_0 / 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: V_0/3.",
