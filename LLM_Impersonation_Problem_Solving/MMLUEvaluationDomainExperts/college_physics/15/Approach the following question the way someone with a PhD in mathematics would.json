    "gpt_response": "The correct statement is D: Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics governing the behavior of fermions, which are particles with half-integer spin. The antisymmetry of the wave function ensures that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state, which is the essence of the Pauli exclusion principle. Bosons, on the other hand, have symmetric wave functions and can occupy the same quantum state, leading to phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation.",
