However, based on my understanding of the principles involved, I can confidently assert that statement D is true. Fermions indeed have antisymmetric wave functions, as dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle. This fundamental property of fermions is central to our comprehension of quantum mechanics and the behavior of particles at the subatomic level.",
