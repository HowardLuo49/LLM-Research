    "gpt_response": "The correct statement is D: Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics where fermions, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, have wave functions that switch sign when particles are exchanged. This antisymmetric property results in the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Bosons, on the other hand, have symmetric wave functions and do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.",
