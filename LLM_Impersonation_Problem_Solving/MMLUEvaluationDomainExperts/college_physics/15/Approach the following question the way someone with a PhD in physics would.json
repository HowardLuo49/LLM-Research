This is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics known as the spin-statistics theorem. Fermions, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, have half-integer spin and exhibit antisymmetric wave functions under exchange of particles, leading to the Pauli exclusion principle which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.",
