The mean kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in metals is ordinarily much higher than kT because\nA: electrons have many more degrees of freedom than atoms do\nB: the electrons and the lattice are not in thermal equilibrium\nC: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas\nD: electrons in metals are highly relativistic",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The mean kinetic energy of conduction electrons in metals is typically much higher than kT due to the fact that the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas. In a degenerate Fermi gas, the Pauli exclusion principle results in the filling of available energy levels up to the Fermi energy, leading to a high average kinetic energy for the electrons. This is in contrast to a classical gas where particles can occupy any energy level, resulting in a lower average kinetic energy. Therefore, option C is the correct explanation for why the mean kinetic energy of conduction electrons in metals is usually much higher than kT.",
