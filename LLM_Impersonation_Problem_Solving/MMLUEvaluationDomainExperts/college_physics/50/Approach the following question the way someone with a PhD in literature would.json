A grating spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm, respectively.

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the definition of resolving power in the context of a grating spectrometer. Resolving power is a measure of the ability of a spectrometer to distinguish between two closely spaced wavelengths. It is commonly defined as the ratio of the wavelength of light being measured to the smallest difference in wavelength that the spectrometer can resolve.\n\nIn this case, the spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm. Therefore, the smallest difference in wavelength that it can resolve is 2 nm. \n\nTo find the resolving power of the spectrometer, we calculate the ratio of the measured wavelength (500 nm) to the smallest difference in wavelength that can be resolved (2 nm):\n\nResolving power = 500 nm / 2 nm = 250\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 250.",
