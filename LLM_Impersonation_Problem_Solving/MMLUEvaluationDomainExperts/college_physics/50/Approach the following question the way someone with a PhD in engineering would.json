A grating spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm, respectively. Which of the following gives the resolving power of the spectrometer?\nA: 2\nB: 250\nC: 5,000\nD: 10,000",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The resolving power of a spectrometer is defined as the ratio of the central wavelength to the minimum wavelength difference that can be resolved. In this case, the central wavelength is (500 nm + 502 nm) / 2 = 501 nm. The minimum wavelength difference that can be resolved is 502 nm - 500 nm = 2 nm. \n\nTherefore, the resolving power can be calculated as:\n\nResolving Power = Central Wavelength / Minimum Wavelength Difference\n= 501 nm / 2 nm\n= 250\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B: 250.",
