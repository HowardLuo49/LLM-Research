    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to consider the conservation of energy and the partitioning of the total kinetic energy between translational and rotational components.\n\nWhen a solid disk rolls down an inclined plane without slipping, both translational and rotational kinetic energy are present. The total kinetic energy of the disk can be given by the sum of these two components:\n\nK_total = K_translational + K_rotational\n\nSince the disk is rolling without slipping, we have the relationship between linear velocity v and angular velocity \u03c9:\n\nv = r * \u03c9\n\nwhere r is the radius of the disk. The kinetic energy in terms of linear velocity and angular velocity can be written as:\n\nK_translational = (1/2) * m * v^2\nK_rotational = (1/2) * I * \u03c9^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the disk and I is the moment of inertia about the center of mass. We can also write the total kinetic energy in terms of the linear velocity and angular velocity as:\n\nK_total = (1/2) * m * v^2 + (1/2) * I * \u03c9^2\n\nGiven that the disk starts from rest, the initial kinetic energy is purely rotational and therefore the initial total kinetic energy is just rotational kinetic energy:\n\nK_initial = (1/2) * I * \u03c9_initial^2\n\nAs the disk rolls down the inclined plane, some of the initial rotational kinetic energy is converted into translational kinetic energy. Therefore, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy at any given time can be expressed as:\n\nFraction_rotational = K_rotational / K_total\n\nSubstituting the expressions for K_translational and K_rotational and simplifying, we have:\n\nFraction_rotational = (1/2) * I * \u03c9^2 / [(1/2) * m * v^2 + (1/2) * I * \u03c9^2]\n\nGiven that the disk is solid and has a moment of inertia I = (1/2) * m * r^2, we can simplify the expression further:\n\nFraction_rotational = (1/2) * (1/2) * m * r^2 * \u03c9^2 / [(1/2) * m * v^2 + (1/2) * (1/2) * m * r^2 * \u03c9^2]\n\nFraction_rotational = (1/4) * r^2 * \u03c9^2 / (v^2 + (1/2) * r^2 * \u03c9^2)\n\nUsing the relationship v = r * \u03c9, we can simplify the expression further:\n\nFraction_rotational = (1/4) / (1 + (1/2)) = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: 1/3",
