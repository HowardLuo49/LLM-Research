    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy, we must first understand the concept of energy for a rolling object. \n\nWhen a solid disk rolls down an inclined plane without slipping, the total kinetic energy can be divided into translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy. The translational kinetic energy is given by 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the disk and v is the velocity of the center of mass. The rotational kinetic energy is given by 1/2 * I * \u03c9^2, where I is the moment of inertia of the disk and \u03c9 is the angular velocity.\n\nAs the disk rolls down the inclined plane, both the translational and rotational kinetic energies will increase. However, since the disk is rolling without slipping, the relationship between the linear velocity and angular velocity is v = r * \u03c9, where r is the radius of the disk.\n\nAt the bottom of the incline, when the disk reaches its maximum speed, the total kinetic energy will be entirely translational kinetic energy because the disk is no longer rotating. Therefore, the rotational kinetic energy fraction at the starting point, when the disk is at rest, would be 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1/4.",
