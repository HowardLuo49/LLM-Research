After some time, what fraction of the disk\u2019s total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy?\nA: 1/4\nB: 1/3\nC: 1/2\nD: 2/3",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy, we need to first calculate the total kinetic energy and then determine the fraction that is due to rotational kinetic energy.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the disk can be calculated as the sum of the translational kinetic energy and the rotational kinetic energy. The translational kinetic energy of the disk is given by 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the disk and v is its linear velocity.\n\nThe rotational kinetic energy of the disk can be calculated as 1/2 * I * \u03c9^2, where I is the moment of inertia of the disk and \u03c9 is its angular velocity. For a solid disk rolling without slipping, the moment of inertia is given by 1/2 * m * r^2, where r is the radius of the disk.\n\nSince the disk is rolling without slipping, the linear velocity and angular velocity are related by v = r * \u03c9.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the total kinetic energy equation, we get:\n\nTotal KE = 1/2 * m * v^2 + 1/2 * I * \u03c9^2\nTotal KE = 1/2 * m * v^2 + 1/2 * (1/2 * m * r^2) * (v/r)^2\nTotal KE = 1/2 * m * v^2 + 1/4 * m * v^2\nTotal KE = 3/4 * m * v^2\n\nTherefore, the rotational kinetic energy is 1/4 * m * v^2, which is 1/4 of the total kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 1/4.",
