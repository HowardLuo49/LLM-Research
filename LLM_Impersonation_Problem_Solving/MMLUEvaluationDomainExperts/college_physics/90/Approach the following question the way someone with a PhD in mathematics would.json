    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we first need to understand the concept of rotational kinetic energy and total kinetic energy for a rolling object. \n\nThe total kinetic energy of the disk can be divided into translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy. The translational kinetic energy is given by 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its linear velocity.
