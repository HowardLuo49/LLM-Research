    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the new rate of energy dissipation when the voltage across the resistor is doubled, we can use the formula for power dissipation in a resistor. Power (P) is equal to the square of the voltage (V) divided by the resistance (R). Mathematically, this can be expressed as P = V^2/R.\n\nGiven that the initial power dissipation is 1 W, and the voltage across the resistor is doubled, the new voltage will be 2V. Substituting this into the power formula, we get:\n\nP = (2V)^2 / R\nP = 4V^2 / R\n\nSince power is directly proportional to the square of voltage, when the voltage is doubled, the power will increase by a factor of 4. Therefore, the new rate of energy dissipation will be 4 W.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 4 W.",
