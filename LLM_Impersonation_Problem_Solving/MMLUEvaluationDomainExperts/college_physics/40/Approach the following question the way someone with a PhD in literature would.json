    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a doctorate in literature, I must confess that my knowledge in the field of electrical engineering is limited. However, I can provide an informed analysis based on the principles of mathematics and physics.\n\nThe power dissipated by a resistor in a circuit can be calculated using the formula P = V^2 / R, where P is the power, V is the voltage across the resistor, and R is the resistance of the resistor.\n\nGiven that the initial power dissipation is 1W, if the voltage across the resistor is doubled, the new voltage, let's call it V', would be 2V. Therefore, the new rate of energy dissipation can be calculated as follows:\nP' = (2V)^2 / R = 4V^2 / R\n\nSince the resistance of the resistor remains constant, the new rate of energy dissipation would increase proportionally to the square of the voltage. Therefore, the new rate of energy dissipation would be 4 times the initial rate, resulting in 4W. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 4W.",
