    "gpt_response": "To determine the new rate of energy dissipation when the voltage across the resistor is doubled, we can use the formula for power dissipation in a resistor, P = V^2/R, where P is power, V is voltage, and R is resistance.\n\nGiven that the original power dissipation is 1 W, we can plug this value into the formula: 1 = V^2/R.\n\nWhen the voltage is doubled, the new voltage V' = 2V. We can rewrite the formula with this new voltage: P' = (2V)^2/R.\n\nSince power is directly proportional to the square of the voltage, the new power dissipation will be 4 times the original power. Therefore, the new rate of energy dissipation will be 4 W.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 4 W.",
