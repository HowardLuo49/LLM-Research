    "gpt_response": "Given that power dissipation in a resistor is given by the formula P = V^2 / R, where P is power, V is voltage, and R is resistance. If the resistor is dissipating energy at a rate of 1 W, it means that P = 1 W, and R is constant. \n\nWhen the voltage across the resistor is doubled, the new voltage V' = 2V. Therefore, the new power dissipation P' can be calculated as:\n\nP' = (2V)^2 / R = 4V^2 / R\n\nSince P = V^2 / R = 1 W, we can substitute this into the equation for power dissipation with the new voltage:\n\nP' = 4(1 W) = 4 W\n\nTherefore, the new rate of energy dissipation would be 4 W. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 4 W.",
