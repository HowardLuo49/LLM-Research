Two students perform an experiment in which they drop a ball from rest from a known height above the ground and measure the speed of the ball just before it strikes the ground. From repeated measurement, the students estimate the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball to be 10 percent. Which of the following gives the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball? (Assume the uncertainty in the ball\u2019s mass is negligibly small.)\nA: 5%\nB: 10%\nC: 15%\nD: 20%",

    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this problem by first understanding the relationship between speed and kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of an object is given by the equation KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its speed.\n\nIn this case, the uncertainty in the speed of the ball is given as 10 percent. To find the uncertainty in the kinetic energy, we can use the formula for propagating uncertainties:\n\n\u03b4(KE) = \u221a((\u2202KE/\u2202v * \u03b4v)^2)\n\nWhere \u03b4(KE) is the uncertainty in the kinetic energy, \u2202KE/\u2202v is the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to speed, and \u03b4v is the uncertainty in the speed (10 percent of the measured speed).\n\nTaking the derivative of the kinetic energy equation gives:\n\n\u2202KE/\u2202v = 2 * (1/2) * m * v = m * v\n\nSubstituting in the values, we get:\n\n\u03b4(KE) = \u221a((m * v * 0.1)^2)\n\nSince the uncertainty in the ball's mass is negligibly small, we can ignore the mass term in the uncertainty calculation.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is 10%, which corresponds to option B.",
