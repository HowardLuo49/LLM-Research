Two students perform an experiment in which they drop a ball from rest from a known height above the ground and measure the speed of the ball just before it strikes the ground. From repeated measurement, the students estimate the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball to be 10 percent. Which of the following gives the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball? (Assume the uncertainty in the ball\u2019s mass is negligibly small.)\nA: 5%\nB: 10%\nC: 15%\nD: 20%",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must delve into the philosophical underpinnings of experimental uncertainty and its propagation to derived quantities such as kinetic energy. Firstly, the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball, as reported by the students, is 10 percent. This uncertainty arises from various sources such as experimental error, instrument limitations, and inherent variability in the system being studied.\n\nWhen considering the uncertainty in kinetic energy, we must recognize that kinetic energy is a derived quantity that depends on the square of the speed of the ball. As a result, the uncertainty in kinetic energy is not simply equal to the uncertainty in speed, but rather it is influenced by the relationship between speed and kinetic energy.\n\nIn this case, since kinetic energy is proportional to the square of speed (KE = 0.5 * m * v^2), the uncertainty in kinetic energy can be calculated by propagating the uncertainty in speed through the equation for kinetic energy. This process involves taking the derivative of the equation for kinetic energy with respect to speed and multiplying by the uncertainty in speed. \n\nAfter performing this calculation, it can be determined that the uncertainty in kinetic energy is 20%. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option D: 20%. This result highlights the complex nature of uncertainty propagation in physical measurements and emphasizes the need for careful consideration of uncertainties in experimental data analysis.",
