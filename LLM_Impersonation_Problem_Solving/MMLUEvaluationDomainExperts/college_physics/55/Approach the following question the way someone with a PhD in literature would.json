Two students perform an experiment in which they drop a ball from rest from a known height above the ground and measure the speed of the ball just before it strikes the ground. From repeated measurement, the students estimate the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball to be 10 percent. Which of the following gives the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball? (Assume the uncertainty in the ball\u2019s mass is negligibly small.)\nA: 5%\nB: 10%\nC: 15%\nD: 20%",

    "gpt_response": "To address this question from a literary perspective, we must first understand the key concepts at play. The uncertainty in measurement, specifically in the speed of the falling ball, informs us about the potential range within which the true value of the speed lies. This uncertainty is given as 10 percent. \n\nNow, to determine the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball, we must consider that kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of the speed of the object. Therefore, any uncertainty in the speed will translate to a greater uncertainty in the kinetic energy.\n\nGiven that the uncertainty in the speed of the ball is 10 percent, we can deduce that the uncertainty in the kinetic energy will be greater than this value. As the kinetic energy is dependent on the square of the speed, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy will be calculated as follows:\n\nUncertainty in Kinetic Energy = 2 * (Uncertainty in Speed) = 2 * 10% = 20%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 20%.",
