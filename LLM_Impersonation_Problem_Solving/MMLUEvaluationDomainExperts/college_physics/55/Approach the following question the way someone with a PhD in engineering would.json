Two students perform an experiment in which they drop a ball from rest from a known height above the ground and measure the speed of the ball just before it strikes the ground. From repeated measurement, the students estimate the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball to be 10 percent. Which of the following gives the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball? (Assume the uncertainty in the ball\u2019s mass is negligibly small.)\nA: 5%\nB: 10%\nC: 15%\nD: 20%",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first recognizing that the kinetic energy of an object is given by the equation KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity. Since the uncertainty in the mass of the ball is negligibly small, we can assume that the only source of uncertainty in the kinetic energy comes from the velocity.\n\nGiven that the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball is 10 percent, we can consider this as the percentage uncertainty in the velocity of the ball. Using the equation for kinetic energy, we see that the uncertainty in the kinetic energy will be twice the uncertainty in the velocity, due to the squared term.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball will be 2 * 10% = 20%. Hence, the correct answer is D: 20%.",
