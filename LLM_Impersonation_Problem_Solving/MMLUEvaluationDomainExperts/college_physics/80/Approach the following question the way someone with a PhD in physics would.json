The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine at what wavelength a body at a surface temperature of 300 K would reach its maximum thermal spectrum, we can use Wien's displacement law. \n\nWien's displacement law states that the wavelength of the peak emission of a blackbody spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. Mathematically, this relationship is given by:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T,\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength at which the spectrum reaches its maximum, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.897 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature of the body.\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.897 x 10^-3 m*K) / 300 K \u2248 9.66 x 10^-6 m.\n\nConverting this to nanometers (nm), we get:\n\n\u03bb_max \u2248 9.66 nm.\n\nTherefore, the thermal spectrum of a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K would reach a maximum near 9.66 nm. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed, as it should be 9.66 nm.",
