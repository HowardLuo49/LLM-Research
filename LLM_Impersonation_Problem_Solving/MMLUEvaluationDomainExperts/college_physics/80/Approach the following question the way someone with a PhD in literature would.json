The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with expertise in literature, I would approach this question with an understanding of the principles of blackbody radiation and thermal spectra. Blackbody radiation is a concept in physics that describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a hypothetical perfect absorber and emitter of radiation at all wavelengths. The peak of the blackbody spectrum is determined by the temperature of the emitting body, with higher temperatures producing shorter-wavelength peaks.\n\nIn the case of the Sun, with a surface temperature of 6,000 K, the blackbody spectrum peaks near 500 nm, in the visible spectrum. This is a result of the high temperature of the Sun's surface, which produces electromagnetic radiation with shorter wavelengths.\n\nFor a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, the thermal spectrum would peak at a longer wavelength compared to the Sun. The peak wavelength of the blackbody spectrum is inversely proportional to temperature, according to Wien's displacement law. As temperature decreases, the peak wavelength of the blackbody spectrum shifts towards longer wavelengths.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is most likely option D: 100 mm, as a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K would emit thermal radiation with a peak wavelength in the infrared spectrum, which typically ranges from a few micrometers to millimeters.",
