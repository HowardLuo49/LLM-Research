The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can apply Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength at which a blackbody spectrum reaches its peak intensity is inversely proportional to the temperature of the body. Mathematically, the relationship is given by:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = constant\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature of the body, and the constant is approximately 2.898 x 10^6 nm*K.\n\nGiven that the surface temperature of the body is close to 300 K, and we know that the Sun's peak wavelength is around 500 nm, we can plug in these values to solve for the peak wavelength of the body:\n\n\u03bb_max (for 300 K) = constant / 300 K\n\u03bb_max (for 300 K) = 2.898 x 10^6 nm*K / 300 K\n\u03bb_max (for 300 K) = 9.66 nm\n\nTherefore, the thermal spectrum for a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K would reach a maximum around 9.66 nm. \n\nThe closest answer option to this calculated value is C: 10 mm.",
