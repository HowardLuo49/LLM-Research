If the Sun were suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass, it would have a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m. What effect, if any, would this change have on the orbits of the planets?\nA: The planets would move directly toward the Sun.\nB: The planets would move in spiral orbits.\nC: The planets would oscillate about their former elliptical orbits.\nD: The orbits would remain unchanged.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Answer: D: The orbits would remain unchanged.\n\nExplanation: The mass of the Sun would remain the same even if it were replaced by a black hole of the same mass. Since the gravitational force experienced by the planets is dependent on the mass of the Sun, and not its volume or density, the orbits of the planets would remain unchanged. The Schwarzschild radius only indicates the event horizon of a black hole and does not affect the gravitational pull it exerts on objects outside of it.",
