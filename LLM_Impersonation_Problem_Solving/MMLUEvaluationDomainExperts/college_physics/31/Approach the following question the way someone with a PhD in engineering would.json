If the Sun were suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass, it would have a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m.

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the gravitational influence of a black hole with a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m, replacing the Sun in the center of the solar system. \n\nFirstly, it is important to note that the gravitational force exerted by a black hole is significantly stronger than that of a star of the same mass due to its extremely dense and compact nature. This increased gravitational force would likely have a significant impact on the orbits of the planets in the solar system.\n\nGiven this understanding, the most plausible answer would be A: The planets would move directly toward the Sun. This is because the strong gravitational pull of the black hole would cause the planets to spiral inwards towards the black hole, resulting in them moving directly towards it. The orbits of the planets would be disrupted and their trajectories would be altered as a result of the presence of the black hole in place of the Sun. \n\nTherefore, the answer is not D: The orbits would remain unchanged, as the introduction of a black hole of the same mass as the Sun would indeed have a noticeable effect on the orbits of the planets in the solar system.",
