The speed of light in a nonmagnetic dielectric material is determined by both the properties of the material (specifically its dielectric constant) and fundamental physical constants. In this case, the dielectric constant of 4.0 indicates the extent to which the material can polarize in response to an electric field.\n\nGiven this information, I would state that the correct answer is A: 1.2 x 10^9 m/s. This can be calculated by multiplying the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s) by the square root of the dielectric constant (4.0). This formula, v = c / \u221a\u03b5, where v is the speed of light in the material, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \u03b5 is the dielectric constant. Therefore, the speed of light inside a material with a dielectric constant of 4.0 is approximately 1.2 x 10^9 m/s.",
