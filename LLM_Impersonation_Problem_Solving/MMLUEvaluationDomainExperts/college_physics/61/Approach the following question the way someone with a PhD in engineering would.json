    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the energy levels associated with different forms of electromagnetic radiation. In the context of nuclear processes, such as radioactive decay, the highest energy emissions are typically in the form of gamma rays. Gamma rays are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation and are commonly emitted during nuclear reactions. Therefore, the correct answer to this question would be A: gamma rays.",
