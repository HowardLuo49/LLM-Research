    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a deep understanding of literature, I would approach this question by analyzing the electromagnetic spectrum and its relationship to nuclear emissions. Gamma rays, which have the highest frequency and energy in the electromagnetic spectrum, are most commonly emitted from a nucleus undergoing radioactive decay. This is due to the extremely high energy levels involved in nuclear processes. Therefore, the correct answer is A: gamma rays.",
