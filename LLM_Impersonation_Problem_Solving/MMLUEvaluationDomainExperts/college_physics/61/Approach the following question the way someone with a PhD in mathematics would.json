    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by considering the energy levels associated with the classification of the different types of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation emitted from a nucleus is typically in the form of gamma rays. This is because gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation, making them the most likely form emitted by nuclear processes. Therefore, the correct answer is A: gamma rays.",
