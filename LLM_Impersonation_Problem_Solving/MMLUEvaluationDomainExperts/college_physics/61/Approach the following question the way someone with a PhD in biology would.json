    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I can confidently say that electromagnetic radiation emitted from a nucleus is most likely to be in the form of gamma rays. This is because gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation and are typically emitted during nuclear processes such as radioactive decay. Microwaves, ultraviolet radiation, and visible light are all lower energy forms of electromagnetic radiation and are not typically emitted from a nucleus during nuclear processes.",
