How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To accelerate a particle of mass m to a speed of 0.6c, we must consider the work-energy principle. The work done on the particle will result in its kinetic energy. \n\nThe kinetic energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is given by:\nK.E. = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2\nwhere \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), and v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nSince the particle starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the work done on the particle is equal to the total kinetic energy at the final speed of 0.6c.\n\nAt 0.6c, the Lorentz factor \u03b3 is calculated by:\n\u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25\n\nSubstitute \u03b3 = 1.25 into the kinetic energy equation to find the work done on the particle:\nK.E. = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 0.25mc^2.",
