How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",

    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the amount of work required to accelerate a proton to a speed of 0.6c, we must employ the principles of special relativity as derived from the Lorentz transformation.
