Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the condition for constructive interference of light reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of the thin film. \n\nThe condition for constructive interference is given by the equation: 2n1t1 = m\u03bb, where n1 and t1 are the refractive index and thickness of the oil film, respectively, m is an integer representing the order of the interference, and \u03bb is the wavelength of light in the medium.\n\nGiven that the blue light has a wavelength of 480 nm and the refractive index of the oil is 1.2, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the minimum thickness of the oil film:\n\n2(1.2)t1 = 1*480 nm\n2.4t1 = 480 nm\nt1 = 200 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film required for constructive interference to occur is 200 nm. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 200 nm.",
