Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",

    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I must admit that this question falls outside of my expertise. However, I can provide a basic understanding of the concepts involved based on my general knowledge.\n\nIn this scenario, we are dealing with thin film interference, which occurs when light waves reflect off both the upper and lower surfaces of a thin film. The condition for constructive interference in thin films is given by the equation 2nt = m\u03bb, where n is the refractive index of the thin film, t is the thickness of the film, m is an integer representing the order of the interference, and \u03bb is the wavelength of light.\n\nGiven that the blue light has a wavelength of 480 nm, a refractive index of 1.2 for the oil, and 1.6 for the glass, we can use the equation mentioned above to determine the minimum thickness of the oil film for constructive interference to occur at normal incidence.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n2(1.2)t = (480 nm)\n2.4t = 480\nt = 480/2.4\nt = 200 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) for constructive interference of blue light with a wavelength of 480 nm is 200 nm. So, the answer is B: 200 nm.",
