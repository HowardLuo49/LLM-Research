Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we can consider the concept of thin film interference. When light strikes a thin film of a material with a different refractive index than its surroundings, some of the light will be reflected at the top and bottom surfaces of the film. If the thickness of the film is such that the two reflected waves interfere constructively, we will observe a maximum in reflected light intensity.\n\nFor blue light of wavelength 480 nm and incident normally on the oil film, we can calculate the wavelength in the oil using the formula:\n\n\u03bb_oil = \u03bb_air / n_oil = 480 nm / 1.2 = 400 nm\n\nThe light reflects off both the top and bottom surfaces of the film, leading to a phase shift of \u03c0 if the light reflects off the more dense medium (glass) and no phase shift if the light reflects off the less dense medium (air). In order for constructive interference to occur, the path length difference between the two reflected waves must be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the oil:\n\n2 * t * n_oil = m * \u03bb_oil\n\nwhere t is the thickness of the oil film, n_oil is the refractive index of the oil, m is an integer representing the order of interference, and \u03bb_oil is the wavelength of light in the oil.\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum thickness of the oil film other than zero (corresponding to m = 1), we can set m = 1 in the equation and solve for t:\n\n2 * t * 1.2 = 1 * 400 nm\nt = 200 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film for constructive interference to occur is 200 nm. Hence, the correct answer is option B: 200 nm.",
