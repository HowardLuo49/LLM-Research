Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we can use the concept of thin film interference. When light reflects off a thin film, the path length difference between the reflected rays from the top and bottom surfaces of the film determines whether constructive or destructive interference occurs.\n\nThe condition for constructive interference in thin films is given by the equation 2nt = m\u03bb, where t is the thickness of the film, n is the refractive index of the film, m is an integer representing the order of the interference, and \u03bb is the wavelength of light in the film.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the reflected light has maximum intensity, which corresponds to constructive interference. The minimum thickness of the oil film occurs when m = 1 and \u03bb = 480 nm (given). We also have the refractive indices of the oil (n=1.2) and glass (n=1.6).\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation and solve for the thickness of the oil film:\n\n2 * 1.2 * t = 1 * 480 nm\n2.4t = 480 nm\nt = 200 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film that results in maximum reflection of the blue light is 200 nm. The correct answer is B: 200 nm.",
