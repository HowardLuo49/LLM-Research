It is similar to the hydrogen atom, with the positron replacing the proton. If a positronium atom makes a transition from the state with n=3 to a state with n=1, the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to\nA: 6.0 e\nB: 6.8 eV\nC: 12.2 eV\nD: 13.6 eV",

    "gpt_response": "One could approach this question by considering the energy levels of the positronium atom in the context of quantum mechanics and understanding the relationship between energy levels and transitions in atomic systems. The energy levels of an atom can be calculated using the formula for the energy of an electron in a hydrogen-like atom, which can be adapted for positronium by replacing the mass of the electron with the reduced mass of the electron-positron system. \n\nThe energy levels of the positronium atom are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere n is the principal quantum number.
