It is similar to the hydrogen atom, with the positron replacing the proton. If a positronium atom makes a transition from the state with n=3 to a state with n=1, the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to\nA: 6.0 e\nB: 6.8 eV\nC: 12.2 eV\nD: 13.6 eV",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the energy emitted in the transition from n=3 to n=1 in positronium, we can use the formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. The energy levels of positronium can be calculated using the reduced mass of the system, which is given by:\n\n\u03bc = m_e*m_p/(m_e + m_p),\n\nwhere m_e is the mass of the electron and m_p is the mass of the positron. Since the mass of the electron is the same as the mass of the positron, the reduced mass simplifies to:\n\n\u03bc = m_e/2.\n\nThe energy levels of the positronium atom are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV/n^2.\n\nSubstituting n=3 and n=1 into the formula yields:\n\nE_3 = -13.6 eV/3^2 = -1.51 eV,\nE_1 = -13.6 eV/1^2 = -13.6 eV.\n\nThe energy emitted in the transition is given by the difference in energy levels:\n\n\u0394E = E_1 - E_3 = -13.6 eV - (-1.51 eV) = -12.09 eV.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is C: 12.2 eV.",
