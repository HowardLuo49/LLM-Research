However, based on my understanding of the quantum efficiency of a photon detector, which refers to the probability that a photon will be detected, a quantum efficiency of 0.1 means that for every 10 photons that are sent into the detector, on average, 1 will be detected.\n\nTherefore, if 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, we can expect that, on average, 10 photons will be detected. This aligns with option B, which states that the detector will detect an average of 10 times. The root mean square (rms) deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values, and in this case, it would be roughly 0.1 due to the quantum efficiency of 0.1.\n\nIn conclusion, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.1, making option B the most appropriate choice.",
