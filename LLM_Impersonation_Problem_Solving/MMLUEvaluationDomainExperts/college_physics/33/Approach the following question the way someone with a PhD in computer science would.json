    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a more technical standpoint, we need to understand the concept of quantum efficiency in the context of photon detectors. Quantum efficiency represents the probability of a photon being detected by the detector. In this case, the quantum efficiency is given as 0.1 or 10%.\n\nWhen 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, the expected number of photons detected by the detector can be calculated using the quantum efficiency. The expected number of detections can be calculated as the product of the number of photons sent (100) and the quantum efficiency (0.1), which equals 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: exactly 10 times. This is because the quantum efficiency determines the average number of detections when a specific number of photons are sent into the detector. The other answer choices are not accurate in this scenario.",
