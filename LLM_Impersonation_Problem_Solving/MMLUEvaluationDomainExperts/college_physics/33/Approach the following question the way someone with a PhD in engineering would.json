    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Answer: A: exactly 10 times\n\nExplanation: The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the probability that a photon incident on the detector will be detected. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that out of 100 photons sent into the detector, on average, 10 photons will be detected. This is a deterministic relationship, so the detector will detect photons exactly 10 times, not with any variation in the number of detections.",
