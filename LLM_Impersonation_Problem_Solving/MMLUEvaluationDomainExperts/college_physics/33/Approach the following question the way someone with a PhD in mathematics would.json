    "gpt_response": "The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is defined as the probability that the detector will respond to a single incident photon. In this case, the quantum efficiency is given as 0.1, which means that on average, 10% of the incoming photons will be detected by the detector.\n\nWhen 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, the expectation value for the number of photons detected can be calculated as the product of the quantum efficiency and the total number of photons sent into the detector. Therefore, the expected number of detections is 0.1 * 100 = 10.\n\nSince the quantum efficiency represents the probability of detection for each individual photon, the number of detections is subject to statistical fluctuations. These fluctuations can be described using the concept of a probability distribution.\n\nThe most appropriate way to quantify the fluctuations in the number of detected photons is to calculate the root mean square (rms) deviation from the expected value. In this case, the rms deviation can be estimated as the square root of the expected number of detections, which is about 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
