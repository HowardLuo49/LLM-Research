    "gpt_response": "The quantum efficiency of a photon detector refers to the probability that a photon entering the detector will be detected. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that there is a 10% chance that any individual photon will be detected.\n\nWhen 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, each photon has a 0.1 probability of being detected. The distribution of detected photons follows a binomial distribution, where the average number of detections can be calculated by multiplying the number of trials (100 photons) by the probability of success (0.1). Therefore, the average number of detections is 100 * 0.1 = 10.\n\nThe root mean square (rms) deviation of a binomial distribution can be approximated by the square root of the product of the number of trials, the probability of success, and the probability of failure. In this case, the probability of failure is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9. The rms deviation is then approximately sqrt(100 * 0.1 * 0.9) = sqrt(9) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
