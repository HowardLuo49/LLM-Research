    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first considering the properties of the emission spectrum of a hydrogen atom, which is well known in atomic physics. The emission spectrum of a hydrogen atom consists of discrete lines corresponding to the transitions of the electron between different energy levels. The wavelengths of these spectral lines are given by the Rydberg formula:\n\n1/\u03bb = R*(Z^2)*(1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, R is the Rydberg constant, Z is the atomic number, and n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states of the electron, respectively.\n\nGiven that the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom, we can expect that the wavelengths of the spectral lines will be related in a simple way. Since Li++ has an atomic number Z = 3, which is one more than hydrogen, we can infer that the wavelengths of the spectral lines will be reduced compared to hydrogen.\n\nThe ratio of the wavelengths of the spectral lines of Li++ to those of hydrogen can be calculated using the Rydberg formula. Since the atomic number Z appears squared in the formula, we can expect that the wavelengths will be reduced by a factor of Z^2, which in this case is 3^2 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: decreased by a factor of 9.",
