    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the differences between the emission spectra of a doubly ionized lithium atom and a hydrogen atom. The emission spectrum of an atom is determined by the energy levels of its electrons, which in turn are influenced by the atomic number (Z) and the number of protons in the nucleus.\n\nIn the case of a doubly ionized lithium atom (Li++), the Z value is 3, which indicates the number of protons in the nucleus. This means that Li++ has lost two electrons, leaving only one electron in the system. On the other hand, a hydrogen atom has a Z value of 1, with only one proton in the nucleus and one electron in orbit.\n\nGiven that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of hydrogen, but with all wavelengths modified in some way, we can deduce that the energy levels of the remaining electron in Li++ must be related to those of the electron in hydrogen. Since the hydrogen atom has only one electron, its energy levels directly determine the observed emission spectrum.\n\nConsidering that the wavelengths of the emission lines are inversely proportional to the energy differences between electron transitions, we can infer that the wavelength of the emission lines of Li++ must be modified in relation to those of hydrogen. Specifically, since Li++ has a Z value three times that of hydrogen, we can conclude that the wavelengths of the emission lines in Li++ are decreased by a factor of 9 compared to those of hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: decreased by a factor of 9.",
