    "gpt_response": "A PhD in literature may not have a specialization in physics or chemistry to provide a detailed analysis of the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom compared to a hydrogen atom. However, they may be able to approach this question by analyzing the language and choices provided.\n\nIn this case, the question asks about the relationship between the emission spectra of the lithium ion and a hydrogen atom. By looking at the answer choices, a PhD in literature may notice that they are specifically focused on factors of decrease or increase.\n\nBased on the choices provided, the correct answer would be B: decreased by a factor of 49. This is because the wavelength of light is inversely proportional to the square of the atomic number, and since lithium has an atomic number of 3 (compared to hydrogen's 1), the factor of decrease would be 3*3*3*3 = 3^4 = 81. However, the question is asking for the factor of decrease compared to a hydrogen atom, which means the factor would be 81/3 = 27. Therefore, the answer B: decreased by a factor of 49 is the closest approximation.\n\nOverall, while a PhD in literature may not have expertise in the specifics of atomic spectra, they can still use critical thinking skills to analyze and interpret the question based on the provided choices.",
