The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the amount of heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The initial potential energy of the elevator is converted into kinetic energy as it falls, and then this energy is dissipated as heat by the brakes to bring the elevator to rest.\n\nThe potential energy of the elevator at the top of the shaft is given by\n\nPE = mgh\n\nwhere m is the mass of the elevator (1,000 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height of the fall (100 m).\n\nPE = 1,000 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 100 m\nPE = 981,000 J\n\nThe kinetic energy of the elevator just before the brakes engage is given by\n\nKE = 1/2 * mv^2\n\nwhere v is the final velocity of the elevator just before the brakes engage. Since the elevator is brought to rest by the brakes, the final velocity is 0.\n\nKE = 0\n\nTherefore, the total energy that the brakes must dissipate is equal to the initial potential energy of the elevator.\n\nTotal energy to be dissipated = 981,000 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 1,000,000 J.",
