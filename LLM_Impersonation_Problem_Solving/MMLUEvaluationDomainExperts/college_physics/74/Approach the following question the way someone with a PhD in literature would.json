The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "In considering the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest, we must first understand the principles of energy and work involved in this scenario. As a PhD in literature, it is important to approach this question from a theoretical and analytical perspective, drawing upon the knowledge and critical thinking skills honed in the study of literary texts.\n\nIn this scenario, the elevator is falling downward due to the snapping of the suspension cable. The force of gravity acting on the elevator causes it to accelerate as it falls. The emergency brakes are then engaged to stop the elevator's motion before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. The work done by the brakes to bring the elevator to rest involves converting the kinetic energy of the falling elevator into heat energy, which is dissipated to the surroundings.\n\nIn this case, the elevator falls a distance of 100 m, starting from rest. The potential energy of the elevator at this height can be calculated using the equation:\n\nPE = mgh\n\nWhere:\nPE = potential energy\nm = mass of the elevator (1,000 kg)\ng = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2)\nh = height (100 m)\n\nPE = 1,000 kg x 9.81 m/s^2 x 100 m\nPE = 981,000 J\n\nSince the elevator falls from rest, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it falls. The kinetic energy of the elevator just before the brakes are engaged can be calculated using the equation:\n\nKE = 1/2 mv^2\n\nWhere:\nKE = kinetic energy\nm = mass of the elevator (1,000 kg)\nv = final velocity of the elevator as it reaches the bottom of the shaft\n\nSince the elevator is brought to rest, the final velocity is 0 m/s. Therefore, the kinetic energy just before the brakes are engaged is 0 J.\n\nThe work done by the brakes to bring the elevator to rest is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the elevator. Therefore, the amount of heat that the brakes must dissipate is equal to the kinetic energy just before the brakes are engaged:\n\nWork = KE = 0 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is option A: 10,000 J.",
