The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I would defer to someone with expertise in physics or engineering to accurately answer this question. However, if I were to approach this question from a general scientific perspective, I would consider the energy involved in the falling elevator to calculate the amount of heat that the brakes must dissipate.\n\nThe potential energy of the elevator at the top of the shaft is given by the equation: PE = mgh, where m is the mass of the elevator, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height through which the elevator falls. Given the information provided, we can calculate the potential energy at the top of the shaft as:\n\nPE = (1000 kg) * (9.8 m/s^2) * (100 m) = 980,000 J\n\nThis potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the elevator falls, and then ultimately dissipated as heat by the emergency brakes to bring the elevator to a stop. The heat dissipated by the brakes is equal to the initial potential energy of the elevator, as they must dissipate all the energy to stop the elevator. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC: 1,000,000 J",
