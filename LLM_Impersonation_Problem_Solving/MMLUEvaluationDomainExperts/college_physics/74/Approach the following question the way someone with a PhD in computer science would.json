The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the heat that the brakes must dissipate in order to bring the elevator safely to rest, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. \n\nThe potential energy lost as the elevator falls is given by the formula: PE = mgh, where m = mass of the elevator (1000 kg), g = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h = height fallen (100 m). \n\nPE = 1000 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 100 m = 981,000 J \n\nThe work done by the brakes (which is equal to the heat dissipated) is equal to the potential energy lost by the elevator. \n\nTherefore, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is 981,000 J, which is approximately 1,000,000 J. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1,000,000 J.",
