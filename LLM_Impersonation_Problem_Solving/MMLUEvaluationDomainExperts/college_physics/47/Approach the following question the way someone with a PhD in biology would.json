    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the distance the particle will travel in the lab frame before decaying, we need to consider time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an observer in one frame of reference perceives the time interval of events occurring in another frame to be dilated.\n\nThe time dilation equation is given by:\n\u0394t_lab = \u03b3*\u0394t_rest    (1)\n\nwhere \u0394t_lab is the time interval in the lab frame, \u0394t_rest is the time interval in the rest frame, and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)     (2)\n\nGiven that the particle decays in 2.0 ms in its rest frame, \u0394t_rest = 2.0e-3 s. Plugging this value into equation (1), we get:\n\n\u0394t_lab = \u03b3*2.0e-3 s     (3)\n\nSubstitute the given velocity v=0.60c into equation (2) to calculate \u03b3. Once \u03b3 is calculated, substitute it into equation (3) to determine \u0394t_lab. \n\nAs the distance traveled before decay is given by the formula d = v*\u0394t_lab, we can then plug in \u0394t_lab and the given velocity v to solve for d. \n\nAfter calculating, the answer should be approximately 288 m. Therefore, the correct option is (B) 288 m.",
