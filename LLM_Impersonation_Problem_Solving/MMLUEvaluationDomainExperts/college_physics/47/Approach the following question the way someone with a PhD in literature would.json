    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the concept of time dilation in special relativity. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere t' is the time measured in the moving frame (lab frame in this case), t is the time measured in the rest frame (2.0 ms in this case), v is the velocity of the moving frame (0.60c in this case), and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - (0.60c)^2/c^2)\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(0.64)\nt' = 2.0 ms / 0.8\nt' = 2.5 ms\n\nThis means that in the lab frame, the particle takes 2.5 ms to decay. Using the formula for distance (d = vt), where v is the velocity of the lab frame (0.60c) and t is the time taken for the decay (2.5 ms), we can calculate the distance traveled by the particle before decaying:\n\nd = (0.60c)(2.5 ms)\nd = 1.5 c ms\nd = 1.5 c * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)(2.5 x 10^-3 s)\nd = 1.5 * 3.00 * 2.5 x 10^5 m\nd = 11.25 x 10^5 m\nd = 1125000 m\nd = 1125 km\n\nTherefore, the particle will travel 1125 km in the lab frame before decaying. Since none of the answer choices provided are in km, we can convert this distance to meters by multiplying by 1000:\n\n1125 km * 1000 m/km = 1125000 m\n\nThus, the correct answer is not listed, as the actual distance traveled is 1125000 meters or 1125 km.",
