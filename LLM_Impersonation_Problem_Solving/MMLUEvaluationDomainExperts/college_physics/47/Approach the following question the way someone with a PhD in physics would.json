    "gpt_response": "In the rest frame of the particle, the decay time is given as 2.0 ms. Let's denote this as \u0394t_o.\n\nIn the lab frame, time dilation occurs due to the relativistic speed of the particle. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\u0394t = \u0394t_o / \u221a(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\u0394t = 2.0 ms / \u221a(1 - (0.60c)^2 / c^2)\n\u0394t = 2.0 ms / \u221a(1 - 0.36)\n\u0394t = 2.0 ms / \u221a(0.64)\n\u0394t = 2.0 ms / 0.8\n\u0394t = 2.5 ms\n\nThe distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame before decaying can be calculated as:\nd = v * \u0394t\nd = 0.60c * 2.5 ms\nd = 0.60c * 2.5 ms * 3.00 x 10^8 m/s\nd = 450 m\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 450 m.",
