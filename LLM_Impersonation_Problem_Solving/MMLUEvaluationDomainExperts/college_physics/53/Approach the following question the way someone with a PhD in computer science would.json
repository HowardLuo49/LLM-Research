    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by analyzing the relationship between the net forces acting on objects A and B. \n\nFirst, we know that the mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, and the acceleration of object B is also twice that of object A. This relationship can be expressed as:\nm_B = 2m_A (mass of object B is twice the mass of object A)\na_B = 2a_A (acceleration of object B is twice that of object A)\n\nNewton's second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:\nF = ma\n\nSubstituting the given relationships into the equation for object A and B, we can express the forces as:\nF_A = m_A * a_A\nF_B = m_B * a_B\n\nSince we know m_B = 2m_A and a_B = 2a_A, we can rewrite the equations for F_A and F_B:\nF_A = m_A * a_A\nF_B = 2m_A * 2a_A\nF_B = 4m_A * a_A\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that F_B = 4F_A.
