The correct answer is D: rate of change of the electric flux through S.\n\nAccording to Maxwell's equations, specifically Amp\u00e8re's law with Maxwell's addition, the electric displacement current through a surface S is indeed proportional to the rate of change of the electric flux passing through that surface. This relationship is fundamental to understanding the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in electromagnetism.",
