    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the rest mass of a particle with total energy of 5.0 GeV and momentum of 4.9 GeV/c, we must first understand the concepts of relativistic energy and momentum. In special relativity, the total energy E of a particle is related to its rest mass m and momentum p by the equation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nGiven that the total energy E is 5.0 GeV and the momentum p is 4.9 GeV/c, we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for the rest mass m. By rearranging the equation, we get m = sqrt(E^2 - p^2)/c^2. Plugging in the values, we find m = sqrt((5.0 GeV)^2 - (4.9 GeV)^2)/(c^2), which simplifies to m \u2248 0.1 GeV/c^2.\n\nTherefore, the rest mass of a particle with total energy 5.0 GeV and momentum 4.9 GeV/c is approximately 0.1 GeV/c^2, which corresponds to option A.",
