An organ pipe, closed at one end and open at the other, is designed to have a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). What is the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe?\nA: 44 Hz\nB: 196 Hz\nC: 262 Hz\nD: 393 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this closed-open organ pipe, we need to first determine the relationship between the frequencies of the different harmonics in a closed-open pipe.\n\nIn a closed-open pipe, the fundamental frequency (first harmonic) is given by:\n\nf1 = v / 4L\n\nwhere f1 is the fundamental frequency, v is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s at room temperature), and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nGiven that the fundamental frequency f1 is 131 Hz, we can rearrange the formula to solve for L:\n\nL = v / 4f1\n   = 343 / (4 * 131)\n   \u2248 0.65 m\n\nNow, for a closed-open pipe, the next higher harmonic (second harmonic) occurs at three times the frequency of the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic is given by:\n\nf2 = 3f1\n   = 3 * 131\n   = 393 Hz\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 393 Hz.",
