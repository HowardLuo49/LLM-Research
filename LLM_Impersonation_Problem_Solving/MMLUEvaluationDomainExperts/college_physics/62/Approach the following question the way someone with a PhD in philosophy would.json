An organ pipe, closed at one end and open at the other, is designed to have a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). What is the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe?\nA: 44 Hz\nB: 196 Hz\nC: 262 Hz\nD: 393 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the frequency of the next higher harmonic for the given organ pipe, one must first understand the concept of harmonics in relation to the fundamental frequency of a vibrating system. The fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency at which the system can oscillate, and it is typically denoted as the first harmonic. Higher harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, which correspond to higher modes of vibration in the system.\n\nIn the case of an organ pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the fundamental frequency is given by the equation:\n\nf = v / (4L),\n\nwhere f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s at room temperature), and L is the length of the pipe. In this scenario, the fundamental frequency is specified to be C (131 Hz), which allows us to solve for the length of the pipe using the equation:\n\n131 Hz = 343 m/s / (4L).\n\nSolving for L, we find that the length of the pipe corresponds to approximately 0.654 meters. Since the pipe is closed at one end, the first harmonic in this system is such that the closed end is a node and the open end is an antinode, resulting in a quarter-wavelength standing wave.\n\nTo calculate the frequency of the next higher harmonic (second harmonic) for this pipe, one must consider that the second harmonic corresponds to a full wavelength standing wave, meaning that the length of the pipe effectively becomes half a wavelength. Therefore, the second harmonic frequency can be expressed as:\n\nf2 = 2f1 = 2 * 131 Hz = 262 Hz.\n\nThus, the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this organ pipe is 262 Hz, which aligns with option C.",
