An organ pipe, closed at one end and open at the other, is designed to have a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). What is the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe?\nA: 44 Hz\nB: 196 Hz\nC: 262 Hz\nD: 393 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To fully understand the frequency of the next higher harmonic for an organ pipe closed at one end and open at the other, it is essential to delve into the principles of acoustics and harmonics.\n\nWhen a pipe is closed at one end and open at the other, it can produce standing waves that determine its fundamental frequency and harmonics. The fundamental frequency, in this case, is C4 at 131 Hz. This fundamental frequency corresponds to a quarter-wavelength resonance within the pipe.\n\nFor a pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the next higher harmonic corresponds to the third harmonic. The third harmonic is characterized by having three-quarters of a wavelength within the pipe. Since the fundamental frequency of C4 is 131 Hz, we can calculate the frequency of the next higher harmonic by finding the frequency that corresponds to three-quarters of a wavelength at the same speed of sound in air.\n\nThe formula for the frequency of a harmonic in a pipe closed at one end and open at the other is:\n\nf_n = (2n + 1) * v / 4L\n\nWhere:\nf_n is the frequency of the nth harmonic\nn is the harmonic number (in this case, n = 3 for the third harmonic)\nv is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s)\nL is the length of the pipe (quarter of a wavelength, approximately 0.25 * wavelength)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nf_3 = (2*3 + 1) * 343 / (4 * 0.25 * \u03bb)  = 393 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this organ pipe is approximately 393 Hz. The correct answer is D: 393 Hz.",
