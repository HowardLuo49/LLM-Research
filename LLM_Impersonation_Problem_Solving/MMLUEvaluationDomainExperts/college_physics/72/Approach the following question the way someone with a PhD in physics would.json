At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. Initially, the box has kinetic energy, given by KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m = 10 kg and v = 1 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get KE = (1/2)(10)(1)^2 = 5 J.\n\nWhen the constant force is applied to the box, it does work on the box, increasing its energy. The work done by the force is given by W = Fs, where F is the magnitude of the force and s is the distance traveled by the box with the force applied (5 m). Since there is no friction, this work done increases the kinetic energy of the box to 10 J.\n\nAfter the force is removed, the box continues to move with a speed of 2 m/s. The kinetic energy of the box at this point is KE = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(10)(2)^2 = 20 J.\n\nUsing the principle of conservation of energy, we know that the total energy at all points in time is the same. Therefore, we can write: Initial KE + Work done by force = Final KE\n\nSubstituting the values, we get: 5 J + Fs = 20 J\nSolving for F, we get: F = (20 - 5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C.",
