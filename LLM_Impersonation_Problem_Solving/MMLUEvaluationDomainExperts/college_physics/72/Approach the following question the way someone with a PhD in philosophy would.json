At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To truly understand the magnitude of the applied force in this scenario, we must first consider the underlying principles of classical mechanics and Newton's laws of motion. Specifically, we need to analyze the equations of motion governing the box's dynamics as it moves under the influence of the force.\n\nGiven that the box has a mass of 10 kg and initially moves at a speed of 1 m/s without friction, we can deduce that the initial kinetic energy of the box is given by KE_initial = (1/2) * m * v^2 = (1/2) * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 5 J.\n\nAs the constant force is applied in the direction of motion, it performs work on the box, causing it to travel a distance of 5 m. The work done by the force can be expressed as W = F * d, where W is the work done, F is the magnitude of the force, and d is the distance traveled. Here, W = KE_final - KE_initial, where KE_final represents the final kinetic energy of the box.\n\nSince the box comes to a stop at a speed of 2 m/s after the force is removed, the final kinetic energy is KE_final = (1/2) * m * v^2 = (1/2) * 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2 = 20 J.\n\nTherefore, the work done by the force is calculated as W = 20 J - 5 J = 15 J. Substituting this into the work formula, we obtain:\n\n15 J = F * 5 m.\n\nFrom this, we can determine that the magnitude of the applied force F is equal to 15 J / 5 m = 3 N.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of the applied force in this scenario is 3 N.",
