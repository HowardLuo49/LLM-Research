    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we can apply the principle of conservation of energy to determine the magnitude of the applied force. Initially, the box has a kinetic energy equal to (1/2)(mass)(velocity)^2 = (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s)^2 = 5 J. When the force is applied, work is done on the box, increasing its kinetic energy. The work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box. \n\nThe change in kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy. The final kinetic energy is (1/2)(10 kg)(2 m/s)^2 = 20 J. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy is 20 J - 5 J = 15 J.\n\nSince work is equal to force times distance, the work done by the force is equal to the force applied times the distance traveled. Thus, we have:\nforce * 5 m = 15 J\nforce = 15 J / 5 m\nforce = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N. So the correct answer is option C: 3 N.",
