At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

    "gpt_response": "This problem can be approached by using the principles of Newton's second law of motion. The initial velocity of the box is 1 m/s, and the final velocity after the constant force is applied and then removed is 2 m/s. The box travels a distance of 5 m with the force applied.\n\nWe can calculate the acceleration of the box using the equation:\n\nv^2 = u^2 + 2as\n\nwhere:\nv = final velocity = 2 m/s\nu = initial velocity = 1 m/s\na = acceleration\ns = distance travelled = 5 m\n\nRearranging the equation for a:\n\na = (v^2 - u^2) / (2s)\na = (2^2 - 1^2) / (2 * 5)\na = (4 - 1) / 10\na = 0.3 m/s^2\n\nNow, using Newton's second law, we know that the force applied can be calculated as:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere:\nF = force applied\nm = mass of the box = 10 kg\na = acceleration calculated above = 0.3 m/s^2\n\nTherefore:\nF = 10 kg * 0.3 m/s^2\nF = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C.",
