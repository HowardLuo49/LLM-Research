A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "In analyzing this situation, we must apply Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a closed loop is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop.\n\nThe formula for calculating the induced EMF in a coil is given by:\n\nEMF = -N * A * (\u0394B/\u0394t)\n\nWhere:\n- EMF is the induced electromotive force\n- N is the number of turns in the coil (in this case, 250 turns)\n- A is the area of the coil (0.2 m^2)\n- \u0394B is the change in magnetic field strength (0.06 T - 0.01 T = 0.05 T)\n- \u0394t is the time interval over which the change in magnetic field occurs (0.25 s)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.05 / 0.25) = -250 * 0.2 * 0.2 = -10 V\n\nTherefore, the average induced EMF in the coil is 10 V.
