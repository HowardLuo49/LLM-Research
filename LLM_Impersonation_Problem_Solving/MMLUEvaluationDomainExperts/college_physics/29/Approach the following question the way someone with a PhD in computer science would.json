A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced EMF is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. \n\nThe magnetic flux through a coil is given by the formula \u03a6 = B * A * cos(\u03b8), where:\n\u03a6 is the magnetic flux\nB is the magnetic field\nA is the area of the coil\n\u03b8 is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the plane of the coil \n\nIn this case, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, so \u03b8 = 0. Therefore, the formula simplifies to \u03a6 = B * A. \n\nThe initial magnetic flux through the coil is 0.01 T * 0.2 m^2 = 0.002 Wb. \nThe final magnetic flux through the coil is 0.06 T * 0.2 m^2 = 0.012 Wb. \n\nThe change in magnetic flux is 0.012 Wb - 0.002 Wb = 0.01 Wb. \n\nThe time interval over which this change occurs is 0.25 s. \n\nUsing Faraday's law, the average induced EMF is equal to the change in magnetic flux divided by the time interval:\nEMF = \u0394\u03a6 / \u0394t\nEMF = 0.01 Wb / 0.25 s\nEMF = 0.04 V\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.04 V.",
