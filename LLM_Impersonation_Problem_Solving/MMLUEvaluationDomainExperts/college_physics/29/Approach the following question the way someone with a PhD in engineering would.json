A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, which states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit.\n\nThe formula for calculating the induced EMF is given by:\nEMF = -N * A * (\u0394B/\u0394t)\n\nWhere:\nEMF is the induced electromotive force,\nN is the number of turns in the coil (250 turns in this case),\nA is the area of the coil (0.2 m^2),\n\u0394B is the change in magnetic field strength (0.06 T - 0.01 T = 0.05 T),\nand \u0394t is the time interval during which the change in magnetic field occurs (0.25 s).\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.05/0.25)\nEMF = - 50 * 0.05\nEMF = -2.5 V\n\nSince the question is asking for the average induced EMF in the coil, the negative sign indicates the direction of the induced current. Therefore, the magnitude of the average induced EMF is 2.5 V.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC: 2.5 V.",
