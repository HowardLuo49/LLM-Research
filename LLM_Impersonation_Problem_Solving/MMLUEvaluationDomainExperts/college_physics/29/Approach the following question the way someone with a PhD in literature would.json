A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "In analyzing this problem, it is important to consider the principles of electromagnetic induction, specifically Faraday's law. According to Faraday's law, the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a closed loop circuit is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. \n\nIn this case, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the circular coil, which means that the magnetic flux through the coil is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength and the area of the coil. The magnetic flux (\u03a6) through the coil is given by \u03a6 = B * A * N, where B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area of the coil, and N is the number of turns in the coil.\n\nInitially, the magnetic field strength is 0.01 T, the area of the coil is 0.2 m^2, and the number of turns is 250. This gives an initial magnetic flux \u03a6_initial = 0.01 * 0.2 * 250 = 0.5 Wb.\n\nAfter a time interval of 0.25 s, the magnetic field strength is increased to 0.06 T. The final magnetic flux \u03a6_final = 0.06 * 0.2 * 250 = 3 Wb.\n\nThe change in magnetic flux during this time interval is \u0394\u03a6 = \u03a6_final - \u03a6_initial = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 Wb.\n\nBy Faraday's law, the induced EMF in the coil is given by -d\u03a6/dt, where d\u03a6/dt is the rate of change of magnetic flux. The average induced EMF during this time interval can be calculated by dividing the change in magnetic flux by the time interval: EMF = \u0394\u03a6 / \u0394t = 2.5 / 0.25 = 10 V.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10 V.",
