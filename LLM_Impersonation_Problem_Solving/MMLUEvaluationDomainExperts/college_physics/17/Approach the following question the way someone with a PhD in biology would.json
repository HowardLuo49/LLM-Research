A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the potential energy and kinetic energy of the mass-spring system.\n\nThe potential energy of a spring is given by the equation U = 1/2 * k * x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the potential energy is maximum when the spring is compressed or stretched the most, so we can calculate it using the maximum displacement x = 0.030 m.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the mass is given by the equation K = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. In this case, the kinetic energy is calculated when the mass passes through its equilibrium position with a velocity of 0.040 m/s.\n\nSince there is no friction in the system, the total mechanical energy is conserved and can be calculated as the sum of the potential and kinetic energies at any point. Therefore, we can calculate the total mechanical energy of the system using the given values for mass, displacement, and velocity.\n\nFirst, calculate the potential energy using U = 1/2 * k * x^2. The spring constant k can be obtained from Hooke's Law, F = -kx, where F is the force exerted by the spring. At maximum displacement, the force is equal to the weight of the mass, mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. So, k = mg/x.\n\nNext, calculate the kinetic energy using K = 1/2 * m * v^2.\n\nAdd the potential and kinetic energies to get the total mechanical energy of the system.\n\nBy performing the calculations, the total mechanical energy of the system is 0.24 mJ. Therefore, the answer is A: 0.24 mJ.",
