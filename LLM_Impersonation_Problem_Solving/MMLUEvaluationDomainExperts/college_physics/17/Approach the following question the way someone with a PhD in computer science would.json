A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the potential energy and the kinetic energy. \n\nThe potential energy of the system is given by the formula:\nPE = 0.5*k*x^2\nWhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. Since the spring is massless, we can consider it as an ideal spring and use the formula:\nk = m*w^2\nWhere m is the mass attached to the spring and w is the angular frequency of the spring. We can calculate w using the formula:\nw = sqrt(k/m)\nSince the mass is attached to the spring, it will oscillate with simple harmonic motion and the total mechanical energy of the system will remain constant.\n\nGiven:\nm = 0.30 kg\nx = 0.030 m\nv = 0.040 m/s\n\nFirst, calculate the angular frequency w:\nk = m*w^2\nw = sqrt(k/m)\nw = sqrt((m*v^2)/x^2)\nw = sqrt((0.30*0.040^2)/0.030^2)\nw \u2248 2.67 rad/s\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy at the equilibrium position:\nPE = 0.5*k*x^2\nPE = 0.5*m*w^2*x^2\nPE = 0.5*0.30*2.67^2*0.030^2\nPE \u2248 0.48 mJ\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 0.48 mJ.",
