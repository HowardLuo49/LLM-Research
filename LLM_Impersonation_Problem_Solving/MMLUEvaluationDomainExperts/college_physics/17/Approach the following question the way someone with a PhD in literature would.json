A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In considering the total mechanical energy of the system described, we must take into account both the kinetic energy and potential energy of the mass-spring system. \n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the equation KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity. In this case, the mass is 0.30 kg and the velocity is 0.040 m/s, so the kinetic energy of the mass at the equilibrium point is KE = 0.5 * 0.30 * (0.040)^2 = 0.00024 J or 0.24 mJ.\n\nThe potential energy (PE) of a spring is given by the equation PE = 0.5 * k * x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position. The spring constant can be found using Hooke's Law, F = -kx, where F is the force exerted by the spring. At the equilibrium point, the total force is zero, so kx = mg. Therefore, k = mg/x. Substituting in the known values, k = (0.30 kg * 9.81 m/s^2) / 0.030 m = 9.81 N/m.\n\nNow we can calculate the potential energy of the spring at the equilibrium point using PE = 0.5 * 9.81 * (0.030)^2 = 0.0044 J or 0.44 mJ.\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy, so E = KE + PE = 0.24 mJ + 0.44 mJ = 0.68 mJ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided.",
