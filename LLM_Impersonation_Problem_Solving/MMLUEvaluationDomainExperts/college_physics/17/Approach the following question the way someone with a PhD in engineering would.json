A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the potential energy and kinetic energy of the mass-spring system. \n\nThe potential energy stored in the spring at any point can be given by the equation: \nPE = 0.5 * k * x^2\n\nWhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. \n\nThe kinetic energy of the mass can be given by the equation:\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nWhere m is the mass and v is the velocity of the mass.\n\nAt the equilibrium position, the spring has potential energy but no kinetic energy. At the maximum displacement, the spring has no potential energy but only kinetic energy. Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the system at any point is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy.\n\nGiven:\nm = 0.30 kg\nx = 0.030 m\nv = 0.040 m/s\n\nUsing the equation for potential energy:\nPE = 0.5 * k * x^2\nPE = 0.5 * k * (0.030)^2\n\nUsing the equation for kinetic energy:\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\nKE = 0.5 * 0.30 * (0.040)^2\n\nTotal mechanical energy:\nTotal Energy = PE + KE\n\nSubstitute the calculated values for PE and KE into the equation:\nTotal Energy = 0.5 * k * (0.030)^2 + 0.5 * 0.30 * (0.040)^2\n\nSolving for k using the given information:\n0.5 * k * (0.030)^2 = 0.5 * 0.30 * (0.040)^2\nk * 0.0009 = 0.5 * 0.30 * 0.0016\nk = (0.5 * 0.30 * 0.0016) / 0.0009\n\nSubstitute the value of k back into the total energy equation:\nTotal Energy = 0.5 * (0.5 * 0.30 * 0.0016 / 0.0009) * (0.030)^2 + 0.5 * 0.30 * (0.040)^2\n\nCalculating the total mechanical energy will give you the final answer of either 0.24 mJ, 0.38 mJ, 0.48 mJ, or 0.75 mJ.",
