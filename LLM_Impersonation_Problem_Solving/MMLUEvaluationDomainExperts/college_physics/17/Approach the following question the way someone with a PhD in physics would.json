A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider both kinetic energy and potential energy. The total mechanical energy is the sum of these two energies.\n\nThe potential energy stored in the spring when the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position is given by the formula:\n\nPE = (1/2)kx^2\n\nWhere PE is the potential energy, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from equilibrium.\n\nGiven that the mass is displaced 0.030 m and the spring constant is not provided, we need to calculate the spring constant using Hooke's Law:\n\nF = -kx\n\nWhere F is the force exerted by the spring and x is the displacement from equilibrium.
