A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In considering the total mechanical energy of the system, we must take into account both the potential energy stored in the spring and the kinetic energy of the mass. \n\nThe potential energy stored in the spring can be calculated using the formula for spring potential energy: PE = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium. In this case, the displacement is 0.030 m and the spring constant k can be determined using Hooke's Law, F = -kx, where F is the force exerted by the spring. \n\nGiven that the speed of the mass as it passes through its equilibrium position is 0.040 m/s, we can calculate the kinetic energy using the formula KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. \n\nBy summing the potential and kinetic energies, we can determine the total mechanical energy of the system. \n\nIt is important to note that in the absence of friction, the total mechanical energy of the system remains constant throughout the motion of the mass. \n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is equal to the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. \n\nGiven the information provided, the correct answer should be C: 0.48 mJ.",
