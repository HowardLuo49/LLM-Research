Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",

    "gpt_response": "Let's start by recalling the equation for the period of a simple pendulum:\n\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g)\n\nwhere T is the period of the pendulum, L is the length of the string, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nGiven that the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, we can write this relationship as:\n\n2T_A = T_B\n\nSubstituting the formula for the period into the above equation, we get:\n\n2(2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we find:\n\n4\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g)\n\n\u221a(L_A/g) = 1/2\u221a(L_B/g)\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get:\n\nL_A/g = 1/4(L_B/g)\n\nL_A = 1/4 L_B\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD: L_B = 1/4 L_A",
