Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",

    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, the relationship between the periods of two simple pendulums can be explained using the formula for the period of a simple pendulum:\n\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g),\n\nwhere T is the period, L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nGiven that the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, we can write this relationship as:\n\n2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2(2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)),\n\nsimplifying this expression gives:\n\n\u221a(L_B/g) = 2\u221a(L_A/g),\n\nsquaring both sides gives:\n\nL_B/g = 4(L_A/g),\n\ncanceling out g gives:\n\nL_B = 4L_A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: L_B = 4L_A.",
