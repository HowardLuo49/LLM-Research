Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",
