Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Let T_A be the period of pendulum A, T_B be the period of pendulum B, and g be the acceleration due to gravity. Using the formula for the period of a simple pendulum T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g), where L is the length of the string, we have T_B = 2T_A. \n\nTherefore, 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2(2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)), which simplifies to \u221a(L_B/g) = 2\u221a(L_A/g). Squaring both sides gives L_B/g = 4(L_A/g), so L_B = 4L_A. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: L_B = 4L_A.",
