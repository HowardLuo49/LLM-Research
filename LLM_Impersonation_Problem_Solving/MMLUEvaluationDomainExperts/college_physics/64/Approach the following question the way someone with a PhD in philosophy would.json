Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the relationship between the lengths of pendulums A and B based on their period ratios, one must consider the fundamental equation for the period of a simple pendulum:\n\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g)\n\nwhere T is the period, L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Given that the periods of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, we can express this relationship mathematically as:\n\n2T_A = T_B\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the periods of pendulums A and B into the equation, we have:\n\n2 * 2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g)\n\nFurther simplifying by dividing both sides by 2\u03c0, we get:\n\n2\u221a(L_A/g) = \u221a(L_B/g)\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots, we obtain:\n\n4(L_A/g) = L_B/g\n\nThis can be rearranged to isolate the lengths of the pendulums as follows:\n\nL_B = 4L_A\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: L_B = 4L_A.",
