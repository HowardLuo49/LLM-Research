Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To analyze this problem, we can start by using the equation for the period of a simple pendulum:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * \u221a(L/g)\n\nWhere T is the period, L is the length of the string, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the masses are identical and the gravitational fields are equal, the only factors affecting the period are the lengths of the strings.\n\nGiven that the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, we can write this relationship as:\n\n2\u03c0 * \u221a(L_B/g) = 2 * 2\u03c0 * \u221a(L_A/g)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n\u221a(L_B/g) = 2\u221a(L_A/g)\n\nL_B/g = 4(L_A/g)\n\nL_B = 4L_A\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: L_B = 4L_A",
