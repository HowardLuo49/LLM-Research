A nonrelativistic particle with a charge twice that of an electron moves through a uniform magnetic field. The field has a strength of \u03c0/4 tesla and is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. What is the particle\u2019s mass if it has a cyclotron frequency of 1,600 hertz?\nA: 2.5 * 10^-23 kg\nB: 1.2 * 10^-22 kg\nC: 3.3 * 10^-22 kg\nD: 5.0 * 10^-21 kg",

    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the mass of the particle moving through the uniform magnetic field with a given charge and cyclotron frequency, we must leverage the fundamental formula for the cyclotron frequency. The cyclotron frequency (f) is given by the equation:\n\nf = qB / (2 * \u03c0 * m)\n\nWhere q is the charge of the particle, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and m is the mass of the particle. Given that the particle has a charge twice that of an electron and a magnetic field strength of \u03c0/4 tesla, we can substitute these values into the equation and rearrange to solve for the mass of the particle.\n\nSubstituting q = 2e (where e is the charge of an electron) and B = \u03c0/4, we have:\n\n1600 = (2*1.6*10^-19 * \u03c0/4) / (2 * \u03c0 * m)\n\nSolving for m, we find:\n\nm = (2*1.6*10^-19 * \u03c0/4) / (2 * \u03c0 * 1600)\nm \u2248 2.5 * 10^-23 kg\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 2.5 * 10^-23 kg.",
