A nonrelativistic particle with a charge twice that of an electron moves through a uniform magnetic field. The field has a strength of \u03c0/4 tesla and is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. What is the particle\u2019s mass if it has a cyclotron frequency of 1,600 hertz?\nA: 2.5 * 10^-23 kg\nB: 1.2 * 10^-22 kg\nC: 3.3 * 10^-22 kg\nD: 5.0 * 10^-21 kg",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "First, we must recall the formula for the cyclotron frequency of a charged particle moving in a magnetic field:\n\n\u03c9 = qB / m\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the cyclotron frequency, q is the charge of the particle, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and m is the mass of the particle.\n\nGiven that the charge of the particle is twice that of an electron, we have q = 2e, where e is the elementary charge. Therefore, q = 2 * 1.6 * 10^-19 C = 3.2 * 10^-19 C.\n\nThe strength of the magnetic field is given as B = \u03c0/4 T.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula and rearrange for the mass m:\n\n1600 = (3.2 * 10^-19) * (\u03c0/4) / m\n1600 = 2.513 * 10^-19 / m\nm = 2.513 * 10^-19 / 1600\nm = 1.57 * 10^-22 kg\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed in the options provided.
