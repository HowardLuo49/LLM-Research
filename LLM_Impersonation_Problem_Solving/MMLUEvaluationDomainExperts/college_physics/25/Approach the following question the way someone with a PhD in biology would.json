In the case of making an n-type semiconductor, we are looking for ions that can donate an electron to the germanium lattice to create excess negative charge carriers.\n\nPhosphorus (P), antimony (Sb), and arsenic (As) can all be used as dopants in germanium to create an n-type semiconductor because they have an extra electron compared to germanium, which can be donated to the crystal lattice.\n\nBoron (B), on the other hand, has one fewer electron compared to germanium. When boron is used as a dopant, it will create excess positive charge carriers in the crystal lattice instead of negative charge carriers, making it unable to form an n-type semiconductor.
