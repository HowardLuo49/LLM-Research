To create an n-type semiconductor, we need to introduce an element that can donate an extra electron to the germanium lattice. This extra electron will create an excess of negative charge carriers, leading to an n-type conductivity.\n\nOf the ions listed, As, P, and Sb are all group V elements, meaning they have 5 valence electrons. When these ions are incorporated into the germanium lattice, they can donate an extra electron to the germanium, creating an n-type semiconductor.\n\nIn contrast, B is a group III element with only 3 valence electrons. When B is introduced into the germanium lattice, it cannot donate an extra electron to the germanium to create an n-type semiconductor.
