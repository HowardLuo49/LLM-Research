How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the kinetic energy of a particle accelerated to a speed of 0.6c. The kinetic energy is given by the equation KE = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor and is equal to 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2).\n\nGiven that the particle starts at rest, its initial kinetic energy is 0, and we are only concerned with the increase in kinetic energy needed to reach a speed of 0.6c. Thus, the work done on the particle is equal to this increase in kinetic energy.\n\nTo find the final Lorentz factor (\u03b3_f) at a speed of 0.6c, we substitute v = 0.6c into the Lorentz factor equation:\n\n\u03b3_f = 1/sqrt(1-(0.6)^2) \u2248 1.25\n\nNow we can calculate the increase in kinetic energy needed to reach this speed:\n\n\u0394KE = (\u03b3_f - 1)mc^2 = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.25mc^2.",
