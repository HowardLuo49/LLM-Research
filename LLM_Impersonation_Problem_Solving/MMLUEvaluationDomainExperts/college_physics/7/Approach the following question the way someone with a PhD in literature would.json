How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a literary perspective, one must first understand the concepts of work and energy in the context of particle acceleration. In this case, we are dealing with the acceleration of protons in cancer therapy to a speed of 0.6 times the speed of light (c).\n\nIn order to calculate the work required to accelerate a particle of mass m to a speed of 0.6c, one must apply the principles of kinetic energy and the work-energy theorem. If we assume the particle starts at rest, then all the work done on the particle must go towards increasing its kinetic energy.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a particle with mass m and velocity v is given by the formula KE = 0.5mv^2. In this case, the desired velocity is 0.6c, so the kinetic energy of the proton at this speed would be KE = 0.5m(0.6c)^2 = 0.18mc^2.\n\nThe work done on the particle is equal to the change in kinetic energy, which in this case is 0.18mc^2 (final KE) - 0 (initial KE) = 0.18mc^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.18mc^2.",
