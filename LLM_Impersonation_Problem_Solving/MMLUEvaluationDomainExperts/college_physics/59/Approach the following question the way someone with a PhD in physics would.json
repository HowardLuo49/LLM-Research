A reversible process is one in which the system and its surroundings can be returned to their original states after the process is completed, without leaving any net effect on the system or its surroundings.\n\nIn a reversible thermodynamic process, it is established through thermodynamic laws that the total change in entropy of the system and its surroundings is zero. This implies that statement D, which suggests that the entropy of the system and its environment must increase, is not true.\n\nStatement A, which states that there are no changes in the internal energy of the system, is also incorrect. While it is possible for the internal energy of the system to remain constant during a reversible process, it is not a rule that applies to all systems undergoing such processes.\n\nStatement B, which claims that the temperature of the system remains constant during the process, is also not universally true for all systems undergoing a reversible thermodynamic process. The temperature of the system may remain constant in some cases, but it is not a general rule for all systems.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is C: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged in any system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process.",
