    "gpt_response": "As a literature expert, I must acknowledge that this question falls outside my area of expertise. However, from a thermodynamics perspective, I can confidently state that the correct answer is B: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process. This is a fundamental characteristic of a reversible thermodynamic process, as it implies that the system is in thermal equilibrium throughout the process, leading to a constant temperature.",
