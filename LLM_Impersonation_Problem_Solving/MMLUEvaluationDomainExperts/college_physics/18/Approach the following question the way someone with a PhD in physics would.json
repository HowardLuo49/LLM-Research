    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider time dilation effects due to special relativity. The observer's reference frame is moving relative to the meter stick, so we need to take into account the time dilation factor.\n\nThe time dilation factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\nt' = t / \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere:\nt' = time in the observer's reference frame\nt = time in the meter stick's reference frame\nv = speed of the meter stick (0.8c)\nc = speed of light\n\nAssuming the length of the meter stick is 1 meter (for simplicity), the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer in its own reference frame is the length divided by the speed:\n\nt = 1 meter / (0.8c) = 1 / (0.8 * 3*10^8 m/s) = 4.167 x 10^-9 s = 4.167 ns\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the time dilation formula:\n\nt' = 4.167 ns / \u221a(1 - (0.8c)^2/c^2) = 4.167 ns / \u221a(1 - 0.64) = 4.167 ns / \u221a0.36 = 4.167 ns / 0.6 = 6.945 ns\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer in the observer's reference frame is approximately 6.945 ns. \n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is D: 6.9 ns.",
