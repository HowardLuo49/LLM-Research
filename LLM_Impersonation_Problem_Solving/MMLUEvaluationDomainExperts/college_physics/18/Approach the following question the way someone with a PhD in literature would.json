    "gpt_response": "As a proficient scholar in the field of literature with a PhD, I must delve into the realm of physics to tackle this question properly. The situation described can be interpreted through the principles of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation. \n\nWhen an object is moving close to the speed of light, its length contracts in the direction of motion and its internal clock runs slower compared to an observer at rest. In this case, a meter stick is moving at 0.8 times the speed of light (c) past an observer. \n\nFrom the perspective of the observer, the length of the meter stick will appear contracted due to its high velocity. This contraction factor is given by the Lorentz contraction formula, which is 1/\u03b3 where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor equal to (1 - v^2 / c^2)^0.5. Substituting the given values, the Lorentz factor is calculated to be 0.6.\n\nNext, the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer in the observer's reference frame can be determined by dividing the contracted length of the stick by its speed. The contracted length can be calculated as the original length of the meter stick (1 meter) multiplied by the Lorentz contraction factor, resulting in a contracted length of 0.6 meters.\n\nFinally, the time taken for the stick to pass the observer is determined by dividing the contracted length (0.6 meters) by the speed of the stick (0.8c). This calculation yields a time of 2.5 nanoseconds (ns). Thus, the correct answer is B: 2.5 ns.",
