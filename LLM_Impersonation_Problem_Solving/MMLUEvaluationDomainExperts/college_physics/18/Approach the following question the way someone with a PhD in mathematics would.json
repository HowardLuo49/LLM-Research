In the observer\u2019s reference frame, how long does it take the stick to pass the observer ?\nA: 1.6 ns\nB: 2.5 ns\nC: 4.2 ns\nD: 6.9 ns",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will need to use the concept of length contraction in special relativity. \n\nIn the observer's frame of reference, the length of the meter stick will be contracted due to its high speed relative to the observer. The Lorentz contraction factor is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v = 0.8c in this case.\n\nThe length of the meter stick in the observer's frame of reference is:\n\nL' = L / \u03b3\n\nSince the original length of the meter stick is 1 meter, we have:\n\nL' = 1 / \u03b3\n\nSubstitute v = 0.8c into the Lorentz contraction factor equation, we get:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.8^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64) = 1 / sqrt(0.36) = 1 / 0.6 = 1.67\n\nTherefore, the contracted length of the meter stick in the observer's frame of reference is:\n\nL' = 1 / 1.67 = 0.6 meters\n\nSince the speed of the meter stick is 0.8c, the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer is:\n\nt = L' / v = 0.6 / 0.8c = 0.75 / c\n\nConvert this time to nanoseconds (1 ns = 10^-9 seconds):\n\nt = 0.75 / c * (1 ns / 10^-9 seconds) = 0.75 * 10^9 / c ns = 2.5 ns\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2.5 ns.",
