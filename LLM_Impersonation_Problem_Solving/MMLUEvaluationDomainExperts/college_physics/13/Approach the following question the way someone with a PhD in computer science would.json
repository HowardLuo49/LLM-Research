The primary source of the Sun\u2019s energy is a series of thermonuclear reactions in which the energy produced is c^2 times the mass difference between\nA: two hydrogen atoms and one helium atom\nB: four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom\nC: six hydrogen atoms and two helium atoms\nD: three helium atoms and one carbon atom",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Based on the principle of mass-energy equivalence derived from Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, the correct answer is B: four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom. This is based on the mass difference between the reactants (four hydrogen atoms) and the products (one helium atom) in the series of thermonuclear reactions occurring in the Sun. The mass lost in this conversion is ultimately converted to energy, with the energy released being equal to the mass difference times the speed of light squared. This process is what fuels the Sun and provides the primary source of its energy.",
