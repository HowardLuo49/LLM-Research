The key reaction in the Sun's core is the fusion of four hydrogen atoms to form one helium atom, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays. This is known as the proton-proton chain reaction, which is the dominant energy-producing process in stars like the Sun.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom. This reaction results in the release of energy that is equivalent to the mass difference between the reactants and products multiplied by the speed of light squared (E=mc^2). This process powers the Sun and provides the energy that sustains life on Earth.",
