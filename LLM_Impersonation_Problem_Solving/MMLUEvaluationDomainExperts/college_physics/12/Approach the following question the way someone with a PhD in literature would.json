The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring which of the following properties?\nA: Specific heat\nB: Thermal conductivity\nC: Electrical resistivity\nD: Hall coefficient",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In doped semiconductors, the sign of the charge carriers can be determined by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a physical property that characterizes the behavior of charge carriers in a material when subjected to a magnetic field. By measuring the Hall coefficient, researchers can determine whether the majority charge carriers in a doped semiconductor are positive (holes) or negative (electrons). This information is crucial for understanding the electrical conductivity and overall behavior of doped semiconductors in electronic devices.",
