The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring which of the following properties?\nA: Specific heat\nB: Thermal conductivity\nC: Electrical resistivity\nD: Hall coefficient",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In considering the sign of charge carriers in a doped semiconductor, one must turn to the fundamental principles of solid-state physics and semiconductor material science. Doping introduces impurities into the semiconductor crystal lattice, thereby altering the conductivity properties of the material. The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring its electrical resistivity. The electrical resistivity is a critical parameter that directly reflects the type of charge carriers present in the material, whether they are majority carriers (electrons or holes) or minority carriers. Additionally, the Hall coefficient, which characterizes the behavior of charge carriers in a magnetic field, can also provide valuable information regarding the sign of the charge carriers. By employing sophisticated experimental techniques and theoretical models, researchers can unravel the complex behavior of charge carriers in doped semiconductors and gain deeper insights into the underlying physical phenomena at play.",
