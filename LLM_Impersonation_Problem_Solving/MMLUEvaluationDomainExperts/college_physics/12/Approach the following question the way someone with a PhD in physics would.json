In a doped semiconductor, the sign of the charge carriers can be determined by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a property that characterizes the sign of the charge carriers in a material. By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the current flow in the semiconductor, the Hall voltage generated allows one to deduce whether the charge carriers are positive (holes) or negative (electrons). Therefore, the correct answer is D: Hall coefficient.",
