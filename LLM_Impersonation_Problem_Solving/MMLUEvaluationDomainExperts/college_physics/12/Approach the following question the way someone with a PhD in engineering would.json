The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring which of the following properties?\nA: Specific heat\nB: Thermal conductivity\nC: Electrical resistivity\nD: Hall coefficient",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a parameter that characterizes the nature of charge carriers in a material. By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the current flow in the semiconductor and measuring the voltage generated perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field, one can determine the sign of the charge carriers (positive or negative) and their concentration. This information is crucial for understanding the electrical properties of the doped semiconductor and designing electronic devices based on it. Specific heat, thermal conductivity, and electrical resistivity are not directly related to determining the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor.",
