The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by understanding the concept of the Doppler effect in sound waves. The Doppler effect refers to the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the source of the wave.\n\nIn this scenario, the police car is moving towards a wall at a speed of 3.5 m/s. The speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz. When the car is moving towards the wall, the sound waves are compressed, leading to a higher frequency of the sound waves heard by the driver.\n\nTo calculate the frequency of the echo heard by the driver, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect:\nf' = (c +/- v) / (c +/- vs) * f\nwhere f' is the frequency heard, c is the speed of sound, v is the speed of the observer, vs is the speed of the source, and f is the original frequency.\n\nPlugging in the values:\nf' = (350 + 3.5) / (350 - 3.5) * 600\nf' = 353.5 / 346.5 * 600\nf' = 1.0204 * 600\nf' = 612.24 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the echo heard by the driver is closest to option D: 612 Hz.",
