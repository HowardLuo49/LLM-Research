The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem like someone with a PhD in computer science, we first need to understand the concept of the Doppler effect and how it relates to the scenario described. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave.\n\nIn this case, the police car is moving towards a wall, emitting a siren with a frequency of 600 Hz. As the car moves towards the wall, the sound waves are compressed, leading to a higher frequency being heard by the driver. When the sound wave reflects off the wall and comes back towards the car, the frequency is further compressed due to the car's motion away from the wall.\n\nUsing the Doppler effect formula for a moving observer:\n\nf' = f * ((v + vo) / (v + vs))\n\nWhere:\nf' = frequency heard by the observer\nf = frequency of the source (600 Hz)\nv = speed of sound (350 m/s)\nvo = speed of the observer (3.5 m/s)\nvs = speed of the source (0 m/s)\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\nf' = 600 * ((350 + 3.5) / (350 - 3.5))\nf' = 600 * (353.5 / 346.5)\nf' = 612 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver would hear the echo at a frequency closest to 612 Hz. So the answer is D: 612 Hz.",
