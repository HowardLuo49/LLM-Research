The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to consider the Doppler effect, which describes the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In this case, the observer is the driver of the police car and the source of the wave is the siren. \n\nWhen the car is moving towards the wall, the frequency heard by the driver will be higher than the actual frequency of the siren. This is because the sound waves are being compressed (shortened) as the car moves towards the wall. \n\nThe formula for the observed frequency (f') of a source moving towards an observer is given by:\n\nf' = f * (v + vo) / (v + vs)\n\nwhere f is the original frequency of the siren (600 Hz), v is the speed of sound (350 m/s), vo is the speed of the observer (3.5 m/s), and vs is the speed of the source (in this case, 0 m/s as the siren is stationary). \n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf' = 600 * (350 + 3.5) / (350 + 0)\nf' = 600 * 353.5 / 350\nf' = 604.285 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency closest to 612 Hz. The correct answer is D.",
