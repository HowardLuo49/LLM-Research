The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a literary scholar, I would approach this question by analyzing the concept of sound and its interactions with motion and the environment. In this scenario, the police car moving towards a wall emits a siren sound at a frequency of 600 Hz. As the sound waves travel towards the wall, they are reflected back towards the car, creating an echo.\n\nThe speed of the police car is given as 3.5 m/s, while the speed of sound in the air is 350 m/s. This means that the car is moving towards the wall at a speed approximately 10 times faster than the speed of sound. As a result, the frequency of the siren heard by the driver will be slightly higher than the original frequency of 600 Hz.\n\nTo calculate the frequency of the echo heard by the driver, we can use the Doppler effect equation:\nf' = f * (v + vo)/(v + vs)\nwhere f' is the frequency heard by the driver, f is the original frequency of the siren, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer (positive when approaching the source), and vs is the speed of the source of the sound.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we find:\nf' = 600 * (350 + 3.5)/(350 - 3.5) \u2248 612 Hz\n\nTherefore, based on this calculation, the driver would hear the echo at a frequency closest to 612 Hz, which corresponds to option D.",
