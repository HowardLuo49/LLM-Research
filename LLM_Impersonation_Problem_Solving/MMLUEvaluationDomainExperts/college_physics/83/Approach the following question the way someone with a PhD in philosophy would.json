The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In considering this scenario, we must first recognize the implications of the Doppler effect on the frequency of the siren as heard by the driver. The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency of a wave when there is relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.\n\nGiven that the car is moving towards the wall at a speed of 3.5 m/s, the frequency of the siren heard by the driver will be Doppler-shifted. The formula to calculate the observed frequency in this situation is:\n\nf' = f(v + vo)/(v + vs)\n\nWhere:\nf' = observed frequency\nf = original frequency of the siren (600 Hz)\nv = speed of sound (350 m/s)\nvo = speed of the observer (3.5 m/s)\nvs = speed of the source (speed of the siren, not given)\n\nBy substituting the given values into the formula, we can calculate the observed frequency as:\n\nf' = 600(350 + 3.5)/(350 + vs)\nf' = 612 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo of the siren at a frequency closest to 612 Hz, which corresponds to option D.",
