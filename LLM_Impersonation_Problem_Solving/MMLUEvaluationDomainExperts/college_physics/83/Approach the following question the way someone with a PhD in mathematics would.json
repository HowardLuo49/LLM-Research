The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in mathematics, we can approach this problem by first understanding the concept of the Doppler effect. \n\nThe Doppler effect occurs when there is relative motion between the source of a wave (in this case, the police car) and the observer of the wave (in this case, the driver). The frequency heard by the observer will be different from the frequency emitted by the source due to this relative motion.\n\nIn this scenario, the police car is moving towards a wall, which acts as a stationary reflector of sound. As the sound waves from the siren travel towards the wall and back to the car, the frequency heard by the driver will be different from the original frequency of the siren.\n\nThe formula to calculate the frequency heard by the driver due to the Doppler effect is given by:\n\nf' = f * (v + vo)/(v + vs),\n\nwhere:\nf' is the frequency heard by the observer,\nf is the frequency emitted by the source (600 Hz in this case),\nv is the speed of sound (350 m/s),\nvo is the speed of the observer (3.5 m/s),\nvs is the speed of the source (equal to vo in this case, as the source is the car itself).\n\nPlugging in the values given:\n\nf' = 600 * (350 + 3.5)/(350 - 3.5) = 600 * (353.5/346.5) \u2248 610 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the frequency heard by the driver is closest to 612 Hz, so the correct answer is D.",
