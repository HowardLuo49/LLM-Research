Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar of literature, it is important to note that the question presented pertains to physics, specifically the concept of interference patterns in the context of optics. In this scenario, we are dealing with the phenomenon of double-slit interference, where light waves passing through two narrow slits interfere with each other, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes on a screen.\n\nThe separation of the bright fringes is determined by the wavelength of the light, the distance between the slits, and the distance to the screen. In the given scenario, the slits are separated by 0.5 micrometers and the bright fringes are separated by 1.0 millimeter on the screen.\n\nWhen the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength of the light is halved. Since the separation of the bright fringes is directly proportional to the wavelength of the light, doubling the frequency would result in halving the separation of the bright fringes.\n\nTherefore, if the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the separation of the bright fringes would be 0.5 millimeters, which is option B.",
