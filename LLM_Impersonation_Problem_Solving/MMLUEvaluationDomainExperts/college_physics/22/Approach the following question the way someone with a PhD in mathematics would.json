Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a mathematician with a PhD, we need to consider the wave properties of light and apply the concept of interference. When light passes through two slits, it produces a pattern of bright and dark fringes on a screen due to interference.\n\nThe separation of the bright fringes on the screen is given by the equation:\n\nd*sin(theta) = m*lambda\n\nWhere:\nd = separation between the slits (0.5 micrometer = 0.5 x 10^-6 meters)\ntheta = angle of diffraction\nm = order of the fringe\nlambda = wavelength of light\n\nIn this case, we are given that the separation of the bright fringes on the screen is 1.0 millimeter = 1 x 10^-3 meters.\n\nNow, if the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength of light will be halved. This implies that lambda' = lambda/2.\n\nSubstitute lambda' into the equation:\n\nd*sin(theta) = m*(lambda/2)\n\nSince the separation of the bright fringes is directly proportional to the wavelength, the new separation will be halved.\n\nTherefore, the separation of the bright fringes when the frequency of the laser light is doubled will be 0.5 millimeters = 0.5 mm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: 0.5 mm",
