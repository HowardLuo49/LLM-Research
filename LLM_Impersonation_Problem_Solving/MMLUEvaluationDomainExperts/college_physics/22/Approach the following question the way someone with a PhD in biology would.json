Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I must clarify that this question pertains more to physics than biology. However, as a scientist, I can still approach it with a scientific mindset.\n\nThe separation of the bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394y = \u03bbL / d\n\nWhere:\n\u0394y = separation of bright fringes on screen\n\u03bb = wavelength of light\nL = distance from the slits to the screen\nd = separation of the slits\n\nSince the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength of the light will be halved. Therefore, if we double the frequency, we halve the wavelength.\n\nIf the original separation of the bright fringes is 1.0 mm, we can use the formula to calculate the new separation:\n\n\u0394y2 = (\u03bb/2)(L/d)\n\u0394y2 = (1/2)\u0394y\n\u0394y2 = 0.5 mm\n\nTherefore, the separation of the bright fringes when the frequency of the laser light is doubled will be 0.5 mm. Option B is the correct answer.",
