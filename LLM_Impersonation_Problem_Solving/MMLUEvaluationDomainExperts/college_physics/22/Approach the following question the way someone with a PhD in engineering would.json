Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must consider the principles of diffraction and interference. When light passes through a pair of narrow slits, it creates a pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes on a screen due to the interference of the diffracted waves. The separation of these fringes can be calculated using the equation: \n\nd*sin(\u03b8) = m*\u03bb\n\nWhere d is the separation of the slits, \u03b8 is the angle of diffraction, m is the order of the fringe, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the light. \n\nGiven that the separation of the slits (d) is 0.5 micrometers and the separation of the bright fringes on the screen is 1.0 millimeter, we can use this information to calculate the wavelength of the light. \n\n1.0 mm = (m*\u03bb) / sin(\u03b8)\n\nBy doubling the frequency of the laser light, the wavelength will be halved. Therefore, the new separation of the bright fringes can be calculated by substituting the new wavelength into the equation:\n\n1.0 mm = (m*(\u03bb/2)) / sin(\u03b8)\n\nSolving for the new separation of the bright fringes will give us the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the separation of the bright fringes on the screen will be 0.25 mm (Option A) when the frequency of the laser light is doubled.",
