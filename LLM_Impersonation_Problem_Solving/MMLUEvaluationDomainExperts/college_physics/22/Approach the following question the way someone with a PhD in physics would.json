Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question like someone with a PhD in physics, we need to consider the principles of interference patterns and the double-slit experiment. \n\nThe separation of bright fringes in a double-slit interference pattern is given by the equation: \nX = \u03bb L / d\n\nwhere X is the separation of fringes, \u03bb is the wavelength of light, L is the distance between the slits and the screen, and d is the distance between the slits.\n\nGiven that the separation of bright fringes when the frequency of the laser light is constant is 1.0 mm, we can use this information to find the wavelength of the light. \n\nNow, as the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength of the light would be halved (since speed of light is constant). So, the new wavelength would be \u03bb/2. \n\nUsing the same equation as before and plugging in the new wavelength, distance between slits, and distance to the screen, we can calculate the new separation of the bright fringes: \nX' = (\u03bb/2) L / d\n\nX' = (0.5\u03bb) L /d \n\nSince we know that X is 1.0 mm, we can set up the equation: \n1.0 mm = (\u03bb) L / d \n\nAnd since \u03bb = 2(\u03bb/2), we know that X' = 0.5 mm.\n\nTherefore, the separation of the bright fringes when the frequency of the laser light is doubled would be 0.5 mm. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 0.5 mm.",
