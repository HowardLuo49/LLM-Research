Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can use the double-slit interference formula:\n\nwavelength * distance between slits / distance to screen = distance between fringes\n\nGiven that the distance between slits is 0.5 micrometers, and the separation of bright fringes is 1.0 millimeter, we can calculate the wavelength of the laser light using the formula:\n\nwavelength = distance between fringes * distance to screen / distance between slits\n\nwavelength = (1.0 * 10^-3 m) * (1.0 m) / (0.5 * 10^-6 m) = 2 * 10^-3 m = 2 mm\n\nNow, if the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the new wavelength will be halved:\n\nnew wavelength = wavelength / 2 = 2 mm / 2 = 1 mm\n\nFinally, we can calculate the separation of bright fringes using the new wavelength:\n\nnew distance between fringes = new wavelength * distance between slits / distance to screen = 1 mm * (0.5 * 10^-6 m) / (1.0 m) = 0.5 * 10^-6 m = 0.5 mm\n\nTherefore, the separation of the bright fringes when the frequency of the laser light is doubled is 0.5 mm, which corresponds to option B.",
