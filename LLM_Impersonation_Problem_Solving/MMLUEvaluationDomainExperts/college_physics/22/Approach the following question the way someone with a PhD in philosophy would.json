Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In contemplating this question, one must first consider the principles of wave optics. The small separation between the slits suggests that we are dealing with the phenomenon of diffraction, where light waves passing through the slits interfere constructively or destructively to produce a pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen. The separation between these fringes is directly related to the wavelength of the light, as well as the distance between the slits.\n\nWhen the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength of the light will be halved due to the inverse relationship between frequency and wavelength in electromagnetic radiation. As the separation of the fringes is directly related to the wavelength, halving the wavelength will result in halving the separation of the fringes. Therefore, if the original separation of the bright fringes is 1.0 mm, doubling the frequency of the laser light will lead to a separation of 0.5 mm. Hence, the correct answer is option B: 0.5 mm.",
