    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we must consider the principles of Newtonian mechanics in order to accurately determine the magnitude of the applied force on the box. The initial speed of the box, in the absence of external forces, is 1 m/s. When the constant force is applied, the box travels a distance of 5 m at an increased speed of 2 m/s before the force is removed. \n\nBy considering the change in kinetic energy of the box, we can determine the work done by the applied force. The initial kinetic energy of the box is given by 0.5 * m * v_initial^2, where m is the mass of the box (10 kg) and v_initial is the initial speed of the box (1 m/s). The final kinetic energy of the box is given by 0.5 * m * v_final^2, where v_final is the final speed of the box (2 m/s). The work done by the applied force is the difference between these two kinetic energies.\n\nUsing the work-energy principle, we can calculate the magnitude of the applied force by dividing the work done by the applied force by the distance over which the force was applied. Therefore, we reject options A and B because the magnitude of the applied force must be greater than 2 N in order for the box to reach a final speed of 2 m/s after traveling 5 m with the force applied. By analyzing the calculations more deeply, we can determine that the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, option C, and this is the correct answer.",
