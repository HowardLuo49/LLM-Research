    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem from a mathematical perspective, we can use the principles of Newton's laws of motion and conservation of energy.\n\nInitially, the box has a kinetic energy of (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s)^2 = 5 J. When the constant force is applied and the box travels 5 m, the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box. This can be expressed as:\n\nForce x distance = change in kinetic energy\n\nF x 5 = (1/2)(10 kg)(2 m/s)^2 - (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s)^2\nF x 5 = 20 J - 5 J\nF x 5 = 15 J\nF = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which is option C.",
