    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of classical mechanics. \n\nFirst, we calculate the initial kinetic energy of the box using the formula:\n\nKE_initial = 0.5 * m * v_initial^2\nKE_initial = 0.5 * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2\nKE_initial = 5 J\n\nNext, we calculate the final kinetic energy of the box after the force is applied and it travels 5 m using the formula:\n\nKE_final = 0.5 * m * v_final^2\nKE_final = 0.5 * 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2\nKE_final = 20 J\n\nThe change in kinetic energy of the box is equal to the work done by the force:\n\nWork = KE_final - KE_initial\nWork = 20 J - 5 J\nWork = 15 J\n\nSince work is equal to force times distance, we can calculate the magnitude of the applied force using the formula:\n\nForce = Work / distance\nForce = 15 J / 5 m\nForce = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 3 N.",
