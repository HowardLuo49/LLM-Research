    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to use the work-energy principle. The work-energy principle states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. The work done by the constant force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the box is given by:\n\nKE1 = 0.5 * m * v1^2 = 0.5 * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 5 J\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the box is given by:\n\nKE2 = 0.5 * m * v2^2 = 0.5 * 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2 = 20 J\n\nThe work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy:\n\nW = KE2 - KE1\n\nW = 20 J - 5 J = 15 J\n\nThe work done by the force can also be calculated as the force multiplied by the distance the box traveled with the force applied:\n\nW = F * d\n\n15 J = F * 5 m\n\nF = 15 J / 5 m\n\nF = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C.",
