    "gpt_response": "In the diamond structure of elemental carbon, the nearest neighbors of each C atom lie at the corners of a tetrahedron. This configuration is due to the sp3 hybridization of the carbon atoms, which leads to the formation of four equivalent \u03c3-bonds with neighboring carbon atoms. This tetrahedral arrangement is a key characteristic of diamond's structure, providing it with its exceptional hardness and strength.",
