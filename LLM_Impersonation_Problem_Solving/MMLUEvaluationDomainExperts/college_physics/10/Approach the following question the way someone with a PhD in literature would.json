    "gpt_response": "In the diamond structure of elemental carbon, the nearest neighbors of each carbon atom lie at the corners of a tetrahedron. This geometric arrangement is a fundamental feature of the diamond lattice, characterized by each carbon atom forming covalent bonds with four neighboring carbon atoms in a tetrahedral configuration. This highly symmetrical and stable structure contributes to the unique properties of diamond, including its exceptional hardness and high thermal conductivity. Therefore, the correct answer is D: tetrahedron.",
