    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must consider the molecular structure of elemental carbon within the diamond lattice. In the diamond structure, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral configuration. This results in a three-dimensional network of carbon atoms arranged in a diamond-shaped pattern. Therefore, the nearest neighbors of each carbon atom in the diamond structure lie at the corners of a tetrahedron. Therefore, the correct answer is D: tetrahedron.",
