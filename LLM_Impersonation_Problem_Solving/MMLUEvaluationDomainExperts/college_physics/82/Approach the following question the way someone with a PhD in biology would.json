The quantum number ml (magnetic quantum number) describes the orientation of the orbital in space. It can take integer values from -l to +l, where l is the angular momentum quantum number.\n\nIn this case, the electron is in the l = 2 state. Therefore, the ml values can range from -2 to +2, giving us a total of 2l+1 = 2(2) + 1 = 5 possible values for ml.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 5.",
