The quantum number l represents the azimuthal quantum number, which determines the shape of the electron's orbital. The possible values of l for a given principal quantum number n are integers ranging from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the l = 2 state, the possible values of the quantum number m_l are integers ranging from -l to l. In this case, l = 2, so the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of allowed values of the quantum number m_l for an electron in the l = 2 state is 5.
