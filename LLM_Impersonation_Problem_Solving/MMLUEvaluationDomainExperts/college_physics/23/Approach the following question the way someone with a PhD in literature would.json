Assume that the solar flux at Earth\u2019s surface is 1,000 W/m^2 and that the sunlight is normal to a completely reflecting surface with an area of 3 m^2. What is the total radiation force exerted on the surface?\nA: 2 x 10^-6 N\nB: 1 x 10^-5 N\nC: 2 x 10^-5 N\nD: 3 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand the concept of radiation pressure. The pressure exerted by electromagnetic radiation on a surface is determined by the intensity of the radiation and is given by the formula:\n\nPressure = (Intensity of radiation) / (speed of light)\n\nIn this case, the intensity of the radiation is given by the solar flux at Earth's surface, which is 1,000 W/m^2. The speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the pressure exerted by the radiation on the completely reflecting surface with an area of 3 m^2 can be calculated using the formula:\n\nPressure = (1,000 W/m^2) / (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 3.33 x 10^-6 N/m^2\n\nTo find the total force exerted on the surface, we must multiply the pressure by the surface area:\n\nTotal force = Pressure x Area = 3.33 x 10^-6 N/m^2 x 3 m^2 = 1 x 10^-5 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 x 10^-5 N.",
