Assume that the solar flux at Earth\u2019s surface is 1,000 W/m^2 and that the sunlight is normal to a completely reflecting surface with an area of 3 m^2. What is the total radiation force exerted on the surface?\nA: 2 x 10^-6 N\nB: 1 x 10^-5 N\nC: 2 x 10^-5 N\nD: 3 N",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total radiation force exerted on the surface, we first need to find the total power incident on the surface. The total power is the product of the solar flux and the area:\n\nPower = Solar flux x Area\nPower = 1,000 W/m^2 x 3 m^2\nPower = 3,000 W\n\nNext, we need to consider that the radiation force exerted on a perfectly reflecting surface is given by the formula:\n\nForce = 2 x (Power / c)\n\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). Substituting in the values:\n\nForce = 2 x (3,000 W / 3 x 10^8 m/s)\nForce = 2 x (1 x 10^-5 N)\nForce = 2 x 10^-5 N\n\nTherefore, the total radiation force exerted on the surface is 2 x 10^-5 N, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
