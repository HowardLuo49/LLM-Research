Assume that the solar flux at Earth\u2019s surface is 1,000 W/m^2 and that the sunlight is normal to a completely reflecting surface with an area of 3 m^2. What is the total radiation force exerted on the surface?\nA: 2 x 10^-6 N\nB: 1 x 10^-5 N\nC: 2 x 10^-5 N\nD: 3 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total radiation force exerted on the surface, we first need to determine the total power received by the surface. The power received by the surface can be calculated by multiplying the solar flux (1000 W/m^2) by the area of the surface (3 m^2).\n\nPower = Solar flux x Area\nPower = 1000 W/m^2 x 3 m^2\nPower = 3000 W\n\nNext, we need to convert this power to force. The force exerted on the surface can be calculated by dividing the power by the speed of light (c). The speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nForce = Power / c\nForce = 3000 W / (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nForce = 1 x 10^-5 N\n\nTherefore, the total radiation force exerted on the surface is approximately 1 x 10^-5 N, which corresponds to option B.",
