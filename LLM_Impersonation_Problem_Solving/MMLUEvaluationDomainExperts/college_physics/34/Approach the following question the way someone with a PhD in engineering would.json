    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in engineering, we need to consider the principles of statistical mechanics and the energy distribution of a harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the average total energy of a harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T can be calculated using the equipartition theorem. The equipartition theorem states that in thermal equilibrium, each degree of freedom of a system will have an average energy of (1/2)kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n\nFor a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, there are three degrees of freedom (one for each spatial dimension), so the average total energy of the oscillator will be the sum of the average energy in each degree of freedom. Therefore, the average total energy of the oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a temperature reservoir at temperature T will be:\n\nAverage total energy = (3 degrees of freedom) x (1/2) kT\nAverage total energy = (3/2) kT\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: (3/2) k T.",
