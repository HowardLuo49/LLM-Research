In this question, we are considering a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a temperature reservoir at temperature T.\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, the average energy of the oscillator can be calculated using the equipartition theorem, which states that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the average energy, where k is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFor a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, there are three quadratic degrees of freedom, corresponding to the three spatial dimensions.
