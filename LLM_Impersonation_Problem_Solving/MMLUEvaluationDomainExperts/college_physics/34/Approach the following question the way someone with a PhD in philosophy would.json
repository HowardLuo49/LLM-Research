We must first understand the concept of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the context of thermodynamics and how it interacts with a temperature reservoir.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the energy of a harmonic oscillator can be described by the equipartition theorem, which states that each quadratic degree of freedom contributes 1/2 kT to the total energy of a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. For a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, there are three quadratic degrees of freedom, so the total energy is expected to be (3/2) kT.\n\nTherefore, the average total energy of the oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a temperature reservoir at temperature T is option C: (3/2) kT. This result emerges from the foundational principles of statistical mechanics and the relationship between energy, temperature, and the degrees of freedom of the system.",
