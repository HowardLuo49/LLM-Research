    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first understanding the basics of the photoelectric effect and Einstein's theory. The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when it is exposed to light. Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect states that the energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency of the incoming light, not its amplitude.\n\nIn the context of this question, we need to understand the relationship between the work function of the metal, the frequency of the incident light, and the potential difference needed to stop the emitted electrons.\n\nEinstein's theory predicts that the work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency of the incident light, not its wavelength. This means that as the frequency of the light increases, the work function of the metal also increases.\n\nFurthermore, the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is not a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. Instead, it is directly related to the energy of the emitted electrons, which is determined by the frequency of the incident light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be:\nA: work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency.",
