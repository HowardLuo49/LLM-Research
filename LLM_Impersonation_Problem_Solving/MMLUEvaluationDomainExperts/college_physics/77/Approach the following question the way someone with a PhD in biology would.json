In this phenomenon, when light of sufficient frequency shines on a metal surface, electrons are ejected from the metal. \n\nEinstein's theory of the photoelectric effect states that the energy of the ejected electrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light. This means that the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons, known as the stopping potential, is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. \n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer to the question would be D: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. This is in line with Einstein's theory and the principles of the photoelectric effect.",
