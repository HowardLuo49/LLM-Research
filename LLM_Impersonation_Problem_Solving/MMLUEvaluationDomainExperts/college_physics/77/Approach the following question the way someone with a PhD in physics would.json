    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by first acknowledging that Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect revolutionized our understanding of the behavior of light and electrons. In this theory, Einstein proposed that light behaves as both a particle and a wave, and that the energy of a single photon is directly proportional to its frequency. \n\nBased on this understanding, we can deduce that the answer to the question is option D: the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. This is because the energy of the ejected electrons is proportional to the frequency of the incident light, and the stopping potential needed to counteract this kinetic energy is also directly related to the frequency of the light.\n\nTherefore, as a physicist with a PhD, I would confidently choose option D as the correct answer based on the principles of Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect.",
