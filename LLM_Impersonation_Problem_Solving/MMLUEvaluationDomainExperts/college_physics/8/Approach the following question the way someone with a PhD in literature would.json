    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Certainly, this question pertains to the wave-particle duality of matter, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. De Broglie's hypothesis posits that all matter exhibits both particle-like and wave-like properties. Specifically, he proposed that the wavelength of a wave associated with a particle is inversely proportional to its momentum, with the proportionality constant being Planck's constant, denoted by \"h\". Therefore, the correct answer to the question is A: Planck's constant. This constant plays a crucial role in determining the wave nature of particles and is essential in understanding the behavior of quantum systems.",
