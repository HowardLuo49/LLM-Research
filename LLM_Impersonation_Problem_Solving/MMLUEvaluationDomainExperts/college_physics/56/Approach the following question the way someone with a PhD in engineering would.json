At one instant, the particle\u2019s speed is 10 meters per second and is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second squared.

    "gpt_response": "To find the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors of the particle, we first need to determine the direction of the velocity and acceleration vectors at the given instant. \n\nThe velocity vector of a particle moving in a circle is always tangent to the circle. Since the particle's speed is increasing, the acceleration vector of the particle is directed towards the center of the circle. This means that the acceleration vector is in the radial direction towards the center of the circle.\n\nNow, considering the position of the acceleration vector in the radial direction and the velocity vector tangent to the circle, we can calculate the angle between them using the relationship between the two vectors:\n\ncos(theta) = (v dot a) / (|v||a|)\n\nHere, v and a are the velocity and acceleration vectors, respectively.\n\nSince the velocity vector and acceleration vector are perpendicular to each other (in the radial and tangential directions, respectively), their dot product is 0. Therefore, cos(theta) = 0, and theta = 90\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the particle\u2019s velocity and acceleration vectors is 90\u00b0, which corresponds to option E: 90\u00b0.",
