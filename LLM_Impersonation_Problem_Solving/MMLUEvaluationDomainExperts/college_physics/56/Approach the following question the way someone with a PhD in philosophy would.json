The angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors, known as the angle of tangential divergence, is crucial in understanding the dynamics of the particle's motion.\n\nBy applying the principles of circular motion and vector analysis, a philosopher with a PhD in philosophy would be able to determine that the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors in this scenario is 90\u00b0. This conclusion is reached by recognizing the perpendicular relationship between the velocity and acceleration vectors in circular motion, where the angle of tangential divergence is always 90\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is not provided among the options given.
