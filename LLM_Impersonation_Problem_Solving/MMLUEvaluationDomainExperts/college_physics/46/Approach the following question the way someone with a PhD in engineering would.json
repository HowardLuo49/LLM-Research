The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first identifying the relevant formula to calculate the frequency of the echo heard by the driver. The formula for the frequency of reflected sound received by a moving observer is given by:\n\nf' = [(v +/- vo) / (v - vs)] * f\n\nWhere:\nf' = frequency of the reflected sound\nv = speed of sound in air (350 m/s)\nvo = speed of the observer (3.5 m/s)\nvs = speed of the source (speed of sound in air, 350 m/s)\nf = frequency of the source (600 Hz)\n\nIn this case, the police car is moving towards the wall, so we use the formula with a positive sign for the observer's speed:\n\nf' = [(350 + 3.5) / (350 - 0)] * 600\nf' = (353.5 / 350) * 600\nf' = 1.0107 * 600\nf' \u2248 606 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the echo heard by the driver is closest to option B: 606 Hz.",
