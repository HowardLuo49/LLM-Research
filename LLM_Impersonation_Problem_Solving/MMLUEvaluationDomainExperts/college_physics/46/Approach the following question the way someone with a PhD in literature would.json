The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar well-versed in the nuances of literature, it is essential to approach this question with an understanding of the concepts of physics and acoustics. The scenario presented involves a moving police car emitting a siren sound, which then bounces off a wall and is heard as an echo by the driver. The frequency of the siren is given as 600 Hz, and the speed of sound is provided as 350 m/s.\n\nWhen the police car is moving towards the wall, the sound waves get compressed in the direction of motion, leading to an increase in the frequency of the sound heard by the driver. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect. On the other hand, when the sound waves bounce back off the wall and return to the moving car, they experience the opposite effect, causing a decrease in frequency.\n\nTo calculate the frequency of the echo heard by the driver, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect:\n\nf' = f((v + v_o)/(v + v_s))\n\nWhere:\nf' = frequency heard by the observer\nf = frequency of the source (600 Hz)\nv = speed of sound (350 m/s)\nv_o = speed of the observer (3.5 m/s)\nv_s = speed of the source (350 m/s)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nf' = 600((350 + 3.5)/(350 + 350))\nf' = 600(353.5/700)\nf' = 600(0.505)\nf' \u2248 303 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 303 Hz. Looking at the answer choices provided, none of them align with this calculated frequency. As a literature scholar, I would suggest revisiting the calculations or assumptions made in order to accurately determine the frequency of the echo heard by the driver.",
