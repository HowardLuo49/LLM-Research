The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "From a philosophical perspective, we can approach this problem by considering the phenomenology of perception and our understanding of sound waves. The driver's perception of the echo of the siren is mediated by the physical properties of sound waves and the motion of the police car.\n\nIn this scenario, the driver hears the echo of the siren as a result of sound waves reflecting off the wall and returning to the car. The frequency of the echo is determined by the Doppler effect, which causes a shift in frequency due to the relative motion between the source of the sound (the siren) and the observer (the driver).\n\nGiven the speed of the car and the speed of sound, we can calculate the frequency of the echo using the Doppler effect equation:\n\nf' = f((v + vo) / (v + vs))\n\nwhere:\nf' = frequency of the echo\nf = frequency of the siren\nv = speed of sound\nvo = speed of the observer (positive if moving towards the source)\nvs = speed of the source\n\nPlugging in the values given:\n\nf' = 600((350 + 3.5) / (350 - 3.5))\nf' = 600(353.5 / 346.5)\nf' = 612 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency closest to C: 612 Hz. This frequency reflects the philosophical understanding of the interplay between perception, physical phenomena, and motion in the experience of hearing a sound echo.",
