The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the frequency shift caused by the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect formula for sound is given by:\n\nf' = f*(v +/- v_s) / (v -/+ v_r)\n\nwhere:\nf' = observed frequency\nf = emitted frequency\nv = speed of sound\nv_s = speed of the source\nv_r = speed of the receiver\n\nIn this case, the driver is moving towards the wall with a speed of 3.5 m/s, and the wall is stationary. Therefore, the speed of the source is positive 3.5 m/s. The speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the emitted frequency is 600 Hz.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf' = 600*(350 + 3.5) / (350 - 0)\nf' = 600 * 353.5 / 350\nf' = 606 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency closest to 606 Hz, which corresponds to option B.",
