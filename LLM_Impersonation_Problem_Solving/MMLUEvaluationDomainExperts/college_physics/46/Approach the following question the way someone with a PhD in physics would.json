The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with expertise in wave theory and acoustics, I would approach this question by considering the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the source of the wave.\n\nIn this case, the police car is moving towards a wall at a speed of 3.5 m/s, emitting a siren with a frequency of 600 Hz. The speed of sound is given as 350 m/s. As the car approaches the wall, the sound waves emitted by the siren will be compressed, leading to an increase in the frequency of the sound wave heard by the driver.\n\nThe formula for the observed frequency (f') due to the Doppler effect in this situation is:\n\nf' = f( v + v_observer) / (v - v_sound)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the siren (600 Hz), v is the speed of sound (350 m/s), v_observer is the speed of the car (3.5 m/s), and v_sound is the speed of sound (350 m/s).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf' = 600(350 + 3.5) / ( 350 - 3.5)\nf' = 600(353.5) / 346.5\nf' \u2248 612 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the siren heard by the driver as an echo is nearest to 612 Hz, which corresponds to option C.",
