In the case of helium, the electron spins must be either parallel (ortho-) or antiparallel (para-). Since electrons are fermions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, they cannot occupy the same energy level with the same spin. Therefore, the ortho- state, where the electron spins are parallel, has a lower energy than the para- state, where the electron spins are antiparallel. \n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the Bohr model of the atom, and nuclear hyperfine coupling are not directly related to this specific phenomenon in the helium atom.",
