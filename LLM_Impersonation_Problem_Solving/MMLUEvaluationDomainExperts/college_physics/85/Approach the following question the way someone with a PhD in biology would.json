A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The energy of the photon was\nA: mc^2\nB: 2mc^2\nC: 3mc^2\nD: 4mc^2",

    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, the conservation of energy and momentum must be considered to determine the energy of the photon.\n\nInitially, the total energy of the system is just the energy of the photon, which we'll denote as E_photon. This energy is equal to the energy equivalent of the rest mass of the system, which is just the rest mass energy of the electron m times c^2. So we have:\n\nE_photon = m*c^2\n\nAfter the photon interacts with the electron and creates an electron-positron pair, the total energy of the system is now distributed among the electron, positron, and the two electrons. Since they are all moving in the same direction at equal speeds, the total energy is split equally among them.\n\nLet the energy of each particle after the interaction be E_final. So we have:\n\n4*E_final = E_photon\n\nSubstituting in the expression for E_photon, we get:\n\n4*E_final = m*c^2\n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon was D: 4mc^2.",
