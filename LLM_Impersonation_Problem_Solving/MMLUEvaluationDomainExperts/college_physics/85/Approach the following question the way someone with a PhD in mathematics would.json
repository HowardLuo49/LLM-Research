A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The energy of the photon was\nA: mc^2\nB: 2mc^2\nC: 3mc^2\nD: 4mc^2",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to apply the principles of energy and momentum conservation in special relativity. \n\nInitially, we have only the photon with energy E and momentum p. After the interaction, we have a positron with energy E' and momentum p', and two electrons with energy E\" and momentum p\" each. \n\nBy conservation of energy, we have E = E' + 2E\". Since the momentum is conserved along the initial direction of the photon, we also have p = p' + 2p\". \n\nAdditionally, the total momentum of the system after the interaction is equal to the momentum of the initial photon, so p = p' + 2p\". \n\nHowever, since all particles have the same speed, we can write p = (E'/c) + 2(E''/c), which reduces to E = E' + 2E\". \n\nBut E' = \u221a((m^2)x (c^4) + (p^2)(c^2)), and E\" = \u221a((m^2)(c^4) + (p^2)(c^2)). \n\nSubstituting these into our energy conservation equation, we get: E = 3\u221a((m^2)(c^4) + (p^2)(c^2)). \n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon was actually 3mc^2.
