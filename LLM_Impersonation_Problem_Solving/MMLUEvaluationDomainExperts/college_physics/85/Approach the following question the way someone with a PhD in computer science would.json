A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The energy of the photon was\nA: mc^2\nB: 2mc^2\nC: 3mc^2\nD: 4mc^2",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of momentum and energy. \n\nInitially, the electron is at rest so its initial momentum and energy are both zero. The photon has energy E and momentum E/c. After the interaction, the positron and the two electrons move off at the same speed, so their momenta cancel out and the total momentum is zero. \n\nBy conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the interaction must be equal to the total momentum after the interaction: E/c = 0.\n\nBy conservation of energy, the total energy before the interaction must be equal to the total energy after the interaction: E + 2mc^2 = 2m\u03b3_c^2.\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we find E = 2mc^2. Therefore, the energy of the photon was 2mc^2, which corresponds to answer choice B.",
