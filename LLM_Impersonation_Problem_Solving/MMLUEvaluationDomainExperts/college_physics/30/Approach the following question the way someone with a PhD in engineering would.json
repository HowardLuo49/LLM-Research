This energy is directly related to the potential difference required to stop the emitted electrons. Specifically, the higher the frequency of the incident light (above the threshold frequency), the greater the energy of the emitted electrons and thus the greater the potential difference required to stop them.\n\nIt is important to note that the work function of the metal (the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface) is independent of the frequency/wavelength of the incident light. Additionally, the current in the photoelectric tube is not a linear function of the wavelength as it depends on factors such as the intensity of the light and the characteristics of the photoelectric material.",
