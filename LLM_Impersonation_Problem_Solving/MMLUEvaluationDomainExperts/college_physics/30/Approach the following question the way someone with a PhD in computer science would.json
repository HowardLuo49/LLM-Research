    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first understanding the key concepts of the photoelectric effect and Einstein's theory. The photoelectric effect refers to the emission of electrons from a material when light of a certain frequency or higher is shone upon it. \n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect, the energy of the emitted electrons is dependent on the frequency of the incident light, rather than its intensity. This means that the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons, known as the stopping potential, is directly related to the frequency of the light.\n\nTherefore, based on Einstein's theory, the correct answer to the question would be D: the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. This understanding is crucial in the field of computer science, as it forms the basis for various applications such as photoelectric sensors and photovoltaic cells.",
