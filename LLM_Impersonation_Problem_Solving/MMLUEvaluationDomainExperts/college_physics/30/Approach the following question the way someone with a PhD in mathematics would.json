    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As per Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect, the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light above the threshold frequency, and not to the wavelength. This relationship is described by the equation E = hf, where E is the energy of the photon (proportional to the potential difference), h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the light. Therefore, the correct answer is D: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.",
