    "gpt_response": "The correct answer to this question is D: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nEinstein's theory of the photoelectric effect states that the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency. When light of sufficient frequency shines on a metal surface, it can eject electrons from the surface, creating a current. The potential difference required to stop these emitted electrons is known as the stopping potential.\n\nAccording to the theory, the stopping potential is directly proportional to the frequency of the incoming light above the threshold frequency. This is because the energy of the photons is directly related to their frequency, and the energy required to stop the emitted electrons is directly related to the energy of the incoming photons.\n\nTherefore, the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.",
