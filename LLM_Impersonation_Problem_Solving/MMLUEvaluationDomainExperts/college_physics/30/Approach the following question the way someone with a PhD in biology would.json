Einstein\u2019s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the\nA: work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency\nB: work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength\nC: current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength\nD: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with expertise in biology, I can provide an analysis of the question from a scientific perspective. \n\nEinstein's theory of the photoelectric effect states that the energy of a photon is directly related to its frequency, not its wavelength. This means that the energy required to liberate an electron from a metal surface (known as the work function) is proportional to the frequency of the incident light. This relationship is described by the equation E = hf, where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is A: the work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency of the incident light, not the wavelength. This relationship is crucial in understanding the behavior of photoelectric tubes and their response to light of varying frequencies.",
