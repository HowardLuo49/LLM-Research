An observer O at rest midway between two sources of light at x = 0 and x = 10 m observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. According to a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\nA: 0.13c\nB: 0.15c\nC: 0.36c\nD: 0.53c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. According to special relativity, time is observed differently for objects moving at different speeds relative to the observer.\n\nLet's denote the distance between observer O and the first source of light as L = 5m. The time difference between the two flashes as seen by observer O is \u0394t = 0 s.\n\nNow, let's consider observer O'. According to O', the first flash reaches O' in a time interval of 13 ns before the second flash. This time interval can be calculated using the time dilation formula:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3(\u0394t - v\u0394x/c^2)\n\nWhere:\n\u0394t' is the time interval as observed by O'\n\u03b3 is the Lorentz factor\nv is the velocity of O' relative to O\n\u0394x is the distance between the two light sources\nc is the speed of light in a vacuum\n\nGiven that \u0394t' = 13 ns = 13 x 10^-9 s and \u0394t = 0, and \u0394x = 10 m, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the velocity v:\n\nv = c(1 - (\u0394t'/\u0394t))/((\u0394t'/\u0394t) + 1)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nv = c(1 - (13 x 10^-9 s/0 s))/(13 x 10^-9 s/0 s + 1) \u2248 0.3646c\n\nTherefore, the speed of O' relative to O is approximately 0.36c.
