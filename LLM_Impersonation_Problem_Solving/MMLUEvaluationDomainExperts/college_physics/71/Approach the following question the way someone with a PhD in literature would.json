The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",

In this case, the concept of redshift in astronomy is crucial. Redshift is a phenomenon observed in the light coming from distant celestial objects, such as galaxies and quasars, where the spectral lines are shifted towards longer wavelengths compared to those observed in laboratory settings on Earth. This redshift is a result of the Doppler effect, where the relative motion between the source of light and the observer causes a shift in wavelength.\n\nIn the case of the quasar 3C9, the hydrogen lines in its spectrum are observed to be shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. This implies a significant redshift, indicating a high relative speed between 3C9 and Earth.\n\nIf we assume that this redshift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, we can apply the formula for the Doppler effect to calculate the relative speed of the quasar. The formula for redshift in terms of relative speed (v) and the speed of light (c) is given by:\n\nz = (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb) = v/c\n\nwhere z is the redshift, \u0394\u03bb is the change in wavelength, and \u03bb is the rest wavelength.\n\nGiven that the redshift is 3 (three times the rest wavelength) and assuming that the speed of light (c) is constant, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the relative speed (v):\n\nv = z * c = 3 * c\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 with respect to Earth is 3 times the speed of light, which corresponds to option A: 2c.
