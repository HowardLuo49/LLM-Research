The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",

    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we first need to understand the concept of redshift in the context of cosmological phenomena. Redshift occurs when the spectral lines of an object are shifted towards longer wavelengths, indicating that the object is moving away from the observer. In the case of quasars, redshift is primarily caused by the expansion of the universe, which stretches the wavelengths of light emitted by distant objects.\n\nIn this scenario, the hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times longer than those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. This indicates a significant redshift, implying that the quasar is receding from Earth at a substantial velocity.\n\nThe redshift (z) of a quasar can be calculated using the formula z = (\u03bb_observed - \u03bb_rest) / \u03bb_rest, where \u03bb_observed is the observed wavelength of the spectral lines and \u03bb_rest is their rest wavelength. In this case, we are given that the observed wavelengths are three times longer than the rest wavelengths, so z = 2.\n\nThe redshift of a distant object is related to its recessional velocity (v) through Hubble's Law, v = cz, where c is the speed of light. Substituting the redshift value of z = 2 into this equation, we find that the relative speed of the quasar is v = 2c, corresponding to option A.\n\nTherefore, based on the observed redshift of the hydrogen lines in the spectrum of 3C9, we can conclude that the relative speed of the quasar is 2 times the speed of light (2c).",
