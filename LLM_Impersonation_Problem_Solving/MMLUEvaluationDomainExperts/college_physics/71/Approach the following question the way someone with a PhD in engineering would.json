The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the relative speed of the quasar, we can use the formula for redshift based on the Doppler effect. The formula for redshift, z, is given by:\n\nz = \u0394\u03bb / \u03bb\u2080\n\nWhere \u0394\u03bb is the observed wavelength shift and \u03bb\u2080 is the rest wavelength. In this case, the observed wavelength shift is three times longer than the rest wavelength, so \u0394\u03bb = 3\u03bb\u2080.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for redshift in terms of velocity, v, which is given by:\n\nv/c = z\n\nWhere v is the velocity of the object, c is the speed of light, and z is the redshift. Substituting the values we have:\n\nv/c = 3\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar is 3 times the speed of light, which is not physically possible.
