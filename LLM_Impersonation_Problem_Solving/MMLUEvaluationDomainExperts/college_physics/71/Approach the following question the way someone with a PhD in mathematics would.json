The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the relative speed of the quasar 3C9, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect:\n\n\u03bb_observed = \u03bb_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))\n\nwhere \u03bb_observed and \u03bb_rest are the observed and rest wavelengths respectively, v is the relative speed between the quasar and Earth, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the observed wavelength is three times longer than the rest wavelength, we have:\n\n3\u03bb_rest = \u03bb_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))\n\nDividing both sides by \u03bb_rest, we get:\n\n3 = sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n9 = (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n9(1 - v/c) = 1 + v/c\n\nExpanding and solving for v/c, we get:\n\n9 - 9v/c = 1 + v/c\n8v/c = 8\nv/c = 1\nv = c\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 is equal to the speed of light, c.
