The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",

    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first delve into the concept of redshift in the context of cosmology. Redshift occurs when the light emitted by a celestial object is stretched as the object moves away from the observer. This stretching results in a shift towards longer wavelengths and lower frequencies. The formula for redshift, denoted by z, is given by z = \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb, where \u0394\u03bb is the change in wavelength and \u03bb is the wavelength of light emitted by the object.\n\nIn the case of the hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9, their wavelengths are three times longer than those observed in the laboratory on Earth. This indicates a redshift of z = 3. According to the Doppler effect, the redshift of an object moving away from the observer is given by z = v/c, where v is the velocity of the object and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Therefore, we can set z = 3 = v/c and solve for v, the relative speed of the quasar.\n\nUtilizing basic algebraic manipulation, we find that v = 3c. Hence, the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 is 3 times the speed of light, or 3c. Thus, the correct answer is not listed amongst the choices given, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of the scenario at hand.",
