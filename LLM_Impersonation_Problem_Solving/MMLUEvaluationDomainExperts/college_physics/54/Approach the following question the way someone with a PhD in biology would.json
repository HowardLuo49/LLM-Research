Maxwell\u2019s equations imply that which of the following must be true just outside the surface of the superconductor?\nA: B = 0\nB: B is perpendicular to the surface.\nC: B is tangential to the surface.\nD: B is time independent.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I am not an expert in electromagnetism and superconductors. However, based on my understanding of physics principles, Maxwell's equations dictate that the magnetic field lines must be continuous and closed, which implies that the magnetic field (B) is tangential to the surface of the superconductor just outside it. Therefore, I would choose option C: B is tangential to the surface.",
