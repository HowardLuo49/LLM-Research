In the case of a superconductor, under ideal conditions, the electric and magnetic fields inside the superconductor are zero due to the Meissner effect.\n\nMaxwell's equations describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in electromagnetism. Near the surface of a superconductor, the behavior of the magnetic field can be deduced from Maxwell's equations. The correct answer would be B is tangential to the surface (C), as the magnetic field lines are pinned to the surface of the superconductor due to the zero resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields in the superconducting state. This means that the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the surface, and it is also time-independent.",
