Maxwell\u2019s equations imply that which of the following must be true just outside the surface of the superconductor?\nA: B = 0\nB: B is perpendicular to the surface.\nC: B is tangential to the surface.\nD: B is time independent.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In a superconductor, under ideal conditions, the electric and magnetic fields inside the material are required to be zero. This is due to the expulsion of magnetic fields that occurs when the material becomes superconducting. According to Maxwell's equations, specifically the Ampere's Law and Faraday's Law, the magnetic field outside a superconductor just outside the surface must be tangential to the surface. This is because there is a current flowing on the surface of the superconductor, known as the Meissner current, which creates a magnetic field that is tangential to the surface. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: B is tangential to the surface.",
