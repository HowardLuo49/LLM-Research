The first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Which of the harmonics, if any, will survive once the pipe is closed at one end?\nA: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\nB: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\nC: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\nD: None",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In considering the question posed, it is paramount to harken to the fundamentals of sound propagation within a closed system. The closing of one end of an organ pipe alters the fundamental frequency and resultant harmonics, thereby necessitating a reevaluation of the harmonics that will endure. In this specific instance, upon closure of one end of the organ pipe, the odd harmonics will persist while the even harmonics will be extinguished. Thus, harmonics at 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz will endure, aligning with scientific principles and the laws governing sound wave behavior in closed-end pipes. Consequently, the correct response, informed by deductive reasoning and the principles of physics, would be option A: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only.",
