The first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Which of the harmonics, if any, will survive once the pipe is closed at one end?\nA: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\nB: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\nC: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\nD: None",

    "gpt_response": "To analyze this situation, we need to consider the boundary conditions at the open and closed ends of the pipe. When an organ pipe is open at both ends, the harmonics that can be produced are all odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. This is because the open ends of the pipe allow for maximum displacement of air particles, resulting in antinodes at those points.\n\nHowever, when one end of the pipe is closed, the boundary condition at that end changes. The closed end of the pipe does not allow for displacement of air particles, resulting in a node at that point. This means that only odd harmonics that have an antinode at the open end and a node at the closed end will survive the transition.\n\nLooking at the given harmonics: 50 Hz (1st harmonic), 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic), and 250 Hz (5th harmonic), we can see that only the odd harmonics that have nodes at the closed end will survive. This means that only the 3rd harmonic (150 Hz) and 5th harmonic (250 Hz) will be present once the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only.",
