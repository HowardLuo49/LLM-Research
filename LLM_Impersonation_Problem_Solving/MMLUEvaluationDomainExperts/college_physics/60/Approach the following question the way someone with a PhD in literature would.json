The first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Which of the harmonics, if any, will survive once the pipe is closed at one end?\nA: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\nB: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\nC: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\nD: None",

    "gpt_response": "In exploring the resonant frequencies of an organ pipe open at both ends, the fundamental frequency and its subsequent harmonics are determined by the length of the pipe and the speed of sound within the medium in which the pipe is situated. When the pipe is closed at one end, a node is created at the closed end which affects the harmonics that can be produced.\n\nThe fundamental frequency of a pipe open at both ends is given by f = v/2L, where f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound, and L is the length of the pipe. The harmonics are then integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nIn the case of an organ pipe closed at one end, the fundamental frequency is found by taking into account the length of the pipe, with the closed end acting as a node. This results in a shift in the standing wave pattern and alters the available harmonics. The first five harmonics mentioned (50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz) are for an open pipe configuration and will not be present in a closed pipe.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: None of the harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end.",
