The first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Which of the harmonics, if any, will survive once the pipe is closed at one end?\nA: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\nB: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\nC: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\nD: None",

    "gpt_response": "In the case of an organ pipe open at both ends, only odd-numbered harmonics will be present. This is because the closed end of the pipe acts as a node for all odd-numbered harmonics, resulting in only odd harmonics being produced. Therefore, once the pipe is closed at one end, only the odd harmonics will survive. \n\nGiven the harmonics provided are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz, the odd harmonics are 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz.
