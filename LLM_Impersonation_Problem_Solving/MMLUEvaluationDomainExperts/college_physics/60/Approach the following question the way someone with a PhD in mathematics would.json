The first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz.

    "gpt_response": "To determine which harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end, we need to consider the conditions for standing waves in a closed pipe. When a pipe is open at both ends, the open ends act as antinodes, allowing for the presence of all odd integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. However, when one end is closed, it acts as a node, limiting the possible harmonics that can form.\n\nIn a closed pipe, only odd integer multiples of the fundamental frequency will be present. Therefore, the only harmonics that will survive when the pipe is closed at one end are those with odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. \n\nGiven that the first five harmonics are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz, we can see that the only harmonics with odd multiples of 50 Hz are 150 Hz and 250 Hz.
