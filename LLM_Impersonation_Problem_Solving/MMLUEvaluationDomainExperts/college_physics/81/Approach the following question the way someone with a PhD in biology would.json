The selection rule for hydrogen atom transitions is \u0394l = \u00b11 and \u0394n = \u00b11. This means that transitions that do not follow these rules are not allowed.\n\nGiven that the electron is in the n = 4, l = 1 state, the possible final states from the given options are:\n\nA: n = 3, l = 2\nB: n = 3, l = 1\nC: n = 3, l = 0\nD: n = 2, l = 0\n\nWe can determine which of these transitions is not allowed by applying the selection rules. \n\nFor option A: n = 3, l = 2\n\u0394l = 2 - 1 = 1, \u0394n = 3 - 4 = -1\nThis transition violates the selection rule for \u0394l = \u00b11, and thus cannot be reached by an allowed transition.
