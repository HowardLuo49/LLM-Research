Which of the following is true about any system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process?\nA: There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.\nB: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\nC: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\nD: The entropy of the system and its environment must increase.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is B: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\n\nIn a reversible thermodynamic process, the system is in equilibrium with its surroundings at every point along the process. This means that the temperature of the system remains constant throughout the process, as any change in temperature would result in a violation of the equilibrium condition. Therefore, option B is true about any system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process.",
