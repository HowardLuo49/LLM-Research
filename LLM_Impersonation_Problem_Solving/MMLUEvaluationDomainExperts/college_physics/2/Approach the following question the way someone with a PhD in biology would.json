Which of the following is true about any system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process?\nA: There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.\nB: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\nC: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\nD: The entropy of the system and its environment must increase.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Reversible thermodynamic processes occur in systems that are in thermodynamic equilibrium throughout the process, meaning that the system's properties can be returned to their original state without leaving any lasting effects on the system or its surroundings. In the case of a reversible process, both the system and its environment can be returned to their original states, thus implying that there are no net changes in the entropy of the system and its surroundings. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.",
