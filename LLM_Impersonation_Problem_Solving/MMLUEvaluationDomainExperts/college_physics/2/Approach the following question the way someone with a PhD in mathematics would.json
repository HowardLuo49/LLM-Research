Which of the following is true about any system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process?\nA: There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.\nB: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\nC: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\nD: The entropy of the system and its environment must increase.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "A system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process follows the laws of thermodynamics and can be described by idealized models. In a reversible process, there is no generation of entropy within the system, meaning that the system returns to its initial state without any irreversible changes. This implies that the entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged, so the correct answer is:\n\nC: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.",
