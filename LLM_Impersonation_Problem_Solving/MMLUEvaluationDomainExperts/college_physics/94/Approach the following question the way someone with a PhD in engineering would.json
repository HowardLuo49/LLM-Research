The orbital radius of A is twice that of B. Which of the following gives the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B?\nA: 4\nB: 2\nC: sqrt(2)\nD: 1/sqrt(2)",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the ratio of the angular momentum of satellite A to satellite B, we can use the formula for angular momentum in circular motion, which is given by:\n\nL = mvr\n\nWhere L is the angular momentum, m is the mass of the satellite, v is the orbital velocity, and r is the orbital radius. Since the satellites are identical, we can assume that they have the same mass.\n\nGiven that the orbital radius of A is twice that of B, we can express the ratio of the angular momenta as follows:\n\nL_A / L_B = (m * v_A * 2r) / (m * v_B * r)\n            = 2 * (v_A / v_B)\n\nTo find the ratio of the angular momentum of A to B, it is essential to determine the ratio of their orbital velocities.\n\nThe orbital velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit can be expressed as:\n\nv = sqrt(GM / r)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the orbital radius. Substituting the values for satellites A and B, we get:\n\nv_A / v_B = sqrt(GM / 2r) / sqrt(GM / r)\n             = sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the angular momentum of satellite A to B is sqrt(2).
