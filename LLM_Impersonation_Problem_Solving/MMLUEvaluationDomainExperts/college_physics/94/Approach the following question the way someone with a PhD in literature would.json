    "gpt_response": "A scholar with a PhD in literature might approach this question by first analyzing the concept of angular momentum as it pertains to orbital mechanics. In this context, angular momentum is a measure of the rotational motion of an object around a fixed point, such as Earth in the case of these satellites. The angular momentum of a satellite is directly related to its orbital radius and velocity.\n\nIn this scenario, the orbital radius of satellite A is twice that of satellite B, which means that the angular momentum of A will be greater than that of B. The ratio of the angular momentum of A to B can be calculated by considering the relationship between angular momentum, orbital radius, and velocity.\n\nThe equation for angular momentum is given by L = mvr, where m is the mass of the satellite, v is its velocity, and r is the orbital radius. Since the satellites are identical, we can ignore the mass term and focus on the ratio of angular momentum in terms of the orbital radius.\n\nGiven that the orbital radius of A is twice that of B, we can say that rA = 2rB. Therefore, the ratio of angular momentum of A to B will be (mvrA) / (mvrB) = 2. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 4.",
