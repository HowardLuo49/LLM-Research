An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must consider the initial velocity of the payload relative to the plane when it is released. Since the plane is moving due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s and the payload is dropped parallel to the ground, the initial velocity of the payload relative to the plane is also 100 m/s north.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the velocity of the payload relative to the ground after 4.0 s. This can be done by considering the motion of the plane and the payload separately. The velocity of the plane after 4.0 s will still be 100 m/s north, while the velocity of the payload after 4.0 s can be calculated using the equation:\n\nvelocity = initial velocity + acceleration \u00d7 time\n\nSince the only force acting on the payload is gravity, the acceleration of the payload will be equal to the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s^2 downward. Substituting the values into the equation, we get:\n\nvelocity = 100 m/s north + (9.8 m/s^2 \u00d7 4.0 s) down\nvelocity = 100 m/s north + 39.2 m/s down\nvelocity = 100 m/s north and 39.2 m/s down\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released is 100 m/s north and 39.2 m/s down. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this is equivalent to 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down. Thus, the correct answer is D.",
