An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released, we can consider the motion of the plane and the motion of the payload separately. \n\nFirst, we note that the plane is traveling due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s. Since air resistance is neglected, the velocity of the plane remains constant throughout the motion. \n\nSecond, the payload is released from the plane and falls freely under the influence of gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.81 m/s^2, directed downward. \n\nUsing the equation of motion for the payload, v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (in this case, 0), a is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and t is the time (4.0 s), we can calculate the velocity of the payload relative to the ground. \n\nv = 0 + (9.81 m/s^2)(4.0 s) = 39.24 m/s downward \n\nFinally, we can calculate the velocity of the payload relative to the plane by subtracting the velocity of the plane from the velocity of the payload relative to the ground. \n\nVelocity of payload relative to plane = 39.24 m/s - 0 m/s = 39.24 m/s downward \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 40 m/s down.",
