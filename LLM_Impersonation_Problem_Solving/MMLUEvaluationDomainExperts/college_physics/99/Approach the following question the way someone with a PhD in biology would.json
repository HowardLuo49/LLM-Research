An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question from a physics perspective. When the airplane drops the payload, the payload will continue moving northward with the same velocity as the airplane at the moment of release, 100 m/s. Since the payload is not acted upon by any external forces like air resistance, it will also not experience any change in velocity while in free fall. Thus, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after release will still be 100 m/s in the northward direction. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.",
