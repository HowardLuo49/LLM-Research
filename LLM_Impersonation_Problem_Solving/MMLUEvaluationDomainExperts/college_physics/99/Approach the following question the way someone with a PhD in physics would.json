An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first understand that the velocity of an object can be broken down into two components: the velocity relative to some fixed reference frame (in this case, the ground) and the velocity relative to another moving object (in this case, the airplane).\n\nWhen the payload is dropped from the airplane, it will initially have the same velocity as the airplane (100 m/s due north). However, since the payload is no longer attached to the airplane and is only acted upon by the force of gravity, it will accelerate downward at approximately 9.8 m/s^2 (neglecting air resistance).\n\nAfter 4.0 seconds, the payload will have accelerated downward to a velocity of approximately 39.2 m/s (9.8 m/s^2 * 4.0 s). Therefore, the velocity of the payload relative to the airplane will be 100 m/s north (from the airplane's velocity) and 39.2 m/s down (from the acceleration due to gravity), which corresponds to answer choice D: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down.",
