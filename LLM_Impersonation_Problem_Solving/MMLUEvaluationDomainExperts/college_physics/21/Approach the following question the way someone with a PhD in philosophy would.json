    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosophical thinker, one must critically examine the nature and structure of atoms in order to determine the appropriate response to the question posed. In this context, it is crucial to recognize that electrons are arranged in different energy levels within an atom, with each energy level corresponding to a specific value of n. The n=1 energy level can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, while the n=2 energy level can hold a maximum of 8 electrons. Therefore, if an atom has filled n=1 and n=2 levels, it would contain a total of 10 electrons in accordance with the electron configuration principle. Thus, the correct answer to the question is D: 10.",
