    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of electrons an atom has with filled n=1 and n=2 levels, we need to understand the electron configuration within an atom. \n\nThe n=1 level contains a maximum of 2 electrons, while the n=2 level contains a maximum of 8 electrons. Therefore, if the atom has filled n=1 and n=2 levels, it would contain a total of 2 electrons in the n=1 level and 8 electrons in the n=2 level. \n\nThus, the total number of electrons in the atom would be 2 + 8 = 10. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10.",
