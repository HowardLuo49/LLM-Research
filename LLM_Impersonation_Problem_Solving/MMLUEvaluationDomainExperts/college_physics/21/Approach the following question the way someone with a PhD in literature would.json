    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a doctorate in literature, I must acknowledge that this question pertains to the field of physics rather than literature. However, drawing on my interdisciplinary knowledge, I can confidently state that if an atom has filled n = 1 and n = 2 levels, it must have a total of 10 electrons. This can be determined by the formula 2n^2, where n is the principal quantum number. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 10 electrons.",
