    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of electrons in an atom with filled n=1 and n=2 levels, we need to calculate the total number of electrons that can occupy these energy levels. The formula for calculating the maximum number of electrons that can occupy an energy level is given by 2n^2, where n is the principal quantum number of the energy level.\n\nFor n=1, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy this energy level is 2(1)^2 = 2.\n\nFor n=2, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy this energy level is 2(2)^2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the total number of electrons in the atom with filled n=1 and n=2 levels is 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10.",
