    "gpt_response": "To begin to analyze this problem, we must first consider the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total energy emitted by a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. In this case, the energy in the cavity can be represented by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nE \u221d T^4\n\nwhere E is the energy and T is the temperature. \n\nIf the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the new temperature T' is given by:\n\nT' = 2T\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the new energy E' can be expressed as:\n\nE' \u221d (2T)^4\nE' \u221d 16T^4\n\nTherefore, the new energy E' is increased by a factor of 16.\n\nNow, we can relate the energy used to melt the ice to the amount of ice melted. Let's assume that the energy required to melt a fixed amount of ice remains constant. This implies that the mass of ice melted is directly proportional to the energy. \n\nTherefore, if the energy is increased by a factor of 16, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time will also increase by a factor of 16. \n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 16",
