    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand the relationship between the energy from electromagnetic waves in equilibrium in a cavity and the melting of ice. \n\nThe energy from electromagnetic waves in a cavity can be represented by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the total energy emitted across all wavelengths by a black body (or in this case, the cavity) is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. This means that if the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the energy emitted by the cavity will be increased by a factor of 2^4 = 16.\n\nNow, the energy emitted by the cavity is used to melt the ice in a fixed amount of time. The amount of ice that can be melted is directly proportional to the energy available. Therefore, if the energy emitted by the cavity is increased by a factor of 16, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time will also be increased by a factor of 16.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 16.",
