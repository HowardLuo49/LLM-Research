    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the energy of electromagnetic waves in equilibrium in a cavity and the melting of ice. The energy from the waves is absorbed by the ice, causing it to melt.\n\nThe energy in equilibrium in a cavity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its Kelvin temperature. Therefore, if the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the energy in the cavity will increase by a factor of 2^4 = 16.\n\nThe amount of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is directly proportional to the energy available for melting. Therefore, if the energy in the cavity increases by a factor of 16, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time will also increase by a factor of 16.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 16.",
