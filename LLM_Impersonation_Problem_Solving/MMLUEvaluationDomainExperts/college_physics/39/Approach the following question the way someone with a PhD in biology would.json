    "gpt_response": "To address this question from a perspective of a PhD in biology, we first need to understand the principles of thermal equilibrium and energy transfer in a cavity. The energy from electromagnetic waves in equilibrium in a cavity is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Planck's law of black-body radiation. This energy can be absorbed by substances within the cavity, such as ice, leading to a change in temperature and potentially phase changes.\n\nWhen the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the energy radiated by the cavity will also increase according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This increase in energy can be absorbed by the ice, causing it to melt at a faster rate. \n\nThe rate of melting of ice is directly proportional to the energy absorbed by the ice. Therefore, if the temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time will also increase by a factor of 2^4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 16.",
