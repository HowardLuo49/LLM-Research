Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the frequency at which the sound first disappears at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face, we must consider the diffraction of sound waves through the rectangular slit.\n\nThe critical angle for diffraction to occur is given by the equation:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03bb / b\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle of diffraction, \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave, and b is the width of the slit.\n\nAt the critical angle, the diffracted sound waves interfere destructively and cancel each other out. This results in the disappearance of sound at that angle.\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for the wavelength of the sound wave:\n\n\u03bb = b * \u03b8\n\nGiven that b = 0.14 m and \u03b8 = 45 degrees (convert to radians: 45 degrees * \u03c0 / 180 = \u03c0 / 4 radians), we can calculate the wavelength of the sound wave:\n\n\u03bb = 0.14 * \u03c0 / 4\n\u03bb \u2248 0.11 m\n\nThe speed of sound in air is 350 m/s. We can now calculate the frequency of the sound wave using the formula:\n\nv = f * \u03bb\n\nRearrange the formula to solve for the frequency:\n\nf = v / \u03bb\nf \u2248 350 / 0.11\n\nf \u2248 3181.82 Hz\n\nSo, the closest option given is D: 3,500 Hz.",
