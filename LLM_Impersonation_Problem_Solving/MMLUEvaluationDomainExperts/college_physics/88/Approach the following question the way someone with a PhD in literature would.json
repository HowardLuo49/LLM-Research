Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "A literary scholar would not typically have expertise in the field of physics and would likely struggle to answer this question accurately. However, if pressed to provide an answer, they may use their critical thinking skills to deduce that a higher frequency sound may diffract less effectively out of the speaker enclosure due to its shorter wavelength. Therefore, they may choose option D: 3,500 Hz as the frequency at which the sound first disappears at a 45-degree angle from the normal to the speaker face.",
