    "gpt_response": "The negative muon, mu^-, is a fundamental particle classified as a lepton. Leptons, such as electrons and muons, are characterized by their interactions with the weak nuclear force. Among the options presented, the particle with properties most similar to the negative muon would be the electron (Option A). This is because both the muon and the electron are leptons, sharing similar properties such as electric charge and weak interactions. Mesons (Option B) are composite particles made up of a quark and an antiquark, and do not share the same properties as the muon. Photons (Option C) are force carriers for the electromagnetic force and do not possess the same characteristics as the muon. Bosons (Option D) are a class of particles that include force carriers such as photons and the Higgs boson but do not have properties most similar to the negative muon.",
