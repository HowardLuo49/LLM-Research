Unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers whose transmission axes make an angle of 45q with each other. The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\nA: 100%\nB: 75%\nC: 50%\nD: 25%",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first consider the behavior of polarized light when incident on a linear polarizer. A linear polarizer only transmits light waves that are polarized along its transmission axis. When unpolarized light is incident on a linear polarizer, half of the light is absorbed and only half of the light is transmitted through.\n\nIn this case, we have two linear polarizers with their transmission axes making an angle of 45 degrees with each other. When unpolarized light is incident on the first polarizer, only half of the light is transmitted through. However, the transmitted light is now polarized along the first polarizer's transmission axis. When this polarized light is incident on the second polarizer, the intensity of the light transmitted through is determined by the angle between the polarization axis and the transmission axis of the second polarizer.\n\nSince the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers is 45 degrees, the intensity of the light transmitted through both polarizers is 100% of the incident intensity. This is because when the first polarizer transmits only half of the incident light, the polarization of the transmitted light is such that it can pass through the second polarizer without any further reduction in intensity. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 100%.",
