    "gpt_response": "This problem involves the concept of Malus's Law, which relates the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer to the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the light's polarization direction.\n\nIn this case, the initial unpolarized light is incident on the first linear polarizer, which will transmit light with an intensity equal to I * cos^2(theta), where theta is the angle between the polarizer's transmission axis and the initial polarization direction of the light.\n\nSince the incident light is unpolarized, it is equally likely to have its polarization direction along any axis. On average, therefore, half of the incident light will be transmitted through the first polarizer. The second polarizer, whose transmission axis is at a 45-degree angle to the first polarizer, will let half of the light that passes through, through. Consequently, the percentage of the incident intensity that is transmitted through both polarizers is 50% or option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 50%",
