Unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers whose transmission axes make an angle of 45q with each other. The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\nA: 100%\nB: 75%\nC: 50%\nD: 25%",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the physics of polarized light and how the intensity changes when passing through polarizers. When unpolarized light is incident on a linear polarizer, the intensity of the transmitted light is reduced by a factor of 1/2 (50%). When this partially polarized light then passes through another polarizer with a different orientation, the intensity is further reduced by a factor of cos^2(theta), where theta is the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers.\n\nIn this case, the transmission axes make an angle of 45 degrees with each other. Therefore, the intensity of the light transmitted through both polarizers will be given by:\n\nI_final = I_initial * (1/2) * (cos^2(45)) = I_initial * 0.5 * (0.5) = I_initial * 0.25\n\nThis means that the transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is 25% of the incident intensity.
