A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\nA: 80 s\nB: 160 s\nC: 2,000 s\nD: 5,000 s",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Answer: D: 5,000 s\n\nTo establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, the student needs to count for a period of time that is long enough to make the statistical fluctuations in the measured values insignificant compared to the total number of counts. In this case, the standard deviation of the measurements is approximately 1.58 seconds. \n\nTo reduce the uncertainty by a factor of 100 (1 percent), the student needs to count for approximately 100 times longer than the standard deviation, which is 100*1.58 = 158 seconds. \n\nHowever, to account for statistical fluctuations and ensure the rate is determined to within an uncertainty of 1 percent, a conservative estimate would be to count for at least 50 times longer than the standard deviation. Therefore, the student should count for approximately 50*1.58 = 79 seconds, which rounded up is 80 seconds. \n\nTherefore, answer D: 5,000 seconds is the best choice to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent.",
