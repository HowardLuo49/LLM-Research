A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\nA: 80 s\nB: 160 s\nC: 2,000 s\nD: 5,000 s",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In order to establish the rate of disintegration to an uncertainty of 1 percent, the student must determine the average value of the measurements taken and its standard deviation. The formula for standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squared differences between each measurement and the average value, divided by the number of measurements. \n\nFor the given measurements (3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5), the average value is 2 and the standard deviation is approximately 1.58. \n\nTo establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to count long enough for the standard deviation to be 1 percent of the average value. This means the student should count for roughly 100 times the standard deviation. For our measurements, this would be 1.58 x 100 = 158 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the closest answer is B: 160 s.",
