A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\nA: 80 s\nB: 160 s\nC: 2,000 s\nD: 5,000 s",

    "gpt_response": "To establish the rate of disintegration of a long-lived radioactive isotope to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to determine the average number of disintegrations per second. \n\nFirst, calculate the average number of disintegrations per second from the given values as: \n(3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 10 = 20 / 10 = 2. \n\nNext, calculate the uncertainty of 1 percent as 0.01 * 2 = 0.02. \n\nTherefore, to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to count for a time when the number of disintegrations is expected to be within 1 percent of the average. \nThis can be done by calculating: \nTime = Average number of disintegrations * (1 / uncertainty)^2 \nTime = 2 * (1 / 0.02)^2 \nTime = 2 * 2500 \nTime = 5000 s \n\nTherefore, the student should count for 5000 seconds to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 5,000 s.",
