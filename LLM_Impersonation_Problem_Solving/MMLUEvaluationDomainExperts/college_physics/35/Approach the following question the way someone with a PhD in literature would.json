A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\nA: 80 s\nB: 160 s\nC: 2,000 s\nD: 5,000 s",

    "gpt_response": "In order to establish the rate of disintegration of a long-lived radioactive isotope to an uncertainty of 1 percent, the student must have a sufficiently large sample size to minimize the effects of statistical fluctuations. In this case, the student has made 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration.\n\nTo determine the rate of disintegration with an uncertainty of 1 percent, we can calculate the standard deviation of the measurements, which is a measure of the dispersion of data points around the mean. The formula for standard deviation is:\n\ns = sqrt((\u03a3(xi - x\u0304)\u00b2)/(n-1))\n\nWhere:\ns is the standard deviation\n\u03a3 is the sum\nxi is each individual measurement\nx\u0304 is the mean of the measurements\nn is the total number of measurements (in this case, 10)\n\nBy calculating the standard deviation, we can determine the uncertainty of the measurements. To establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, the standard deviation should be less than 1% of the mean. \n\nUsing the given measurements, we find the mean to be:\n\nMean = (3+0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5)/10 = 2\n\nThen, calculate the standard deviation:\n\ns = sqrt(((3-2)\u00b2 + (0-2)\u00b2 + (2-2)\u00b2 + (1-2)\u00b2 + (2-2)\u00b2 + (4-2)\u00b2 + (0-2)\u00b2 + (1-2)\u00b2 + (2-2)\u00b2 + (5-2)\u00b2)/9) = sqrt(14/9) \u2248 1.2\n\nSince the standard deviation is greater than 1% of the mean value, we need more measurements to reduce the uncertainty. To minimize the uncertainty to 1%, a total of 80 measurements should be taken. Therefore, the student should count for 80 seconds to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 80 s.",
