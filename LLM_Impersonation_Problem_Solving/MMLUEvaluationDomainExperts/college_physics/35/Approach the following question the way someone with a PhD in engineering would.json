A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\nA: 80 s\nB: 160 s\nC: 2,000 s\nD: 5,000 s",

    "gpt_response": "To establish the rate of disintegration of a radioactive isotope to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to calculate the standard deviation of the measurements. \n\nFirst, we calculate the average of the measurements:\n(3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 10 = 2\n\nNext, we calculate the variance:\n((3-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (4-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (5-2)^2) / 10 = 5.2\n\nThen, we take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation:\n\u221a5.2 = 2.28\n\nTo establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to find the range within which 68% of the measurements fall (assuming a normal distribution). Since our average is 2 and our standard deviation is 2.28, the range would be 2\u00b12.28.\n\nUsing the formula: uncertainty = (1% x average) / (68%), we can solve for the necessary counting time:\n(0.01 x 2) / ((2.28 / 2) x 0.68) = 0.0175\n\nTherefore, the student should count for approximately 0.0175 x 10 = 0.175 seconds to establish the rate with an uncertainty of 1 percent.
