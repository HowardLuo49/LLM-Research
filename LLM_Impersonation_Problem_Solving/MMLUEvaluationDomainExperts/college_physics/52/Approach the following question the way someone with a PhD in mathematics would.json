    "gpt_response": "The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real. This can be proven by considering the properties of Hermitian operators in quantum mechanics. By definition, a Hermitian operator is equal to its own conjugate transpose. This implies that the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real, as the eigenvalues of the conjugate transpose are the complex conjugates of the original eigenvalues. Therefore, option A: real, is the correct answer.",
