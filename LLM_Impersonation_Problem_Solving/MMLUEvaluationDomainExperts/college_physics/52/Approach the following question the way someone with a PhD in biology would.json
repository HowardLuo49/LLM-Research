This property ensures that the eigenvalues, which represent the possible values of a physical observable when the operator is applied to its corresponding eigenstate, are always real numbers. The real nature of the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator plays a crucial role in the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the underlying mathematical framework describing physical systems.",
