In this process, the incoming electrons knock out inner shell electrons from the metal atoms, creating vacancies in these inner shells. Subsequently, outer shell electrons transition to fill these vacancies, emitting X-ray photons with energies specific to the energy difference between the involved electron energy levels. This process results in the characteristic X-ray lines observed on a continuous background in X-ray spectra. \n\nThe other options, such as electrons producing \u010cerenkov radiation, electrons colliding with phonons in the metal, and electrons combining with protons to form neutrons, are not relevant mechanisms for producing characteristic X-rays in this context.",
