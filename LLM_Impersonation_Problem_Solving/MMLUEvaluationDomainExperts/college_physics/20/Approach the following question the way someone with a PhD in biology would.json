Characteristic X rays, appearing as sharp lines on a continuous background, are produced when high-energy electrons bombard a metal target. Which of the following processes results in the characteristic X rays?\nA: Electrons producing \u010cerenkov radiation\nB: Electrons colliding with phonons in the metal\nC: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\nD: Electrons combining with protons to form neutrons",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "C: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\n\nCharacteristic X rays are produced when high-energy electrons collide with inner shell electrons in a metal target, resulting in the removal of electrons from these inner shell levels. This creates vacancies, which are then filled by electrons from outer shell levels. As electrons transition between energy levels, characteristic X rays are emitted as a result of the differences in energy levels between the initial and final states of the electrons. This process is known as characteristic X-ray emission.",
