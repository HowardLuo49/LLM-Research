The electric displacement current, as described by Maxwell's equations, is given by the equation \u2207 \u22c5 D = \u03c1_f + \u2202B/\u2202t, where D is the electric displacement field, \u03c1_f is the free charge density, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, the electric displacement current through a surface S can be represented by the equation \u222e_S D \u22c5 dA = \u03b5_0 \u2202\u03a6_E / \u2202t, where \u03b5_0 is the permittivity of free space and \u03a6_E is the electric flux through the surface S.
