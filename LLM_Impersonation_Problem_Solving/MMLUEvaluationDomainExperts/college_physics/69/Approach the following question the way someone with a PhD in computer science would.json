    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is A: rate of change of the electric flux through S.\n\nIn Maxwell's equations, the displacement current is a term added to Amp\u00e8re's law to account for the contribution of changing electric fields to the magnetic field. Mathematically, the displacement current is related to the rate of change of the electric flux through a surface.\n\nTherefore, the electric displacement current through a surface S is indeed proportional to the rate of change of the electric flux through S, as stated in option A.",
