Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state in the excited states of the helium atom can be most accurately understood in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, including having the same spin. In the case of helium, when the electron spins are parallel (ortho- state), they are in a higher energy configuration compared to when the spins are antiparallel (para- state) due to the repulsion between the electrons with parallel spins. This leads to the ortho- state having a higher energy, and therefore a lower stability, than the para- state.",
