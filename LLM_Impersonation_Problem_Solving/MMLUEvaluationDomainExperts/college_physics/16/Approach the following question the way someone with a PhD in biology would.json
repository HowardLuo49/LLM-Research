Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state in the excited states of the helium atom can be understood in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers, including spin. In the ortho- state, the electrons have parallel spins, which is a higher energy configuration due to the increased electron-electron repulsion. In contrast, the para- state with antiparallel spins has lower energy and is therefore more stable. This stability is a result of the Pauli exclusion principle, which limits the possible spin configurations of electrons in an atom.",
