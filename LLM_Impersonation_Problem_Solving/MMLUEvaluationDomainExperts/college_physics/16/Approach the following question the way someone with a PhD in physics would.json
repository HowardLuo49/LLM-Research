Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the principles of quantum mechanics. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers, including their spin. This means that when two electrons have parallel spins (ortho- state), they cannot occupy the same energy level, leading to a lower energy state compared to when they have antiparallel spins (para- state). Therefore, the correct answer is B: The Pauli exclusion principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the Bohr model of the atom, and nuclear hyperfine coupling are not directly relevant to the observed energy difference between para- and ortho- states in the helium atom.",
