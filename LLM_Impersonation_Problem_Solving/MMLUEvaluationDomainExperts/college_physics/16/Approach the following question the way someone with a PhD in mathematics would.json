Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As an expert in mathematics with a PhD, I would approach this question by first recognizing that the energy difference between para- and ortho- states in the helium atom is related to the electron spins. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in a given system can have the same set of quantum numbers, including spin. This principle plays a crucial role in determining the electronic structure of atoms.\n\nIn the case of helium, when two electrons occupy the same orbital, they must have opposite spins in order to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. This results in two possible configurations: one with parallel spins (ortho-) and one with antiparallel spins (para-). \n\nThe observation that the ortho- state has lower energy than the para- state can be understood in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons in the ortho- state have parallel spins, which allows them to be closer to each other in space, leading to a more stable configuration and lower energy. On the other hand, electrons in the para- state have antiparallel spins, leading to a higher energy due to greater repulsion between the electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle",
