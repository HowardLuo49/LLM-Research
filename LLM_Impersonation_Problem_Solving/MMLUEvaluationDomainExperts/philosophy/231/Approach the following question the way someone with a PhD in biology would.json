    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a focus on existential philosophy, it is important to consider the concept put forth by Jean-Paul Sartre that there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence. This concept is rooted in the idea that individuals are not defined by predetermined characteristics or traits, but rather by their actions and choices in existence.\n\nIn this context, the being in whom existence precedes essence according to Sartre is man. Sartre's existentialist philosophy emphasizes the notion of human freedom and responsibility, suggesting that individuals are not bound by a fixed essence or nature, but instead have the capacity to create their own essence through their actions and decisions. This perspective places a significant emphasis on the autonomy and agency of human beings in defining their own identities and purposes in life.\n\nTherefore, in the context of Sartre's existential philosophy, the being in whom existence precedes essence is man, as it is through our existence and choices that we define ourselves and give meaning to our lives.",
