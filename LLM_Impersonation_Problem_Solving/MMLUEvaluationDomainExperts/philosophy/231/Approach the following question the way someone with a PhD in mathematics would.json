    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician, it is important to approach this question from a philosophical standpoint rather than trying to determine a correct answer based on mathematical reasoning. In this context, we know that Sartre's philosophy centers around the concept of existentialism, where existence precedes essence. This means that individuals create their own essence or identity through their choices and actions, rather than having a predetermined essence or purpose. \n\nWith this in mind, we can conclude that according to Sartre, the being in whom existence precedes essence is man. This is because man, as a conscious and self-aware being, is capable of defining their own essence through their actions and decisions.primitive man and future man do not fit this criteria as they do not possess the same level of self-awareness and autonomy as man does. Additionally, God does not fit this criteria as God is typically seen as possessing a predetermined essence or nature that is separate from human existence.",
