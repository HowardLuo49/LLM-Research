    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. Plato's suggestion that knowledge is innate or remembered as a result of being triggered by experience is in response to a paradox he sets up for himself.  The paradox, now referred to as Meno's Paradox, has to do with the question of:\nA: how a person can remember anything about the realm of the Forms after the shock of being born into this world.\nB: how knowledge of the Forms can ever be anything other than a generalization of experience.\nC: how anyone can recognize the correct answer to a question without already knowing the answer.\nD: how concepts bound to the realm of becoming have meaning only when associated with the realm of Being.",

    "gpt_response": "A: how a person can remember anything about the realm of the Forms after the shock of being born into this world.\n\nA person with a PhD in computer science might approach this question from a computational perspective, considering the concept of memory in terms of information storage and retrieval. They may analyze Plato's idea of knowledge being innate or remembered in terms of how information is acquired, stored, and accessed in the human brain or in artificial intelligence systems. They may also explore the implications of this idea for machine learning algorithms and knowledge representation schemes. Additionally, they may seek to relate Plato's concept of innate knowledge to current cognitive science theories and computational models of learning and memory.",
