    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. Plato's suggestion that knowledge is innate or remembered as a result of being triggered by experience is in response to a paradox he sets up for himself.  The paradox, now referred to as Meno's Paradox, has to do with the question of:\nA: how a person can remember anything about the realm of the Forms after the shock of being born into this world.\nB: how knowledge of the Forms can ever be anything other than a generalization of experience.\nC: how anyone can recognize the correct answer to a question without already knowing the answer.\nD: how concepts bound to the realm of becoming have meaning only when associated with the realm of Being.",

    "gpt_response": "A literature scholar with a PhD would likely approach this question by first delving into Plato's philosophy and examining the text where Meno's Paradox is presented. They might analyze the dialogue between Socrates and Meno to understand the implications of the paradox and how it relates to the broader themes of knowledge, truth, and the nature of reality in Plato's work.\n\nThe scholar might also explore the concept of innate knowledge as expounded by Plato and how it contrasts with empiricism and other philosophical perspectives on the origins of knowledge. They might investigate how Plato's theory of recollection fits within his larger metaphysical framework, including the distinction between the realm of the Forms and the world of appearances.\n\nIn considering the options presented in the question, the scholar might critically evaluate each response in light of Plato's philosophy, looking for the most coherent and philosophically sound interpretation. They might also draw on their knowledge of literature and philosophical analysis to construct a nuanced and well-supported argument for their chosen answer.",
