    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by examining Stevenson's views on the role of empirical methods in moral philosophy. Stevenson is known for his influential work in metaethics, particularly for his emotivist theory of ethical language, which posits that ethical statements are expressions of one's emotions rather than objective truths. \n\nIn his writings, Stevenson does not outright reject the use of empirical methods in resolving ethical disagreement. Instead, he acknowledges that empirical evidence can play a role in shaping moral beliefs and values. However, he also emphasizes the subjectivity and emotive nature of moral judgments, suggesting that empirical methods may not always be sufficient for resolving ethical disagreements, as individual emotions and values can vary greatly.\n\nTherefore, based on Stevenson's perspective, I would argue that option B is the most accurate representation of his views. Empirical methods can be helpful in certain cases, but they are not always the ultimate or sole determining factor in resolving ethical disagreements. Stevenson would likely caution against relying solely on empirical evidence without considering the subjective and emotional aspects of moral decision-making.",
