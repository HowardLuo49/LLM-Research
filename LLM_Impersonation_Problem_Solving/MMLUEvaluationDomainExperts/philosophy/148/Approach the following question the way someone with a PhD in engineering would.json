From a PhD in engineering perspective, it is understood that empirical methods have their limitations when applied to ethical disagreements. While empirical evidence can be valuable in informing ethical decision-making, it is not always sufficient to fully resolve complex ethical dilemmas. Ethical disagreements often involve subjective values and beliefs that cannot be solely determined through empirical data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB: are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreement, but are not always sufficient.",
