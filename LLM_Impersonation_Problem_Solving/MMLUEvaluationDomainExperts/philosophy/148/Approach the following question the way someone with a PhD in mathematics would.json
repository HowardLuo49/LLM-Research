In the realm of ethics and moral philosophy, empirical methods may involve studying human behavior, conducting surveys or experiments, and analyzing data to understand ethical beliefs and values.\n\nStevenson's perspective likely suggests that empirical methods have some utility in resolving ethical disagreement, as they provide a means to study and understand human moral reasoning and behavior. However, it is unlikely that Stevenson would argue that empirical methods are always sufficient for resolving ethical disagreement, as ethical questions often involve complex value judgments that may not be fully captured through empirical investigation alone.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer from a mathematical perspective would be B: empirical methods are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreement, but are not always sufficient. This answer acknowledges the potential value of empirical methods in studying ethical questions while also recognizing the limitations of such approaches in addressing the full complexity of moral reasoning and ethical dilemmas.",
