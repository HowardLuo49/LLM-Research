    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question from a mathematical standpoint, we must first understand the philosophical principles behind Epicurus' teachings. Epicurus believed that the ultimate goal in life was to achieve a state of ataraxia, or freedom from pain and fear. In this sense, the wise man would seek to minimize his suffering and live a tranquil existence.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can eliminate option A, as a yearning for the end of life would not align with the pursuit of ataraxia. Option B, fearing the cessation of life, would also be counterintuitive to Epicurean philosophy, as fear is viewed as a source of suffering.\n\nOption C, being unconcerned with death, seems to be more in line with Epicurus' teachings. The wise man would accept death as a natural part of life and not let the fear of it consume him.\n\nOption D, realizing that death is an illusion, does not appear to be consistent with Epicurus' beliefs. While Epicurus did argue that death should not be feared as it is merely the absence of sensation, he did not go so far as to claim that death is an illusion.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer would be C: the wise man is unconcerned with death.",
