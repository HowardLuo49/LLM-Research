    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "From a physics perspective, Epicurus' philosophy on death can be evaluated through the lens of the conservation of energy principle. According to this principle, energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred or converted from one form to another. Applying this concept to the idea of death, it can be understood that the essence of a being, which can be equated to energy in a physical sense, does not truly cease to exist upon death but rather undergoes a transformation.\n\nIn this context, the wise man, according to Epicurus, would realize that death is not something to be feared or yearned for but rather accepted as a natural process of transformation. Therefore, option C: is unconcerned with death, aligns with Epicurus' teachings and the physicist's perspective on the eternal nature of energy. Additionally, option D: realizes that death is an illusion, can also be justified as the wise man would understand that death is not the end but merely a transition to a different state of existence.",
