    "gpt_response": "Hume's philosophical perspective in relation to beauty perception is often interpreted as asserting that each individual mind perceives a different beauty. This is in line with his empiricist views, which suggest that experiences and perceptions are subjective and dependent on the individual's own background, beliefs, and experiences. Therefore, it can be argued that Hume would align with option B - a different beauty - as his position on aesthetic judgments tends to emphasize the diversity of human perceptions rather than a universal or objective standard of beauty.",
