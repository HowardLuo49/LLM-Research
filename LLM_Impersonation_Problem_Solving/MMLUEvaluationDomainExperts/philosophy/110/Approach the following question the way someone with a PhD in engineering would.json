    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing David Hume's philosophical perspective on perception and aesthetics. Hume, a prominent figure in empiricism, argued that the mind perceives beauty subjectively, meaning that it is based on individual experiences, emotions, and personal preferences. Therefore, the correct answer would be B: a different beauty. Hume believed that beauty is a contingent property that exists in the eye of the beholder, rather than as an objective quality inherent in the object being perceived. This concept aligns with the idea that beauty is a subjective experience that can vary from person to person based on their unique perceptions and interpretations.",
