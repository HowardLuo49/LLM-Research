    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by examining the philosophical theories of perception and aesthetics. Hume, a prominent British empiricist philosopher, challenges traditional notions of beauty as an objective quality in his Treatise of Human Nature. He argues that beauty is not an inherent property of objects but rather a subjective experience that varies from person to person.\n\nBased on Hume's theories of perception, it can be inferred that he believes each mind perceives beauty in a different way (option B). This is because our perceptions are shaped by our individual experiences, emotions, and cultural backgrounds, leading to diverse interpretations of what is considered beautiful.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that Hume's perspective aligns with the idea that beauty is subjective and that each mind perceives it differently, rather than perceiving a universally objective beauty.",
