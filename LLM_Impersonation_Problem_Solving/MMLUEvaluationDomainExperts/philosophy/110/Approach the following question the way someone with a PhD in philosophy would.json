    "gpt_response": "Hume posits that each mind perceives subjective beauty, thus option B: a different beauty. This is in line with his empiricist epistemology, which asserts that knowledge is derived from sensory experiences and subjectivity plays a crucial role in shaping individual perceptions of beauty. Hume's notion of beauty is not grounded in objective or universal standards, but rather in the unique qualia of each individual's perception. This leads to a plurality of experiences and interpretations of beauty, rather than a singular, objective standard that all minds perceive.",
