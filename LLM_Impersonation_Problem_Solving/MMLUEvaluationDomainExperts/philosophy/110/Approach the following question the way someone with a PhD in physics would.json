    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, it is important to approach philosophical questions with a critical and analytical mindset. In this case, Hume's view on perception of beauty is interesting to consider. Hume argues that each mind perceives beauty subjectively, based on its own unique experiences and perspectives. This aligns with the idea that beauty is a subjective concept, and can vary from person to person.\n\nIn this context, Hume would likely argue that each mind perceives beauty differently (option B), rather than perceiving objective beauty (option D) which suggests a universal standard of beauty. Hume's philosophy emphasizes the importance of individual perception and interpretation, rather than an external, objective standard. This aligns with the principles of subjectivity and empiricism that Hume often employs in his philosophical arguments.\n\nTherefore, a physicist with a deep understanding of Hume's philosophy would likely select option B, as it aligns with Hume's views on perception and the subjective nature of beauty.",
