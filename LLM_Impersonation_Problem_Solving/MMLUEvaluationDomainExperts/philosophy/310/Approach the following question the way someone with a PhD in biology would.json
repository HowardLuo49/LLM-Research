    "gpt_response": "As a PhD biologist, I can confirm that all of the options presented (physical injury, stress and anxiety, impaired development) are forms of harm that research participants may potentially suffer during the course of a study. Physical injury can occur as a result of invasive procedures or accidents, while stress and anxiety can manifest from the pressure of participating in research. Impaired development may arise if the research intervention negatively impacts the participant's growth or functioning. It is essential for researchers to carefully consider and minimize potential risks to participants in order to uphold rigorous ethical standards in scientific inquiry.",
