    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, it is important to consider the ethical implications and potential harms that research participants may experience in any study. In this context, all of the options presented - physical injury, stress and anxiety, and impaired development - are indeed forms of harm that participants could potentially suffer. Physical injury could occur if participants are exposed to dangerous conditions or procedures during the study. Stress and anxiety could result from the psychological impact of participating in research, such as fear of the unknown or discomfort with disclosing personal information. Impaired development can occur if the study interferes with normal growth or learning processes. Therefore, it is imperative for researchers to take precautions to minimize these risks and protect the well-being of their participants.",
