Natural science deals with the empirical study of the natural world, including biology, chemistry, physics, and other related fields. Philosophical inquiries into the principles and laws governing the natural world can provide practical knowledge and understanding that can be applied to various real-world problems and challenges. In this sense, natural science can be seen as a highly practical branch of philosophy that seeks to uncover and explain the fundamental truths of the natural world, enabling us to make informed decisions and choices based on evidence and reasoning.",
