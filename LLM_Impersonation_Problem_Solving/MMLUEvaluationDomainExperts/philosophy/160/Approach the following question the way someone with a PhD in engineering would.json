    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing Cicero's views on philosophy and determining which branch aligns most closely with practical applications in engineering field. Cicero believed that the most practical branch of philosophy dealt with the application of moral duties in everyday life, making option C: moral duties, the most likely answer. This branch of philosophy focuses on ethical principles and decision-making, which are fundamental in engineering to ensure responsible and sustainable practices. While logic and natural science are important in the field of engineering, it is ultimately moral duties that guide ethical decision-making and responsible actions. Therefore, based on Cicero's perspective, option C is the most relevant and practical branch of philosophy for an engineer to consider.",
