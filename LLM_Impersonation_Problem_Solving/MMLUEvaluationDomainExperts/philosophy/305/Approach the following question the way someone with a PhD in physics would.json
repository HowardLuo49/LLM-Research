    "gpt_response": "Aesthetic values have to do with the subjective judgment of beauty and pleasure derived from works of art and other objects. These values are often discussed in the context of philosophical aesthetics, which seeks to understand the nature of aesthetic experiences and the criteria by which we judge the beauty or merit of art. As a physicist, I would approach this question by examining the psychological, neural, and cognitive processes underlying aesthetic perception and appreciation. This may involve studying the role of color, form, composition, symmetry, and other visual features in eliciting aesthetic responses, as well as exploring how cultural, historical, and social factors influence our aesthetic preferences. Ultimately, the study of aesthetic values can shed light on the fundamental human experiences of beauty, creativity, and imagination.",
