    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by analyzing the various interpretations and implications of each statement within the context of literary and philosophical theories. \n\nFirstly, the control condition claiming that it is morally wrong to ever lose control of oneself (option A) could be seen through the lens of classic tragic literature, where characters often face dire consequences for their loss of control or unchecked emotions. This view aligns with the Aristotelian concept of hamartia, or tragic flaw, where characters' downfall is often precipitated by their lack of self-control.\n\nOption B, stating that it is morally wrong to try to control the lives of others, brings to mind themes of power dynamics and autonomy found in works such as George Orwell's \"1984\" or Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\". These texts critique totalitarian regimes that seek to control every aspect of individuals' lives, highlighting the ethical implications of such control.\n\nOption C presents the idea that one cannot be morally assessed for factors outside of one's control, which resonates with existentialist literature that grapples with questions of free will and determinism. Authors such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus explore the tension between personal responsibility and external circumstances beyond one's control in works like \"No Exit\" and \"The Stranger\".\n\nLastly, option D suggests that individuals cannot be morally blamed for taking control of their own lives, echoing themes of empowerment and self-determination found in feminist literature and postcolonial narratives. Authors like Virginia Woolf and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie challenge societal constraints and advocate for individuals to assert their agency and assert control over their own destinies.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in literature would approach the question of moral control with a nuanced understanding of how different perspectives and interpretations intersect with literary themes and philosophical concepts. Each statement offers a unique lens through which to explore the complexities of control, agency, and morality in a variety of literary texts and theoretical frameworks.",
