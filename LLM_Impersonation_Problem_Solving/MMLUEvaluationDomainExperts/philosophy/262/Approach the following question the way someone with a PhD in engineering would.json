    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, my understanding of justice aligns with the theory proposed by W.D. Ross, a philosopher known for his work in ethics. According to Ross, justice is not simply about the adherence to laws or contracts, but rather about ensuring that individuals receive what is due to them based on their merits. This means that justice involves a fair and equitable distribution of resources, rewards, and opportunities that align with an individual's contributions and deserts. Therefore, in the context of Ross's theory, option C: when the distribution of happiness is in accordance with merit, would be the most accurate representation of justice.",
