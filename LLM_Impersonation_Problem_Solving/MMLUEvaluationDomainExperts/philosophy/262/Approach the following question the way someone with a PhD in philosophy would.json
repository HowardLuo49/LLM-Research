    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by first examining the views of W.D. Ross on justice. Ross was a prominent philosopher known for his work on moral philosophy and ethics. In his writings, Ross put forth the concept of prima facie duties, which are moral obligations that are binding unless overridden by a more pressing duty.\n\nBased on Ross's framework, I would argue that justice, according to Ross, is most closely aligned with option B: when contracts and promises are adhered to. This is because adhering to contracts and promises is inherently tied to the concept of duty and obligation, which are fundamental components of Ross's ethical theory. Additionally, honoring contracts and promises can be seen as a manifestation of respect for others and their autonomy, which are central to Ross's moral philosophy.\n\nWhile all the options presented may have some relation to justice in certain contexts, Ross's emphasis on duty, obligation, and respect for others leads me to conclude that the most fitting interpretation of justice within his framework would be adherence to contracts and promises.",
