In this case, we are asked to determine Ross's view on justice. \n\nFirstly, I would consider the definition of justice as given by Ross in his work. I would examine how he defines justice and what principles or criteria he uses to determine when justice is present. \n\nNext, I would analyze each of the options presented in the question in relation to Ross's definition of justice. I would assess whether each option aligns with Ross's conceptualization of justice and whether it accurately reflects his views on the topic. \n\nBased on my analysis, I would then select the option that best corresponds to Ross's interpretation of justice. This may involve applying logical reasoning, critical thinking, and an understanding of Ross's theoretical framework to arrive at the most appropriate answer. \n\nIn conclusion, as a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by carefully examining Ross's perspective on justice, evaluating the provided options in relation to his views, and selecting the answer that best reflects his understanding of justice.",
