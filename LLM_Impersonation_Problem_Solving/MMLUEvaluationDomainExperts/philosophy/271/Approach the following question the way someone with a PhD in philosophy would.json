Moore was a prominent British moral philosopher who argued for a form of ethical intuitionism, asserting that goodness is a simple, non-natural property that cannot be reduced to any other property.\n\nIn Moore's view, when he says that \"pleasure is good,\" he is making a claim about the intrinsic value of pleasure. To Moore, goodness is an irreducible property that can simply be perceived by intuition. Therefore, when Moore asserts that pleasure is good, he is not simply saying that pleasure is desired or pleasant, but rather that pleasure possesses inherent value.\n\nGiven this understanding of Moore's philosophy, the statement that \"pleasure is good\" does not equate to any of the options provided. While pleasure may be desired or pleasant, Moore's assertion is rooted in a more foundational claim about the intrinsic goodness of pleasure itself.
