Feinberg claims that the story about Abraham Lincoln:\nA: provides some evidence for psychological egoism.\nB: provides some evidence against psychological egoism.\nC: provides no evidence for or against psychological egoism.\nD: actually involves a confusion between ethical egoism and psychological egoism.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first analyzing the definitions of psychological egoism and ethical egoism. Psychological egoism posits that individuals are inherently selfish and always act in their own self-interest, while ethical egoism is the ethical theory that individuals should always act in their own self-interest.\n\nIn the story about Abraham Lincoln, it is often cited that his decision to free the slaves was motivated by his desire to preserve the Union rather than out of a purely self-interested motive. This would suggest that the story provides evidence against psychological egoism, as it demonstrates an instance where an individual acted in a way that was not solely self-serving.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the correct answer would be:\n\nB: provides some evidence against psychological egoism.",
