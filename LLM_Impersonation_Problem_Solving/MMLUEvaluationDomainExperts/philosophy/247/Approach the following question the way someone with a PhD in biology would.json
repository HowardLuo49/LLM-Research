    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In the realm of aesthetics, the view that art is defined by its form is known as formalism. This perspective emphasizes the intrinsic visual and structural qualities of a work of art, focusing on elements such as line, shape, color, and composition rather than external factors such as the artist's intention or cultural context. Formalism originated in the early 20th century as a reaction against the dominant trend of expressionism, which prioritized emotional expression and personal experience in art. Supporters of formalism argue that a work of art should be judged based on its formal properties alone, independent of its subjective or social significance. This approach has been influential in shaping the discourse surrounding art criticism and has been particularly prominent in the fields of modern and contemporary art.",
