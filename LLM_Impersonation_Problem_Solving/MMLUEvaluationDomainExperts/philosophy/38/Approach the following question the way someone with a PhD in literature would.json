    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Kant, in his philosophical work, emphasizes the intrinsic value of reason in guiding ethical decision-making and emphasizing the importance of autonomous rationality. His claim regarding the natural purpose of reason is closely tied to his broader moral philosophy, particularly his conception of the good will as central to ethical action. Kant argues that the proper function of reason is not merely to seek happiness or pleasure, which he considers to be contingent and subjective, but rather to seek knowledge and ultimately to cultivate a good will. \n\nFor Kant, the good will is the rational capacity to act in accordance with moral principles, regardless of external circumstances or personal desires. This concept is vital in Kant's moral philosophy as it provides a universal and objective foundation for ethical behavior. Therefore, the answer to the question of the natural purpose of reason according to Kant would be option D: produce a good will. It is through reason's ability to guide individuals towards acting from a sense of duty and moral obligation that the true purpose of reason is fulfilled in Kant's ethical framework.",
