    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. According to Socrates, the value or quality of one's life depends on understanding the principles of, or basic rationale for human existence.  Without such knowledge (he suggests) life lacks virtue, because:\nA: acting virtuously means acting in way that is informed about what one is doing and why.\nB: someone who does not understand existence philosophically could never do anything right.\nC: to have the power or ability to do anything at all requires that we know what we are doing.\nD: not only is virtue knowledge but also the unexamined life is not worth living.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "From a mathematical perspective, Socrates' assertion can be interpreted as a fundamental axiom in the mathematical reasoning process. Just as in mathematics, where understanding the principles and concepts is crucial for solving complex problems, in life, the understanding of the basic rationale for human existence is necessary for living a virtuous life.\n\nIn the context of Socrates' argument, option A aligns well with this mathematical perspective. Acting virtuously implies a conscious and informed decision-making process, where one understands the underlying principles of their actions. This parallels the mathematical concept of informed decision-making in problem-solving, where knowledge of the underlying principles is key to successfully solving complex mathematical problems.\n\nAdditionally, option D further reinforces the importance of knowledge and examination in the pursuit of a fulfilling life. In mathematics, the rigorous examination and understanding of mathematical concepts lead to new discoveries and insights. Similarly, in life, the examination and understanding of the fundamental principles of existence are essential for a meaningful and fulfilling life.",
