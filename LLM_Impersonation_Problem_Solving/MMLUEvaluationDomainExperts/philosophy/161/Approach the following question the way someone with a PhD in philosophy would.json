    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. According to Socrates, the value or quality of one's life depends on understanding the principles of, or basic rationale for human existence.  Without such knowledge (he suggests) life lacks virtue, because:\nA: acting virtuously means acting in way that is informed about what one is doing and why.\nB: someone who does not understand existence philosophically could never do anything right.\nC: to have the power or ability to do anything at all requires that we know what we are doing.\nD: not only is virtue knowledge but also the unexamined life is not worth living.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As Socrates famously asserts in Plato's Apology, the core tenet of his philosophy is that \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\" This declaration encapsulates his belief that a life devoid of philosophical inquiry and understanding fundamentally lacks virtue. In Socrates' view, virtue is intimately tied to knowledge and understanding - a person can only truly act virtuously if they are cognizant of the principles and rationale underlying their actions.\n\nIndeed, Socrates posits that to act virtuously is to act in a manner that is both informed and intentional. Without a deep comprehension of the fundamental truths of existence, individuals are unable to truly grasp the implications of their actions and make morally sound decisions. In this sense, a lack of philosophical understanding renders one incapable of potentially achieving virtue, as their actions are dictated more by ignorance than by deliberate thought and reflection.\n\nMoreover, Socrates contends that the very essence of agency and power in human life stems from knowledge and understanding. To have the ability to act in any capacity necessitates a level of awareness about what one is doing and why. Thus, in the absence of philosophical investigation and contemplation, individuals are left adrift in a state of unknowing, unable to fully exercise their agency and engage in meaningful, virtuous actions.\n\nUltimately, Socrates' assertion that the unexamined life is not worth living underscores the profound significance he places on philosophical understanding in the pursuit of virtue. By emphasizing the intrinsic connection between knowledge, virtue, and the meaningfulness of life, Socrates challenges individuals to engage in critical self-reflection and intellectual inquiry as essential components of a life well-lived.",
