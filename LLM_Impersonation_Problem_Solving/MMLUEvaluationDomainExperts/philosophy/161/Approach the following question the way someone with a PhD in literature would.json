    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. According to Socrates, the value or quality of one's life depends on understanding the principles of, or basic rationale for human existence.  Without such knowledge (he suggests) life lacks virtue, because:\nA: acting virtuously means acting in way that is informed about what one is doing and why.\nB: someone who does not understand existence philosophically could never do anything right.\nC: to have the power or ability to do anything at all requires that we know what we are doing.\nD: not only is virtue knowledge but also the unexamined life is not worth living.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar in literature, one can analyze Socrates' perspective on the value of life through a literary lens, understanding his ideas as a form of philosophical dialogue and inquiry. In this context, Socrates' emphasis on understanding the principles of human existence to lead a virtuous life aligns with the overarching themes of knowledge, self-examination, and morality that often permeate philosophical and literary works.\n\nIn addressing the question at hand, a scholar with a PhD in literature would likely argue that option A, \"acting virtuously means acting in a way that is informed about what one is doing and why,\" best encapsulates Socrates' perspective. This interpretation emphasizes Socrates' belief that true virtue arises from a deep understanding of the underlying reasons and principles guiding one's actions, rather than mere adherence to external standards or codes of conduct. Through critical analysis and self-reflection, individuals can achieve a higher level of moral awareness and make ethical decisions based on reasoned judgment.\n\nFurthermore, the reference to \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" in option D underscores the importance of self-examination and philosophical inquiry in Socrates' philosophy. By encouraging individuals to question their beliefs, values, and actions, Socrates challenges them to actively engage in introspection and intellectual exploration, thereby fostering personal growth, self-awareness, and moral development.\n\nOverall, a scholar with a PhD in literature would likely interpret Socrates' ideas on the value of life through a nuanced and multifaceted lens, drawing connections between his philosophical principles and the broader themes of knowledge, self-discovery, and morality that resonate in literary texts and cultural discourse.",
