    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first considering the role of ethics in the field of biology. Ethics in biology often revolve around the concept of values, virtues, and moral principles that guide ethical decision-making in research, conservation, and the treatment of living organisms.\n\nIn this context, Nussbaum's assertion that at the first stage of ethical inquiry, terms for the virtues should be neutral between competing specifications of the virtue aligns with the importance of objectivity and impartiality in ethical reasoning. By adopting a neutral stance, one can avoid bias and consider different perspectives when evaluating ethical dilemmas in biology.\n\nFurthermore, Nussbaum's emphasis on neutrality in defining terms for virtues also reflects the complexities and nuances involved in ethical inquiry within the biological sciences. As researchers navigate issues such as animal welfare, genetic engineering, and ecosystem conservation, it is essential to maintain a balanced and open-minded approach that takes into account various ethical frameworks and perspectives.\n\nOverall, from a biologist's perspective, Nussbaum's suggestion that terms for virtues should be neutral between competing specifications of the virtue resonates with the interdisciplinary nature of ethical inquiry in biology and highlights the need for a thoughtful and inclusive approach to addressing ethical challenges in the field.",
