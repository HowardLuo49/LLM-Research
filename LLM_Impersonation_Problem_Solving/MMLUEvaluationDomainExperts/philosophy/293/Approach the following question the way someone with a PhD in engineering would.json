    "gpt_response": "Nussbaum's claim that at the first stage of ethical inquiry, terms for the virtues should be neutral between competing specifications of the virtue aligns with the need for precision and impartiality in defining and analyzing ethical concepts. By maintaining a neutral stance, one can objectively evaluate different interpretations and applications of virtues without bias or preconceived notions. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities inherent in ethical discussions and helps in formulating a robust framework for ethical inquiry. Therefore, the correct answer is C: neutral between competing specifications of the virtue.",
