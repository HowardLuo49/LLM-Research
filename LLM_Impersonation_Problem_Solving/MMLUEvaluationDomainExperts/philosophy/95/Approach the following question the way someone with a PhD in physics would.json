    "gpt_response": "According to Hobbes, whenever and wherever men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, there is war. This is highlighted in his famous work \"Leviathan\", where he argues that without a sovereign authority to enforce order, individuals will naturally act in their own self-interest, leading to a state of constant conflict and warfare. This is in contrast to the concept of democracy, which involves the rule of the people, and freedom, which implies the absence of constraints or limitations. Hobbes's theory underscores the importance of a strong central authority to maintain peace and social order.",
