According to the scripture that Butler discusses in Sermon One, human beings are:\nA: independent and autonomous individuals.\nB: all a part of one body.\nC: all a part of God.\nD: part of the animal kingdom.",
    "solution": "B",

The scripture likely refers to the interconnectedness and interdependence of individuals within a community or society, rather than solely emphasizing an individualistic or autonomous existence. This aligns with the understanding of systems engineering, where individual components are seen as interconnected parts of a larger, complex system. Therefore, the most accurate interpretation would be option B: all a part of one body, highlighting the interconnected nature of human beings within a larger societal or spiritual framework.",
