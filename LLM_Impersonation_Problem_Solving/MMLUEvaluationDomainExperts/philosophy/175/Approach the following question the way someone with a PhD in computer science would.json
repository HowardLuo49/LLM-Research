    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I must approach this question from an analytical and critical perspective. The scripture that Butler discusses in Sermon One is likely to be examined in the context of metaphorical or symbolic representations of human beings.\n\nIn this case, the scripture likely presents human beings as a metaphorical \"body\" or entity that is interconnected and interdependent. This aligns with option B, which states that human beings are all a part of one body. This interpretation suggests that human beings are not independent and autonomous individuals, as option A suggests. Additionally, human beings being part of God or the animal kingdom does not align with the likely metaphorical interpretation of the scripture in question.\n\nTherefore, as a computer scientist, I would argue that according to the scripture in Sermon One that Butler discusses, human beings are portrayed as all a part of one body, emphasizing interconnectedness and interdependence.",
