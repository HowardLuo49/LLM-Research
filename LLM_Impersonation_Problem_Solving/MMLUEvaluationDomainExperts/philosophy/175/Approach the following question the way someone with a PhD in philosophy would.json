According to the scripture that Butler discusses in Sermon One, human beings are:\nA: independent and autonomous individuals.\nB: all a part of one body.\nC: all a part of God.\nD: part of the animal kingdom.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Butler's interpretation of the scripture in Sermon One, it is evident that human beings are posited as interconnected and interdependent entities, forming a collective whole akin to one body. This perspective suggests an ontology that highlights the interconnectedness and shared essence of humanity, emphasizing unity and mutual dependence rather than individual autonomy. Furthermore, the notion of humans as part of God or the animal kingdom is not directly supported by Butler's discussion, which instead emphasizes the interconnectedness and mutual dependence of human beings. Thus, a nuanced reading of Butler's sermon suggests that human beings are portrayed as a unified collective entity, interconnected and interdependent, rather than as autonomous individuals or divinely or naturally differentiated beings.",
