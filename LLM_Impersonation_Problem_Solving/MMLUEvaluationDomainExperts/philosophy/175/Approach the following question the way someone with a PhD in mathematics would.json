According to the scripture that Butler discusses in Sermon One, human beings are:\nA: independent and autonomous individuals.\nB: all a part of one body.\nC: all a part of God.\nD: part of the animal kingdom.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by interpreting the scripture in a nuanced and analytical manner. In Butler's Sermon One, the idea of human beings being part of one body suggests a deep interconnectedness and unity among individuals. This concept can also be understood through mathematical principles such as network theory or graph theory, where nodes represent individuals and edges represent connections between them. This interconnectedness implies a complex and interdependent relationship among human beings, rather than viewing them as independent and autonomous individuals. Therefore, based on the scripture discussed in Sermon One, the most appropriate answer would be:\n\nB: all a part of one body.",
