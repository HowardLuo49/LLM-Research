According to the scripture that Butler discusses in Sermon One, human beings are:\nA: independent and autonomous individuals.\nB: all a part of one body.\nC: all a part of God.\nD: part of the animal kingdom.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In analyzing the scripture discussed in Sermon One, it is evident that human beings are portrayed as all being part of one body. This concept aligns well with biological principles, specifically in the context of understanding the interconnectedness and interdependence of different components within a system. In this case, human beings can be seen as analogous to the various cells and tissues that make up an organism, each playing a unique role but ultimately functioning together as a cohesive unit. This perspective highlights the importance of cooperation and mutual support among humans, emphasizing the idea that the actions of one individual can have ripple effects on the entire collective group. Therefore, from a biological standpoint, the notion of human beings being all part of one body resonates with the concept of unity and interconnectedness in biological systems.",
