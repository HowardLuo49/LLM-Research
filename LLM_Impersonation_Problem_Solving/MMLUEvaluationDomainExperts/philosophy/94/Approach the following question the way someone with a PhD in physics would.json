Stevenson's moral relativism theory argues that moral judgments are not objective statements about the world, but are instead expressions of personal beliefs and attitudes. In this view, moral disagreements arise from differing beliefs about what is right or wrong, rather than differences in interests, theories, or practices. This understanding of moral disagreements as rooted in conflicting beliefs is a key aspect of Stevenson's arguments against ethical objectivism and in favor of moral subjectivism.",
