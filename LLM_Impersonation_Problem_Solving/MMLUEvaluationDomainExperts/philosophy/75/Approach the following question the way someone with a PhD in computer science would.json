    "gpt_response": "The important formal characteristic of art that is most relevant from a computational perspective is coherence. Coherence refers to the arrangement and organization of the elements within a work of art, which can be analyzed and understood through formal computational methods such as algorithmic analysis and pattern recognition. This formal characteristic is essential for creating meaningful and aesthetically pleasing artworks, and it plays a crucial role in the interpretation and appreciation of art in both traditional and digital mediums.",
