    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in physics, I approach this question with a logical and analytical perspective. Baier's argument regarding moral rules suggests that they should be applied uniformly to all individuals unless there are morally relevant differences present. This perspective aligns with a principle of fairness and equality in the application of moral standards. The argument also implies that moral rules are not absolute and may vary depending on the context and ethical considerations. Therefore, option B, which states that moral rules must be applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences, would likely be the most appropriate choice based on Baier's argument.",
