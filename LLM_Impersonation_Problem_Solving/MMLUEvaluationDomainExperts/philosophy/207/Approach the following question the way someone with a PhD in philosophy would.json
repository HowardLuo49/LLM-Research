Baier is known for her work in moral philosophy, specifically addressing issues related to moral rules and their application.\n\nIn her argument, Baier emphasizes the importance of applying moral rules consistently and fairly. She acknowledges that there may be morally relevant differences between individuals or groups that could impact how moral rules are applied. However, Baier ultimately asserts that moral rules should be applied to everyone alike, unless there are clear and compelling reasons to consider otherwise.\n\nBased on this understanding of Baier's argument, I would argue that the correct answer to the question is B: moral rules must be applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences. Baier's position is rooted in a commitment to fairness and consistency in moral decision-making, while also recognizing the potential for unique circumstances that may warrant exceptions to this general principle.",
