    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering it from a logical and analytical perspective. Baier's argument regarding moral rules revolves around the concept of fairness and equality in their application. \n\nOption A suggests that moral rules always must be applied to everyone alike, which may be too rigid of a stance to take. In certain situations, there may be morally relevant differences that necessitate different treatment. \n\nOption B is a more nuanced interpretation of Baier's argument, stating that moral rules must be applied to everyone alike unless there are morally relevant differences that justify exceptions. This aligns more closely with the idea of fairness and equality in moral decision-making. \n\nOption C, that moral rules only apply to some members of a group, contradicts Baier's argument and goes against the principle of universality in moral rules. \n\nOption D, asserting that moral rules are the same in every society, is a separate issue from Baier's argument and pertains more to cultural relativism. Baier's argument seems to focus more on the application of moral rules rather than their cultural variability. \n\nIn conclusion, option B aligns most closely with the concept of moral rules as presented by Baier, acknowledging the need for universal application while also allowing for exceptions in the presence of morally relevant differences.",
