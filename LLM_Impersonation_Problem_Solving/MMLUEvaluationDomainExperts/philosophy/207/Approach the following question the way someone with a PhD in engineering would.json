Baier argues that moral rules:\nA: always must be applied to everyone alike.\nB: must applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences.\nC: only apply to some members of a group.\nD: are the same in every society.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, it is important to approach questions regarding morality and ethics with a rational and analytical mindset. Baier's argument regarding moral rules suggests that they must be applied to everyone alike, unless there are morally relevant differences that warrant different treatment. This viewpoint emphasizes the importance of fairness and consistency in the application of moral rules.\n\nIn the context of engineering, adherence to moral rules and ethical principles is crucial in decision-making processes, especially when considering the impact of engineering projects on society and the environment. It is essential to consider the broader implications of our actions and ensure that ethical considerations are integrated into engineering practices.\n\nTherefore, based on an engineering perspective, option B: \"must be applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences\" aligns with the principles of fairness and consistency in moral decision-making. This approach helps to uphold ethical standards and promote responsible engineering practices.",
