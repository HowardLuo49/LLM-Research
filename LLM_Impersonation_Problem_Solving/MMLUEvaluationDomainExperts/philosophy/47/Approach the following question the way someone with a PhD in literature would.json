For the soft determinist, to say that you could have done otherwise is to say that you would have done otherwise if _____.\nA: your desires were always the same\nB: your desires were completely under your control\nC: your desires had been different\nD: your desires played no role in your decisions",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The soft determinist argues that the assertion of one's ability to have done otherwise is contingent upon the hypothetical scenario in which one's desires were different. This perspective posits that while individuals are influenced by external factors and prior causes, they still possess a degree of control over their decisions. Therefore, to suggest that one could have acted differently is to imply that alternative desires would have yielded different outcomes. In essence, the soft determinist contends that the notion of free will is compatible with determinism, so long as one's desires play a crucial role in the decision-making process.",
