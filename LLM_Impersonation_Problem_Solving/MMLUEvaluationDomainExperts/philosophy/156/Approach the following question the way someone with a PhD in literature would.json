    "gpt_response": "Baier's assertion highlights the complexity of moral advice seeking by emphasizing the interpersonal dynamic inherent in such exchanges. Rather than simply seeking commands or preferences from others, the act of asking for moral advice entails a deeper level of engagement and dialogue. This process involves not only seeking information or guidance but also engaging in a shared deliberation with the advisor. Through this deliberative process, individuals can engage in a mutual exploration of values, principles, and considerations, ultimately seeking a deeper understanding of the moral issue at hand. In this sense, asking for moral advice involves a foundational element of empathy, as it requires both parties to engage with and understand the perspectives, experiences, and emotions of each other. Thus, Baier argues that when we seek moral advice, we are not simply looking for commands or preferences, but rather engaging in a complex and nuanced process of mutual deliberation and empathetic engagement.",
