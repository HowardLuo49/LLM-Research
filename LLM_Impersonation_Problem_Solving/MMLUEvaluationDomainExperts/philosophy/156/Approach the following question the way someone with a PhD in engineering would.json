Baier's assertion implies a deeper understanding of the nature of moral advice seeking. Asking for moral advice involves seeking guidance on making decisions that align with ethical principles and values. \n\nIn this context, the option C: deliberate with us, seems to best capture the essence of seeking moral advice. Deliberation suggests a process of thoughtful and careful consideration of different perspectives, values, and ethical principles in order to arrive at a morally sound decision. This aligns well with the complexity and nuance involved in seeking moral advice, especially in situations where there may be conflicting values or interests at play.\n\nTherefore, a PhD in engineering would likely agree with Baier's assertion that when we ask for moral advice, we are seeking others to deliberate with us, considering various ethical considerations and helping us navigate complex moral dilemmas.",
