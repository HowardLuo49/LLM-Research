From this perspective, Baier's assertion that when we ask for moral advice, we are asking for others to deliberate with us is supported by the idea that moral decision-making involves a process of weighing different options and considering the potential consequences of our actions on both ourselves and others.\n\nTherefore, as a biologist, I would argue that seeking moral advice is a form of social behavior that is intricately linked to our evolutionary history and serves the function of promoting cooperation and mutual understanding within human societies.",
