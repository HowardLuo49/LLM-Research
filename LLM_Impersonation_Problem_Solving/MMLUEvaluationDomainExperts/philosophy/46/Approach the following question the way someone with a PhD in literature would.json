    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by analyzing Bentham's perspective on the relationship between morality and theology. Bentham, a prominent philosopher in the utilitarian tradition, posited that moral actions should be determined by their utility in promoting the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. In this context, Bentham's assertion regarding the relationship between morality and theology is particularly relevant.\n\nContrary to the traditional theological standpoint that morality is derived from divine commandments or the will of God, Bentham's view suggests a more secular and rational approach to ethics. He argues that morality should be based on the consequences of one's actions rather than on adherence to religious dogma. \n\nIn light of his utilitarian framework, Bentham would likely support the idea that we must first determine whether an action is morally right or wrong by assessing its consequences on human well-being. This evaluation should be independent of any considerations of divine will or the existence of a deity. Therefore, option A aligns with Bentham's utilitarian ethics and his emphasis on the importance of moral reasoning grounded in rationality rather than theological beliefs.",
