The version of utilitarianism that Brandt defends makes rightness a function of:\nA: the consequences of particular acts.\nB: the actual and recognized rules of society.\nC: ideal rules.\nD: whether or not one\u2019s maxim can be universalized.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Brandt's version of utilitarianism posits that the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences, rather than any external rules or principles. Therefore, the correct answer is A: the consequences of particular acts. Brandt believes that the ethical value of an action is derived from the overall amount of happiness or well-being it produces, making the consequences of the action crucial to its moral assessment. This perspective aligns with classical utilitarianism, which prioritizes the maximization of utility or pleasure as the basis for ethical decision-making. In this way, Brandt's framework emphasizes the importance of evaluating the specific outcomes and impacts of individual actions in order to determine their ethical status within a utilitarian framework.",
