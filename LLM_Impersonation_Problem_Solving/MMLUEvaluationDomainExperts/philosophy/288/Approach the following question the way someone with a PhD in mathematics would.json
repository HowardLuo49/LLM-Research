The version of utilitarianism that Brandt defends makes rightness a function of:\nA: the consequences of particular acts.\nB: the actual and recognized rules of society.\nC: ideal rules.\nD: whether or not one\u2019s maxim can be universalized.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "From a mathematical perspective, the version of utilitarianism that Brandt defends can be seen as a function that maps a set of actions to a value representing the overall utility or goodness produced by those actions. In this framework, the rightness of an action is determined by the consequences it produces in terms of maximizing overall utility, rather than being based on adherence to specific societal rules or the universalizability of one's maxim. Therefore, we can say that the correct answer is A: the consequences of particular acts.",
