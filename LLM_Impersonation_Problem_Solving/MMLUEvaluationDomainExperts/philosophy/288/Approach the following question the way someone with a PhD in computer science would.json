    "gpt_response": "The version of utilitarianism that Brandt defends posits that the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences, specifically with regards to the overall well-being or happiness it produces. This perspective aligns with option A: the consequences of particular acts. Brandt emphasizes maximizing overall utility or happiness as the guiding principle for ethical decision making, rather than adherence to specific societal rules, ideal rules, or the universalizability of one's maxim. This consequentialist approach prioritizes the outcomes of actions in terms of their impact on the well-being of all individuals involved, ultimately aiming to maximize overall utility in accordance with utilitarian principles.",
