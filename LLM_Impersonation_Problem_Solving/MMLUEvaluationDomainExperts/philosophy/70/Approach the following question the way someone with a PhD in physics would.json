This criticism suggests that if ethical truths are solely determined by God's commands, then they are not based on any inherent moral principles or reasons, but rather simply on God's personal preferences or whims. This leads to the conclusion that ethical obligations are contingent upon God's arbitrary decrees rather than being grounded in any objective moral reality.\n\nTherefore, based on this criticism, the appropriate answer to the question posed would be:\n\nD: arbitrary",
