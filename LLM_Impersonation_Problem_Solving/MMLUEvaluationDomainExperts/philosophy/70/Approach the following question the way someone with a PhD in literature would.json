This criticism stems from the belief that if morality is dependent solely on the will of a divine being, then moral values become arbitrary and subject to change based on God's whim. This raises questions about the consistency and reliability of moral principles if they are grounded solely in divine commands.\n\nMoreover, critics argue that if God's commands are arbitrary, then it becomes difficult to discern a coherent moral framework or rationale for ethical decision-making. This can lead to moral relativism and the erosion of ethical standards based on rational reflection and consensus.\n\nIn light of these criticisms, proponents of the divine command theory must grapple with the challenge of reconciling the belief in a moral authority with the need for a coherent and consistent ethical system.
