He emphasized the importance of practical wisdom (phronesis) in the cultivation of virtue, which involves the ability to discern the right course of action in specific situations. This notion of moral expertise suggests that the virtues are contingent upon context and may require adaptation in response to changing circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, Aristotle's theory of the virtues is not limited to his own cultural context, but is intended to be applicable universally. While he acknowledges the influence of cultural norms and practices on the development of virtuous character, he also seeks to identify core traits that are intrinsic to human nature and essential for ethical excellence.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the correct answer to the question is B: open-ended and revisable.
