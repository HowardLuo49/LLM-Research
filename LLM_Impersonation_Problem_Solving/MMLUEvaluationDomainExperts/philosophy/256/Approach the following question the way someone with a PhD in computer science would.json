    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first noting that Gauthier is a prominent philosopher in the field of ethics, specifically known for his work on rational egoism. Gauthier's concept of morality facing a foundational crisis implies a tension between the traditional moral frameworks of altruism and egoism.\n\nIn this context, the term \"enlightened egoism\" refers to the idea that individuals should act in their own self-interest while taking into account the well-being of others. This concept aligns closely with Gauthier's rational egoism, which suggests that individuals should act in a way that maximizes their own utility within a framework of cooperative behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, \"pure altruism\" refers to the belief that individuals should prioritize the well-being of others above their own self-interest. This perspective stands in contrast to Gauthier's rational egoism, which emphasizes the pursuit of self-interest within a context of mutually beneficial exchanges.\n\n\"Justified constraint\" could be interpreted as the idea that moral principles may impose limitations on one's pursuit of self-interest, which reflects the tension Gauthier explores in his work on the foundations of morality.\n\n\"Prima facie duties\" refer to moral obligations that are binding unless overridden by more pressing considerations. This concept does not directly align with Gauthier's rational egoism but could be seen as a way to reconcile competing moral frameworks in the face of a foundational crisis.\n\nOverall, the most fitting answer to the question would be:\nC: justified constraint.",
