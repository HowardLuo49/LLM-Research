    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In considering the morality described by Gauthier as facing a foundational crisis, it is important to understand the complex arguments put forth by the philosopher in his exploration of moral theory. Gauthier's concept of morality can be seen as involving a tension between individual self-interest and broader moral considerations. This tension manifests in the idea of enlightened egoism, which posits that individuals can pursue their own self-interest in a way that is conducive to the overall welfare of society.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be A: enlightened egoism. Gauthier argues that individuals can act in self-interested ways while still contributing to the common good, highlighting the complex interplay between individual desires and collective moral obligations. This understanding of morality as involving a foundational crisis reflects the ongoing debate within moral philosophy regarding the ethical principles that guide human behavior.",
