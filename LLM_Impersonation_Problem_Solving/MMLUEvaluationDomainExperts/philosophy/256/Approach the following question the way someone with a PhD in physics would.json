    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question from the perspective of moral philosophy. Gauthier's concept of a foundational crisis in morality pertains to the ethical theory of enlightened egoism, which posits that individuals should act in their own self-interest while also recognizing the importance of cooperation and mutually beneficial interactions with others. This theory emphasizes rational decision-making and the pursuit of long-term self-interest, rather than short-term gains or purely altruistic actions.
