    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. Brandt claims that whether a moral code is ideal depends in part on:\nA: the complexity of the rules.\nB: how many people would likely violate it.\nC: the costs of its restrictions, in terms of the guilt it induces.\nD: all of the above.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In the context of moral philosophy, Brandt's assertion can be analyzed through a multidimensional framework that takes into account the principles of utilitarianism and deontological ethics. From a utilitarian perspective, the complexity of moral rules can be seen as directly related to the practicality and feasibility of implementing and adhering to the moral code. Complex rules may be difficult to understand and apply consistently, leading to potential confusion and conflict in moral decision-making.\n\nFurthermore, the likelihood of people violating a moral code is a crucial factor in its effectiveness and efficiency. A moral code that is frequently violated by individuals may indicate a lack of widespread acceptance or internalization of its principles. This could result in diminished moral authority and effectiveness of the code in promoting positive behavior.\n\nMoreover, the costs of adhering to a moral code in terms of guilt can influence its overall utility and desirability. Moral codes that induce excessive guilt or psychological distress may negatively impact individuals' well-being and hinder the development of a healthy moral framework.\n\nTherefore, it can be argued that Brandt's claim, that the idealness of a moral code depends on the complexity of the rules, the likelihood of violations, and the costs of restrictions in terms of guilt, is valid. By addressing these dimensions, one can assess the practicality, efficacy, and ethical implications of a given moral code, ultimately determining its idealness in promoting moral behavior and enhancing societal well-being.",
