Brandt claims that whether a moral code is ideal depends in part on:\nA: the complexity of the rules.\nB: how many people would likely violate it.\nC: the costs of its restrictions, in terms of the guilt it induces.\nD: all of the above.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by first analyzing each statement individually and then considering how they relate to each other in the context of moral code evaluation.\n\nA: The complexity of the rules can indeed play a significant role in determining the practicality and enforceability of a moral code. Complex rules may be difficult for individuals to understand and adhere to, leading to potential confusion and non-compliance.\n\nB: The number of people likely to violate a moral code can also be a crucial factor in assessing its effectiveness. If a significant portion of the population is likely to violate the code, it may indicate that the code is not well-aligned with societal norms or values.\n\nC: The costs of restrictions, in terms of guilt induced, can influence the overall acceptance and adherence to a moral code. If a code induces excessive guilt or moral anguish in individuals, it may have negative psychological effects and decrease overall compliance.\n\nIn considering these factors, it becomes evident that each of the statements (A, B, and C) addresses different dimensions of evaluating the effectiveness and appropriateness of a moral code. Therefore, the comprehensive evaluation of a moral code would involve assessing its complexity, likelihood of violations, and the emotional costs associated with compliance. Thus, the most appropriate answer would be D: all of the above.",
