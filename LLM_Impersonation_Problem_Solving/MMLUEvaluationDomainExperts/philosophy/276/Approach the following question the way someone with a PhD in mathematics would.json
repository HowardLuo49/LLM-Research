Brandt claims that whether a moral code is ideal depends in part on:\nA: the complexity of the rules.\nB: how many people would likely violate it.\nC: the costs of its restrictions, in terms of the guilt it induces.\nD: all of the above.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "A PhD in mathematics would likely approach this question from a logical and analytical perspective, using mathematical principles to evaluate the different factors mentioned by Brandt.\n\nFirstly, the complexity of a moral code can be seen as a measure of its efficiency and practicality. A simple and straightforward set of rules may be easier for individuals to understand and follow, making it more ideal in terms of adherence. However, a more complex set of rules may be necessary for addressing a wide range of situations and circumstances, thus potentially making it more ideal in terms of its comprehensiveness and applicability.\n\nSecondly, the number of people who would likely violate a moral code can impact its effectiveness and feasibility. A moral code that is frequently violated may not be seen as ideal, as it may fail to effectively regulate behavior and uphold ethical standards. On the other hand, a moral code that is rarely violated may be considered more ideal, as it demonstrates its ability to guide behavior and promote moral behavior in individuals.\n\nLastly, the costs of a moral code in terms of the guilt it induces can be viewed as a measure of its impact on individuals' emotional well-being and moral development. A moral code that imposes excessive guilt may be seen as overly restrictive and detrimental to individuals' mental health, potentially making it less ideal. Conversely, a moral code that induces an appropriate level of guilt may be viewed as more effective in promoting moral behavior and character development.\n\nIn light of these considerations, a PhD in mathematics may conclude that all of the factors mentioned by Brandt - the complexity of the rules, the likelihood of violation, and the costs of restrictions in terms of guilt - are important considerations in determining the ideal nature of a moral code. Therefore, the answer to the question would likely be D: all of the above.",
