    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. Brandt claims that whether a moral code is ideal depends in part on:\nA: the complexity of the rules.\nB: how many people would likely violate it.\nC: the costs of its restrictions, in terms of the guilt it induces.\nD: all of the above.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Brandt's assertion, it is important for a biologist to analyze the biological and evolutionary underpinnings of morality. From a biological perspective, moral codes can be seen as adaptive strategies that have evolved to regulate social behavior and promote group cohesion. The complexity of moral rules can impact their effectiveness in promoting cooperation and reducing conflict within a social group. Additionally, the potential for violations of a moral code can influence its ability to maintain social order and stability. The costs of adhering to a moral code, in terms of guilt or other negative emotions, can also impact its utility in shaping behavior.\n\nTherefore, a biologist with a PhD would likely support the assertion that the idealness of a moral code depends on a combination of factors, including the complexity of the rules, the likelihood of violations, and the emotional costs of adherence. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the correct answer is D: all of the above.",
