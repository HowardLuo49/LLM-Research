Brandt claims that whether a moral code is ideal depends in part on:\nA: the complexity of the rules.\nB: how many people would likely violate it.\nC: the costs of its restrictions, in terms of the guilt it induces.\nD: all of the above.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing the factors mentioned by Brandt. \n\nFirstly, the complexity of the rules plays a significant role in determining the effectiveness of a moral code. Complex rules may be difficult for individuals to understand and adhere to, leading to increased likelihood of violations. Simplified and straightforward rules are generally more effective in guiding behavior.\n\nSecondly, the number of people likely to violate a moral code is another important consideration. A moral code that is widely violated may be viewed as ineffective and may not serve its purpose of promoting moral behavior in society.\n\nLastly, the costs of the restrictions imposed by a moral code, in terms of the guilt induced, can impact its idealness. If a moral code imposes excessive guilt or emotional burden on individuals, it may lead to negative psychological effects and reduced compliance.\n\nTherefore, I would agree with Brandt's assertion that the idealness of a moral code depends on the complexity of the rules, the likelihood of violations, and the costs of its restrictions in terms of guilt. Hence, the correct answer would be D: all of the above.",
