    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is B: impressions and ideas. Hume's division of perceptions follows his philosophy of empiricism, where he emphasizes the importance of sensory experiences (impressions) over cognitive reflections (ideas). Impressions refer to our immediate, vivid perceptions derived from sense experience, while ideas are derived from impressions through processes such as memory, imagination, and reasoning. This distinction allows Hume to critically analyze the nature and foundation of our beliefs, knowledge, and understanding.",
