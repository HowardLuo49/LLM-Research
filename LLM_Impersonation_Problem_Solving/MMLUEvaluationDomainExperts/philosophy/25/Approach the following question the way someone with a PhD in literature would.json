    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is clear that Hume's division of perceptions into two categories, impressions and ideas, is a fundamental concept in his philosophical discourse. Impressions are defined as our more immediate and vivid perceptions, such as sensations and emotions, while ideas are derived from those impressions through reflection and abstraction. This distinction allows Hume to examine the nature of human cognition and understanding, highlighting the role of sensory experience in shaping our perception of the world. By recognizing the distinction between impressions and ideas, Hume provides insight into the complexities of human consciousness and the interplay between direct sensory experience and mental representation.",
