This often involves analyzing various ethical frameworks, perspectives, and principles to provide justification for ethical judgments. A PhD in mathematics would likely approach this question by seeking to apply logical reasoning, critical analysis, and rigorous argumentation to develop a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors that contribute to the evaluation of moral actions.",
