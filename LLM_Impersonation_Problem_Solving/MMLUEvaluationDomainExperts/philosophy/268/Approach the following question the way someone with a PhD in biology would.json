    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "B: why one moral event caused another\n\nA moral theory in the context of biology would typically approach the question of why one moral event caused another by considering the underlying biological mechanisms and evolutionary factors at play. This could involve examining how specific behaviors or actions impact individual fitness, group survival, or overall reproductive success, and how these effects shape the development and evolution of moral behaviors within a population. By understanding the biological basis of morality, a moral theory can provide insights into the causal relationships between different moral events and help to explain the emergence and persistence of particular moral norms and values.",
