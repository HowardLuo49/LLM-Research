    "gpt_response": "C: serves some important function\n\nFrom a biological perspective, an object may be considered to have aesthetic value if it serves some important function in its environment. This can be seen through various examples in nature where organisms have evolved certain characteristics or behaviors that are not only functional but also visually appealing. For instance, the bright colors and intricate patterns of flowers may serve to attract pollinators, thus aiding in the reproduction of the plant species. Similarly, the elaborate courtship displays of birds may not only serve to attract mates but also to establish social hierarchy within the population. Therefore, from a biological standpoint, aesthetic value can be tied to the functionality of an object in its natural context.",
