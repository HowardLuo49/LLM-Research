    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is C: serves some important function.\n\nIn the realm of computer science, the aesthetics of an object are often judged based on its functionality and how well it serves a specific purpose or function. This view is supported by the concept of \"form follows function\", which suggests that the design of an object should be primarily based on its intended use and purpose. Therefore, an object in computer science would be considered to have aesthetic value if it serves some important function effectively and efficiently.",
