    "gpt_response": "A prominent view is that an object has aesthetic value if it has no utility. This idea is rooted in the concept of aestheticism, which prioritizes beauty and emotional response over practical function. The aesthetic value of an object is often argued to be independent of its utility or meaning, instead focusing on its ability to evoke a sense of pleasure or appreciation in the observer. This perspective is supported by theories in aesthetics, philosophy, and psychology, which suggest that the beauty of an object lies in its ability to captivate and move the viewer, rather than its practical or symbolic significance.",
