Nagel claims that most skeptical arguments:\nA: are the result of applying arbitrarily stringent standards.\nB: are based on linguistic confusions.\nC: are logically self-refuting.\nD: grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would argue that Nagel's claim that most skeptical arguments grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards is indeed a valid point. Skeptical arguments often challenge our understanding of the world by placing our beliefs under scrutiny and demanding evidence and logical consistency. By consistently applying ordinary standards of evidence and logic, skeptics aim to uncover any inconsistencies or gaps in our knowledge, leading to a more robust and well-founded understanding of the world. This approach aligns with the scientific method, which relies on skepticism and critical thinking to advance our understanding of the natural world. Therefore, I would agree with Nagel's assertion that skeptical arguments often stem from the rigorous application of ordinary standards.",
