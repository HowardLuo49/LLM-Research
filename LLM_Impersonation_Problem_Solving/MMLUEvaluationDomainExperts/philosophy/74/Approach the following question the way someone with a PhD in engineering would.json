Utilitarianism, as advocated by John Stuart Mill, prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number. In this context, Mill would argue that option A is the most appropriate approach to determining how to act. By calculating the expected consequences of our actions, we can make decisions that maximize utility and ultimately benefit society as a whole.\n\nOptions B, C, and D, which suggest relying on rules of thumb derived from utility, consulting tradition, or consulting scripture, do not align with the utilitarian principles that Mill championed. These alternative approaches may not necessarily lead to decisions that maximize overall utility and could potentially be biased or based on subjective beliefs rather than objective analysis.\n\nIn summary, a PhD in engineering would likely support option A as the most reasonable and logical approach to decision-making, based on the utilitarian principles advocated by John Stuart Mill.",
