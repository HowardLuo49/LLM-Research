    "gpt_response": "From a physics perspective, the question posed by Mill in determining how to act can be best approached through the lens of consequentialism. This is a philosophical theory that states that the morality of an action is solely determined by its consequences. \n\nGiven this perspective, option A is closest to the idea of consequentialism. By calculating the expected consequences of our actions, we are able to make decisions based on the potential outcomes and choose the option that maximizes utility or happiness for the greatest number of individuals. This aligns with the principle of utility, which is often used in ethical decision-making to maximize overall well-being.\n\nOptions C and D, consulting tradition and scripture, do not necessarily align with a purely consequentialist approach, as they rely on external sources or authorities to guide decision-making rather than focusing on the outcomes of actions themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, a physicist with a PhD would likely choose option A, as it aligns most closely with a consequentialist approach to ethical decision-making based on calculating expected consequences.",
