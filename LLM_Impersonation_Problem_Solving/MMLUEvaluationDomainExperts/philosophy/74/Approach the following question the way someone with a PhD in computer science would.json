Mill claims that in deciding how to act:\nA: we should always calculate the expected consequences of our action.\nB: we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.\nC: we should consult tradition.\nD: we should consult scripture.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer science PhD, I approach this question by analyzing it from a rational and logical perspective. Mill's ethical theory, utilitarianism, asserts that the moral worth of an action is determined by its contribution to overall happiness or pleasure. Therefore, option A aligns with this theory as it emphasizes the importance of considering the expected consequences of our actions in order to maximize utility.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not directly correlate with utilitarianism as they do not prioritize the maximization of utility or overall happiness. Rule of thumb, tradition, and scripture may not always lead to the most optimal outcomes for maximizing utility as they are not grounded in the principles of utilitarianism.\n\nIn conclusion, as a PhD in computer science, it is reasonable to assert that option A, calculating the expected consequences of our actions, is the most appropriate approach in line with Mill's utilitarianism.",
