    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the moral philosophy of John Stuart Mill, particularly his principle of utility. Mill argues that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people, known as the principle of utility.\n\nIn relation to the question, Mill would argue that in deciding how to act, we should not simply rely on tradition or scripture, as these may be outdated or based on arbitrary authority. Instead, we should follow rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility, which involves calculating the expected consequences of our actions and choosing the course of action that maximizes overall happiness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to Mill's moral philosophy would be B: we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility. This approach emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences of our actions and acting in a way that maximizes the overall well-being of society.",
