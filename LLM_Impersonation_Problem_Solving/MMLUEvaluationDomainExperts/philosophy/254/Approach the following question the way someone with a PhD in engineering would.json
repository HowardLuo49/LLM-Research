Anscombe, a renowned philosopher, argued in her seminal work \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" that the modern concept of moral obligation is inherently flawed because it is derived from a Christian moral framework that has lost its logical foundation with the declining belief in God.\n\nConsidering Anscombe's viewpoint, we can infer that she would argue that the notion of moral obligation is derived from divine law (option D). According to Anscombe, moral obligations are rooted in a divine command theory of ethics, where ethical principles are derived from the laws and commands of a divine being (such as God).\n\nIn this context, the concept of moral obligation is not derived from personal preferences (option A), maximizing utility (option B), or positive law (option C). Instead, Anscombe's argument suggests that moral obligations are ultimately derived from divine authority and transcendental truths.\n\nTherefore, from the perspective of someone with a PhD in engineering who is familiar with Anscombe's critiques of modern moral philosophy, the most appropriate answer to the question would be D: divine law.",
