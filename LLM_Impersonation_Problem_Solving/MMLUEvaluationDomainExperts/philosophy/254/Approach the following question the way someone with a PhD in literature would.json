    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with expertise in literature, I would approach this question by examining the philosophical underpinnings of Anscombe's claim regarding the derivation of moral obligation. Anscombe, a prominent figure in the field of ethics, argues that the notion of moral obligation is closely connected to the concept of divine law. This belief stems from her deep engagement with the history of moral philosophy and the role of religion in shaping ethical principles.\n\nAnscombe's assertion is grounded in her rejection of utilitarian and preference-based approaches to ethics, which she sees as inadequate for grounding moral obligations. Instead, she posits that moral obligations are best understood within the context of a divine framework, where moral principles are derived from God's commandments or a higher moral authority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is D: divine law. This reflects Anscombe's view that the concept of moral obligation is intrinsically linked to a transcendent source of moral authority, rather than being derived from individual preferences, utility calculations, or positive laws instituted by human institutions.",
