Anscombe famously argued in her seminal work \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" that the notion of moral obligation is derived from the concept of divine law. She criticizes the modern moral philosophy for its reliance on utilitarianism and subjective preferences, instead advocating for a return to a virtue ethics grounded in the concept of divine command.\n\nIn her view, moral obligation cannot be derived from personal preferences or a utilitarian calculus of maximizing utility. Instead, she argues that true moral obligations are derived from a higher authority, namely divine law. Anscombe's argument is grounded in her belief in the existence of objective moral truths that are independent of human subjectivity or societal norms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question would be D: divine law, as understood within the framework of Anscombe's philosophical views on ethics and morality.",
