    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing Anscombe's claims in the context of ethical philosophy and moral theory. Anscombe, a prominent philosopher in the field of ethics, argues that the notion of moral obligation is derived from the concept of divine law rather than other proposed sources such as preference, maximizing utility, or positive law.\n\nIn her influential essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe critiques the prevailing ethical theories of her time, particularly utilitarianism and deontological ethics, for lacking a solid foundation for moral obligation. She argues that these theories fail to provide a satisfactory account of why certain actions are morally obligatory or forbidden.\n\nInstead, Anscombe posits that the concept of moral obligation can only be understood within the framework of a divine command theory of ethics. According to this view, moral obligations are grounded in the commands or will of a higher authority, typically identified as God. In this sense, moral obligations are not simply based on individual preferences, societal norms, or the pursuit of utility, but rather on a transcendent source of moral authority.\n\nTherefore, in response to the question posed, someone with a PhD in computer science would likely choose option D: divine law, as the concept from which Anscombe claims the notion of moral obligation is derived. This choice reflects Anscombe's philosophical arguments and her perspective on the foundations of ethics.",
