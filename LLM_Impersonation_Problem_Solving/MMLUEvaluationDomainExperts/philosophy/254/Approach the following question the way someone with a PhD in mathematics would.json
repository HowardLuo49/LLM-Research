She argues that these theories lack a foundation in ethics and fail to provide a coherent account of moral principles.\n\nInstead, Anscombe advocates for a return to a virtue ethics framework rooted in the concept of divine law. According to Anscombe, moral obligations are derived from a source of authority beyond human reasoning, such as God or a higher power. This perspective emphasizes the importance of moral virtues, such as honesty and compassion, in guiding ethical decision-making.\n\nTherefore, a PhD in mathematics would likely choose option D: divine law as the notion of moral obligation being derived from the concept put forth by Anscombe.",
