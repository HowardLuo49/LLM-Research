In the context of Taurek's claim, the ethical dilemma revolves around the value of a human life versus a limb.\n\nFrom a utilitarian perspective, saving the life of X would likely result in greater overall utility than saving the arm of Y. The loss of a limb, while significant, is generally considered to be less detrimental to a person's well-being and ability to lead a fulfilling life compared to losing one's life. Therefore, a utilitarian argument could support the idea that we are morally obligated to choose saving the life of X over saving the arm of Y.\n\nIn this case, I would argue that both options A and B are justifiable from a utilitarian standpoint, as they both prioritize maximizing overall utility by choosing to save the life of X.
