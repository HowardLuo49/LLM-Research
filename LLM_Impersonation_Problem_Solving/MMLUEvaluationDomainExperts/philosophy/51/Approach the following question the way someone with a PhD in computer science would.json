    "gpt_response": "A computer science perspective would likely approach this question through the lens of decision theory and ethics. In this case, the decision maker (Y) is faced with a moral dilemma that involves prioritizing between saving a life (X) or saving an arm (Y).\n\nOne way to approach this decision is through utilitarianism, which suggests that the action that maximizes overall well-being should be chosen. In this scenario, saving the life of X would likely result in a greater overall well-being compared to saving the arm of Y.\n\nFrom a decision theory perspective, the decision maker (Y) could also consider the expected utility of each outcome. Saving the life of X would likely have a higher expected utility compared to saving the arm of Y.\n\nTherefore, based on these perspectives, it can be argued that option A (Y is obligated to choose saving the life of X) is the most appropriate in this situation. This is because it aligns with both utilitarian principles and decision theory principles, as saving a life is likely to result in greater overall well-being and expected utility.",
