    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by noting that Jeremy Bentham was a philosopher and social reformer, not a scientist or engineer, and his concept of the two sovereign masters being pain and pleasure reflects a utilitarian philosophy. Utilitarianism posits that the right course of action is the one that maximizes overall happiness and minimizes overall suffering. Therefore, the answer to the question is A) pain and pleasure, as Bentham believed that individuals are motivated by seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. This perspective aligns with the utilitarian consideration of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain for the greatest number of people when making ethical decisions.",
