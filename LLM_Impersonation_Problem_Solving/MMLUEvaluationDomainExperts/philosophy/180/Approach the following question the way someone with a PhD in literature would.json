    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would analyze Bentham's statement through the lens of his philosophical views on utilitarianism. Bentham, a key figure in the development of utilitarian ethics, posited that actions are morally right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. In this context, the two sovereign masters that nature has placed mankind under can be interpreted as pain and pleasure.\n\nPain and pleasure serve as the fundamental principles guiding human behavior according to Bentham's utilitarian perspective. Pain and pleasure are considered universal motivators that influence individual decisions and actions. Pain is seen as a negative experience that individuals seek to avoid, while pleasure is viewed as a positive experience that individuals seek to maximize.\n\nTherefore, an individual with a PhD in literature would likely argue that Bentham's claim aligns with his utilitarian philosophy, emphasizing the importance of pain and pleasure as primary forces shaping human conduct. The focus on pain and pleasure as sovereign masters suggests a utilitarian understanding of ethics and morality, where the pursuit of happiness and avoidance of suffering are central to human existence.",
