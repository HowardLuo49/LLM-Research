    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I approach this question by analyzing Bentham's statement through a logical and systematic lens. Bentham, a utilitarian philosopher, posits that mankind is governed by two primary motivators: pain and pleasure. This aligns with his utilitarian principle of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain in order to achieve the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nWhen considering the other options presented - good and evil, God and the devil, duty and self-interest - it is clear that these concepts do not directly align with Bentham's utilitarian philosophy. Good and evil, for example, are moral concepts that may vary depending on cultural and religious beliefs, while duty and self-interest are more related to ethical decision-making rather than the underlying motivators of human behavior.\n\nTherefore, as a mathematician, I would confidently choose option A: pain and pleasure, as the answer that best reflects Bentham's utilitarian perspective on the sovereign masters that govern mankind.",
