    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, it is important to consider Hume's claim within the context of evolutionary biology and psychology. Hume's assertion that our final verdicts on moral matters are derived from emotion aligns with research highlighting the role of emotions in moral decision-making processes.\n\nEmotions have been evolutionarily conserved across species, suggesting a universal quality to the moral sense that is shared among humans. This idea is supported by research showing that certain moral principles, such as fairness and reciprocity, are found across different cultures, pointing to a shared moral foundation that is likely rooted in our evolutionary history.\n\nFurthermore, neurobiological studies have identified brain regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, that are involved in processing moral emotions and decision-making. These findings provide empirical support for the role of emotion in shaping our moral judgments.\n\nIn summary, as a biologist, I would argue that Hume's claim that our final verdicts on moral matters are derived from emotion is well-supported by evidence from evolutionary biology and neuroscience. Emotions play a crucial role in guiding our moral intuitions and shaping our ethical decisions, reflecting a universal moral sense that is deeply rooted in our biology.",
