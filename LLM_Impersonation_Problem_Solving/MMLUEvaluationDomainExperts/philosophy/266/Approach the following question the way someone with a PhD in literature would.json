    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, one would likely view Hume's Inquiry as a pivotal text in the history of moral philosophy. In this work, Hume argues that our final verdicts on moral matters are derived primarily from emotion rather than reason. Hume posits that reason alone is insufficient to determine moral judgments, as it is ultimately our passions and sentiments that drive our moral decision-making. This stance aligns with Hume's broader philosophical project of emphasizing the role of emotion and sentiment in shaping human behavior and thought. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D: emotion.",
