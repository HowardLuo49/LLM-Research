    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In Cicero's philosophical framework, each person is understood to possess two distinct characters: the universal and the individual. These characters represent the duality of human nature, whereby individuals are both part of the broader universal order and unique entities with their own personal qualities and characteristics. The universal character reflects the shared aspects of human existence, while the individual character pertains to the specific attributes and traits that differentiate one person from another. This conception aligns with Cicero's broader ideas about ethics and virtue, as he believed that individuals have the capacity for both virtuous and vicious behavior, depending on how they align themselves with the universal principles of goodness and morality. Ultimately, Cicero's view underscores the complex interplay between the divine and beastly aspects of human nature, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and moral cultivation in striving towards a more harmonious and virtuous existence.",
