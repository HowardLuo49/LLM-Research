This dual nature reflects the inherent complexity of human beings, who possess both noble and base qualities within them. The divine aspect represents the higher, more noble aspects of humanity, such as reason, virtue, and morality, while the beastly aspect embodies lower, more primitive impulses such as greed, selfishness, and violence. By acknowledging and understanding this duality within themselves, individuals can strive towards cultivating their divine qualities and overcoming their beastly tendencies, ultimately leading to a more virtuous and fulfilling life.",
