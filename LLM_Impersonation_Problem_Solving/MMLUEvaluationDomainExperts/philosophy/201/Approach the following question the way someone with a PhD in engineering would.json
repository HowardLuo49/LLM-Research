    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In Cicero's perspective, each individual possesses two inherent characters bestowed upon them by Nature, namely the divine and beastly. This dichotomy suggests that individuals hold within them both transcendent and base qualities, defining the complexity of human nature. This dual nature is intrinsic to the human condition and influences the actions and decisions of individuals as they navigate their lives. Cicero's philosophy delves into the inherent contradictions within individuals, emphasizing the struggle between the divine and beastly aspects of human nature. This understanding of duality in human character serves as a foundation for ethical and moral inquiry, prompting individuals to strive towards their higher, more virtuous selves while also acknowledging and addressing their baser instincts. Overall, Cicero's framework underscores the complexity and depth of human nature, offering insights into the intricacies of individual character and behavior.",
