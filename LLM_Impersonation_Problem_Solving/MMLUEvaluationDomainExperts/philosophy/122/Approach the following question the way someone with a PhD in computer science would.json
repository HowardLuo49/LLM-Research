    "gpt_response": "According to Feinberg, the claim that we always feel pleasure when we get what we want is false. Feinberg argues that there are cases in which individuals do not experience pleasure even when they obtain what they desire. \n\nIf the claim were true, it would not necessarily support psychological egoism. Psychological egoism posits that human actions are motivated solely by self-interest and the pursuit of pleasure.
