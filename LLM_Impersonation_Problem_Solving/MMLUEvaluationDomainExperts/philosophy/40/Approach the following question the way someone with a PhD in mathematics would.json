    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the definitions given by Mill for \"utility\" and selecting the most precise and rigorous definition based on logical reasoning and critical evaluation.\n\nMill defines \"utility\" as the promotion of happiness and the prevention of pain, often summarized as the principle of \"the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\" This definition aligns closely with option C: pleasure and the absence of pain.\n\nIn mathematical terms, utility can be seen as a function that assigns a real number to each possible outcome or state of the world, representing the level of satisfaction or welfare derived from that outcome. The goal is to maximize this utility function, typically by choosing actions or policies that maximize the overall happiness or well-being of society. This concept is foundational in the field of utilitarianism, a philosophical theory that focuses on the consequences of actions in determining their moral worth.\n\nTherefore, as a mathematician with expertise in this area, I would argue that option C most accurately captures Mill's definition of utility and its relevance to maximizing well-being and happiness in society.",
