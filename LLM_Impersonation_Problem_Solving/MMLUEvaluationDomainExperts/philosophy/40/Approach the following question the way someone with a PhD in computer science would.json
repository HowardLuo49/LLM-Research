    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question from a perspective of information processing and logic. Mill defines \"utility\" as the promotion of happiness or pleasure and the absence of pain. This definition aligns with the principle of utilitarianism, where actions are judged based on their utility or ability to maximize overall happiness or well-being. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: pleasure and the absence of pain. This definition of utility is essential in understanding how to optimize decision-making processes and resource allocation in various computational systems.",
