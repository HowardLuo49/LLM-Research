    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with expertise in theoretical and applied physics, I would approach this question by analyzing Mill's definition of \"utility\" as it pertains to his ethical philosophy. Through a rigorous examination of Mill's writings, particularly in his work \"Utilitarianism,\" I would interpret utility as the principle that actions are morally right if they promote happiness or pleasure and minimize pain or suffering for the greatest number of individuals.\n\nIn this context, Mill defines utility as encompassing not just the usefulness of actions for a specific craft or industry (option A), nor solely for the benefit of society as a whole (option B), but rather as the pursuit of happiness and the reduction of suffering. This aligns closely with option C, which highlights pleasure and the absence of pain as key components of utility.\n\nMoreover, option D also encapsulates an essential aspect of Mill's concept of utility, emphasizing that actions should promote the interests of all individuals involved and avoid causing harm. By considering the complexities of ethical decision-making within the framework of utilitarianism, I would critically evaluate each option in light of Mill's philosophical principles to arrive at a well-informed and nuanced understanding of the concept of utility.",
