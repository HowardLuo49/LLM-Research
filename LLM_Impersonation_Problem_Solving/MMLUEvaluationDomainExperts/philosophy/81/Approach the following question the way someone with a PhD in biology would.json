According to Moore, the most fundamental question in all of ethics is:\nA: whether life is worth living.\nB: whether God exists.\nC: how \u201cgood\u201d is to be defined.\nD: whether morality is objective.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by examining it through the lens of evolutionary biology and the natural world. The most fundamental question in ethics, according to Moore, is whether morality is objective. This question is particularly interesting from a biological perspective because it raises the issue of whether moral values and ethical principles have roots in human biology and evolution.\n\nIn biology, we study how organisms have evolved certain behaviors and traits that enhance their survival and reproductive success. This includes elements of social behavior, cooperation, altruism, and aggression. The question of objective morality ties into this idea, as it touches on whether moral norms and values have a basis in our evolutionary past.\n\nFurthermore, the discussion of objective morality also relates to scientific theories about moral reasoning and decision-making. Neurobiological research has shown that certain areas of the brain are involved in moral judgment and decision-making processes. This raises the question of whether moral principles are hardwired into our biology or shaped by cultural and environmental factors.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of whether morality is objective is a complex and multifaceted issue that can be approached from a biological perspective. It involves considering the evolutionary origins of moral norms and values, as well as the role of biology in shaping moral reasoning and decision-making processes.",
