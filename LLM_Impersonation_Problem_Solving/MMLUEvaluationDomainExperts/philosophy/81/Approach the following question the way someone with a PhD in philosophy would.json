    "gpt_response": "According to philosopher G.E. Moore, the most fundamental question in all of ethics is whether morality is objective. This question delves into the nature of moral values and principles and whether they exist independently of human beliefs and opinions. Moore argued that ethical statements such as \"this action is good\" can be objectively true or false, regardless of individual perspectives or cultural norms. This question leads to further inquiries about the foundation of moral truths and the possibility of a universal moral code that guides human behavior. In exploring this question, philosophers aim to uncover the nature of morality and its implications for ethical decision-making.",
