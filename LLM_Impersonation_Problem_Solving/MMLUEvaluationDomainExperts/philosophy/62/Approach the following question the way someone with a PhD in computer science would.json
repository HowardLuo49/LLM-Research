    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "According to Kant, moral laws are necessary and apply to all rational beings. Kant's moral philosophy is based on the idea of universal moral laws that are binding on all rational beings, regardless of their individual circumstances or cultural background. These moral laws are not contingent on human desires or cultural beliefs, but are instead derived from reason itself. Kant believed that moral laws are objective and universal, and are grounded in the inherent dignity and worth of all rational beings. Kant's ethics are thus distinct from ethical theories that are based on cultural relativism or divine command theory.",
