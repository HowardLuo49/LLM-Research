    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "According to Kant, moral laws are necessary and apply to all rational beings. Kant argues that moral laws are not contingent upon individual beliefs or societal norms, but are based on reason and are universal in nature. Kant believed that moral principles are derived from a priori reasoning and are necessary for the rational beings to act according to duty. This view is in line with Kant's deontological ethics, which emphasizes the importance of moral duties and principles that are binding on all rational beings, regardless of individual differences or cultural variations. Therefore, the correct answer is A: necessary and apply to all rational beings.",
