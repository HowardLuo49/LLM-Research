    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "According to Kant, moral laws are seen as necessary and absolute, applying to all rational beings regardless of cultural or societal differences. Kant's theory of morality is grounded in a belief in the autonomy of rational beings, who are capable of recognizing and following universal moral principles. Therefore, option A is the most accurate representation of Kant's conception of moral laws. The idea that moral laws are contingent or culturally relative would run counter to Kant's moral philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of reason and rationality in determining the moral worth of actions. Additionally, Kant's moral theory is secular and does not rely on divine commands for its foundation, making option D inconsistent with his beliefs.",
