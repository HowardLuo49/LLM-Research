    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "According to Kant, moral laws are A: necessary and apply to all rational beings. Kant believed that moral laws are derived from reason and are universal principles that apply to all rational beings, regardless of cultural or religious differences. These moral laws are based on the inherent rationality and autonomy of individuals, rather than being contingent on specific circumstances or cultural beliefs. Kant's philosophy of morality is grounded in the idea of the categorical imperative, which requires individuals to act in a way that can be universalized and respects the inherent dignity and autonomy of all rational beings. Thus, moral laws are seen as necessary, universal principles that apply to all rational beings.",
