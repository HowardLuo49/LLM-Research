    "gpt_response": "In his seminal work The Right and the Good, W.D. Ross expounds on the concept of prima facie duties, which he describes as moral obligations that are binding upon individuals in certain circumstances but that can be overridden by other, more weighty duties. To elucidate this concept, Ross employs an analogy with our emotions, positing that just as our emotional responses towards certain situations do not necessarily dictate our actions, so too our prima facie duties do not always compel us to act in a particular manner. This analogy serves to highlight the complexity and nuance inherent in ethical deliberation, emphasizing the need for individuals to carefully weigh conflicting duties and make deliberate moral choices based on a holistic consideration of the various factors at play.",
