    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a Ph.D. in literature, I would approach this question by analyzing W.D. Ross's concept of prima facie duties within the realm of ethical philosophy. Ross, a prominent figure in the field of ethics, posits that individuals have certain prima facie duties, which are fundamental moral obligations that must be considered in making ethical decisions.\n\nIn one of his key works, \"The Right and the Good,\" Ross explains the notion of prima facie duties by drawing an analogy with our emotions. He argues that just as our emotions provide us with immediate moral intuitions that guide our actions, prima facie duties serve as similarly fundamental moral intuitions that guide our ethical decision-making. These duties, such as honesty, beneficence, and fairness, are prima facie in nature, meaning that they are morally binding unless overridden by stronger conflicting duties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be D: our emotions, as Ross uses this analogy to illustrate the foundational role that prima facie duties play in moral reasoning and decision-making. This interpretation showcases the intricate interplay between ethics, philosophy, and literature, highlighting the depth and complexity of Ross's ethical framework.",
