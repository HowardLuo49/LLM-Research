Prima facie duties are moral obligations that are binding unless they conflict with another, stronger duty. \n\nIn order to explain the notion of prima facie duty, Ross draws an analogy with our emotions. This analogy suggests that just as our emotions can pull us in different directions and create conflicting desires, our moral duties can sometimes conflict with one another. This comparison helps to illustrate the complexity and nuance of ethical decision-making, highlighting the need to carefully consider and balance various moral considerations when determining the right course of action. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is D: our emotions. This analogy provides a useful framework for understanding the nature of prima facie duties and the complexities of moral reasoning.",
