If the world that we individually perceive is limited to an internal perspective, then there is no way that we could determine whether our own perspective is useful, true, or valuable because:\nA: we know whether our internal perspective is correct only by comparing it with an objective, external perspective (the \"real\" world).\nB: whatever we appeal to in order to prove that our perspective is right itself would be part of the standard we use in evaluating that perspective.\nC: scientific research that reveals facts about the world would cause us to challenge our perceptions in a dreamworld of our own making.\nD: without limiting our perspective to an internal dreamworld, we cannot achieve any objective, external knowledge of the real world.",

Without being able to compare and contrast our internal perspectives with an external reality, we are confined to a subjective and potentially distorted view of the world. In mathematics, the pursuit of truth and objectivity is crucial, and without a way to validate our perspectives externally, we are left with a limited and potentially skewed understanding of reality. So, it is only by moving beyond our internal dreamworld and seeking out objective truths that we can hope to gain a more accurate understanding of the world around us.",
