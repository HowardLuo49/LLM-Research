In contrast, Aristotle emphasized empirical observation and believed that knowledge is derived from sensory experience. \n\nThomas Aquinas, a Catholic theologian, synthesized philosophical teachings with Christian beliefs. His works emphasized the importance of reason in understanding faith and the natural world. \n\nImmanuel Kant introduced the concept of categorical imperative, which argues for ethical behavior based on universal principles. \n\nGiven the ethical and philosophical nature of Singer's conclusions, it is most likely that his ideas align more closely with Kant's theories, which emphasize rationality and universal moral principles. Therefore, I would choose option D: Immanuel Kant as the thinker whose conclusions are similar to Singer's.",
