In this case, Singer's conclusions are likely related to ethical or moral theories, which would align more closely with the views of Immanuel Kant rather than Plato, Aristotle, or Thomas Aquinas. Kant was a prominent philosopher known for his deontological ethics and his emphasis on the importance of rationality and duty in moral decision-making. By evaluating the specific arguments and principles put forth by Singer, I would determine whether his conclusions are indeed more in line with Kantian philosophy.",
