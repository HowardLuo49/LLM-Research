Bentham defines the fecundity of a pleasure or pain as:\nA: its chance of occurring.\nB: the degree to which it is felt.\nC: its chance of being followed by sensations of the same kind.\nD: how long it lasts.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In the context of Bentham's formulation of utilitarianism, the fecundity of a pleasure or pain refers to its likelihood or probability of producing further pleasurable or painful sensations. This concept is crucial in the calculation of utility, as it impacts the overall utility derived from a particular pleasure or pain. The fecundity of a pleasure or pain is not simply determined by its intensity or duration, but rather by its potential to generate additional feelings of the same kind.\n\nTherefore, option C: its chance of being followed by sensations of the same kind, is the most appropriate definition of fecundity in the context of Bentham's utilitarian philosophy. This understanding allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the consequences of different pleasures and pains, leading to a more informed and rational decision-making process.",
