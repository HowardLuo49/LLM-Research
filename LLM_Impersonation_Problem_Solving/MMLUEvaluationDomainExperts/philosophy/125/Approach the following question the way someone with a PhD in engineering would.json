Bentham defines the fecundity of a pleasure or pain as:\nA: its chance of occurring.\nB: the degree to which it is felt.\nC: its chance of being followed by sensations of the same kind.\nD: how long it lasts.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the definition of fecundity within Bentham's utilitarian framework. Fecundity, in this context, refers to the likelihood that a particular pleasure or pain will be followed by similar sensations. This concept is important in evaluating the overall utility or disutility of a certain action or experience. Therefore, I would select option C as the correct definition of fecundity in this context.",
