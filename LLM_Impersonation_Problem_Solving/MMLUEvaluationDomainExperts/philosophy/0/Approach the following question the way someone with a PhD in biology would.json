In the context of biology, aesthetics would deal with objects or aspects of the natural world that are not necessary for our survival or reproduction, but which may provide us with a sense of pleasure or appreciation. This would include things like colorful flowers, beautiful landscapes, or the intricate patterns on the wings of a butterfly. While these objects may not be essential to our existence in a biological sense, they can still hold value and significance for humans in terms of our emotional or psychological well-being.",
