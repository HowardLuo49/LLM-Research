In mathematics, we strive for objectivity, rationality, and consistency in our reasoning and arguments. Any assertion that justifies acts of injustice, breaking promises, or stealing is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of our intellectual pursuits.\n\nTherefore, based on ethical principles and logical reasoning, I must argue that it is never permissible to commit acts of injustice, break promises, or steal.
