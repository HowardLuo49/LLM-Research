    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing it from a logical and ethical standpoint. \n\nFirstly, Cicero's claim that it is sometimes permissible to commit acts of injustice, break promises, or steal goes against the commonly accepted norms of ethical behavior. In the field of computer science, ethical considerations are paramount, particularly when it comes to issues such as privacy, security, and fairness in algorithmic decision-making. Therefore, it is unlikely that a computer scientist with a PhD would agree with Cicero's claims.\n\nFurthermore, from a logical perspective, committing acts of injustice, breaking promises, or stealing can have negative consequences both on a personal level and in society as a whole. In computer science, logical reasoning and critical thinking are key skills that are used to analyze problems and develop effective solutions. Therefore, it is unlikely that a computer scientist with a PhD would condone behavior that goes against these principles.\n\nIn conclusion, based on ethical considerations and logical reasoning, a computer scientist with a PhD would likely choose option D: none of the above, as the most appropriate response to Cicero's claims.",
