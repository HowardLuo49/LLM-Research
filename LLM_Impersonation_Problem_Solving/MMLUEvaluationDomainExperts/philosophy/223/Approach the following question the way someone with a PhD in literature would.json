In his work \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), Cicero explores the interplay between moral duty and practicality, advocating for a system of ethics that is based on natural law and reason.\n\nCicero argues that there are certain circumstances in which it may be permissible to break promises or commit acts that would normally be considered unjust. This notion is rooted in his belief that the ultimate goal of ethical behavior is the attainment of a virtuous life, which may sometimes require making difficult decisions that go against conventional moral norms.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Cicero does not advocate for moral relativism or the justification of unethical behavior. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of carefully weighing one's actions in light of their potential consequences and striving to act in accordance with principles of justice and honesty.\n\nTherefore, in response to the question, it can be argued that Cicero would endorse the idea that it is sometimes permissible to break promises or commit acts that may be seen as unjust, but only in exceptional circumstances where doing so would ultimately lead to a greater good or uphold a higher moral principle.",
