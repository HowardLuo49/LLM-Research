    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach Cicero's claim with a nuanced understanding of moral philosophy. In his work, Cicero argues that there may be certain situations in which it is permissible to break promises or commit acts that would typically be considered unjust or morally wrong. This position is rooted in his belief in the inherent complexity and context-dependent nature of moral dilemmas.\n\nCicero's stance is reflective of a broader philosophical tradition that recognizes the complexities of moral decision-making and the potential for conflicting moral principles to come into play. For example, in situations where breaking a promise or committing an act of theft may be necessary to prevent greater harm or secure a greater good, Cicero argues that it may be permissible to do so.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that Cicero advocates for a blanket permission to commit acts of injustice or break promises without any regard for the moral consequences. Instead, his claim underscores the importance of carefully considering the specific circumstances and potential consequences of one's actions when making moral judgments.\n\nTherefore, as a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach Cicero's claim by acknowledging the complexity and context-dependent nature of moral decision-making, while also recognizing the need for ethical reflection and consideration of the implications of one's actions. Ultimately, the answer to whether it is permissible to commit acts of injustice, break promises, or steal would depend on a thorough analysis of the specific circumstances and moral principles at play.",
