While Singer may acknowledge that famine relief can lead to short-term increases in population, he would argue that the imperative to alleviate immediate suffering trumps concerns about potential long-term consequences.\n\nFurthermore, Singer may also highlight the importance of addressing underlying issues such as poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and unequal distribution of resources as factors contributing to both famine and overpopulation.
