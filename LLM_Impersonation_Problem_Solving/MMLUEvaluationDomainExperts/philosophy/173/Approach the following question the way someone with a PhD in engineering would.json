Singer argues against the notion that famine relief is counterproductive because it leads to overpopulation. From a scientific and analytical perspective, I would evaluate the empirical evidence and data supporting or refuting this claim.\n\nIn this context, Singer likely argues that the idea that famine relief leads to overpopulation has been empirically shown to be false. This perspective aligns with the scientific method of relying on objective evidence and data to support claims.
