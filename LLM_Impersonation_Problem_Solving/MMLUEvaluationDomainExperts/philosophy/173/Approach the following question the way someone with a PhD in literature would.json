Instead, he would emphasize the importance of addressing the urgent needs of individuals experiencing famine, while acknowledging the complexities and ethical considerations involved in discussions about population growth.\n\nTherefore, the most likely response from Singer to the argument that famine relief leads to overpopulation would be option A: this has empirically been shown to be false.
