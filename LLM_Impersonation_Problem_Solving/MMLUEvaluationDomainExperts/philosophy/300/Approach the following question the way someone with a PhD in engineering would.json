    "gpt_response": "The theory that asserts mental states are identical to brain states is known as identity theory. This perspective posits that mental states like thoughts, beliefs, and emotions are not separate entities from brain states, but rather, they are one and the same. This view has been influential in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science, as it provides a physicalist framework for understanding mental phenomena.",
