    "gpt_response": "According to Aristotle, we should begin ethical inquiry by specifying the aim of human life. This is because Aristotle believed that ethics is a practical science that seeks to understand the ultimate purpose or end goal of human existence, which in turn informs our understanding of what actions and behaviors are morally virtuous or morally reprehensible. By first defining the aim of human life, we can then determine what intrinsic values or duties are necessary in order to fulfill that aim and live a truly ethical and fulfilling life.",
