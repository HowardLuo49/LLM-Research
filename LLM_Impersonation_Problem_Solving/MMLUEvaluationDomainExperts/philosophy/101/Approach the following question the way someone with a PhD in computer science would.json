According to Brandt\u2019s theory, an ideal moral rule is one that would:\nA: maximize positive utility, ignoring negative utility.\nB: minimize negative utility, ignoring positive utility.\nC: maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted.\nD: take no account of either positive or negative utility.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "From a theoretical standpoint, Brandt's theory aligns with utilitarianism, which holds that the morally right action is the one that maximizes overall utility. Therefore, an ideal moral rule according to Brandt's theory would be one that maximizes utility, taking into account both positive and negative outcomes. This means that option C, \"maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted,\" would be the correct choice. Ignoring either positive or negative utility would not align with the principles of utilitarianism as outlined by Brandt.",
