According to Brandt\u2019s theory, an ideal moral rule is one that would:\nA: maximize positive utility, ignoring negative utility.\nB: minimize negative utility, ignoring positive utility.\nC: maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted.\nD: take no account of either positive or negative utility.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As an individual with a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by recognizing that Brandt's theory aims to determine an ideal moral rule based on utility considerations. In this context, utility refers to the overall balance of pleasure and pain resulting from the application of a particular moral rule.\n\nBrandt's theory suggests that an ideal moral rule is one that maximizes utility, taking into account both positive and negative utilities. This aligns with the concept of utilitarianism, which focuses on achieving the greatest overall happiness or well-being for the greatest number of individuals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be option C: maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted. This reflects the holistic approach to moral decision-making that considers all consequences, both favorable and unfavorable, in the pursuit of ethical and virtuous actions.",
