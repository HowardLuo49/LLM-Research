In this context, utility refers to the overall well-being or satisfaction derived from a particular action or decision.\n\nAccording to Brandt's theory, an ideal moral rule would be one that maximizes utility, taking into account both positive and negative utilities. This means that the moral rule should strive to increase overall well-being and minimize overall suffering for individuals affected by the rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\nC: maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted.",
