In light of this, the answer that aligns most closely with his teachings would likely be option C: only after careful reflection on the consequences of our actions.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, engaging in thoughtful reflection before acting can be seen as beneficial for survival and reproductive success. By considering the potential consequences of our actions, we are more likely to make decisions that are in our best interest and the interest of those around us. This can lead to more successful interactions with others in our social group, as well as better adaptation to changing environmental conditions.\n\nWhile the other options may have their merits in certain contexts, such as following natural instincts or acting for the benefit of the group, careful reflection on the consequences of our actions holds the most promise for promoting individual and collective well-being in the long term.",
