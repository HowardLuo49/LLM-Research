    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, my training and experience have taught me the importance of methodical and rigorous thinking. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, advises that we act only after careful reflection on the consequences of our actions. This approach aligns with the scientific method, which requires careful consideration of evidence, logical reasoning, and potential outcomes before drawing conclusions or taking action. By applying this philosophical stance to our decision-making processes, we can strive for greater ethical clarity and societal benefit. Therefore, I would recommend option C: only after careful reflection on the consequences of our actions, in line with both Stoic philosophy and scientific principles.",
