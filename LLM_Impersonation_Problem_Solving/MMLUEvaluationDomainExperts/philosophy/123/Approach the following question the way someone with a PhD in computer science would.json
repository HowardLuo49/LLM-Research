    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. Plato distinguishes knowledge from mere belief or opinion by saying that knowledge must be a true belief for which one can give a justification, a rationale, or \"logos.\"  In terms of his image of the Divided Line, for Plato, knowledge is attained only when our sensible experience is:\nA: grounded ultimately in what our senses reveal to us about the world of becoming.\nB: based on images of the good, beauty, and truth obtained from particular objects and on which the concepts and Forms depend.\nC: replaced by what we sincerely believe is true or have come to believe based on our upbringing.\nD: understood in terms of concepts or innate ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a Ph.D., I would approach this question by first analyzing Plato's concept of knowledge as outlined in the Divided Line allegory. Plato's perspective on knowledge maintains that true knowledge is not just a belief or opinion, but a belief that is justified with a rational explanation or \"logos.\"\n\nIn the context of the Divided Line, Plato argues that knowledge is only achieved when our sensible experiences are understood in terms of concepts or innate ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered. This aligns with option D, as it emphasizes the importance of rationality and understanding in the pursuit of true knowledge.\n\nPlato's view opposes options A, B, and C. Option A suggests that knowledge is grounded in sensory experiences, which, according to Plato, are deceptive and unreliable. Option B suggests that knowledge is based on images of the good, beauty, and truth obtained from particular objects, which, while connected to Forms, are not enough to constitute true knowledge. Option C implies that knowledge is a product of sincere belief, contrary to Plato's requirement of rational justification.\n\nTherefore, a computer scientist with a Ph.D. would select option D as the most accurate representation of Plato's perspective on knowledge in the context of the Divided Line.",
