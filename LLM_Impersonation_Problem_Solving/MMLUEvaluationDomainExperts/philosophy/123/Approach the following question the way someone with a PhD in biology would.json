    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. Plato distinguishes knowledge from mere belief or opinion by saying that knowledge must be a true belief for which one can give a justification, a rationale, or \"logos.\"  In terms of his image of the Divided Line, for Plato, knowledge is attained only when our sensible experience is:\nA: grounded ultimately in what our senses reveal to us about the world of becoming.\nB: based on images of the good, beauty, and truth obtained from particular objects and on which the concepts and Forms depend.\nC: replaced by what we sincerely believe is true or have come to believe based on our upbringing.\nD: understood in terms of concepts or innate ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered.",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by critically analyzing Plato's theory of knowledge and the Divided Line. From a biological perspective, it is important to understand the role of sensory experiences in shaping our understanding of the world around us.\n\nPlato argues that knowledge is attained when our sensible experience is understood in terms of concepts or innate ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered. This view aligns with the scientific method, which relies on empirical evidence and rational reasoning to form justified beliefs.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is D: understood in terms of concepts or innate ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered. This reflects the importance of logical reasoning and empirical evidence in establishing knowledge in both biology and philosophy.",
