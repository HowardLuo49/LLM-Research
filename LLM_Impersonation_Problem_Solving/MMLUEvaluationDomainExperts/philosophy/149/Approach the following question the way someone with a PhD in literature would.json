    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by examining Tolstoy's life, particularly his spiritual journey and conversion to a more religious and moral way of living. Before his conversion, Tolstoy was surrounded by wealth, fame, and privilege as a member of the Russian aristocracy. These material possessions and societal status could be seen as providing him with what is considered complete happiness in the eyes of many, but Tolstoy himself ultimately found them lacking and unfulfilling.\n\nFurthermore, Tolstoy's exploration of existential questions, such as the meaning of life, the nature of happiness, and the pursuit of truth, suggests that he was surrounded by a sense of intellectual and emotional turmoil that led him towards a deeper insight into the human condition. As such, options A and D could be seen as the most relevant to Tolstoy's pre-conversion surroundings.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in literature approach to this question would involve a nuanced analysis of Tolstoy's personal and philosophical journey, considering the complexities of his social context, spiritual beliefs, and artistic output.",
