Berkeley, an 18th-century philosopher, argued that material substance does not exist independently of perception and that sensory experiences are the only reality. Therefore, sensible things, according to Berkeley, cannot exist except in a mind. This concept aligns with his notion of immaterialism, which posits that all reality is ultimately mental or spiritual in nature. In this context, the correct answer would be: A) a mind.",
