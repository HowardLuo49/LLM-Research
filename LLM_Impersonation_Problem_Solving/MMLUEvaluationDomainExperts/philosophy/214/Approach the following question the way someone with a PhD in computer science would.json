This is because Bentham's ethical theory, known as utilitarianism, posits that the right course of action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure and minimizes overall suffering or pain. This principle dictates that individuals should always act in a way that maximizes the greatest net balance of pleasure over pain for all affected by the action. Thus, decisions about what we ought to do are determined by the calculation of the expected outcomes in terms of pleasure and pain.",
