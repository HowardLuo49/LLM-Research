    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand Jeremy Bentham's ethical philosophy, known as utilitarianism. According to Bentham, the morality of an action is determined by its consequences in terms of pleasure and pain. In other words, an action is morally right if it leads to the greatest amount of overall pleasure or happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nBased on this understanding, Bentham would argue that considerations of pain and pleasure determine what we ought to do. This aligns with option A: \"what we ought to do.\" Utilitarianism dictates that we should always strive to maximize pleasure and minimize pain in our actions in order to promote the greatest overall happiness. Therefore, Bentham's ethical framework is prescriptive in nature, guiding individuals towards actions that maximize pleasure and minimize pain.\n\nIn contrast, Bentham's philosophy does not dictate what individuals will actually do in practice. Human behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond just considerations of pain and pleasure, such as personal beliefs, social norms, and individual desires. Therefore, Bentham's ethical theory does not determine what individuals will do in any given situation, as suggested by option B: \"what we will do.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Bentham's utilitarianism is focused on guiding individuals towards actions that maximize pleasure and minimize pain, making option A: \"what we ought to do\" the correct answer in this context.",
