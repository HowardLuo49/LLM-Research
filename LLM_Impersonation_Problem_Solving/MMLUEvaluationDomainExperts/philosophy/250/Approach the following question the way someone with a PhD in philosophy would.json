    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In the realm of research ethics, the method most commonly associated with a lack of informed consent would be covert observation. Covert observation involves the researcher monitoring subjects without their knowledge or consent, which raises ethical concerns regarding privacy, autonomy, and respect for the individuals being observed. This method is often considered problematic in terms of upholding principles of beneficence and respect for human dignity, as it can lead to potential harm or violation of individuals' rights without their explicit consent. Ethical guidelines and regulations typically require researchers to obtain informed consent from participants before conducting any research activities, to ensure that individuals are aware of the nature of the study and their role, as well as any potential risks or benefits involved. In the absence of informed consent, covert observation can pose significant ethical challenges and may not align with ethical principles guiding research conduct.",
