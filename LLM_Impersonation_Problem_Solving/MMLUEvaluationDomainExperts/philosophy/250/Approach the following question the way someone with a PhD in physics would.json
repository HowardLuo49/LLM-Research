In the context of data collection methods, covert observation is most commonly associated with a lack of informed consent. Covert observation involves observing subjects without their knowledge or explicit consent, thereby violating their right to be informed and participate voluntarily in the research. This method raises significant ethical concerns and is generally not considered acceptable in research ethics guidelines. It is important for researchers to prioritize the protection and autonomy of human subjects by obtaining adequate informed consent before conducting any form of research.",
