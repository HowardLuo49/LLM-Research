    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is important to first establish a foundational understanding of the concept of informed consent within research ethics. Informed consent is a key principle that ensures research participants are fully informed about the nature of the study, its procedures, risks, benefits, and their rights before agreeing to participate. This ethical requirement is crucial in upholding the autonomy and welfare of research participants.\n\nAmong the methods listed, covert observation is most commonly associated with a lack of informed consent. Covert observation involves researchers observing and recording behavior without the knowledge or consent of the individuals being observed. This can raise significant ethical concerns, as it violates the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice that underpin research ethics guidelines. Without informed consent, participants are deprived of the opportunity to make an informed decision about their involvement in the study, potentially leading to ethical breaches and harm to participants.\n\nIn contrast, qualitative content analysis, in-depth interviewing, and structured interviewing typically involve direct interaction with participants, where informed consent can be obtained through explaining the research purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. While challenges related to informed consent may still arise in these methods, covert observation stands out as the method most commonly associated with a lack of informed consent in research practice.",
