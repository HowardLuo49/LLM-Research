Informed consent is a crucial ethical principle in research and involves ensuring that participants fully understand the purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits of the study before they agree to participate.\n\nCovert observation is most commonly associated with a lack of informed consent. This method involves observing individuals without their knowledge or consent, which violates the principle of informed consent. In covert observation, participants are unaware that they are being studied, and therefore cannot provide consent or withdraw from the study. This lack of transparency and respect for the autonomy of participants makes covert observation ethically problematic and raises concerns about the protection of participants' rights and well-being.",
