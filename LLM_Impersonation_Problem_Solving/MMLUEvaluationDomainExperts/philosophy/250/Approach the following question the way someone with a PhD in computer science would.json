    "gpt_response": "The method most commonly associated with a lack of informed consent is covert observation. Covert observation involves observing subjects without their knowledge or consent, which raises ethical concerns about respect for individuals' autonomy and rights to privacy. This method can be particularly problematic in research involving vulnerable populations or sensitive topics, where obtaining informed consent is essential to protecting participants' well-being and rights. Researchers must carefully consider the ethical implications of covert observation and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect participants' rights and minimize potential harm.",
