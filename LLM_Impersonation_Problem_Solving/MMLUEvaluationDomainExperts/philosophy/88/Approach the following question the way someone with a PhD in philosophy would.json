    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. To say that \"philosophy\" (like \"love\" or \"art\") is not a closed concept means that we cannot state the necessary and sufficient conditions by which it is defined.  Rather, philosophic issues are identifiable as having \"family resemblances\" with one another.  In other words:\nA: there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another.\nB: the way we come to think about philosophy, love, or art really depends on how we were raised by our families to identify things as resembling one another.\nC: the necessary and sufficient condition for something to be considered philosophic is that it answers either of these questions: What does it mean? and How do you know?\nD: philosophy is not a closed discipline insofar as it is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD in the field, I would argue that option A is the most accurate representation of the nature of philosophy as a discipline. The idea that philosophy is not a closed concept suggests that there is no one defining characteristic that can be used to pinpoint exactly what a philosophical issue is. Instead, we can identify philosophical issues by the way they are related to other issues in a broad network of ideas.\n\nDrawing on Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of \"family resemblances,\" we can understand philosophy as a field where issues overlap and intersect in complex ways, rather than being neatly categorized according to a rigid set of necessary and sufficient conditions. This challenges the notion that philosophy can be neatly defined and confined within strict boundaries.\n\nIt is not the case that philosophy is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true, as option D suggests. Rather, philosophy involves critical thinking, rigorous argumentation, and a deep engagement with the complex questions that shape our understanding of the world. The idea that philosophical issues have family resemblances with one another highlights the interconnected and dynamic nature of philosophical inquiry, reflecting the diversity and richness of human thought.",
