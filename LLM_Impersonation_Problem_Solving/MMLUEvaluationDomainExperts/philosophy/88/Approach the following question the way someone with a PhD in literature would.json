To say that \"philosophy\" (like \"love\" or \"art\") is not a closed concept means that we cannot state the necessary and sufficient conditions by which it is defined.  Rather, philosophic issues are identifiable as having \"family resemblances\" with one another.  In other words:\nA: there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another.\nB: the way we come to think about philosophy, love, or art really depends on how we were raised by our families to identify things as resembling one another.\nC: the necessary and sufficient condition for something to be considered philosophic is that it answers either of these questions: What does it mean? and How do you know?\nD: philosophy is not a closed discipline insofar as it is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true.",

They would likely draw on the concept of \"family resemblances\" as described by Wittgenstein, highlighting the interconnectedness and shared characteristics among various philosophical issues rather than a fixed set of criteria for defining philosophy. The emphasis would be on the open-ended nature of philosophy, which allows for diverse perspectives and interpretations to coexist within the discipline. The PhD in literature would likely argue that this approach enriches philosophical inquiry and fosters intellectual dialogue by embracing a plurality of viewpoints and interpretations.",
