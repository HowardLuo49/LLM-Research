    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. To say that \"philosophy\" (like \"love\" or \"art\") is not a closed concept means that we cannot state the necessary and sufficient conditions by which it is defined.  Rather, philosophic issues are identifiable as having \"family resemblances\" with one another.  In other words:\nA: there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another.\nB: the way we come to think about philosophy, love, or art really depends on how we were raised by our families to identify things as resembling one another.\nC: the necessary and sufficient condition for something to be considered philosophic is that it answers either of these questions: What does it mean? and How do you know?\nD: philosophy is not a closed discipline insofar as it is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "A PhD in physics would approach this question by acknowledging the complexity and diversity of philosophical issues and perspectives. They would likely agree with option A, stating that there is no one defining feature that exclusively identifies an issue as philosophic. Instead, they would see philosophical issues as having interconnected aspects that overlap and are roughly associated with each other. This is similar to how in physics, different phenomena may have overlapping characteristics and shades of gray rather than being strictly categorized.\n\nThey would also likely agree with the idea that philosophy is not a closed concept, as new perspectives and interpretations can continuously reshape and expand our understanding of philosophical problems. They would appreciate the open-mindedness and willingness of philosophy to accept a wide range of viewpoints and answers, similar to how scientific theories are constantly evolving based on new evidence and perspectives.\n\nOverall, a PhD in physics would approach this question through a lens of complexity and interconnectedness, appreciating the nuanced nature of philosophical issues and the evolving nature of the discipline as a whole.",
