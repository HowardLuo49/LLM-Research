    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. To say that \"philosophy\" (like \"love\" or \"art\") is not a closed concept means that we cannot state the necessary and sufficient conditions by which it is defined.  Rather, philosophic issues are identifiable as having \"family resemblances\" with one another.  In other words:\nA: there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another.\nB: the way we come to think about philosophy, love, or art really depends on how we were raised by our families to identify things as resembling one another.\nC: the necessary and sufficient condition for something to be considered philosophic is that it answers either of these questions: What does it mean? and How do you know?\nD: philosophy is not a closed discipline insofar as it is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "A: there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another.\n\nExplanation: The concept of philosophy, like love and art, is open-ended and does not have a fixed set of necessary and sufficient conditions for its definition. Instead, philosophical issues are characterized by their family resemblances, meaning that they share similar traits or characteristics with other philosophical ideas, forming a network of interconnected concepts. This interconnectedness allows for a broad and diverse range of topics and approaches within the field of philosophy, making it an open and dynamic discipline.",
