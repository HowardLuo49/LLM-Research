    "gpt_response": "As per the philosophies espoused by Socrates, an unexamined life is deemed tragic primarily due to the detrimental consequences it inflicts upon the individual's soul. Through engaging in self-reflection and critical examination of one's thoughts, beliefs, and actions, Socrates posits that individuals are able to cultivate true wisdom and attain a deep understanding of the world around them. Failure to embark upon this journey of self-discovery and introspection ultimately leads to a degradation of the soul, contributing to a state of ignorance, moral decay, and spiritual impoverishment. Consequently, Socrates argues that an unexamined life not only deprives individuals of personal growth and fulfillment but also poses a significant threat to the well-being of the community and the broader society at large.",
