    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The idea that an unexamined life is a tragedy, as espoused by Socrates, can be interpreted within a philosophical framework that emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and introspection for personal growth and ethical development. From a metaphysical perspective, the root of this tragedy can be traced back to the notion of the soul. In the Platonic tradition, the soul is regarded as the core of one's being, housing one's true identity, values, and virtues. Failure to engage in self-examination and self-awareness can lead to the neglect and corruption of the soul, resulting in a disconnection from one's authentic self and a deviation from the path of moral excellence. Therefore, according to Socrates, an unexamined life is a tragedy because it inflicts grievous harm to the soul, disrupting the harmony and integrity of one's inner world.",
