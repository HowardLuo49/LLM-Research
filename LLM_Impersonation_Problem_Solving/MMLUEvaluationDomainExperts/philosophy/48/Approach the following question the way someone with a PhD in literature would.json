This implies that these duties do not require empirical evidence or logical proof to be valid or known. Instead, Ross suggests that they are intuitively apprehended by individuals with moral sensitivity and reflect universal moral truths. Therefore, Option B, that our prima facie duties are self-evident, aligns with Ross's perspective in moral philosophy.",
