These duties are not based on any external proof or objective criterion, but are instead intuitively known and recognized by individuals. Ross argues that these duties are self-evident in nature, meaning that they are immediately and clearly perceived as morally binding. This perspective aligns with the belief that our prima facie duties are indeed self-evident and do not require external validation or proof.",
