    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I must approach this question by considering the perspectives and theories within the field of ethics rather than solely relying on my scientific expertise. In this case, the concept of prima facie duties is a foundational principle within ethical philosophy, particularly in the deontological ethical framework proposed by philosophers such as W.D. Ross.\n\nAccording to Ross, prima facie duties are moral principles that provide guidance in ethical decision-making, such as duties of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and fidelity. These duties are considered to be self-evident in the sense that they do not require further justification or proof, but rather serve as fundamental moral truths that guide our actions.\n\nTherefore, based on Ross's perspective and the ethical framework within which prima facie duties are situated, the most appropriate answer to the question is B: our prima facie duties are self-evident. This aligns with the understanding that these duties are considered to be intuitively known and accepted as foundational moral principles in guiding ethical behavior.",
