The concept of prima facie duties refers to duties that are binding but can be overridden by stronger moral obligations. In this context, the statement that our prima facie duties are self-evident aligns with traditional ethical theories such as deontology, which asserts that certain moral principles are inherently known or intuitively understood.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be B: our prima facie duties are self-evident. This aligns with the philosophical framework within which ethical principles are believed to be objectively true and universally applicable, based on rational reflection and moral intuition.",
