In response to the claim that deliberative justification is incomplete, it is essential to consider the insights provided by Gauthier in expanding the definition of deliberative justification.\n\nGauthier's argument that deliberative justification by definition takes account of all relevant considerations is significant in addressing the issue of incompleteness. By asserting that the process of deliberative justification inherently encompasses the evaluation of all pertinent factors, Gauthier is suggesting that the potential limitations of this form of justification are mitigated by its comprehensive nature.\n\nMoreover, Gauthier's claim that deliberative justification works implies that despite its perceived incompleteness, the effectiveness of this method in guiding decision-making processes cannot be overlooked. By emphasizing the practical utility of deliberative justification, Gauthier provides further support for the validity and applicability of this approach in real-world scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, Gauthier's argument that all theories of justification are equally incomplete underscores the inherent challenges in constructing a fully comprehensive framework for justifying beliefs and actions. This recognition of the limitations of all theories of justification underscores the need for a nuanced and critical approach to evaluating the efficacy of different approaches in addressing complex ethical and epistemological dilemmas.\n\nIn summary, a PhD in computer science would approach the question of deliberative justification with a focus on the logical consistency, practical applicability, and inherent limitations of this method, as articulated by Gauthier. By critically analyzing and interpreting Gauthier's insights, one can develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of deliberative justification and its role in informing decision-making processes.",
