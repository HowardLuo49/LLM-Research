    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by utilizing a logical and rational approach. According to Ross, constructing a moral theory should involve constructing logical proofs for moral principles. This means using reasoning and critical thinking to arrive at ethical principles that are sound and defensible. Consulting social conventions, reflecting on personal beliefs, and consulting scripture are important considerations, but a robust and well-founded moral theory should be based on logical proofs that can withstand scrutiny and debate. Therefore, I would argue that constructing logical proofs for moral principles is the most appropriate approach for developing a coherent and defensible moral theory.",
