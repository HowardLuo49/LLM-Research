In this context, Ross argues that the process of constructing a moral theory should involve reflecting on what we really think. This approach emphasizes the importance of introspection and self-reflection in determining our moral beliefs and principles. Rather than relying solely on logical proofs, social conventions, or scripture, Ross suggests that a moral theory should be grounded in our own considered judgments and intuitions about what is morally right or wrong. This approach highlights the subjective and personal nature of moral reasoning, which is a central concern in ethical philosophy.",
