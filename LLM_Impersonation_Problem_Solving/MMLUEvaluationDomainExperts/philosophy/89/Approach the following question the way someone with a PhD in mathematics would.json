According to Ross, we should construct a moral theory by:\nA: constructing logical proofs for moral principles.\nB: consulting social conventions.\nC: reflecting on what we really think.\nD: consulting scripture.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Ross would argue that constructing a moral theory involves a combination of all the options provided. Logical proofs are important in determining the consistency and validity of moral principles. Consulting social conventions can provide insights into what is considered moral within a particular society or culture. Reflecting on our own beliefs and intuitions is crucial in understanding our moral inclinations. Additionally, consulting scripture can offer valuable moral guidelines for some individuals. Therefore, a comprehensive moral theory should consider all of these aspects in order to construct a well-rounded and robust framework for moral decision-making.",
