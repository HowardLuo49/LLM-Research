    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I approach this question by examining the perspective of Epicurus, a Greek philosopher. According to Epicurus, the wealth required for a good life is likely to be viewed as easily procured. Epicurus advocated for a simple and modest lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. Therefore, he would likely argue that happiness and a good life do not necessarily require great wealth or extravagant possessions.
