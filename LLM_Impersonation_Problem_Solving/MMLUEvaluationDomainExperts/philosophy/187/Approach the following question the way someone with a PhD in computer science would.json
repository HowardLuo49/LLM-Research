According to Epicurus, the wealth required for a good life is:\nA: easily procured.\nB: attainable for everyone, but only through great effort.\nC: available only to the rich.\nD: available only to the gods.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first examining the teachings of Epicurus, a philosopher from ancient Greece who believed in a life of tranquility and freedom from fear and pain. Epicurus emphasized the pursuit of pleasure and the importance of friendship, simple living, and self-reflection.\n\nIn this context, the wealth required for a good life according to Epicurus would likely align with his belief that true happiness comes from inner peace and contentment rather than material possessions. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Epicurus would advocate for option A: easily procured wealth as the answer to this question.\n\nEpicurus would likely argue that true wealth is not necessarily tied to financial or material abundance, but rather to the ability to live comfortably and pursue one's own happiness without being burdened by excessive wants or desires. While wealth may be necessary to meet basic needs and secure a level of comfort, Epicurus would likely emphasize that true fulfillment and contentment come from within, rather than from external sources such as money or possessions.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the teachings of Epicurus, the wealth required for a good life is likely to be easily procured, as true happiness and contentment are not dependent on external wealth or luxury, but rather on internal values and beliefs that promote peace of mind and fulfillment.",
