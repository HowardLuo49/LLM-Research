Mill argues that virtue:\nA: is not desirable.\nB: is desirable only as a means to one\u2019s own happiness.\nC: is desirable only as a means to the happiness of others.\nD: is desirable as part of one\u2019s happiness.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To properly engage with Mill's argument on virtue, it is paramount to delve into his consequentialist ethical framework which stresses the importance of maximizing overall happiness as the ultimate goal of morality. In his seminal work, \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill posits that virtue, as a component of happiness, is indeed desirable. However, he diverges from the notion that virtue is solely valuable for its own sake, instead championing the view that virtue is instrumental in contributing to one's overall happiness.\n\nTherefore, within the framework of Mill's utilitarian philosophy, the option that accurately captures his stance on the desirability of virtue would be option D: \"is desirable as part of one's happiness.\" This perspective highlights Mill's belief that cultivating virtues such as kindness, integrity, and justice not only promotes individual well-being but also plays a crucial role in fostering the greater happiness of society as a whole. Ultimately, by integrating virtue into one's pursuit of happiness, individuals can align their actions with the ethical principles that uphold the greatest good for the greatest number.",
