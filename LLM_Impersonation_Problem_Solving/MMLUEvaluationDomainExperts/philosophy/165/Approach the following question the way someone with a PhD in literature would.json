    "gpt_response": "In his seminal work, Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill posits that virtue is integral to the pursuit of happiness. He argues that true happiness is not merely the pursuit of one's own pleasure, but rather the cultivation of virtues such as kindness, empathy, and justice. Therefore, Mill would argue that virtue (option D) is desirable as part of one's happiness, as it contributes to a deeper and more enduring sense of fulfillment and well-being. This aligns with his overall philosophy of utilitarianism, which places emphasis on the greatest good for the greatest number of people.",
