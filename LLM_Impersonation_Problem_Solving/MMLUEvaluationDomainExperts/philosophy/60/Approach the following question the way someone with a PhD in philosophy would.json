According to Baier\u2019s theory, the second step in assessing whether an action is morally permissible is to find out:\nA: whether it is forbidden by a moral rule of one\u2019s group.\nB: whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.\nC: whether it is forbidden by a law.\nD: whether one can approve of it.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In Baier's theory of moral permissibility, the second step involves a critical evaluation of the moral rule that prohibits the action in question. This entails determining whether the moral rule is indeed a genuine moral rule, as opposed to a mere societal convention or arbitrary prohibition. This evaluation requires a careful examination of the underlying principles and values that inform the moral rule, as well as an assessment of its coherence and consistency with other established moral principles. Ultimately, the goal is to ascertain whether the moral rule is truly grounded in moral reasoning and ethical considerations, rather than mere societal norms or personal preferences.",
