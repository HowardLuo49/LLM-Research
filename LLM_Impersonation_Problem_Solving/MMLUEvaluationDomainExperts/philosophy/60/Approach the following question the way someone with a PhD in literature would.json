    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. According to Baier\u2019s theory, the second step in assessing whether an action is morally permissible is to find out:\nA: whether it is forbidden by a moral rule of one\u2019s group.\nB: whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.\nC: whether it is forbidden by a law.\nD: whether one can approve of it.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Baier's theory of moral permissibility, it is important to note that the second step involves delving deeper into the nature of the moral rule that may or may not forbid the action in question. Baier posits that simply determining if an action is forbidden by a moral rule of one's social group is not sufficient in evaluating its morality. Instead, the key consideration at this stage is to ascertain the legitimacy and authenticity of the moral rule itself. In essence, the second step involves questioning whether the moral rule that prohibits the action holds true moral weight and validity. Consequently, the answer to the question posed would be B: whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule. This nuanced approach underscores Baier's emphasis on the critical examination and validation of moral norms and rules in the moral decision-making process.",
