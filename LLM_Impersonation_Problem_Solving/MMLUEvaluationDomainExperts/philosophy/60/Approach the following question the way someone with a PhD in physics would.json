In this context, the second step in assessing whether an action is morally permissible involves determining whether the moral rule prohibiting it is indeed a genuine moral rule. This step goes beyond simply considering the rules of one's group or society, or whether the action is legally forbidden. Instead, it delves into the deeper moral foundations and justifications for the rule itself, evaluating its inherent moral value and legitimacy. Therefore, the correct answer according to Baier's theory would be B: whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.",
