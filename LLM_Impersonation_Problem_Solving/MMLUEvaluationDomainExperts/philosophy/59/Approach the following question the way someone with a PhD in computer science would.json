Parfit is a well-known philosopher who has made significant contributions to the fields of ethics and personal identity. His claims often involve complex ethical dilemmas and thought experiments.\n\nIn this case, Parfit is discussing the concept of outcomes being better or worse than alternatives. Option A suggests that it is possible for an outcome to be worse for a particular person than some alternative, meaning that there could be a scenario where one person's well-being is not maximized in comparison to another scenario. Option B suggests that it is possible for an outcome to be worse than some alternative in a more general sense, without specifying a particular person.\n\nConsidering Parfit's work, it is likely that he would argue for the validity of both options A and B. Parfit's ethical framework often involves considerations of individual well-being and overall utility, so he would likely agree that outcomes can be worse for specific individuals and in a general sense compared to alternatives. Therefore, the correct answer would be option C: both a and b.",
