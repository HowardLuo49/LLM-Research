Parfit's claim A that \"it is possible for an outcome to be worse for a particular person than some alternative\" can be understood in terms of individual subjective experiences and preferences. This idea aligns with the concept of personal utility and satisfaction, which can vary between individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, claim B that \"it is possible for an outcome to be worse than some alternative\" suggests a more objective evaluation of outcomes, potentially based on some universal standard or measure of goodness or well-being. In the context of moral philosophy, this could relate to the concept of overall social utility or maximizing the well-being of a population.\n\nTherefore, given the nature of these claims, it is possible that both A and B could be true simultaneously. Claim A focuses on individual perspectives and experiences, while claim B highlights broader ethical considerations. As such, the most appropriate answer would be C: both A and B.",
