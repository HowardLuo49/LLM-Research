Paley's argument revolves around the concept of design in nature, specifically comparing the design of a watch to the design of biological systems. \n\nThe key difference that Paley is highlighting is that the design of nature, which he refers to as the \"contrivance\" of nature, is greater and grander than that of a man-made object like a watch. This emphasizes the complexity and intricacy of natural systems, such as the human body or ecosystems, which exhibit a level of design and functionality that far surpasses anything created by human hands.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer choice would be D: greater and grander, as this aligns with Paley's argument regarding the superiority of natural design compared to human contrivances.",
