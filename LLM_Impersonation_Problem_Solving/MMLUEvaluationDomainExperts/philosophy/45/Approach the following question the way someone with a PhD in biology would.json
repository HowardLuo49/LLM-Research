    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the concept of biological complexity and adaptation in nature. Paley's argument suggests that the intricate design and functionality of living organisms and ecosystems surpass the contrivance of human-made objects like watches. The key difference lies in the scale and complexity of natural systems, which have evolved over millions of years through natural selection and genetic variation. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: greater and grander, as nature's mechanisms and adaptations far exceed the simplicity and artificiality of man-made objects like watches.",
