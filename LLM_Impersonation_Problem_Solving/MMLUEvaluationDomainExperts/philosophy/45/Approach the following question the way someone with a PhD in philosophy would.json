Paley argues that the intricate design and functionality of a watch necessitate the existence of a watchmaker, and similarly, the complex and ordered nature of the natural world suggests the existence of a divine Creator.\n\nIn light of this, the key difference that Paley posits between the contrivance of a watch and that of nature is that the latter is greater and grander. This notion stems from the idea that the natural world exhibits an unparalleled level of complexity, organization, and beauty that far surpasses anything humans can create. The sheer magnitude and intricacy of nature's designs, from the molecular level to the cosmos as a whole, point towards a transcendent intelligence behind its creation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: greater and grander.",
