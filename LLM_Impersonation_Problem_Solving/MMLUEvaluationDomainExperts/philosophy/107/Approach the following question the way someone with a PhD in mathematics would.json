In the original position, parties are behind a veil of ignorance, where they do not know their own personal characteristics, interests, or circumstances. In this scenario, it would be nearly impossible for parties to accurately predict which policies would maximize happiness for all individuals involved, making utilitarianism impractical and unfeasible in such a situation. \n\nA PhD in mathematics would likely appreciate the complexity and uncertainty of trying to determine the consequences of various policies under utilitarianism, especially in a hypothetical scenario like the original position.
