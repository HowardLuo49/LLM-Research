Rawls argues that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because:\nA: it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.\nB: doing so would be too risky.\nC: it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.\nD: they would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "A party in the original position, as described by Rawls, would not accept utilitarianism because it fails to uphold the principles of justice as fairness. Utilitarianism focuses solely on maximizing overall happiness or utility, without considering the rights and interests of individuals. This approach would not be acceptable to parties in the original position, as they would prioritize ensuring fairness and protecting the most vulnerable members of society over simply maximizing overall happiness.\n\nAdditionally, utilitarianism may lead to unjust outcomes, such as sacrificing the rights or well-being of a minority group for the greater good of the majority. This conflicts with the principles of justice as fairness, as outlined by Rawls, which prioritize the equal treatment and protection of all individuals within a society.\n\nIn essence, parties in the original position would reject utilitarianism because it fails to uphold the principles of justice and fairness that they would prioritize when making decisions about the structure of society.",
