Rawls argues that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because:\nA: it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.\nB: doing so would be too risky.\nC: it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.\nD: they would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar in literature with a PhD, it is important to critically engage with Rawls's argument regarding the rejection of utilitarianism by parties in the original position. Rawls posits that individuals in the original position, behind the veil of ignorance, would not choose utilitarianism as a guiding principle for the distribution of resources and allocation of societal goods. \n\nOne of the reasons put forth by Rawls is the inherent uncertainty and difficulty in determining which policies would ultimately maximize overall happiness. Utilitarianism relies on the consequentialist framework of evaluating actions based on their outcomes, specifically in terms of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. However, the parties in the original position lack the necessary information and knowledge to accurately predict and assess the outcomes of various policies. This uncertainty and complexity may render utilitarianism less feasible and pragmatic as a moral theory within the context of the original position.\n\nAdditionally, Rawls suggests that adopting utilitarianism in the original position may entail significant risks and potential harms. Utilitarianism's emphasis on maximizing overall happiness could potentially result in sacrificing the interests and rights of certain individuals for the greater good. This utilitarian calculus may lead to injustices, such as the execution of innocent people, in the pursuit of the greatest overall happiness. Parties in the original position, behind the veil of ignorance, are rational and self-interested individuals who seek to secure their own essential liberties and interests. The risk of being on the losing end of utilitarian calculations may deter parties from choosing this moral theory as the foundational principle for societal organization.\n\nOverall, Rawls's argument against utilitarianism in the original position highlights the complexities, uncertainties, and risks associated with this consequentialist moral theory. Parties behind the veil of ignorance prioritize fairness, justice, and the protection of essential liberties, which may lead them to reject utilitarianism as a viable ethical framework within the original position.",
