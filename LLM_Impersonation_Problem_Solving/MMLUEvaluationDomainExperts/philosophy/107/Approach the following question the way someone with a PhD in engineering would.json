Rawls argues that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because:\nA: it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.\nB: doing so would be too risky.\nC: it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.\nD: they would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing Rawls' concept of the original position and its implications for the acceptance of utilitarianism. In the original position, parties are placed behind a \"veil of ignorance\" where they are unaware of their own characteristics, such as their social status, wealth, or personal preferences. This ensures that decisions are made without bias and in a fair manner.\n\nOne of the key reasons why parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism is because it may require them to make decisions that go against their own interests or values. Utilitarianism, as a consequentialist ethical theory, focuses on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, often at the expense of individual rights or justice. Parties in the original position, not knowing their own position in society, would be hesitant to endorse a theory that could potentially lead to unfair outcomes or actions that they themselves would not accept.\n\nAdditionally, the complexity and uncertainty involved in determining the outcomes of utilitarian policies may also deter parties from accepting it. Utilitarianism requires the calculation and comparison of the overall happiness or utility generated by different actions, which can be difficult to quantify objectively. Parties in the original position would likely prefer a more straightforward and clear-cut ethical theory that ensures fairness and justice for all individuals involved.\n\nIn conclusion, parties in the original position would have valid reasons for rejecting utilitarianism, including concerns about fairness, uncertainty in outcome determination, and the potential for unjust actions. These considerations align with Rawls' theory of justice as fairness, which emphasizes the importance of equal rights and opportunities for all individuals.",
