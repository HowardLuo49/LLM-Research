    "gpt_response": "Wolf argues that the unattractiveness of the moral saint gives us reason to abandon both utilitarianism and Kantianism. Utilitarianism, with its focus on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, may require moral saints to sacrifice their own happiness or well-being for the greater good, ultimately leading to a life devoid of personal fulfillment. On the other hand, Kantianism, with its emphasis on duty and moral rules, may require moral saints to prioritize universal principles over personal relationships or self-care, leading to a lack of authentic human connection and emotional depth. In light of these critiques, Wolf suggests that a more nuanced ethical theory is needed that allows for a balance between personal flourishing and moral commitments.",
