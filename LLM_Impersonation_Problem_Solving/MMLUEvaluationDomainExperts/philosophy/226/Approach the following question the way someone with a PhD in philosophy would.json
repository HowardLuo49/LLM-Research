One objection to Singer\u2019s theory that he considers is that it:\nA: does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\nB: inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\nC: does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\nD: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In delving into the intricacies of Singer's theoretical framework, one must carefully navigate the objections that have been raised against it. One such objection that Singer himself contemplates pertains to the contention that his theory fails to adequately address suffering in a global context, beyond the confines of our immediate geopolitical boundaries. This objection challenges the adequacy of Singer's moral framework in extending ethical considerations and responsibilities to individuals in distant lands who are also subject to significant deprivation and suffering.\n\nFurthermore, another objection that Singer grapples with is the assertion that his theory inappropriately assigns moral significance to proximity, thereby elevating the welfare of those geographically closer to us over individuals who are located further away. This objection touches upon the ethical complexities that arise when delineating the scope and boundaries of moral obligations, particularly in the context of global ethics and interconnectedness.\n\nMoreover, Singer also encounters the objection that his theory fails to acknowledge the nuanced moral distinctions that exist between our obligations to our loved ones and our responsibilities towards strangers. This objection underscores the primacy of personal relationships and the unique moral ties that bind us to our family and friends, which may necessitate a differentiated approach to allocating ethical duties and resources.\n\nFinally, one must contend with the objection that Singer's theory necessitates a radical overhaul of our existing moral framework, imposing significant revisions and alterations to our foundational ethical principles. This objection raises concerns about the practicality and feasibility of implementing Singer's proposed moral schema, as well as the potential repercussions of such a fundamental reconfiguration of moral norms and values.\n\nIn light of these multifaceted objections, it becomes evident that Singer's theory is subject to rigorous critique and scrutiny, prompting a deeper exploration of the complexities and challenges inherent in advocating for a more inclusive and expansive moral compass that transcends boundaries of proximity, personal relationships, and existing ethical frameworks.",
