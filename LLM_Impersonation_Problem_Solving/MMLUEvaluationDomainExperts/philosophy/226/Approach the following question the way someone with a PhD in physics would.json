One objection to Singer\u2019s theory that he considers is that it:\nA: does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\nB: inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\nC: does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\nD: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.",

    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I would approach this question by analyzing the underlying assumptions and implications of Singer's theory from a logical and rational perspective. In particular, I would focus on evaluating the objection that Singer's theory requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.\n\nOne key aspect of Singer's theory is the concept of effective altruism, which argues that individuals have a moral obligation to maximize the overall well-being of all sentient beings, regardless of their proximity or familiarity. This principle challenges traditional moral frameworks that prioritize the well-being of our loved ones or fellow citizens over that of strangers in need.\n\nFrom a physics perspective, I would consider the potential consequences of adopting Singer's theory on a societal level. Would such a drastic revision to our moral scheme lead to greater overall well-being and societal progress, or would it result in unintended negative consequences? I would also analyze the practical feasibility of implementing Singer's theory in a complex and interconnected global society.\n\nUltimately, I would approach the objection to Singer's theory by evaluating the implications of such a drastic revision to our moral scheme in a systematic and analytical manner, drawing on principles of logic, ethics, and societal well-being.",
