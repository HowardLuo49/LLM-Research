One objection to Singer\u2019s theory that he considers is that it:\nA: does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\nB: inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\nC: does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\nD: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.",

    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the logical implications of each statement and possible counterarguments in a rigorous manner. One objection to Singer's theory that he considers is that it inappropriately makes proximity morally important. This objection raises the concern that Singer's theory may prioritize helping those closest to us geographically over those in greater need who may be further away. By delving deeper into the ethical framework underlying Singer's theory and analyzing the potential consequences of prioritizing proximity, we can better evaluate the validity of this objection. Additionally, we could consider whether the objection holds up under different ethical principles or if there are potential solutions to mitigate the perceived issue of proximity in Singer's theory. In this way, a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics would approach this question with a logical and analytical mindset, carefully examining the nuances of the objection and its implications within Singer's moral framework.",
