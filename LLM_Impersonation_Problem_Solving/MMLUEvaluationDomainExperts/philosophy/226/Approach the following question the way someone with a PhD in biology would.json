One objection to Singer\u2019s theory that he considers is that it:\nA: does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\nB: inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\nC: does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\nD: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by critically analyzing the objections presented to Singer's theory. One objection that Singer considers is the idea that his theory does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers. This objection raises a valid point about the role of empathy and emotional connections in moral decision-making processes. From a biological perspective, it can be argued that our evolutionary history has shaped us to prioritize the well-being of those closest to us, as this can enhance the survival and reproductive success of our genes.\n\nFurthermore, research in neuroscience has shown that our brains are wired to respond more strongly to the suffering of individuals we are emotionally connected to, such as family and friends. This neural response can influence our moral intuitions and lead us to prioritize the needs of our loved ones over strangers. However, it is important to recognize that this bias towards our own social group may not always align with moral principles that seek to promote the greatest good for the greatest number of individuals.\n\nIn considering this objection, it is essential to balance our natural inclination towards caring for our loved ones with the ethical imperative to consider the well-being of all individuals, regardless of their proximity or familiarity to us. Singer's theory challenges us to extend our circle of moral concern beyond our immediate social group and to consider the interests of all sentient beings. While it is true that we may have stronger emotional attachments to our loved ones, this should not exempt us from considering the suffering of strangers and taking action to alleviate their pain.\n\nIn conclusion, from a biological perspective, the objection that Singer's theory does not account for our stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers highlights the complex interplay between evolutionary influences, neural mechanisms, and moral decision-making processes. By critically engaging with this objection, we can deepen our understanding of the ethical considerations involved in extending compassion and care to individuals both near and far.",
