One objection to Singer\u2019s theory that he considers is that it:\nA: does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\nB: inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\nC: does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\nD: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with expertise in literature and ethical theory, I would approach this question by considering the various nuances and complexities involved in Singer's argument. One objection that Singer considers is that his theory inappropriately makes proximity morally important. This objection challenges the idea that geographical distance should be a determining factor in our moral obligations towards others. Critics argue that Singer's emphasis on saving lives in distant countries over those in our immediate vicinity may be ethically problematic.\n\nSinger's theory raises important questions about the nature of ethics and our obligations to others, particularly in the face of widespread suffering and inequality. By questioning the moral significance of proximity, Singer encourages us to reconsider traditional notions of moral responsibility and expand our moral circle to include all sentient beings, regardless of their distance from us.\n\nFurthermore, Singer's theory challenges us to confront the moral complexities of our relationships with loved ones and strangers. While some critics argue that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers, Singer suggests that our moral duties should be based on objective factors such as the prevention of suffering, rather than subjective relationships or emotions. This raises important questions about the nature of moral duties and the universality of ethical principles.\n\nOverall, Singer's theory prompts us to critically examine our moral beliefs and consider how we can best alleviate suffering and promote justice in a global context. While some may object to Singer's theory on the grounds that it requires a drastic revision to our moral scheme, others may see it as a necessary and transformative reevaluation of our ethical responsibilities.",
