According to Kant, morality requires us to:\nA: perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness.\nB: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\nC: behave only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave.\nD: place the interests of others above the interests of ourselves.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a Ph.D. in biology, I would approach this question by considering the ethical framework put forth by Immanuel Kant. Kant's deontological ethics emphasize the importance of moral duties and principles that are independent of consequences. According to Kant, morality requires individuals to act on maxims that can be willed to become universal laws, which aligns with option B. This means that moral actions are not based on maximizing happiness or appealing to virtue, but rather on following rational and categorical imperatives that can be universally applied. Kant's focus on the inherent value of moral duty rather than the outcomes of actions sets his ethical theory apart from utilitarian approaches that prioritize outcomes such as total happiness. Therefore, based on Kantian ethics, the correct answer to the question would be B: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.",
