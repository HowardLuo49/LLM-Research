According to Kant, morality requires us to:\nA: perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness.\nB: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\nC: behave only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave.\nD: place the interests of others above the interests of ourselves.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, it is important to approach this question by examining it through the lens of Kantian ethics. Immanuel Kant, a prominent philosopher in the Enlightenment era, argued that morality requires individuals to act based on rational principles that can be universally applied. This leads us to option B: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\n\nKant's famous formulation of the categorical imperative states that individuals should act only according to maxims that they can will to become universal laws. This means that individuals should consider whether the principle behind their actions could be applied to everyone in a similar situation without leading to contradictions or irrationality. By following this principle, individuals are able to act in a morally upright way that is consistent with the autonomy and dignity of all rational beings.\n\nIn contrast, options A, C, and D do not align with Kant's moral philosophy. Option A, which suggests that individuals should perform actions that lead to the greatest total happiness, is more in line with utilitarianism, a different ethical framework that prioritizes the maximization of overall happiness. Option C, which proposes that individuals should behave as a perfectly virtuous person would, is more closely associated with virtue ethics, which emphasizes the cultivation of virtuous character traits.\n\nOption D, which suggests that individuals should place the interests of others above their own, does not necessarily reflect Kant's perspective on morality. While Kant does advocate for treating others with respect and dignity, he does not argue for self-sacrifice or the prioritization of others' interests over one's own. Instead, Kant emphasizes the importance of acting out of a sense of duty and following universal moral principles that respect the autonomy and rationality of all individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in engineering would argue that according to Kant, morality requires individuals to act only on maxims that can be willed to become universal laws, as this aligns with Kant's emphasis on rationality, autonomy, and consistency in moral decision-making.",
