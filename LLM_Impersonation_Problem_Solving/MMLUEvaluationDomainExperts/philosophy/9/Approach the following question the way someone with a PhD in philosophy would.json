According to Kant, morality requires us to:\nA: perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness.\nB: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\nC: behave only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave.\nD: place the interests of others above the interests of ourselves.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In accordance with Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, the correct response to the question posed would be option B: to act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws. Kant's deontological ethics is grounded in the concept of duty and the categorical imperative, which asserts that morality is not contingent upon the consequences of our actions, but rather on the principles or maxims from which we act. By adhering to universalizable maxims, individuals are able to uphold their moral duty and respect the inherent worth and dignity of all rational beings. Consequently, Kantian ethics prioritizes the rational capacity for autonomy and the necessity of acting in accordance with rational principles that can be universally applied.",
