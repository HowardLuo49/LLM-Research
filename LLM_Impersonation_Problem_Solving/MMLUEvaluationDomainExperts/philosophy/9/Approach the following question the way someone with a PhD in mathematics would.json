According to Kant, morality requires us to:\nA: perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness.\nB: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\nC: behave only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave.\nD: place the interests of others above the interests of ourselves.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the underlying principles and logic behind Kant's moral philosophy. Kant argues that morality is grounded in the concept of duty and the categorical imperative, which states that one should act only on maxims that can be willed to become universal laws without contradiction. This means that morality requires us to act in a way that is consistent with principles that can be universally applied and do not lead to logical inconsistencies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to Kant's moral philosophy would be:\n\nB: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.",
