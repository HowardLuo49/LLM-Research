According to Kant, morality requires us to:\nA: perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness.\nB: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\nC: behave only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave.\nD: place the interests of others above the interests of ourselves.",

    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by examining Immanuel Kant's ethical theory as outlined in his seminal work, \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals.\" Kant argues that morality is grounded in the concept of duty and rationality, rather than consequences or emotions.\n\nIn line with this, Kant proposes his famous categorical imperative, which states that we should act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws. This means that moral actions must be based on principles that could be consistently followed by all rational beings, regardless of personal desires or situations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to Kant would be B: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws. This highlights the importance of rationality, consistency, and duty in ethical decision-making, rather than the pursuit of happiness, virtuous behavior, or selfless sacrifice for others.",
