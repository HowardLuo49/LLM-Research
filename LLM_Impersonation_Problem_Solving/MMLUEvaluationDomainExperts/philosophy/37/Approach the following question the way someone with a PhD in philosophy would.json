In his seminal work \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes argues that in a state of nature, individuals are constantly in a state of war against each other due to their self-interested and competitive nature. In order to escape this state of nature and establish a stable society, individuals must enter into a social contract with each other and submit to the authority of a sovereign ruler.
