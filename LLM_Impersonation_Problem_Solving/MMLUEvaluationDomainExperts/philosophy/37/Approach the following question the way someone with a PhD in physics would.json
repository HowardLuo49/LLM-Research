    "gpt_response": "From a physicist's perspective, we can understand Hobbes' definition of injustice through the lens of social contract theory. In this framework, injustice is defined as a failure to abide by a contract. Hobbes believed that individuals in a society enter into a social contract with a sovereign authority in order to maintain social order and prevent the state of nature, which he believed to be characterized by chaos and violence. In this context, disobeying the terms of the social contract, as set by the sovereign, would be considered unjust. Therefore, according to Hobbes, the definition of injustice is C: failure to abide by a contract.",
