    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing the definition of animal motion as proposed by Hobbes from a logical and evidence-based perspective. In this context, Hobbes refers to animal motion as all voluntary behavior, which encompasses a broad range of actions and reactions carried out by animals that are based on their free will or conscious decision-making processes. This definition aligns with the principles of mechanical engineering, where the study of motion and behavior of systems plays a fundamental role in understanding and designing complex systems. Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be D: all voluntary behavior.",
