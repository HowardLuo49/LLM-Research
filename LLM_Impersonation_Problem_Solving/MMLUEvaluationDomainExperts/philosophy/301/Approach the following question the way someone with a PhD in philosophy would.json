Butler, a major figure in ethics and moral philosophy, developed a theory of human nature which emphasizes the harmony and coherence of human nature, positing that human beings are inherently rational and benevolent creatures. \n\nIn this context, Butler's assertion that to follow nature in the strictest and most proper sense is to act on one's conscience can be understood as an ethical imperative rooted in the intrinsic goodness and rationality of human nature. Acting on one's conscience, according to Butler, aligns with the fundamental nature of human beings as rational and benevolent agents, thereby promoting moral integrity and genuine self-fulfillment.\n\nTherefore, in the view of a philosopher with a PhD in philosophy, the correct answer to the question would be D: act on one's conscience, as it encapsulates Butler's ethical theory and conception of human nature in the most accurate and nuanced manner.",
