While this perspective may not align with all philosophical or ethical frameworks, it is important to consider the historical and cultural significance of religion in shaping ethical systems and moral reasoning.\n\nTherefore, as a PhD in engineering, I would analyze Anscombe's argument in relation to relevant ethical theories and debates, considering how religious beliefs and moral principles intersect in shaping individual and societal notions of moral obligation. This analytical approach would involve examining the underlying assumptions and implications of Anscombe's assertion, as well as potential criticisms or alternative interpretations that may arise from different philosophical perspectives.",
