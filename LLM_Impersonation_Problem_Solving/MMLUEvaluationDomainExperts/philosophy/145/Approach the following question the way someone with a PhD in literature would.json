In her influential essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe argues that the term \"moral obligation\" has lost its meaning in modern ethical discourse.\n\nIn Anscombe's view, \"moral obligation\" traditionally signified a sense of duty or responsibility rooted in a religious framework, particularly the commands of God. However, she criticizes this religious foundation as outdated and incoherent in a secular society. \n\nTherefore, according to Anscombe, the current understanding of \"moral obligation\" is not accurately captured by any of the options provided.
