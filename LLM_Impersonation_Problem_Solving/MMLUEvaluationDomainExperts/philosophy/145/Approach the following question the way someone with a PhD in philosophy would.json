    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher, I would approach this question by examining the writings and theories of Elizabeth Anscombe in order to understand her perspective on the concept of \"moral obligation.\" Anscombe, a prominent figure in contemporary moral philosophy, argued that \"moral obligation\" cannot be properly understood within a secular framework divorced from religious beliefs. \n\nIn her influential essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe criticizes the Enlightenment thinkers for severing morality from its religious foundations and reducing it to mere subjective preferences or societal norms. She maintains that without a belief in God as the ultimate source of moral authority, the concept of \"moral obligation\" loses its normative force and becomes merely a matter of individual feelings or social conventions.\n\nTherefore, according to Anscombe, \"moral obligation\" currently signifies the commands of God, as only a divine authority can provide a solid foundation for objective moral norms that bind individuals irrespective of their personal desires or societal conventions. This perspective stands in contrast to the secular interpretations of morality that dominate much of contemporary ethical discourse.",
