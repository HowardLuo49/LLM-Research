    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. According to Socrates, just as there is a difference between what an ironic statement says and its true meaning, so also appearances differ from reality.  Even though societies or individuals appear to differ about what is required for the good life, that in no way contradicts the fact that:\nA: what is right or wrong, true or false varies from one culture to another.\nB: appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.\nC: the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth.\nD: there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Approaching this question from a philosophical perspective, it is essential to unpack the intricate relationship between appearances and reality, as elucidated by the teachings of Socrates. Socrates posited that there exists a dichotomy between appearances, which are often deceiving, and reality, which constitutes the underlying truth. This distinction serves as the foundation for philosophical inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIn addressing the statement that societies or individuals may appear to differ about what is required for the good life, it is crucial to acknowledge that this apparent divergence does not negate the existence of objective principles for thought and action. Despite varying cultural norms and individual perspectives on the good life, there are overarching moral truths and ethical principles that transcend temporal and cultural boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the most aligned response to the question would be option D: there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life. This assertion underscores the significance of transcending mere appearances and engaging in critical reflection to discern the objective truths that underpin moral conduct and virtuous living. Ultimately, the distinction between appearance and reality serves as a catalyst for dialectical discovery and the cultivation of a deeper understanding of the principles that govern human behavior and societal flourishing.",
