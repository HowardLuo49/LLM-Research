    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. According to Socrates, just as there is a difference between what an ironic statement says and its true meaning, so also appearances differ from reality.  Even though societies or individuals appear to differ about what is required for the good life, that in no way contradicts the fact that:\nA: what is right or wrong, true or false varies from one culture to another.\nB: appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.\nC: the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth.\nD: there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "C: the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth. \n\nAs a computer scientist, we can apply this philosophical concept to our discipline by recognizing that the appearance of a program's functionality may differ from its true underlying structure and behavior. By understanding this distinction and delving into the reality of the code, we can more effectively identify and resolve bugs, optimize performance, and ultimately create more reliable and robust software systems. This aligns with Socrates' notion that delving beyond appearances and into reality is essential for uncovering truth and achieving a greater understanding.",
