According to Socrates, just as there is a difference between what an ironic statement says and its true meaning, so also appearances differ from reality.  Even though societies or individuals appear to differ about what is required for the good life, that in no way contradicts the fact that:\nA: what is right or wrong, true or false varies from one culture to another.\nB: appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.\nC: the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth.\nD: there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.",

They would likely appreciate the connection between Socratic philosophy and the scientific method, recognizing the importance of distinguishing between superficial appearances and underlying truths in both realms. They would also understand the value of dialectical reasoning in uncovering deeper truths and principles that transcend cultural differences. Ultimately, they would likely agree that the distinction between appearance and reality is crucial for the pursuit of objective truth and the establishment of universal principles for thought and action.",
