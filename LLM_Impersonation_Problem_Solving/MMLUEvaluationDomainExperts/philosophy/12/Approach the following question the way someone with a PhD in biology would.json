    "gpt_response": "As a researcher with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by examining it through the lens of ethics and moral philosophy, specifically in the context of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that advocates for the maximization of overall happiness or utility. John Stuart Mill, a prominent utilitarian philosopher, argued that the right action is the one that produces the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nIn his writings, Mill acknowledges that one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism is drawn from the idea of justice. Critics argue that utilitarianism can lead to unjust outcomes by sacrificing the interests or rights of a minority or individual for the greater good of the majority. This tension between maximizing utility and respecting justice is a key challenge for utilitarianism and has been a subject of debate among ethicists.\n\nIn considering the options provided, duty, virtue, and supererogation are all relevant concepts in ethical theory. Duty refers to moral obligations that individuals have towards others, while virtue pertains to moral character and the cultivation of good traits. Supererogation involves actions that go above and beyond what is morally required. While these concepts are important in ethical discussions, the objection to utilitarianism based on justice is particularly salient in highlighting the potential shortcomings of the theory.\n\nTherefore, from a biological perspective, understanding the ethical complexities of utilitarianism, including its tensions with justice, can inform discussions on the ethical implications of scientific research and decision-making in the field of biology.",
