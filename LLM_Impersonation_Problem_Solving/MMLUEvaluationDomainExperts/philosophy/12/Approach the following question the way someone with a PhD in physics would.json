    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, it is important to approach this question with a logical and analytical mindset. In this case, we must consider the objection to utilitarianism put forth by Mill in relation to duty, justice, virtue, and supererogation.\n\nMill argued that one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism comes from the concept of justice. Utilitarianism is based on the principle of maximizing overall happiness or utility, often at the expense of individual rights or justice. Critics argue that this approach can sometimes lead to injustices or violations of individual rights in the pursuit of the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nWhile duty, virtue, and supererogation are also important ethical concepts, Mill specifically highlighted justice as a key objection to utilitarianism. This objection highlights the tension between the utilitarian focus on maximizing overall happiness and the need to uphold principles of justice and fairness in ethical decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, as a physicist with a PhD, it is crucial to consider the objections to utilitarianism raised by Mill, particularly regarding the concept of justice. By understanding and evaluating these objections, we can gain a deeper insight into the ethical implications of utilitarianism and its limitations in addressing complex moral dilemmas.",
