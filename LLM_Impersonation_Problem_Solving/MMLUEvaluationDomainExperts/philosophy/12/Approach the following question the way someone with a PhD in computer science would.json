Mill argues that one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism is drawn from the concept of justice. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that focuses on maximizing overall happiness or utility. However, critics argue that utilitarianism may lead to injustices, as it prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number without taking into account the rights or interests of minority individuals. Justice, as a moral principle, emphasizes fairness, equality, and respecting the rights of individuals. Critics argue that utilitarianism may overlook the importance of justice in ethical decision-making, leading to potentially unjust outcomes. This objection highlights a fundamental tension between utilitarianism and principles of justice.",
