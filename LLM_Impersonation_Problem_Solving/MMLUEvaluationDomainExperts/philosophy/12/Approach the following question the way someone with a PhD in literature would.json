Utilitarianism advocates for the greatest good for the greatest number, often leading to situations where the needs or happiness of the minority are sacrificed for the greater good of the majority. This can conflict with traditional notions of justice, which emphasize fairness, equality, and individual rights. Critics argue that utilitarianism can be unjust in its consequences and fail to uphold principles of justice.\n\nWhile duty, virtue, and supererogation may also present challenges to utilitarianism, the concept of justice aligns closely with the ethical concerns that are at the heart of objections to this ethical theory. By evaluating the implications of justice in relation to utilitarianism, one can grasp the complexities and criticisms surrounding this influential ethical framework.",
