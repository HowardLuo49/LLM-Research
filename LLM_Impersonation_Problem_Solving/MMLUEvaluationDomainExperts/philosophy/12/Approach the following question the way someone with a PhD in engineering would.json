This principle often conflicts with other moral theories that focus on concepts like duty, justice, and virtue.\n\nIn this context, Mill's claim that one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism is drawn from the idea of justice is particularly relevant. Justice is a fundamental moral principle that emphasizes fairness, equality, and the protection of individual rights. Utilitarianism, with its focus on maximizing overall happiness, may sometimes justify actions that violate principles of justice, such as sacrificing the rights or well-being of a minority for the greater good of the majority.\n\nTherefore, the concept of justice presents a significant challenge to utilitarianism, highlighting the ethical complexities and potential conflicts that arise when trying to apply a purely consequentialist framework to moral decision-making. By recognizing and engaging with these objections, proponents of utilitarianism, including Mill, can further refine and strengthen their ethical theory.",
