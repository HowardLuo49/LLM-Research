    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by evaluating each option in terms of its logical consistency and relevance to the principles of utilitarianism. \n\nIn utilitarianism, the ethical theory founded by Jeremy Bentham and expanded upon by John Stuart Mill, the moral worth of an action is determined by its ability to maximize overall happiness or utility. This principle is often criticized for neglecting the importance of other moral considerations like duty, justice, virtue, and supererogation. \n\nConsidering Mill's assertion that one of the strongest objections to utilitarianism is drawn from the idea of duty, it is important to note that duty-based ethical theories, such as Kantian ethics, emphasize the importance of following moral rules and obligations regardless of the consequences. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, prioritizes the overall consequences of actions over adherence to moral rules, which may conflict with the notion of duty.\n\nSimilarly, justice is a fundamental concept in moral philosophy that concerns fairness, equality, and the just distribution of benefits and burdens. Utilitarianism's focus on maximizing overall utility may lead to situations where the ends justify the means, potentially disregarding principles of justice and fairness.\n\nVirtue ethics, another prominent ethical theory, emphasizes the development of virtuous character traits and values as the basis for ethical decision-making. Utilitarianism's emphasis on consequences rather than character may conflict with the principles of virtue ethics, leading to objections based on the idea of virtue.\n\nLastly, supererogation refers to actions that go above and beyond what is morally required, demonstrating exceptional moral excellence or generosity. Utilitarianism's focus on maximizing overall utility may not always account for the value of supererogatory actions, leading to objections related to the limitations of utilitarian moral reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, while utilitarianism offers a compelling framework for ethical decision-making based on maximizing overall happiness, it may face strong objections from alternative ethical theories that emphasize duty, justice, virtue, and supererogation. A thorough examination of these objections can deepen our understanding of the complexities of moral philosophy and inform discussions on the strengths and limitations of utilitarianism as an ethical theory.",
