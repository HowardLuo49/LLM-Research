This criterion emphasizes the importance of ethical theories aligning with our established beliefs and values in order to be considered morally adequate. In the realm of physics, we often strive for theories that are consistent with experimental observations and established scientific principles. Similarly, in ethics, it is crucial for moral theories to be consistent with the moral intuitions and judgments that we hold as a society. This ensures that ethical theories are relevant and applicable to real-world situations.",
