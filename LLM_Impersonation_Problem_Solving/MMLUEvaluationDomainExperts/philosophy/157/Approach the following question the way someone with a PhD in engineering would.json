Consequentialist moral theories, such as utilitarianism, focus on the outcomes or consequences of actions in order to determine their moral rightness. This approach emphasizes maximizing overall utility or value, making decisions based on what will result in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In the context of engineering, considering the consequences of actions and choices is critical in ensuring ethical practices and decision-making.",
