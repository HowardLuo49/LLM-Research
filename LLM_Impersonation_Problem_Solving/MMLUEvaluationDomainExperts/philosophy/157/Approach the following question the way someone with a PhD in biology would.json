This aligns with the principles of biological sciences, which often focus on cause-and-effect relationships and the impact of certain actions on individuals or ecosystems. In contrast, deontological theories emphasize adherence to moral principles or duties regardless of the outcomes, and virtue-oriented theories prioritize the character traits or virtues of individuals in determining ethical behavior. Egoistic theories, on the other hand, focus on self-interest as the primary motivator for ethical decision-making. Therefore, the correct answer in this context would be C: consequentialist.",
