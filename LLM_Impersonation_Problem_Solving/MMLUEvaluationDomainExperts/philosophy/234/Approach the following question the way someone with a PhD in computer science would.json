Why is it \"easier said than done\" to ensure that the principle of informed consent is adhered to?\nA: It is not practicable to present every participant with all the information about the study.\nB: Sometimes it is desirable to withhold certain pieces of information, such as the length of time an interview will take.\nC: If the participants knew exactly what the researcher was intending to study, they might change their behavior.\nD: All of the above.",

For example:\n- It is not feasible to provide participants with every detail about a study, as this may overwhelm them with too much information and complicate the consent process.\n- There may be situations where it is deemed necessary to withhold certain details, such as the duration of an interview, in order to avoid biasing the participant's responses.\n- If participants are fully aware of the research objectives, they may alter their behavior in order to align with what they believe the researchers are looking for, leading to biased results. \n\nThese factors make it difficult to completely adhere to the principle of informed consent in practice, despite the importance of upholding ethical standards in research.",
