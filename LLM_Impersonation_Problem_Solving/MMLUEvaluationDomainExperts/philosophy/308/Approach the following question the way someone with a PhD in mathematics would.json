From this perspective, an actually infinite number of things would be considered meaningless, as it cannot be feasibly constructed or comprehended within the confines of mathematical reasoning.\n\nOn the other hand, there are mathematicians who hold a different view, such as those who work in set theory. From this perspective, an actually infinite number of things is not only possible, but it is a fundamental concept in the study of infinite sets. In this context, the existence of an actually infinite number of things is considered to be a valid and meaningful concept in mathematics.\n\nIn conclusion, the response to Craig's statement that an actually infinite number of things is possible, meaningless, exists somewhere, or cannot exist would depend on the specific mathematical framework and philosophical viewpoint one holds.
