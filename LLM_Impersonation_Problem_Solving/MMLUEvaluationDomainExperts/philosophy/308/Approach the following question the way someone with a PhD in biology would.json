In mathematics and physics, the idea of an actual infinite number of things is often met with skepticism due to the limitations of our physical world and the laws of nature. While the concept of infinity is a useful mathematical tool and can be described theoretically, the idea of an actual infinite number of things existing in the physical world is considered by many to be impossible. Therefore, I would lean towards choosing option D: cannot exist.",
