This is due to various physical and mathematical limitations, such as the inability to have an actually infinite amount of matter or energy in a finite space. Craig would likely argue that while mathematical infinities can be useful as theoretical concepts, they do not actually exist in the physical world. Therefore, option D: cannot exist, would be the most likely response from someone with a PhD in engineering.",
