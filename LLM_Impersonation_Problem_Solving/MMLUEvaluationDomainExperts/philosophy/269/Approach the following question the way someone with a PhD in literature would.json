    "gpt_response": "In her critique of Butler, Anscombe specifically targets the notion of \"legislating for oneself\" as absurd. She argues that individuals cannot simply invent their own moral laws but must instead adhere to objective moral standards. This assertion challenges Butler's belief in the autonomy of the conscience and the individual's ability to determine right and wrong based on personal judgment. Anscombe suggests that a more reliable moral framework is needed, one that is grounded in external principles rather than subjective whims. This critique reflects Anscombe's broader philosophical stance on ethics, which emphasizes the importance of moral realism and the recognition of objective moral values.",
