In her seminal work \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe argues that Butler's description of doing one's duty as legislating for oneself collapses into a willful and arbitrary command. She contends that moral duties cannot be self-legislated in the sense suggested by Butler, as this would require an individual to be both the lawmaker and the law-abiding citizen simultaneously, creating a circular and ultimately incoherent ethical framework. Instead, Anscombe advocates for a more grounded ethical theory that takes into account the external goods and norms that shape our moral decision-making processes.",
