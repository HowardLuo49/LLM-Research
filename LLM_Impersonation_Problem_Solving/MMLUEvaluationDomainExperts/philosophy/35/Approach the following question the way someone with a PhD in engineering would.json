The systematic use of critical reasoning to investigate fundamental questions about reality, morality, and knowledge falls under the realm of philosophy. This discipline involves rigorous analysis, logical argumentation, and critical evaluation of assumptions to reach deeper insights and understanding of the world around us. In this sense, the philosophical method plays a crucial role in shaping our thinking and guiding us towards more informed and reasoned conclusions.",
