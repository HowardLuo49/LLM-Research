Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Philosophers use critical reasoning and argumentation to analyze these fundamental questions and seek answers through rigorous examination of concepts and principles. This approach is distinct from propositional logic and syllogistic reasoning, although these logical tools may be employed within the broader framework of philosophical inquiry.",
