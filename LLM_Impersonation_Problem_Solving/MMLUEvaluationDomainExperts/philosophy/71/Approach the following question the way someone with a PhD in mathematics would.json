In Aquinas' philosophical framework, the end of every action is understood as the ultimate goal or purpose towards which that action is directed. Aquinas believed that every action is ultimately directed towards some good, as he posited that all beings inherently seek their own perfection and fulfillment.\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, we can view this proposition as a fundamental axiom within Aquinas' ethical system. Just as a mathematical axiom is a self-evident truth that serves as a basis for further reasoning, Aquinas' assertion that the end of every action is some good can be seen as a foundational principle upon which his ethical theory is built.\n\nTherefore, I would approach this question by selecting option C: some good, as this aligns with Aquinas' philosophical reasoning and provides a coherent and logical explanation for the ultimate aim of human actions within his ethical framework.",
