This is deeply rooted in his belief that humans have a fundamental desire for goodness, which drives their actions and decisions. While desires, pleasures, and emotional states may play a role in motivating individuals, Aquinas argues that the ultimate goal or end of these actions is the attainment of some good. This aligns with his broader philosophical framework of natural law and moral theory, which emphasizes the pursuit of the highest good as the ultimate aim of human existence.",
