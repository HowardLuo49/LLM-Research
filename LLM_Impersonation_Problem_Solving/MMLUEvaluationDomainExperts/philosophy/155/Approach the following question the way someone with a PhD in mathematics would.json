Let's break down each option:\n\nA: goodness and pleasure are the same thing - This implies that pleasure is inherently good, and if they are the same thing, then saying pleasure is good would be redundant.\n\nB: good is something different than pleasure - This suggests that goodness and pleasure are distinct concepts, indicating that pleasure alone is not inherently good.\n\nC: all good things are pleasant - This implies that for something to be good, it must also be pleasant. This aligns with the idea that pleasure is a necessary condition for goodness.\n\nD: all pleasant things are good - This suggests that anything that is pleasant is also good. This statement does not necessarily mean that pleasure itself is good, only that things which are pleasant are good.\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, if we consider the statements made by Moore, option C seems to be the most relevant in this context. In order for pleasure to be considered good, it must also be pleasant. This aligns with Moore's argument that there is no meaning in saying that pleasure is good unless all good things are pleasant.",
