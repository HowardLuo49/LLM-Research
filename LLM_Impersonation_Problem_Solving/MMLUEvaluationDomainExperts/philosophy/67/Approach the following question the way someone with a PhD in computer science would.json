    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first defining what deception in research entails. Deception in research refers to intentionally misleading participants or stakeholders in order to obtain information or data. In the context of business research, deception can be harmful as it can compromise the reliability and validity of the findings, as well as ethical considerations.\n\nHaving laid the foundation, I would then analyze each of the options provided to determine which one constitutes deception in business research. Option A, the obtaining of company material without permission, does not necessarily involve deception unless the researcher misrepresents themselves or their intentions in order to access the material. Option B, the researcher wearing a disguise during an observation, is an example of deception as it involves misleading the participants or stakeholders about the researcher's true identity and intentions.\n\nOption C, the researcher representing their research as being about a different topic, is also an example of deception in business research. By misrepresenting the true purpose of the research, the researcher is intentionally misleading participants in order to obtain information. Option D, the researcher failing to ask permission to interview someone, may not necessarily involve deception depending on the circumstances. However, it is important to note that failing to ask permission can still be ethically problematic and impact the credibility of the research.\n\nIn conclusion, the examples of deception in business research presented in the options are B: The researcher wearing a disguise during an observation, and C: The researcher representing their research as being about a different topic. These actions involve intentional misleading of participants or stakeholders in order to obtain information, and should be avoided in ethical research practices.",
