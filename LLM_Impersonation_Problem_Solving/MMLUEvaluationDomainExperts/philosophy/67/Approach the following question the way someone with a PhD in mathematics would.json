Based on this definition, the example of deception in business research in the given options would be:\n\nC: The researcher representing their research as being about a different topic.\n\nThis is because by misrepresenting their research topic, the researcher is deliberately deceiving participants or organizations in order to gather information or access resources that they may not have otherwise been able to obtain. The other options may involve unethical behavior, but they do not necessarily involve deception as defined within the context of business research.",
