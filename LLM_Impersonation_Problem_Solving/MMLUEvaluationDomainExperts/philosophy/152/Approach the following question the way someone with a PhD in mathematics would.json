    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing each option from a logical and rigorous standpoint.\n\nOption A, deducing a conception of justice from self-evident premises, may seem appealing as a method of justification. However, in the realm of mathematics and logic, it is crucial to ensure that the premises being used are indeed self-evident and logically sound. Without a clear definition of what constitutes a self-evident premise in the context of justice, this approach may lead to subjective interpretations and potential logical fallacies.\n\nOption B, relying on direct acquaintance via moral intuition, may also be problematic from a mathematical perspective. Intuition, while valuable in some contexts, can be subjective and open to bias. In mathematics, relying solely on intuition without rigorous proof or evidence would not be considered a valid method of justification.\n\nOption C, advocating for the mutual support of many considerations to form a coherent view of justice, aligns more closely with the principles of mathematics. In mathematics, complex concepts and theorems are often justified through the convergence of multiple lines of evidence and reasoning. By considering a wide range of factors and integrating them into a cohesive framework, a more robust and reliable justification for a conception of justice can be achieved.\n\nTherefore, as a mathematician with a PhD, I would argue that option C, the mutual support of many considerations which fit into one coherent view, is the most appropriate and reliable method for justifying a conception of justice. A comprehensive and well-rounded approach that combines various perspectives and evidence is more likely to yield a robust and defensible conception of justice, akin to the rigorous standards of mathematical proof and reasoning.",
