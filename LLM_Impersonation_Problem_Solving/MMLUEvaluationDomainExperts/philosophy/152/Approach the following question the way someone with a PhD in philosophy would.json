    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would argue that Rawls' claim regarding the justification of a conception of justice aligns more closely with option C: the mutual support of many considerations, which it fits into one coherent view. Rawls is known for his theory of justice as fairness, which places emphasis on the idea of justice being derived from a veil of ignorance and the deliberation of reasonable individuals in an original position. This approach involves a comprehensive and systematic consideration of multiple factors, such as principles of liberty, equality, and distributive justice, in order to construct a coherent and justifiable conception of justice. Therefore, Rawls' view suggests that a conception of justice should be justified through the integration and alignment of various considerations, rather than being deduced from self-evident premises or moral intuition alone.",
