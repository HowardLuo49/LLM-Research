    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by examining Rawls' reasoning and arguments for his claim. Rawls, a renowned political philosopher, argues in his book \"A Theory of Justice\" that a conception of justice should be justified by the mutual support of many considerations, which it fits into one coherent view. This is in line with his approach of developing the principles of justice through a thought experiment known as the original position and the veil of ignorance.\n\nRawls rejects the idea of deducing justice from self-evident premises, as he believes that people's biases and preconceptions would inevitably influence the selection of these premises. He also rejects the notion of direct acquaintance via moral intuition, as he argues that such intuitions are subjective and may vary among individuals.\n\nTherefore, as a PhD in engineering, I would argue that Rawls' claim that a conception of justice should be justified by the mutual support of many considerations, which it fits into one coherent view, is the most comprehensive and reasoned approach to justifying a conception of justice.",
