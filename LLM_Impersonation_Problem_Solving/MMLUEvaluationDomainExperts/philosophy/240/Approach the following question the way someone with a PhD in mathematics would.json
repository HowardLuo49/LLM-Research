According to Socrates, it is important that we discover what makes a particular action (e.g., a merciful or just act) the kind of action that it is, because without such knowledge:\nA: no one in society will ever do any action that really is merciful or just, only those actions that they think are merciful or just.\nB: the primary purpose of human existence--which is to think and to know--is replaced by a focus on morality (acting and doing).\nC: we can refer only to how people characterize actions without knowing why such actions should be characterized that way.\nD: there would be no way to distinguish one kind of action (e.g., a merciful action) from another kind of action (e.g., a just action).",

Without this knowledge, actions may be confused or misunderstood, leading to potentially harmful consequences in both individual behavior and societal norms.",
