    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. According to Socrates, it is important that we discover what makes a particular action (e.g., a merciful or just act) the kind of action that it is, because without such knowledge:\nA: no one in society will ever do any action that really is merciful or just, only those actions that they think are merciful or just.\nB: the primary purpose of human existence--which is to think and to know--is replaced by a focus on morality (acting and doing).\nC: we can refer only to how people characterize actions without knowing why such actions should be characterized that way.\nD: there would be no way to distinguish one kind of action (e.g., a merciful action) from another kind of action (e.g., a just action).",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Approaching this question from a theoretical perspective grounded in a PhD in literature, it is essential to note the significance of understanding the philosophical underpinnings of Socrates' assertion. Socrates, as a pivotal figure in the history of Western thought, emphasized the importance of questioning and seeking knowledge in order to live a virtuous life.\n\nIn this context, Socrates' argument emphasizes the need for individuals to critically examine the nature of actions and understand the fundamental principles that determine their moral character. By delving into the essence of actions, individuals can cultivate a deeper understanding of virtues such as mercy and justice, thereby enabling them to act in accordance with these virtues.\n\nFurthermore, Socrates' emphasis on the importance of knowledge in determining the nature of actions is crucial in fostering moral development and ethical decision-making. Without a comprehensive understanding of why certain actions are considered merciful or just, individuals may simply rely on superficial or misguided beliefs, leading to actions that are not truly virtuous.\n\nTherefore, from a literary perspective informed by a background in philosophy and ethics, it is evident that Socrates' insistence on uncovering the essence of actions is essential for fostering moral awareness, ethical conduct, and the pursuit of a virtuous life. In this light, the answer to the question lies in option C: without knowledge of why actions should be characterized in a certain way, individuals can only rely on superficial perceptions rather than a deep understanding of moral principles.",
