This perspective prioritizes empirical observations and external factors in determining the meaning and significance of linguistic expressions or mental states, rather than relying on religious doctrines or beliefs. Externalists argue that meaning is determined by factors beyond the individual's own mental content or subjective intentions, and thus they often reject the idea that religious or supernatural elements play a role in shaping meaning. Instead, they emphasize the importance of external, objective criteria in understanding the semantics of language and the nature of meaning.",
