Externalism in philosophy of language holds that the meanings of words are determined in part by factors external to the speaker or hearer, such as the physical or social context in which they are used. In a pragmatic approach, meaning is understood in terms of the effects that words have on behavior and communication, rather than intrinsic properties of the words themselves. This perspective is often favored by those who emphasize the functional and practical aspects of language use.",
