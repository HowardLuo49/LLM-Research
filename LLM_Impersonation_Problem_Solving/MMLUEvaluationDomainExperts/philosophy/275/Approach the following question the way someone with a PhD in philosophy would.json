    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Cicero's perspective on expediency, one must first understand his broader ethical framework. Cicero, as a Stoic philosopher, believed in the pursuit of virtue as the highest good and the foundation of a well-lived life. Within this context, he asserted that it is imperative to cultivate virtues such as justice, generosity, and kindness in order to achieve eudaimonia, or flourishing.\n\nThus, one can infer that for Cicero, it is indeed expedient to be just, generous, and kind. These virtues are not only intrinsically valuable in themselves, but also instrumental in promoting individual well-being and fostering harmonious relationships within society. By embodying these virtues, one is able to uphold ethical principles, promote the common good, and cultivate a sense of moral integrity.\n\nTherefore, from a philosophical perspective informed by Cicero's teachings, the correct answer to the question would be D: all of the above. This aligns with the notion that the pursuit of virtue is not only a moral imperative, but also a practical means of achieving a life characterized by wisdom, fulfillment, and excellence.",
