    "gpt_response": "In philosophical discourse, the concept of expediency typically refers to actions or decisions that are deemed to be advantageous or beneficial in achieving a particular goal or outcome. Therefore, in interpreting Cicero's assertion that it is expedient to be just, generous, and kind, one can surmise that he is suggesting that these qualities are not only morally virtuous but also strategically advantageous in the pursuit of one's objectives. From a biological perspective, it can be argued that these virtues might enhance one's social reputation, foster cooperative relationships, and thereby confer potential fitness benefits in terms of increased social support, alliance formation, and overall reproductive success. In this context, individuals who exhibit traits such as justice, generosity, and kindness may be more likely to attract allies, secure resources, and ultimately enhance their inclusive fitness, in line with principles of kin selection and reciprocal altruism. Consequently, one can argue that from a biological standpoint, the cultivation of virtues such as justice, generosity, and kindness may indeed be seen as expedient in promoting individual fitness and overall reproductive success.",
