    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The concept of dualism posits that human beings consist of two distinct substances: the physical body and the non-material mind. This philosophical framework, known as substance dualism, asserts that these two entities interact with one another in complex ways. Materialism, on the other hand, argues that only physical matter exists and that mental states are reducible to physical states. Functionalism and identity theory are competing theories within the philosophy of mind that aim to explain the relationship between the mind and body in different ways.",
