    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is C: substance dualism. In philosophy of mind, substance dualism is the view that the mind and body are two distinct substances that interact with each other. This view is often attributed to the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who famously argued that the mind and body are separate entities that interact in the pineal gland of the brain. Substance dualism stands in contrast to materialism, which holds that only physical matter exists, and to functionalism and identity theory, which both posit different ways of understanding the relationship between mind and body.",
