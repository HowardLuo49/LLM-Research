    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "First, we must understand that Berkeley was a philosopher who denied the existence of material substances. He believed that reality was composed solely of ideas and perceptions. With this in mind, we can infer that Berkeley would likely argue that heat and cold are only sensations existing in our minds, making option D the most likely answer. He would likely argue that our experiences of heat and cold are not actually caused by physical objects in the external world, but are instead projected onto these objects by our minds. Therefore, the perception of heat and cold is subjective and not an inherent property of the external world.",
