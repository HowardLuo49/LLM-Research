George Berkeley, an influential philosopher in the 18th century, argues for a theory known as subjective idealism, which posits that only minds and their ideas exist. In this context, the statement that heat and cold are illusions would align with Berkeley's belief that physical objects, as we perceive them, are actually ideas in our minds rather than independently existing entities. Therefore, the most fitting answer to the question would be:\n\nD: only sensations existing in our minds.",
