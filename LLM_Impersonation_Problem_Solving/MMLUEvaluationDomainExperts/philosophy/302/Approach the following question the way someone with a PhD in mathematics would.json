    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first understanding the Kalam Cosmological Argument put forth by Craig. According to Craig, the Kalam Cosmological Argument states that everything that begins to exist has a cause, the universe began to exist, therefore the universe has a cause. This aligns with option B: the universe has a cause. This argument does not specifically establish the existence of the God of Christianity or argue against the Big Bang model. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be B: the universe has a cause.",
