    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in literature, it is important to understand Stevenson's perspective on ethical judgments from a literary and philosophical standpoint. Stevenson, a prominent ethical philosopher, posits that the primary use of ethical judgments is to influence the interests of others. This belief is rooted in Stevenson's emotivist theory, which suggests that ethical statements are expressions of an individual's attitudes and emotions rather than objective truths or facts.\n\nIn Stevenson's view, ethical judgments serve the purpose of persuading others to adopt a particular ethical stance by appealing to their emotions and values. By appealing to the interests and values of others, individuals can shape their behavior and decisions in line with their own ethical beliefs. This understanding of ethical judgments underscores the importance of rhetoric and persuasion in shaping moral discourse and influencing ethical behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question posed is B: influence the interests of others. Stevenson's theory highlights the significance of ethical judgments in not only expressing personal approval or disapproval but also in actively shaping the ethical landscape through interpersonal influence and persuasion.",
