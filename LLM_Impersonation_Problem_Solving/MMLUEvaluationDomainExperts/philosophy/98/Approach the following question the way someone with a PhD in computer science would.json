    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, it is important to recognize the role of ethical judgments in decision making processes, especially in regards to the design and implementation of computer systems and algorithms. \n\nIn this context, ethical judgments play a critical role in influencing the interests of others, as they guide the development of technologies that impact individuals and society at large. By considering ethical principles such as privacy, fairness, and accountability, computer scientists can design systems that align with societal values and promote positive outcomes for users.\n\nWhile ethical judgments may also involve describing one's own approval of certain actions or choices, their primary use in the field of computer science is to influence the interests of others by ensuring that technology is developed and deployed in an ethical and responsible manner.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to Stevenson's claim would be B: influence the interests of others.",
