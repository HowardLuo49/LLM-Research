    "gpt_response": "A PhD in biology would approach this question by examining human behavior and societal structures through the lens of evolutionary biology and psychology. Hobbes' idea of a state of nature where humans exist without a centralized authority is often compared to the concept of natural selection and the struggle for survival among individuals and groups.\n\nIn this context, humans are seen as inherently competitive and self-interested, driven by the need to secure resources and ensure their own survival. Without a common power, there is a lack of enforceable rules or social norms to regulate behavior, leading to conflict and competition for limited resources.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer according to a PhD in biology would be:\nD: war of every man against every man. This aligns with the idea that in the absence of a central authority, individuals would resort to aggressive and competitive behavior in order to secure their own survival.",
