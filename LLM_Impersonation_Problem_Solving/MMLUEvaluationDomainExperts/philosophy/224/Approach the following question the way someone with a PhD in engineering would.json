    "gpt_response": "As a PhD candidate in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing the philosophical concepts put forth by Thomas Hobbes in his work on political philosophy. Hobbes argued that in the absence of a common power, specifically a sovereign authority, humans would exist in a state of nature characterized by a \"war of every man against every man.\" This state of nature is marked by constant fear, insecurity, and competition as individuals pursue their self-interests without any overarching authority to moderate their actions. Therefore, based on Hobbes' theory, the correct answer to the question is D: war of every man against every man.",
