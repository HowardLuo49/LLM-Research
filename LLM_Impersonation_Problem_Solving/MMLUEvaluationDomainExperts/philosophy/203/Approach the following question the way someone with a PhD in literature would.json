Nussbaum claims that in cross-cultural communication, inhabitants of different conceptual schemes tend to view their interaction:\nA: in a relativist way.\nB: in an absolutist way.\nC: in a Kantian way.\nD: in an Aristotelian way.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Cross-cultural communication, according to Nussbaum, entails an understanding that individuals from varying conceptual schemes will interpret their interactions in a relativist manner. This suggests that there is no absolute or universal truth in communication between different cultures, but rather an acknowledgment and respect for the differing perspectives and values that shape each individual's understanding of the world. This viewpoint aligns with the postmodern notion that truth is relative and subjective, dependent on one's cultural background and beliefs. Therefore, in cross-cultural communication, it is essential to approach interactions with an open mind and a willingness to engage with and learn from diverse perspectives.",
