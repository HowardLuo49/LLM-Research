    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "A person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments could still be rational in the sense that they base their decisions on reasons and logic rather than emotions or moral principles. However, it could be argued that they are limiting their decision-making capabilities by ignoring moral considerations. Additionally, they may not be able to coherently invoke morality to protect their own interests if they do not believe in the validity of moral judgments. Therefore, it is possible that both options A and C could be true, depending on the context and beliefs of the individual in question. Option B, claiming that the person is immoral, may not be accurate as morality is subjective and based on individual beliefs and values. Finally, option D, stating that such a person couldn't possibly exist, is not necessarily true as there could be individuals who choose not to make moral judgments for various reasons.",
