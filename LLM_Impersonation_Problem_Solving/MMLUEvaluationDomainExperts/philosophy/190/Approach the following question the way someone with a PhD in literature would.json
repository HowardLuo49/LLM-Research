    "gpt_response": "Hare's assertion that a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments is irrational is based on his ethical theory of universal prescriptivism. In this theory, Hare argues that moral statements are not descriptive of the world but rather prescriptions of action that individuals are obligated to adhere to universally. Therefore, by refusing to make positive moral judgments, a person is failing to adhere to this basic moral responsibility, which Hare considers to be irrational.\n\nAdditionally, Hare posits that individuals who refuse to make positive moral judgments cannot coherently invoke morality to protect their own interests. This is because morality, according to Hare, is a system of rules that are meant to be followed universally and impartially, without regard to personal interests. By refusing to engage with positive moral judgments, individuals are undermining the very foundation of moral decision-making and cannot reasonably expect to rely on morality for their own benefit.\n\nFurthermore, Hare's position implies that a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments couldn't possibly exist in a coherent moral framework. This is because moral decision-making requires individuals to engage with and make judgments about ethical principles and values, which are essential components of a moral framework. By rejecting this fundamental aspect of moral reasoning, individuals would be unable to effectively navigate complex ethical dilemmas and participate in meaningful moral discourse. Therefore, according to Hare, a person who refuses to make positive moral judgments is not only irrational and unable to invoke morality for personal interests, but also fundamentally incompatible with the very concept of morality itself.",
