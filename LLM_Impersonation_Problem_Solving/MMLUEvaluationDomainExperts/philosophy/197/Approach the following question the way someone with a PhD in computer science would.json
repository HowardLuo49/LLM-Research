    "gpt_response": "To address Augustine's claim that to be happy, one must know the causes of natural occurrences and the causes of good and evil, it is important to consider the philosophical and ethical implications of this statement. \n\nIn Augustine's perspective, knowledge of natural occurrences may lead to a deeper understanding of the world and help individuals make informed decisions. Understanding the causes of good and evil, on the other hand, is crucial for moral reasoning and ethical decision-making. By knowing the consequences of our actions and the origins of both positive and negative outcomes, individuals are better equipped to navigate through life and pursue happiness.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that the correct answer is C: both a and b. Augustine's assertion implies that true happiness is contingent upon a comprehensive understanding of both the natural world and ethical principles.",
