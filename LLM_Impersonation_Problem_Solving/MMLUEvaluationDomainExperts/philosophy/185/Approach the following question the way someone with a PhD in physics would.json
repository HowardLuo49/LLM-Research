This fallacy occurs when a premise assumes the truth of the conclusion, rather than providing independent evidence for it. By simply reiterating the concept of good in different terms, philosophers engage in circular reasoning rather than offering a rigorous and logically sound definition. Moore's critique highlights the importance of avoiding such fallacies in the pursuit of a clear and coherent understanding of moral concepts.",
