The naturalistic fallacy refers to the mistaken belief that moral concepts can be equated with natural facts or properties. Moore posited that goodness is a non-natural property that cannot be reduced to any empirical or scientific observations. By conflating moral judgments with natural characteristics, previous philosophers have erroneously assumed that they could derive moral conclusions from factual premises, thereby committing the naturalistic fallacy. Moore's critique challenges the prevailing assumptions of ethical theory and underscores the need for a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the nature of goodness.",
