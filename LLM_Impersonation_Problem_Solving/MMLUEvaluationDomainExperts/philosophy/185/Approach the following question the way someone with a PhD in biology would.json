This fallacy occurs when one tries to define something in terms of its natural properties or characteristics, without considering that the concept itself may be irreducible to anything else. In the case of defining \"good\", Moore argues that it is a non-natural property that cannot be reduced to any other natural properties or facts. Therefore, attempting to define good in purely naturalistic terms is a fallacy according to Moore's argument.",
