This fallacy entails attempting to define \"good\" in terms of natural properties or attributes, such as pleasure or happiness. Moore argues that \"good\" is an irreducible, non-natural property and therefore cannot be equated with any empirical or observational facts. By falling into the naturalistic fallacy, philosophers are essentially attempting to derive an ethical conclusion from purely descriptive premises, which Moore, in his Principia Ethica, contends is logically invalid. Therefore, option C: the naturalistic fallacy, is the correct answer in this context.",
