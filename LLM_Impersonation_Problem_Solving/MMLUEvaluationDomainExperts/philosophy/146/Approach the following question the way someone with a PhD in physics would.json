    "gpt_response": "Hume's perspective on beauty is often framed within the context of his philosophical outlook, specifically his empiricist views on knowledge and perception. In his treatise \"Of the Standard of Taste,\" Hume argues that beauty is not an objective quality inherent in objects themselves, but rather a subjective experience that arises from the interaction between the observer and the object. This view aligns with Hume's broader belief that all knowledge and ideas are ultimately derived from sensory experience. Therefore, a correct interpretation of Hume's stance on beauty would be D: no quality in things themselves.",
