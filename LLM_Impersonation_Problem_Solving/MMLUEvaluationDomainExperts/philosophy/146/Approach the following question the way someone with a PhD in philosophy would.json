    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hume posits that beauty is not a quality inherent in things themselves, as would be suggested by option A. Rather, he argues that beauty is a subjective perception that is formed based on individual experiences and sentiments. Hume's philosophy centers around the idea that ideas such as beauty are not derived from a priori knowledge, as suggested in option B, but rather from sensory experiences and reflections on those experiences.\n\nFurthermore, Hume would reject the notion that beauty is judged by logical standards, as proposed in option C. Instead, he would contend that beauty is a subjective emotional response that is not bound by logical rules or standards.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate representation of Hume's view on beauty would align with option D, where beauty is seen as having no inherent quality in things themselves, but rather is a subjective perception shaped by personal experiences and sentiments.",
