While his beliefs about life's meaning may not have been explicitly stated in a technical or scientific context, it is important to consider the broader philosophical and ethical implications of his work and life.\n\nBased on my understanding of Darrow's views on social justice, individual rights, and the human condition, I would suggest that option C is the most likely interpretation of his belief about life's meaning. Throughout his career, Darrow advocated for fairness, equality, and the protection of civil liberties, often representing marginalized or oppressed groups in court. This suggests a belief in the ultimate rewards of fighting for justice and making a positive impact on society, despite the uncertainty and challenges that life may present.\n\nWhile it is not possible to definitively determine Darrow's personal beliefs about life's meaning without further research or analysis of his writings and speeches, I believe that option C is a reasonable and informed interpretation based on his public advocacy and legal career.",
