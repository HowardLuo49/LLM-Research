    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician, I would approach this question by noting that Clarence Darrow was a prominent figure in the legal and social justice world, known for his defense of controversial causes and his commitment to the principles of human rights and societal progress. Given his background and beliefs, it is likely that he viewed life's meaning as complex and multi-faceted, encompassing both the struggles and hardships that individuals face, as well as the potential for personal growth, social change, and the pursuit of justice. Therefore, his belief about life's meaning would likely align most closely with option C: Life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding.",
