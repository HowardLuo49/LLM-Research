    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I must approach this question with a critical and analytical mindset. Clarence Darrow, a renowned American lawyer and leading figure in the history of the American labor movement, was known for his strong advocacy of civil liberties and his stance against injustice.\n\nIn order to determine Darrow's belief about life's meaning, one must delve into his writings, speeches, and personal philosophies. It is important to note that Darrow was not a philosopher or theologian, but rather a legal mind with a penchant for social justice.\n\nBased on my understanding of Darrow's work and beliefs, it is reasonable to infer that he likely held the belief that life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding. Darrow's tireless work in defending the rights of the underprivileged and marginalized members of society, his commitment to justice, and his advocacy for civil liberties suggest a belief in the inherent value and potential of human life.\n\nWhile Darrow may have acknowledged the hardships and challenges that life presents, his dedication to fighting for a more just and equitable society implies a belief in the meaningfulness and importance of individual lives and the pursuit of justice. Therefore, I would argue that option C, \"Life was uncertain but ultimately rewarding,\" best captures Clarence Darrow's belief about life's meaning.",
