    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a logical and analytical perspective. Firstly, it is important to note that morality is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been studied by various disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, and ethics.\n\nWhile cultural influences can certainly play a role in shaping our moral beliefs and values, it is oversimplifying to dismiss morality as merely a cultural artifact. Morality is a fundamental aspect of human existence, guiding our decisions and actions in various aspects of our lives.\n\nFurthermore, to claim that morality is not relevant to our lives is misguided, as our moral beliefs and values often inform how we interact with others, make decisions, and navigate the complexities of society. Morality serves as a compass for ethical behavior and plays a crucial role in promoting the well-being of individuals and communities.\n\nLastly, while morality may not provide a definitive and universal guide to conduct in every situation, it serves as a framework for individuals to navigate ethical dilemmas and make principled decisions. It is important to recognize the nuances and complexities of morality, rather than dismissing its significance altogether.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, I would argue that none of the options presented accurately capture the full scope and complexity of morality.",
