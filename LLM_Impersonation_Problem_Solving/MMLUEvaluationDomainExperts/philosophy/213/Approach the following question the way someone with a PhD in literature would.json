    "gpt_response": "As a scholar in the field of literature, I would argue that Wolf's claim regarding morality being merely a cultural artifact reflects a postmodern perspective that deconstructs traditional values and norms. This perspective suggests that morality is not fixed or universal but rather a construct shaped by the society and culture in which it is produced.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that morality is not really relevant to our lives could be seen as a nihilistic viewpoint that questions the meaningfulness of moral principles in a world devoid of inherent values. However, it is important to note that many literary works explore the complexities of moral dilemmas and the impact of ethical choices on individuals and society.\n\nIn response to the option stating that morality provides a comprehensive guide to conduct, one might argue that while moral principles can offer guidance in navigating ethical challenges, they are not always clear-cut or universally applicable. Literature often grapples with the ambiguity and subjectivity of moral decision-making, depicting characters who struggle with conflicting values and obligations.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest that the correct answer to Wolf's claim about morality lies in the nuanced and multifaceted nature of ethical inquiry, which cannot be fully captured by any single statement or perspective. Ultimately, the study of literature can offer valuable insights into the complexities of moral thought and human behavior, challenging us to critically engage with questions of ethics and value.",
