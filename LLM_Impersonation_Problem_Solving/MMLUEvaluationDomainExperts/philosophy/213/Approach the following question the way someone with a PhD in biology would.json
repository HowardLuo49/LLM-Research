    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the evolutionary origins of morality in humans. Evolutionary biology suggests that certain moral behaviors, such as altruism and cooperation, have been selected for because they enhance the survival and reproductive success of individuals and groups. This suggests that morality has a strong biological basis and is not purely a cultural artifact. \n\nI would also consider the role of morality in society and how it influences human behavior and decision-making. While morality may not provide a comprehensive guide to conduct in all situations, it does play a significant role in shaping norms and values within a society. \n\nBased on this perspective, I would argue that option C, \"provides a comprehensive guide to conduct,\" is the most accurate statement regarding morality. While it may not be the sole determinant of behavior, morality does play a significant role in guiding human actions and interactions.",
