    "gpt_response": "In considering Wolf's claim about morality, it is important to engage in a nuanced analysis of her position. Wolf argues that morality is not merely a cultural artifact, as it holds intrinsic value and significance beyond the norms and practices of specific societies. Moreover, Wolf does not assert that morality is irrelevant to our lives, but rather that it plays a vital role in shaping our actions and decisions. However, Wolf also suggests that morality does not necessarily provide a comprehensive guide to conduct, as ethical dilemmas are often complex and context-dependent, requiring a nuanced and reflective approach to moral decision-making. Therefore, based on Wolf's nuanced perspectives on morality, the correct answer would be D: none of the above.",
