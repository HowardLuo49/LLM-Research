    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "B: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nStevenson, as a prominent figure in metaethics, would likely argue that his theory of emotivism does in fact offer an account for objective moral goodness and that it does not rely solely on subjective feelings or preferences. He may argue that his theory allows for a form of objective goodness that is grounded in the ways in which moral statements function in language and communication. This would demonstrate his response to the objection that his theory does not account for a priori knowledge of objective goodness.",
