How does Stevenson respond to the objection that his theory does not account for the kind of goodness that is objective and is known a priori?\nA: He claims to have proven that such a property does not exist.\nB: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\nC: He claims he does not understand such a property.\nD: None of the above.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "B: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nStevenson argues that his theory of emotivism, which states that moral judgments are expressions of subjective preferences, can still account for the kind of goodness that is objective and known a priori. He contends that moral judgments can be grounded in shared social practices and conventions, which can provide a basis for objective moral truths. Stevenson's response suggests that he believes his theory is capable of accommodating this kind of goodness, rather than denying its existence outright.",
