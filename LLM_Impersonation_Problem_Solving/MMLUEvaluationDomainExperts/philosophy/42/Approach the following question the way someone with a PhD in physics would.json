How does Stevenson respond to the objection that his theory does not account for the kind of goodness that is objective and is known a priori?\nA: He claims to have proven that such a property does not exist.\nB: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\nC: He claims he does not understand such a property.\nD: None of the above.",

    "gpt_response": "B: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nA physicist with a PhD would likely respond to this objection by explaining Stevenson's perspective on the nature of value and morality. Stevenson's theory of emotivism argues that moral judgments are expressions of our emotions rather than statements of objective facts, but he still maintains that there is a kind of goodness that is objective and known a priori. Stevenson's response to this objection would likely involve defending his theory by explaining how it can account for objective moral values and how they can be known a priori.",
