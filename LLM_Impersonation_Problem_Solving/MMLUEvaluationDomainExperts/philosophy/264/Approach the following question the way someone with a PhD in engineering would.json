Ross claims that we learn of our prima facie duties:\nA: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.\nB: by apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts.\nC: by proving them philosophically.\nD: from the explicit moral instruction we receive as children.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a logical and analytical perspective. The concept of prima facie duties, proposed by philosopher W.D. Ross, is based on the idea that certain moral principles are intuitively known and can guide our actions. To determine how we learn of these duties, we must consider the nature of moral knowledge acquisition.\n\nOption A suggests that we learn of our prima facie duties by first recognizing the rightness of specific actions and then deriving general principles from these observations. This aligns with Ross's belief that moral truths are self-evident and can be inferred from direct experiences.\n\nOption B proposes the opposite approach, stating that we first grasp general principles and then apply them to determine the rightness of particular acts. While this method may be applicable in some moral frameworks, it does not fully capture Ross's emphasis on immediate moral intuitions.\n\nOption C suggests that prima facie duties can be proven philosophically, which contradicts Ross's view that moral truths are not amenable to strict logical proof but rather to intuitive recognition.\n\nOption D implies that our knowledge of prima facie duties is solely derived from moral instruction received in childhood. While upbringing and education certainly play a role in shaping our moral understanding, Ross's theory emphasizes the innate quality of moral intuitions.\n\nTherefore, based on Ross's theory and the nature of moral knowledge acquisition, the most accurate answer would be option A: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.",
