    "gpt_response": "Ross's claim that we learn of our prima facie duties has profound implications for ethical theory and moral education. As someone with a PhD in literature, my approach to this question would involve delving into Ross's philosophical framework and examining the nuances of his argument.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to understand Ross's concept of prima facie duties. Prima facie duties are moral principles that guide our actions in specific circumstances, but are not absolute or unconditional. These duties are derived from our intuitive moral sense and interact with one another in complex ways.\n\nRoss argues that we learn of our prima facie duties not through explicit moral instruction or philosophical proofs, but through a process of moral perception and discernment. According to Ross, we come to recognize the prima facie rightness of particular acts through our immediate moral intuitions and experiences. These experiences serve as the foundation for our ethical discernment and the development of our moral consciousness.\n\nIn light of Ross's perspective, option A seems to align most closely with his framework. Ross suggests that we first perceive the prima facie rightness of particular acts in specific situations, and then abstract general principles from these experiences. This process of moral discernment and abstraction allows us to grasp the broader ethical principles that underlie our prima facie duties.\n\nIn conclusion, Ross's account of how we learn of our prima facie duties offers a rich and nuanced understanding of moral education and ethical development. By emphasizing the importance of moral perception and discernment, Ross challenges us to go beyond theoretical abstractions and engage more deeply with our moral intuitions and experiences.",
