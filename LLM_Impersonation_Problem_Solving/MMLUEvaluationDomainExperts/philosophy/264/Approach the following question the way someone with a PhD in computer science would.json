    "gpt_response": "A PhD in computer science would likely approach this question by breaking it down logically and critically analyzing each option.\n\nIn this case, Ross, a well-known philosopher, is known for his work on ethics and moral philosophy. He argues for the existence of prima facie duties, which are duties that are binding and must be fulfilled unless overridden by another duty.\n\nOption A suggests that we learn of our prima facie duties by first recognizing the rightness of specific actions and then deriving general principles from those actions. This aligns with Ross's ethical framework, as he argues that our moral intuition plays a significant role in determining our obligations.\n\nOption B proposes the opposite approach, suggesting that we derive the rightness of specific actions from general moral principles. While this may be a valid way of approaching ethics, it may not align with Ross's particular views.\n\nOption C, which suggests that we prove prima facie duties philosophically, may not align with Ross's perspective, as he emphasizes the importance of moral intuition in determining moral obligations.\n\nOption D, which suggests that we learn our prima facie duties from explicit moral instruction received in childhood, may also not align with Ross's view, as he emphasizes the role of moral intuition rather than external instruction in determining moral obligations.\n\nOverall, a PhD in computer science would likely critically analyze each option in light of Ross's work on ethics and moral philosophy to arrive at a logical conclusion. In this case, option A may be the most suitable answer based on Ross's emphasis on the importance of moral intuition in determining prima facie duties.",
