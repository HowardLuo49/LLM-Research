Ross claims that we learn of our prima facie duties:\nA: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.\nB: by apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts.\nC: by proving them philosophically.\nD: from the explicit moral instruction we receive as children.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering Ross's concept of prima facie duties within the context of ethical theory. Prima facie duties refer to moral obligations that are deemed to be binding unless overridden by stronger moral considerations.\n\nIn his work, W.D. Ross argues that we come to know our prima facie duties through a process of moral perception. This process involves recognizing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, such as telling the truth or keeping promises, and then extrapolating general principles from these concrete examples. This approach suggests that our ethical intuitions play a central role in guiding our moral decision-making.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate response to Ross's claim would be option A: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles. This aligns with Ross's view that our moral knowledge is grounded in concrete experiences and reflections on specific moral situations, rather than being derived solely from abstract philosophical reasoning or external sources of moral instruction.",
