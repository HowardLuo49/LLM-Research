Ross claims that we learn of our prima facie duties:\nA: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.\nB: by apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts.\nC: by proving them philosophically.\nD: from the explicit moral instruction we receive as children.",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would approach this question from the perspective of moral philosophy. In this context, W.D. Ross, a prominent ethical theorist, posits that we learn of our prima facie duties by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles. This aligns with Ross's deontological approach to ethics, where moral obligations are derived from principles that guide our actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles. This is consistent with Ross's ethical framework and highlights the importance of intuition and reflection in determining our moral duties.",
