    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by analyzing the logical relationships between the different options presented. \n\nRoss' theory of prima facie duties suggests that certain duties are self-evident and do not require further justification. Therefore, the process of learning about these duties would likely involve a combination of recognizing the prima facie rightness of particular acts and understanding general principles that guide moral behavior. \n\nOption A, which suggests that we learn of our prima facie duties by first recognizing the rightness of particular acts and then apprehending general principles, aligns well with Ross' theory. This approach implies a bottom-up process where individual moral intuitions inform our understanding of broader ethical principles.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, suggests a top-down approach where general principles are first apprehended and then used to infer the rightness of particular acts. While this approach may also play a role in moral reasoning, it may not capture the intuitive and self-evident nature of prima facie duties as described by Ross.\n\nOption C, which suggests proving prima facie duties philosophically, does not seem to align with Ross' emphasis on the intuitive and non-theoretical nature of these duties.\n\nOption D, which suggests that we learn of prima facie duties from explicit moral instruction as children, could play a role in shaping our moral intuitions and values, but it may not fully capture the self-evident and non-derivative nature of Ross' concept of prima facie duties.\n\nIn conclusion, as a mathematician, I would go with option A as the most plausible explanation for how we learn about our prima facie duties, based on the principles outlined in Ross' theory.",
