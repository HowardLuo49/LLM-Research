Hume's philosophy famously emphasized the role of passion over reason in guiding human behavior. While reason does play a role in his philosophical system, he does not view it as the source of moral actions. Instead, Hume believed that reason is \"the slave of the passions,\" serving to justify and support our desires rather than dictating them.\n\nHume describes reason as \"cool and disengaged\" in the sense that it is distinct from and subservient to our emotional and passionate impulses. This characterization contrasts with the traditional view of reason as a higher faculty capable of determining ethical principles and guiding moral actions.\n\nAdditionally, Hume argues that reason is not the first spring or impulse to desire, as it is incapable of motivating action on its own.
