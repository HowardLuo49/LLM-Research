    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by interpreting it in the context of philosophy. In this case, Nagel's assertion about the connection between moral luck and another philosophical problem requires a deeper understanding of both concepts.\n\nThe problem of moral luck, as articulated by Nagel, deals with the moral assessment of actions and outcomes that are influenced by factors beyond an individual's control. This raises questions about the fairness and accountability of moral judgments in light of external circumstances.\n\nIn considering which option is closely connected to the problem of moral luck, it is important to analyze each choice in relation to moral agency and responsibility. Of the options provided, freedom of the will stands out as the most relevant to the issue of moral luck.\n\nFreedom of the will pertains to the capacity of individuals to make choices and act according to their own volition. In the context of moral luck, the extent to which individuals can be held responsible for their actions in light of external influences is contingent upon their freedom to make autonomous decisions. This intersects with the problem of moral luck in questioning how much control individuals truly have over their moral outcomes when factors beyond their control come into play.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that the answer to the question is B: freedom of the will, as it is most closely connected to the problem of moral luck in terms of agency, accountability, and the implications of external influences on moral judgments.",
