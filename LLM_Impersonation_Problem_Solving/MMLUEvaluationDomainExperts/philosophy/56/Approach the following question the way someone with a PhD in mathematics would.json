    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by analyzing the logical connections between the concepts of moral luck and the options provided. \n\nNagel's argument on the problem of moral luck revolves around the idea that moral judgments should not be influenced by factors beyond an individual's control, such as luck. This raises questions about the nature of responsibility and agency in moral decision-making.\n\nOne possible connection between the problem of moral luck and the options provided is the concept of freedom of the will. The debate over moral luck implicates discussions on the extent to which individuals have control over their actions and moral choices. A discussion of freedom of the will can shed light on how individuals are morally responsible for their actions in the face of external factors like luck.\n\nTherefore, from a mathematician's perspective, the most closely connected concept to the problem of moral luck among the options given is B: freedom of the will. This is because freedom of the will addresses the issue of agency and control in moral decision-making, which is fundamental to understanding the implications of moral luck.",
