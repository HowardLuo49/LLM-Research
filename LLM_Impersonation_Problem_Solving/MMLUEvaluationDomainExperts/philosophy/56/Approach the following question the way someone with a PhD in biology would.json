    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by drawing on my understanding of the interactions between biology and philosophy. In this context, Nagel's argument regarding the problem of moral luck can be seen as closely connected to the problem of freedom of the will. This is because the concept of moral luck suggests that an individual's moral responsibility can be influenced by factors beyond their control, such as external circumstances or genetic predispositions.\n\nIn the realm of biology, we understand that human behavior is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and cognitive factors. This includes factors that may limit an individual's ability to make truly autonomous and morally significant choices. This notion of limited freedom of the will aligns closely with Nagel's argument about moral luck, as both address the challenges posed by external influences on an individual's moral agency.\n\nTherefore, based on my background in biology and understanding of philosophical concepts, I would argue that the problem of moral luck is most closely connected to the problem of freedom of the will.",
