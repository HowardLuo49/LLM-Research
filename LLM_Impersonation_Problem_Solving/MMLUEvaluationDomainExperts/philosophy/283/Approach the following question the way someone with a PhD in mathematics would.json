    "gpt_response": "In order to properly approach this question from a mathematical perspective, we must first understand the underlying philosophical principles at play. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, believed in living in accordance with nature and accepting the inevitability of death as a part of the natural order. \n\nFrom a mathematical standpoint, we can consider the desire for one's loved ones to live forever as a form of attachment or clinging to a specific outcome, which goes against the Stoic principle of accepting the natural course of events. This can be seen as a deviation from rationality and a failure to recognize the limits of human control.\n\nTherefore, in the context of Epictetus' philosophy, the desire for one's loved ones to live forever would be considered silly, as it implies a rejection of the natural order and a refusal to acknowledge the reality of mortality. This perspective aligns with the Stoic emphasis on maintaining inner tranquility and acceptance of external events beyond one's control.",
