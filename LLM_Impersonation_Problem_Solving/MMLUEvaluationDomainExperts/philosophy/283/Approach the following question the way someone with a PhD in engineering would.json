    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first acknowledging that Epictetus was a Stoic philosopher who believed in accepting the natural order of the universe and advocating for the development of rationality and self-control in order to achieve inner peace. In this context, the desire for one's loved ones to live forever could be viewed through the lens of Stoic philosophy.\n\nFrom a Stoic perspective, the desire for one's loved ones to live forever could be seen as a natural instinct, as humans naturally form emotional attachments to others and seek to protect and preserve those relationships. However, Stoics also believe in accepting the impermanence of life and the inevitability of death, viewing attempts to defy this natural order as futile and potentially leading to suffering.\n\nTherefore, while the desire for one's loved ones to live forever may indeed stem from genuine love and a natural instinct, it could also be considered by some Stoics as misguided or even blasphemous, as it goes against the acceptance of the natural cycle of life and death. In this sense, Epictetus might consider such desires as ultimately silly, in that they represent a misunderstanding or rejection of the fundamental principles of Stoic philosophy.",
