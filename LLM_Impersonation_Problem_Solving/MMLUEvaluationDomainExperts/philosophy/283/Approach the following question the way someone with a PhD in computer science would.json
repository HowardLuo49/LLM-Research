    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to clarify Epictetus' perspective on desires and emotions. In Stoic philosophy, desires are seen as the root of suffering and therefore are to be controlled and ultimately eradicated. Emotions, including love for one's loved ones, are seen as judgments that should be moderated through reason and understanding of the nature of reality.\n\nGiven this framework, we can evaluate Epictetus' claim about the desire for loved ones to live forever. From a Stoic perspective, desiring immortality for loved ones goes against the natural order of things, as all things in the world are impermanent and subject to change. This desire can be seen as a reflection of our attachment to the temporal world and a refusal to accept the transient nature of life.\n\nTherefore, Epictetus would likely view the desire for one's loved ones to live forever as a form of attachment and an irrational response to the reality of life and death. In this sense, he would likely consider it to be not a sign of genuine love, but rather a misguided and ultimately unattainable desire that leads to unnecessary suffering and moral confusion.\n\nBased on this interpretation, the correct answer would likely be C: blasphemous in the context of Stoic philosophy.",
