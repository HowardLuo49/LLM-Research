In the realm of ethics, a rationalist approach to virtues emphasizes the importance of moral reasoning and the cultivation of intellectual virtues such as wisdom, prudence, and judgment.\n\nEmpiricism, on the other hand, posits that knowledge is derived primarily from sensory experience and empirical evidence.

While the concept of virtues may still be relevant within a relativist ethical framework, the focus is more on understanding and respecting diverse moral perspectives rather than on articulating universal principles.\n\nAbsolutism, in contrast, holds that there are objective and universal moral truths that are applicable regardless of situational factors or individual perspectives. Within an absolutist ethical approach, virtues may be seen as inherent qualities that guide moral behavior and decision-making in accordance with these transcendent principles.\n\nIn light of Nussbaum's assertion, it can be argued that the turn toward an ethical approach based on virtues aligns more closely with a rationalist perspective, which emphasizes the role of reason, intellect, and moral reflection in cultivating virtuous character and guiding ethical action.",
