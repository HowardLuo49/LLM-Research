Nussbaum claims that to many current ethical theorists, turning to an ethical approach based on the virtues is connected with a turn toward:\nA: rationalism.\nB: empiricism.\nC: relativism.\nD: absolutism.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Nussbaum\u2019s assertion regarding the ethical approach based on virtues suggests a nuanced understanding of philosophical traditions and contemporary perspectives within ethics. The turn towards focusing on virtues rejects superficial rationalistic frameworks that prioritize abstract reasoning disconnected from real-life experiences. Instead, the virtuous approach emphasizes the cultivation of moral character through lived experiences and practical guidance. This shift is not necessarily a rejection of reason altogether, as virtues such as wisdom and prudence still require rational reflection. \n\nMoreover, the emphasis on virtues does not necessarily lead to relativism, as virtues such as justice and benevolence can provide universal principles for ethical behavior. In contrast, absolutism, with its rigid adherence to moral rules and principles, may be seen as antithetical to the flexible and context-sensitive nature of virtue ethics. Instead, virtue ethics encourages a nuanced, situation-specific approach to moral decision-making that values the complexity and diversity of human experiences. \n\nIn conclusion, Nussbaum's claim aligns with a broader trend within contemporary ethics that seeks to reintegrate ethical theory with practical wisdom and human flourishing, moving away from abstract rationalism or rigid absolutism towards a more nuanced and context-sensitive understanding of moral virtue.",
