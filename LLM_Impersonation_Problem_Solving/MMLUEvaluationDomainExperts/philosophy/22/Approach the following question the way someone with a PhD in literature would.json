    "gpt_response": "Nussbaum's assertion that the shift towards a virtues-based ethical approach is connected with a turn towards rationalism or empiricism is indeed a complex and nuanced one. In her work, she delves into the intricacies of ethical theory and argues that a focus on virtue ethics aligns more closely with the rationalist tradition, which emphasizes the role of reason and intellect in moral decision-making.\n\nBy contrast, an empiricist approach tends to prioritize experience and observation in forming ethical judgments, which may not align as neatly with a virtues-based framework. Furthermore, Nussbaum's argument suggests that a virtues-based approach does not necessarily lead to relativism or absolutism, but rather emphasizes the cultivation of moral character and the importance of practical wisdom in navigating ethical dilemmas.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the most fitting answer to the question posed would be:\n\nA: rationalism.",
