    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by considering the connections between ethics, virtues, and different philosophical approaches. Nussbaum's assertion suggests that ethical theorists who advocate for a virtues-based approach may be aligned with a particular philosophical orientation.\n\nIn this context, the concept of virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of virtuous traits or qualities in guiding ethical decision-making. Such an approach may place value on qualities such as honesty, compassion, courage, and wisdom, which are seen as essential for leading a morally good life.\n\nRationalism and empiricism are two contrasting philosophical approaches that have been historically discussed in the context of ethics. Rationalism emphasizes the role of reason and logic in understanding the world and making ethical judgments, while empiricism favors the gathering of evidence and experience to inform ethical decisions.\n\nRelativism and absolutism are two other philosophical positions that are often discussed in the context of ethics. Relativism suggests that ethical truths and values are subjective and may vary depending on cultural, social, or individual perspectives. Absolutism, on the other hand, asserts that there are objective, universal ethical principles that govern moral behavior.\n\nBased on Nussbaum's claim, it is possible that turning to a virtues-based ethical approach may be connected with a rejection of relativism, which could potentially lead to an embrace of either rationalism or absolutism. The emphasis on specific virtuous qualities in virtue ethics may align more closely with absolute principles than with relativistic values.\n\nTherefore, if I were to approach this question as a PhD in biology, I would argue that turning to an ethical approach based on the virtues is more likely connected with a turn toward absolutism (option D) rather than rationalism, empiricism, or relativism.",
