Wolf claims that ultimately, normative questions must be assessed from:\nA: the moral point of view.\nB: the point of view of virtue.\nC: the point of view of individual perfection.\nD: a perspective that is unattached to a commitment to any well-ordered system of values.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would argue that Wolf's assertion aligns with the philosophical framework of ethical engineering. When evaluating normative questions, engineers must consider the moral implications of their actions and decisions. This aligns with option A, which emphasizes assessing normative questions from the moral point of view.\n\nEngineering ethics requires engineers to consider the potential impact of their work on society, the environment, and individuals. By approaching normative questions from a moral perspective, engineers can ensure that their decisions are in alignment with ethical principles and values. This can help prevent harm, promote justice, and uphold the public trust in the engineering profession.\n\nWhile the other options may also have value in certain contexts, the moral point of view is particularly relevant in the field of engineering. By grounding normative assessments in moral principles, engineers can make responsible and ethical choices that benefit society as a whole.",
