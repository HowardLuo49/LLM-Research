With this in mind, I would argue that the correct answer is A: the way one deals with one's impressions.\n\nIn Stoic philosophy, the concept of controlling one's own reactions and responses to external stimuli is central to achieving inner peace and fulfillment. Epictetus believed that individuals have the power to control their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, regardless of external circumstances. By mastering one's own reactions and responses, one can cultivate a sense of autonomy and control over one's own life.\n\nIn contrast, options B, C, and D (one's family, friends, and body) are all external possessions or relationships that can be influenced or taken away by outside forces. While these elements may play a role in one's life, according to Stoic philosophy, true ownership and control lie in one's ability to manage one's own mental and emotional responses.",
