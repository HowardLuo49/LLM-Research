    "gpt_response": "According to Kant's moral philosophy, nothing can be called \"good\" without qualification except for a good will. Kant argues that other goods, such as right action, good consequences, or happiness, are not intrinsically valuable in themselves. Only a good will, defined as a will that acts out of duty and respect for moral principles, is considered to be unconditionally good. This is because a good will is the only thing that is within our control and is not contingent on external factors or outcomes. Therefore, according to Kant, a good will is the only thing that can be described as genuinely good without any qualification.",
