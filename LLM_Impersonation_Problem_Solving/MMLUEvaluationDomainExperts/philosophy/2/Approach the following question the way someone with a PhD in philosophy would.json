Kant asserts that actions may be evaluated based on their intentions rather than solely on their outcomes, emphasizing the inherent value of a virtuous and morally upright will. This notion is foundational to Kant's deontological ethics, which prioritizes the intrinsic goodness of the will itself over external factors such as happiness or consequences. Thus, in Kant's framework, a good will stands as the pinnacle of moral worth and the sole entity that can be deemed truly good without any reservations.",
