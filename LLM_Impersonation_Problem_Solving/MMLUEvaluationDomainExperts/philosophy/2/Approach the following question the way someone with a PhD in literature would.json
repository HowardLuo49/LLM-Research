    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a deep understanding of literature, it is important to consider Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy in order to provide a comprehensive answer to this question. According to Kant, the only thing that can be called \"good\" without qualification is a good will. Kant argues that a good will is intrinsically good, irrespective of the consequences of one's actions or whether those actions conform to moral duty. In his seminal work, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant emphasizes the importance of acting out of a sense of duty and moral obligation rather than seeking happiness or achieving good consequences. Therefore, the correct answer to this question would be D: a good will, as Kant believed that the moral worth of an action is derived from the intention behind it.",
