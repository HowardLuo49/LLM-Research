    "gpt_response": "In response to Feinberg's claim, it must be pointed out that arguments for psychological egoism are indeed typically nonempirical in character. This is because psychological egoism is a theory that asserts that all human actions are ultimately motivated by self-interest. This theory is based on the assumption of human nature and the inherent desires and motivations of individuals, rather than on empirical evidence derived from controlled studies or neuroscience. Therefore, Feinberg's assertion that most arguments for psychological egoism are nonempirical in character is accurate and reflective of the philosophical nature of this theory.",
