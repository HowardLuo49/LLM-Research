    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by analyzing the different types of arguments typically made in support of psychological egoism. Feinberg's claim suggests that most arguments for psychological egoism are nonempirical in character, meaning they are not based on empirical evidence or controlled studies.\n\nIn the field of computer science, we often rely on empirical evidence and data-driven approaches to support our theories and hypotheses. Therefore, it would be important to critically evaluate the extent to which the arguments for psychological egoism are indeed nonempirical in nature. This could involve examining the methodologies used in previous studies and assessing the validity of their conclusions.\n\nAdditionally, as a researcher with expertise in data analysis and statistics, I would also consider the potential biases and limitations inherent in arguments that rely on interviews and surveys. It is important to ensure that the data collected is reliable and representative of the population being studied in order to make valid inferences about human behavior and motivations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the claim made by Feinberg may have some truth to it, as a computer scientist I would approach this question by critically evaluating the empirical basis of arguments for psychological egoism and examining the methodologies used to support these claims. By taking a data-driven approach, we can enhance our understanding of psychological egoism and contribute to the ongoing debate in the field.",
