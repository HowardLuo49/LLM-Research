This implies that they rely on logical and conceptual analysis rather than empirical evidence derived from scientific studies or observations in the field of neuroscience. The philosophical foundation of psychological egoism lies in its assertion that individuals are ultimately motivated by self-interest, a contention that can be scrutinized and debated through rational discourse rather than experimental validation. Thus, Feinberg suggests that the central contentions of psychological egoism are not dependent on empirical data but instead rest on a conceptual framework that delineates the nature of human motivation and behavior.",
