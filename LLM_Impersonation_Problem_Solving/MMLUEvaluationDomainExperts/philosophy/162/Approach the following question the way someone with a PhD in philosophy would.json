Rawls claims that students with fewer native assets (such as intelligence) should be given:\nA: more attention and resources than those with more native assets.\nB: the same level of attention and resources as those with more native assets.\nC: less attention and fewer resources than those with more native assets.\nD: virtually no educational resources.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Rawls' philosophical argument revolves around the concept of \"justice as fairness,\" which posits that in a just society, individuals should have equal access to resources and opportunities regardless of their natural talents or abilities. From this perspective, it can be inferred that Rawls would advocate for Option A: giving students with fewer native assets more attention and resources than those with more native assets.\n\nThis position is based on the principle of distributive justice, where the distribution of resources is guided by the need to address inequalities and ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity to develop their capabilities and lead a fulfilling life. In this context, providing additional support to those with fewer native assets can help level the playing field and enable them to achieve their full potential. Therefore, Rawls would likely argue that educational institutions have a moral obligation to prioritize the needs of students who may be disadvantaged due to factors beyond their control.",
