Rawls claims that students with fewer native assets (such as intelligence) should be given:\nA: more attention and resources than those with more native assets.\nB: the same level of attention and resources as those with more native assets.\nC: less attention and fewer resources than those with more native assets.\nD: virtually no educational resources.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first acknowledging that the concept of distributive justice, as proposed by Rawls, is a complex and nuanced issue that has implications for educational policy and practice. Rawls argues for a principle of justice that prioritizes the well-being of the least advantaged members of society.\n\nIn the context of education, this principle would suggest that students with fewer native assets, such as intelligence, should be given more attention and resources in order to level the playing field and ensure that they have equal opportunities for success. This approach is aligned with the concept of equity in education, which recognizes that individuals have different starting points and therefore require different levels of support to achieve the same outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question would be A: more attention and resources should be given to students with fewer native assets in order to promote fairness and equal opportunities in education. This approach reflects a commitment to social justice and the idea that all individuals should have access to the resources they need to reach their full potential.",
