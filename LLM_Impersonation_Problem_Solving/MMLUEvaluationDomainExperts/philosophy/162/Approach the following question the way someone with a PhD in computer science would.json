Rawls claims that students with fewer native assets (such as intelligence) should be given:\nA: more attention and resources than those with more native assets.\nB: the same level of attention and resources as those with more native assets.\nC: less attention and fewer resources than those with more native assets.\nD: virtually no educational resources.",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by considering the principles of fairness and equality in education. Rawls' concept of justice as fairness suggests that individuals with fewer native assets should be given more attention and resources in order to level the playing field and provide equal opportunities for all students to succeed. This idea aligns with the principles of equity and inclusivity in education, where each individual's unique needs and circumstances are taken into account to ensure they have access to the support and resources necessary for their academic development. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: more attention and resources than those with more native assets.",
