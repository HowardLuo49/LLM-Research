    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by examining Peter Singer's principle as outlined in his work on ethics and animal rights. Singer argues for the principle of equal consideration of interests, which posits that all beings with interests deserve equal moral consideration, regardless of their species. This principle challenges traditional notions of human superiority and advocates for a more inclusive ethic that extends beyond the human species.\n\nGiven Singer's emphasis on the equality of interests, it is likely that compliance with his principle would require more than just modest changes to personal habits. In order to truly honor the equal consideration of interests, individuals would need to drastically reassess and transform their personal habits, particularly in relation to their consumption of animal products and treatment of non-human beings.\n\nFurthermore, Singer's principle also implicates societal structures and practices that perpetuate the exploitation and suffering of animals. In order to fully align with his ethical framework, it stands to reason that broader societal changes would also be necessary. This would likely involve challenging and reshaping existing institutions, policies, and cultural norms that sanction and support practices that violate the principle of equal consideration of interests.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that compliance with Singer's principle would necessitate drastic changes to both our personal habits and to society as a whole, making option D the most fitting choice in this context.",
