    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, we can approach this question from a systems perspective. Singer's principle of ethical responsibility towards global poverty can be viewed as a complex system that involves both personal actions and societal structures. In order to effectively address global poverty, it is necessary to consider both individual behaviors and systemic changes. Therefore, compliance with Singer's principle would likely require both modest changes to our personal habits and more substantial changes to society as a whole. Option B, which suggests modest changes to personal habits as well as society, aligns with this systems thinking approach.",
