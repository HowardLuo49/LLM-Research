According to Singer, compliance with his principle requires:\nA: modest changes to our personal habits, but not to our society as a whole.\nB: modest changes to our personal habits, as well as to society.\nC: drastic changes to our personal habits, but not to our society.\nD: drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, it is important to first understand Singer's principle. Singer is a prominent philosopher and ethicist who argues for the moral obligation to alleviate suffering in the world, particularly in terms of poverty and global inequality. Singer's principle, known as the \"effective altruism\" approach, suggests that individuals should use their resources to help others in the most effective way possible.\n\nGiven Singer's emphasis on the importance of alleviating suffering and promoting well-being, it is likely that compliance with his principle would require more than just modest changes to our personal habits. In order to effectively address global issues such as poverty and inequality, it is necessary to consider systemic changes and societal structures that perpetuate these problems.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question would be D: drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society. Singer's principle calls for individuals to critically evaluate how their actions and choices impact others, and to actively work towards creating a more just and equitable society.",
