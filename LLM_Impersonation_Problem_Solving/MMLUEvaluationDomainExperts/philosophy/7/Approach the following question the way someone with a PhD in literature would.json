    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by drawing upon the works and theories of Peter Singer, particularly in relation to his principle of effective altruism and ethical responsibilities towards alleviating global poverty. Singer argues that individuals have a moral obligation to prevent bad occurrences without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance, thereby endorsing a position that calls for significant changes in behavior and societal structures.\n\nBased on Singer's philosophy, the most appropriate answer to the question would be option D: drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society. Singer suggests that individuals have a duty to donate significant portions of their income to aid organizations and to consider the consequences of their actions on a global scale. This necessitates a shift in personal behaviors towards greater altruism and a reevaluation of societal norms and structures that perpetuate poverty and inequality.\n\nTherefore, Singer's principle of effective altruism implies that compliance with it involves not only modest changes to personal habits but also significant adjustments at the societal level in order to address the root causes of global injustices.",
