    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering Singer's principle in the context of ethical treatment of animals. Singer is known for his advocacy of animal rights and the principle of equal consideration of interests. Based on this, compliance with Singer's principle would likely require drastic changes to both our personal habits and to society as a whole.\n\nSinger argues that animals should be considered as beings with their own interests and deserve moral consideration. This would mean changing personal habits such as adopting a plant-based diet, avoiding products tested on animals, and supporting cruelty-free practices. Additionally, societal changes may include implementing stricter regulations on animal agriculture, research, and other industries that exploit animals.\n\nThus, the most likely answer based on Singer's principles and the ethical implications of animal rights would be D: drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.",
