    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "For Socrates, the soul is harmed by lack of knowledge. In his philosophical exploration of the nature of the soul and its relationship to the external world, Socrates posits that ignorance is the root of all evil and suffering. He believes that true knowledge of oneself and of the world is essential for the well-being of the soul, as it allows one to navigate through life with wisdom and virtue. Therefore, the absence of knowledge not only impedes one's ability to make informed choices and lead a fulfilling life, but also leaves the soul vulnerable to the negative influences of ignorance and falsehood. It is through the pursuit of knowledge and self-awareness, according to Socrates, that one can achieve true happiness and fulfillment.",
