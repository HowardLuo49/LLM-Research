According to Butler, it is impossible to:\nA: approve of the actions of others without imitating them.\nB: do something of which one does not oneself approve.\nC: be motivated by genuine benevolence.\nD: do that which is good and not to approve of it.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Based on Butler's philosophical framework, the correct answer would be D: do that which is good and not to approve of it. Butler suggests that moral approval is inherent in the nature of goodness itself. Therefore, it is impossible to separate the action from the approval of it, as doing what is good inherently implies approval of that action. This aligns with the concept of moral psychology and moral philosophy, which posits that moral actions are intrinsically linked to moral judgments and evaluations.",
