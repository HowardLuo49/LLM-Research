According to Butler, it is impossible to:\nA: approve of the actions of others without imitating them.\nB: do something of which one does not oneself approve.\nC: be motivated by genuine benevolence.\nD: do that which is good and not to approve of it.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "According to Butler, it is impossible to do that which is good and not to approve of it. This assertion stems from Butler's moral theory which posits that we have an inherent sense of goodness and that our moral obligations stem from this internal sense of right and wrong. Therefore, for Butler, our actions are intrinsically linked to our moral approval or disapproval of them. This suggests that a disconnect between our actions and our moral approval of them would be inconceivable according to Butler's framework. In this sense, Butler implies that genuine moral action necessarily involves a corresponding moral approval, rendering it impossible to do that which is good without also approving of it.",
