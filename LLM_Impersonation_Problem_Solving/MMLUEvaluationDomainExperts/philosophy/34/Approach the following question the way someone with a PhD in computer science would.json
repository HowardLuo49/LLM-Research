Butler posits that human beings have a moral sense that guides them towards virtuous actions. In the context of the question, Butler argues that it is impossible for individuals to do something morally good without also approving of it.\n\nTherefore, according to Butler, the correct answer would be Option D: do that which is good and not to approve of it. This aligns with Butler's belief that moral actions are inherently tied to moral approval, as individuals cannot truly act in a morally good way without also recognizing and approving of the goodness of their actions.",
