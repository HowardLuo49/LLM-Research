Bentham claims that utilitarian calculations:\nA: should be performed prior to each action.\nB: need not be performed before each action, but should always be kept in mind.\nC: are merely a formal device, and do not have practical application.\nD: are fundamentally flawed.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in philosophy, I would approach this question by examining the foundational principles of utilitarianism as proposed by Jeremy Bentham. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that holds that the right course of action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure. Bentham's utilitarian calculations involve weighing the potential consequences of an action to determine its moral worth.\n\nIn considering Bentham's perspective, it is important to note that he believed that utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action. This is because the moral worth of an action is determined by its consequences, and these consequences can only be assessed through careful calculation. By performing utilitarian calculations before each action, individuals can ensure that they are acting in a way that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure.\n\nTherefore, option A, which states that utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action, aligns with Bentham's views on how utilitarianism should be applied. Options B, C, and D do not accurately reflect Bentham's perspective, as he believed that utilitarian calculations are essential for determining the moral worth of actions.",
