    "gpt_response": "A PhD in literature would likely approach this question by analyzing Bentham's concept of utilitarianism and how it applies to ethical decision-making in literature. \n\nBentham's utilitarian calculations involve weighing the potential consequences of an action in order to determine the greatest overall good for the greatest number of people. This philosophy emphasizes utility or happiness as the ultimate measure of morality.\n\nBased on this understanding, a scholar with a PhD in literature would likely argue that option A: should be performed prior to each action, aligns most closely with Bentham's principles. By performing utilitarian calculations before taking any action, individuals can ensure that their choices will result in the most favorable outcome for society as a whole.\n\nIn literature, characters often face moral dilemmas that require them to consider the greater good. By applying utilitarian calculations, characters can make more informed decisions that reflect their values and priorities.\n\nOverall, a PhD in literature would likely argue that utilitarian calculations should be a key consideration in ethical decision-making, both in literature and in real life.",
