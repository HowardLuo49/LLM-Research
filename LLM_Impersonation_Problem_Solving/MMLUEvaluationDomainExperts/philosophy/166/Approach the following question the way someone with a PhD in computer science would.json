    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of utilitarian calculations. Utilitarianism, a normative ethical theory, suggests that the moral worth of an action is determined by its utility in maximizing happiness or pleasure and minimizing suffering or pain for the greatest number of people.\n\nIn the context of Bentham's utilitarian calculations, it is important to note that he advocated for a quantitative approach to ethics, where the rightness or wrongness of an action could be objectively assessed based on the net utility it produces. This involves calculating the overall happiness and suffering generated by different possible actions and selecting the one that maximizes overall utility.\n\nWith this understanding, I would approach Bentham's claim that utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action. This suggests a commitment to evaluating the consequences of one's actions in a systematic and rigorous manner to ensure that the greatest good is achieved. From a computational perspective, this approach aligns with the idea of optimizing decision-making processes through algorithmic calculations and rational analysis.\n\nTherefore, as someone with a PhD in computer science, I would likely agree with option A: utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action. This aligns with the systematic and logical thinking inherent in computational approaches to problem-solving, where maximizing utility can be seen as a form of optimization or decision-making process.",
