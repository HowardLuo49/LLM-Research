    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach Bentham's claim on utilitarian calculations with a critical and analytical mindset. Utilitarianism is a philosophical theory that focuses on maximizing overall happiness or utility. \n\nBentham's assertion that utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action reflects a strict adherence to the principle of maximizing utility in decision-making processes. This approach necessitates a constant evaluation of potential outcomes and their impact on the overall well-being of individuals affected by the action. \n\nIn contrast, option B, which suggests that utilitarian calculations need not be performed before each action but should always be kept in mind, acknowledges the importance of maintaining a utilitarian mindset in decision-making processes. This approach allows for a more practical and flexible application of utilitarian principles, taking into account the complexities and uncertainties inherent in real-world situations.\n\nOn the other hand, option C, which posits that utilitarian calculations are merely a formal device with no practical application, undermines the fundamental principles of utilitarianism and fails to recognize its value in guiding ethical decision-making.\n\nLastly, option D, which claims that utilitarian calculations are fundamentally flawed, overlooks the potential benefits of utilitarianism in promoting the greater good and ensuring the ethical implications of actions are considered.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in engineering would likely approach Bentham's claim on utilitarian calculations by critically evaluating the various options and considering the practical implications of each approach in real-world decision-making scenarios.",
