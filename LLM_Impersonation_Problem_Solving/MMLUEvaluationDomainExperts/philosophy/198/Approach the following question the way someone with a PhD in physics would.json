While the specific reasoning behind each of these limitations would need to be explored further, it is possible that Wolf would assert that engaging in activities such as reading Victorian novels, displaying sarcastic wit, or having an interest in gourmet cooking could distract or detract from the single-minded pursuit of moral perfection that characterizes the moral saint.\n\nTaking into account the principles underlying Wolf's concept of the moral saint, it is plausible that Wolf would argue that all of the above options (A, B, and C) are incompatible with being a moral saint.
