    "gpt_response": "In her seminal work \"Moral Saints,\" Susan Wolf posits that a moral saint is characterized by a rigid moral perfectionism, whereby their entire existence is devoted to the pursuit of moral goodness. According to Wolf, a moral saint is incapable of leading a well-rounded and fulfilling life due to the constant prioritization of moral concerns above all else.\n\nIn examining the traits proposed in the question, it is evident that options A, B, and C all align with Wolf's concept of a moral saint. Reading Victorian novels, possessing a sarcastic wit, and having an interest in gourmet cooking are all pursuits that can be seen as detracting from the singular focus on moral perfectionism that characterizes the moral saint. Therefore, it can be argued that according to Wolf, a moral saint would indeed be unable to engage in these activities, leading to the conclusion that the correct answer is D: all of the above.",
