Moore argued that certain concepts cannot be defined, such as \"good\" and \"yellow,\" as they are inherently indefinable or self-evident. However, concepts like \"horse\" can be defined through their properties and characteristics.\n\nTherefore, according to Moore, the concept of \"horse\" can be defined, but concepts like \"good\" and \"yellow\" cannot. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC: horse",
