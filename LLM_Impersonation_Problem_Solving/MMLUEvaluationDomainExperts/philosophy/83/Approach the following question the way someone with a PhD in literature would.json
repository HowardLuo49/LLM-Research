Moore, the concept that can be defined is \"yellow.\" Moore argues that concepts such as \"good\" and \"horse\" cannot be adequately defined, as they are considered irreducible and indefinable. In his essay \"A Defence of Common Sense,\" Moore distinguishes between natural properties that can be directly perceived, such as the color yellow, and abstract concepts like goodness or horserace, which are unable to be defined in terms of something more basic. Therefore, the concept of \"yellow\" is the only one of the options that Moore would argue can be defined.",
