In this case, out of the given options, the concept that can be defined according to Moore would be \"good.\" This is because \"good\" is an abstract concept that can be analyzed, discussed, and defined philosophically. The concepts of \"yellow\" and \"horse,\" on the other hand, are concrete and empirical in nature, and may not be subject to the same kind of definitional scrutiny as abstract concepts like \"good.\" Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA: good",
