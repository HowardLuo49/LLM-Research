Dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure.\"  Here Plato indicates how hypothetical knowledge cannot provide the foundation of dialectical knowledge, insofar as hypotheses simply:\nA: explain sense experiences in terms of general concepts which themselves are not explained.\nB: show how particular objects of experience cause us to recall innate ideas.\nC: describe sense experience without providing an explanation for dialectical methods.\nD: reject the use of reason, preferring instead dialectic, to achieve knowledge.",

    "gpt_response": "A: explain sense experiences in terms of general concepts which themselves are not explained. \n\nPlato argues that dialectic, as the highest form of philosophical inquiry, bypasses the need for hypotheses by directly engaging with first principles. Hypotheses only serve to explain sensory experiences in terms of general concepts, but they do not provide a genuine understanding of the absolute good. In order to achieve true knowledge, one must transcend the realm of the senses and reach the realm of pure intelligence through dialectical reasoning.",
