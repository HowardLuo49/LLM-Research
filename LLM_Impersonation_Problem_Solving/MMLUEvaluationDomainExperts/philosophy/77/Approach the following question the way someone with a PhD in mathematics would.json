This principle can be applied to the case of imprisoning debtors, suggesting that if imprisoning A is justified, then it should also be justified to imprison all debtors in similar situations. \n\nOption C, considerations of the consequences of imprisoning A, is a key factor in moral decision-making. Imprisoning A could have various negative consequences, such as impacting their ability to repay their debts, causing harm to their family, and potentially leading to further social issues. \n\nTherefore, a mathematician with a PhD would likely choose option D, all of the above, as the moral argument against imprisoning A likely encompasses a combination of fear, universalizability, and considerations of consequences.",
