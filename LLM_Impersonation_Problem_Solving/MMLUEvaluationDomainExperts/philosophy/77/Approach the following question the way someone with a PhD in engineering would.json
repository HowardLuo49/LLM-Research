The moral argument against imprisoning debtor A would likely be based on a combination of universalizability and considerations of the consequences of such action. \n\nUniversalizability refers to the idea that moral principles should be applicable universally to all individuals in similar circumstances. In the case of debtor A, imprisoning them for their debt may be seen as unfair or unjust, as it could set a dangerous precedent that could potentially harm others in similar situations. \n\nConsiderations of the consequences of imprisoning debtor A would also need to be taken into account. Imprisoning individuals for debts could have negative implications for society as a whole, such as increased strain on the prison system, potential harm to debtor A's family, and limited opportunities for debtor A to repay their debt in the future. \n\nTherefore, the moral argument against imprisoning debtor A would likely consider both universalizability and the consequences of such action, making answer choice D: all of the above the most appropriate selection.",
