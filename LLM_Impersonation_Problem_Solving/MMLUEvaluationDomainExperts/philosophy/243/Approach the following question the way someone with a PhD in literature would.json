    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In Butler's philosophical framework, injustice is not merely a result of individual desires for external goods or a love of injustice, but rather stems from a deeper root of ill-will towards others and even self-hatred. Butler's conception of injustice goes beyond surface-level explanations and delves into the psychological and moral complexities that underlie human behavior and societal structures. Through her nuanced analysis, Butler highlights how internalized negative emotions and beliefs can manifest as acts of injustice towards oneself and others, ultimately perpetuating systemic inequalities and harm. Thus, Butler's view on the causes of injustice is multifaceted and rooted in a profound understanding of the human psyche and ethical quandaries that plague society.",
