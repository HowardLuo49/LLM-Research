    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing Butler's perspective on the causes of injustice from a philosophical and ethical standpoint. \n\nIn Butler's view, injustice is primarily caused by desires for external goods. This perspective aligns with the idea that individuals may act unjustly in order to achieve or maintain material possessions, power, or status. This can lead to actions that harm others or infringe upon their rights, resulting in unjust outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, Butler may argue that the love of injustice plays a role in causing injustice. This could refer to an individual's enjoyment or satisfaction in acting unjustly, either towards others or oneself. The pursuit of unjust actions for personal enjoyment or gain can contribute to creating and perpetuating systems of injustice.\n\nIll-will toward others is another potential cause of injustice according to Butler. This refers to individuals harboring negative feelings or intentions towards others, which can manifest in unjust actions or behaviors. Ill-will may stem from prejudiced beliefs, resentment, or a lack of empathy, all of which can lead to unjust treatment of others.\n\nFinally, Butler may contend that self-hatred can also contribute to the perpetuation of injustice. This could refer to individuals projecting their own negative self-perceptions onto others, leading to mistreatment or discrimination. Additionally, feelings of self-hatred can result in destructive behaviors towards oneself, which may indirectly harm others and perpetuate cycles of injustice.\n\nIn summary, a PhD in engineering would approach Butler's view on the causes of injustice by examining the roles of desires for external goods, love of injustice, ill-will toward others, and self-hatred in contributing to unjust actions and outcomes in society.",
