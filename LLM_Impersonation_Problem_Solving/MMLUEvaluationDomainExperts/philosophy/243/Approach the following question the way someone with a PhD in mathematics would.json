    "gpt_response": "In Butler's philosophical framework, injustice is fundamentally rooted in the disordered desires individuals have for external goods. These desires stem from a lack of understanding of one's true nature and the misguided belief that fulfillment can be found in material possessions or societal status. This leads individuals to violate the inherent moral principles that govern just behavior, resulting in acts of injustice. Love of injustice, ill-will toward others, and self-hatred are all related manifestations of this underlying problem of misdirected desires for external goods, rather than primary causes of injustice. Thus, the correct answer is A: desires for external goods.",
