    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In Butler's view, injustice is primarily caused by desires for external goods. This aligns with psychological theories that suggest that human behavior is driven by the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. External goods such as power, wealth, and status can often lead individuals to prioritize their own interests over the well-being of others, resulting in unjust actions and behaviors. This perspective is rooted in evolutionary biology and social psychology, which highlight the role of competition and self-interest in shaping human social behavior. Additionally, Butler may argue that self-hatred and ill-will toward others can also contribute to injustice, but the primary driving force is the pursuit of external goods.",
