Kant believed that moral actions should be guided by rationality and universalizability. In the case of making a lying promise, Kant would argue that it is immoral because it is not logically consistent to will that everyone should make lying promises. If everyone were to make lying promises, trust in society would break down, rendering the concept of a promise meaningless. This principle of universalizability is central to Kant's moral reasoning and is why he would consider making a lying promise to be wrong.",
