    "gpt_response": "C: you could not consistently will that everyone should make lying promises\n\nAs a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by examining Kant's moral philosophy and his concept of the categorical imperative. According to Kant, our actions should be guided by a universal moral law that is based on reason alone. Making a lying promise would be considered wrong because it goes against the principle of universalizability - that is, you could not consistently will that everyone should make lying promises. This is because if everyone were to make lying promises, trust within society would break down, rendering the concept of promises meaningless and ultimately harmful to the social fabric. Therefore, from a Kantian perspective, making a lying promise is ethically wrong because it contradicts the fundamental principle of moral consistency and universality.",
