To Kant, making a lying promise would be wrong because _____.\nA: lying to people can cause them harm\nB: lying to people harms society\nC: you could not consistently will that everyone should make lying promises\nD: most people condemn the practice",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "C: you could not consistently will that everyone should make lying promises\n\nA PhD in computer science would likely approach this question from a logical and ethical perspective. In the context of Kantian ethics, making a lying promise would be considered wrong because it violates the categorical imperative, specifically the principle of universalizability. According to Kant, individuals should only act in ways that they could consistently will that everyone should act in the same way. Therefore, if everyone were to make lying promises, the concept of promises would become meaningless and society would break down. This ethical reasoning is applicable to computer science in terms of coding practices, where consistency and reliability are paramount.",
