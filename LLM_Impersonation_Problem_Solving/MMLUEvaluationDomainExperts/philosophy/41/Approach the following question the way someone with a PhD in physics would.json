    "gpt_response": "C: you could not consistently will that everyone should make lying promises\n\nA person with a PhD in physics would likely approach this question by drawing on Kant's moral philosophy, specifically his concept of the Categorical Imperative. According to Kant, the Categorical Imperative is a moral principle that states one should act only according to maxims that could be consistently willed as universal laws. Making a lying promise would be wrong according to Kant because if everyone were to make lying promises, the act of promising itself would become meaningless and trust in society would be eroded. Therefore, one could not consistently will that everyone should make lying promises without undermining the very concept of promising itself.",
