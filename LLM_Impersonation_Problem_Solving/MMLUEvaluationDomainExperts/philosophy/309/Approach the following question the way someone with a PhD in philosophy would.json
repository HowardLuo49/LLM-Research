    "gpt_response": "Descartes posited that the interaction between the body and mind occurred in the pineal gland. This belief is rooted in his dualistic framework, which maintains a clear distinction between the immaterial mind and the material body. By locating the point of interaction in the pineal gland, Descartes aimed to identify a specific physical site where the otherwise independent realms of mind and body could interact, thus addressing the challenge of how these two distinct substances could communicate with each other. This conceptualization has been subject to various criticisms and interpretations within the history of philosophy, yet it remains a foundational aspect of Descartes' philosophy of mind-body interaction.",
