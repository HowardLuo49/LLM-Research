Descartes believed that the pineal gland was the \"seat of the soul\" and the point at which the physical and spiritual realms interacted. This belief stemmed from his view that the pineal gland was the only singular structure in the brain that was not duplicated, leading him to believe it had a unique function. Therefore, based on Descartes' philosophy, the interaction between the body and mind took place in the pineal gland.",
