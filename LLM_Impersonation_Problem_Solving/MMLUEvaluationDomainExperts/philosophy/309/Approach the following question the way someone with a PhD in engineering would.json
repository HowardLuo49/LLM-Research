Descartes, a 17th-century French philosopher and mathematician, posited that the pineal gland was the \"seat of the soul\" and the point of interaction between the immaterial mind and the material body. This belief was based on his dualist philosophy, which separated the mind and body into distinct entities. While modern neuroscience has debunked many of Descartes' specific theories about the pineal gland, his ideas have had a lasting impact on the study of consciousness and the mind-body relationship.",
