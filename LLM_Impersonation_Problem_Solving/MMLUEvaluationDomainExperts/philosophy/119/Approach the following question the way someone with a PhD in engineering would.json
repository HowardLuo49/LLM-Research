    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by drawing upon the philosophical and ethical theories of Immanuel Kant. Kant, a significant figure in the field of moral philosophy, posited the concept of the moral law as being given to each person by their own rational will. This concept forms the foundation of Kant's deontological ethics, in which moral actions are determined by the adherence to a universal principle known as the categorical imperative.\n\nWhile society, God, and nature may have influences on an individual's moral development, Kant's emphasis on the autonomy of the rational will suggests that the moral law is ultimately determined by one's own reasoning and capacity for moral judgment. Therefore, the correct answer to the question posed would be B: one's own will.",
