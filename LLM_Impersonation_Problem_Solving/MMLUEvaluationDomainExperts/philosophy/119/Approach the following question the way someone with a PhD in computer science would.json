Kant's philosophy on morality is based on the concept of deontological ethics, in which moral duties are determined by reason and rationality rather than consequences.\n\nKant asserts that the moral law is given to each person by their own will, specifically through the faculty of reason. He argues that individuals have the capacity to autonomously determine what is morally right or wrong through the use of their rational faculties. This aligns with Kant's belief in the importance of human autonomy and the inherent ability of individuals to make moral decisions based on their own rational judgments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be B: one's own will, as it reflects Kant's emphasis on individual autonomy and rational determination of moral duties.",
