According to Brandt, John Stuart Mill\u2019s view most closely resembles:\nA: act-utilitarianism.\nB: a rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society.\nC: a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\nD: Kant\u2019s ethics.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In examining John Stuart Mill's ethical views, it becomes apparent that his perspective aligns most closely with act-utilitarianism. This is evidenced by Mill's emphasis on the consequences of individual actions as the primary determinant of their moral value. Unlike rule-utilitarianism, which focuses on adherence to established societal rules or ideal moral principles, Mill's approach prioritizes the maximization of overall happiness or utility through the evaluation of the outcomes of specific actions. Furthermore, Mill's framework diverges significantly from Kantian ethics, which emphasizes moral duties and obligations based on reason rather than the outcomes or consequences of actions. As such, it can be argued that Mill's ethical theory most closely resembles act-utilitarianism.",
