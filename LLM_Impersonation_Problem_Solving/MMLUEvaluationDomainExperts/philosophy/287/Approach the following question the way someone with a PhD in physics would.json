    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by acknowledging that John Stuart Mill is a prominent philosopher in the field of ethics, specifically known for his utilitarianism. In Brandt's analysis, Mill's view aligns most closely with act-utilitarianism, which is the ethical theory that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or utility in a given situation. This is in contrast to rule-utilitarianism, which focuses on adhering to particular rules or principles to maximize overall utility. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: act-utilitarianism.",
