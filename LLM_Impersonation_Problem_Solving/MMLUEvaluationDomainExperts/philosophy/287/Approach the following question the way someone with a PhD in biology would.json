    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by analyzing the key principles and tenets of John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism and comparing them to the options provided.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill's view on utilitarianism is often closely associated with act-utilitarianism, which emphasizes the importance of maximizing overall happiness or utility through individual actions. This aligns with the core beliefs of Mill that the ethics of actions should be judged by their consequences and their ability to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nRule-utilitarianism, on the other hand, focuses on the idea that actions should be guided by rules that, when followed, produce the greatest amount of good for society as a whole. This can be further categorized into two types: rule-utilitarianism based on the actual rules of society and rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.\n\nKant's ethics, on the other hand, is a deontological ethical theory that emphasizes the importance of duty and universal moral principles, rather than the consequences of actions.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is clear that John Stuart Mill's view on utilitarianism most closely resembles act-utilitarianism (Option A) rather than the other options provided.",
