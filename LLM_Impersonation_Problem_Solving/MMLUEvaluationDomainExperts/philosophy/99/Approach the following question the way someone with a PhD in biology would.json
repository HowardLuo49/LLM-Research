    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question from a perspective of natural rights and the concept of what constitutes a fundamental right. In this context, Butler's assertion that the only thing anyone has a right to is life would be based on the principle that life is a universally recognized fundamental right inherent to all individuals. This position aligns with the biological understanding of the intrinsic value and importance of life as a basic biological characteristic.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the concept of rights can vary depending on the philosophical, ethical, and legal frameworks being considered. While life may be considered a fundamental right in biological contexts, other perspectives may prioritize liberty, property, or happiness as equally important. Ultimately, the interpretation of rights and the determination of what individuals have a right to is a complex and multifaceted issue that extends beyond a strict biological viewpoint.",
