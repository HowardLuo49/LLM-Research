Life, as the first option, is often considered a fundamental right and a necessary prerequisite for the enjoyment of other rights. Liberty, the second option, refers to the freedom of individuals to act and make choices within a society. \n\nProperty, the third option, relates to the ownership and control of material possessions, which has been a subject of controversy and debate in philosophical and political discourse.
