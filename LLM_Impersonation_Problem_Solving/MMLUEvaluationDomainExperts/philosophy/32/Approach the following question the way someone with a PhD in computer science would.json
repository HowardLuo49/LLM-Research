Kant argues that moral principles are not derived from experience (a posteriori), but are instead known through reason and understanding inherent to the nature of rational beings (a priori). Additionally, Kant views moral principles as synthetic, meaning that they provide new knowledge beyond what is already contained within the concept of morality itself. This perspective aligns with Kant's belief in the autonomy and dignity of rational individuals in determining moral truths.",
