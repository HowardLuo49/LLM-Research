    "gpt_response": "According to Immanuel Kant, the supreme principle of morality is best understood as synthetic and a priori. Kant believed that moral truths are not derived from experience or observation of the world (a posteriori), but rather are known through reason and hold independently of experience (a priori). Additionally, he argued that moral principles are not mere logical truths or tautologies (analytic), but rather involve the combination of concepts in a way that goes beyond what is contained within them individually (synthetic). Hence, Kant's supreme principle of morality, which he called the \"categorical imperative,\" is best categorized as synthetic and a priori.",
