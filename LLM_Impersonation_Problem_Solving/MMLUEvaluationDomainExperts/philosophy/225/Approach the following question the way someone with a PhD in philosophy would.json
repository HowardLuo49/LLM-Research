    "gpt_response": "As a scholar of philosophy, one must approach the question of the traditional definition of art with a nuanced and critical perspective. Throughout history, various thinkers and schools of thought have proposed different understandings of what constitutes art. \n\nOne prevalent traditional definition of art is that it involves representation. This view, often associated with the aesthetic theories of thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle, posits that art is a way of representing or imitating the natural world. According to this conception, art serves as a mirror reflecting the beauty and order of reality, allowing viewers to contemplate and appreciate the underlying truths and forms of the world.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this representation-based definition of art is not without its challenges and critiques. Some contemporary philosophers, such as Arthur Danto and George Dickie, have argued that art cannot simply be reduced to representation, as it encompasses a wide range of creative practices and expressions that may not necessarily involve mimesis or imitation. These thinkers advocate for a more inclusive and open-ended understanding of art that acknowledges its diverse and evolving nature.\n\nIn conclusion, while the representation-based definition of art has long been influential in the history of philosophy, it is essential for contemporary scholars to engage critically with this tradition and explore alternative perspectives that capture the complex and multifaceted nature of artistic expression.",
