    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I must look at Cicero's statement from a scientific perspective. When he speaks of following Nature as our guide, he may be referring to the ethical philosophy of natural law, which suggests that moral principles are inherent in the natural order of the universe. From a physics standpoint, we can understand the natural laws that govern the physical world as being fundamental principles that guide the behavior of matter and energy. In this sense, following Nature as our guide could imply aligning our actions with these fundamental principles of the universe in order to stay morally on track. This interpretation suggests that by understanding and adhering to the laws of nature, we can make ethical decisions that are in harmony with the world around us.",
