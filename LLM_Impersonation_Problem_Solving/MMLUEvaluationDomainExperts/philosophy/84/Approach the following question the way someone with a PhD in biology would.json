This perspective aligns with Cicero's belief that following Nature as our guide is the key to avoiding moral astray.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint, we can observe patterns in nature that demonstrate a balance and order that can serve as a moral compass for human behavior. For example, the concept of ecological balance in ecosystems can be seen as a reflection of natural harmony that humans should strive to emulate in their interactions with each other and the environment.\n\nAdditionally, evolutionary biology can provide insights into the origins of moral behavior in humans, suggesting that certain moral principles may have evolutionary roots that are influenced by our biological makeup. By following Nature as our guide, we can tap into these innate moral instincts that have been shaped by our evolutionary history.\n\nIn conclusion, a biologist with a PhD would likely agree with Cicero's assertion that following Nature as our guide can help us stay on the right moral path. Our biological and evolutionary heritage may provide us with valuable insights into the moral principles that govern our behavior, making it a reliable guide for moral decision-making.",
