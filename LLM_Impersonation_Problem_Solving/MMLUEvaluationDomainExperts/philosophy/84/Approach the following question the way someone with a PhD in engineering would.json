Cicero's belief in following Nature as our guide can be interpreted as aligning our actions with the inherent order and principles of the natural world.\n\nFrom an engineering standpoint, one could argue that Nature operates according to scientific laws and principles that govern the universe. By following Nature as our guide, we can strive to act in harmony with these fundamental laws, ultimately leading to ethical and moral behavior.\n\nThis approach aligns with the concept of natural law theory, which posits that there are universal moral principles inherent in the natural order that can guide human conduct. By adhering to these principles, individuals can make decisions that are morally sound and aligned with the natural order of the world.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in engineering would likely argue that following Nature as our guide, as advocated by Cicero, can serve as a reliable moral compass to ensure that we do not go morally astray. By aligning our actions with the principles of the natural world, we can make ethical choices that are consistent with the overall order of the universe.",
