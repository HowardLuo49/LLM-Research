    "gpt_response": "Cicero's argument that we will never go morally astray if we follow Nature as our guide is rooted in his philosophy of Natural Law. In his works, particularly \"De Officiis\" and \"De Legibus,\" Cicero explores the concept that there is an innate moral order in the natural world that human beings can align themselves with in order to live a virtuous life.\n\nBy following Nature as our guide, Cicero suggests that we should look to the natural world for principles of justice, fairness, and ethical behavior. This involves understanding and adhering to universal truths and values that are inherent in the natural order of things. Rather than relying on man-made laws or religious edicts, Cicero believes that by reflecting on the natural world and our place within it, we can cultivate a sense of moral responsibility and righteousness.\n\nCicero's argument is essentially a call to reason and introspection, urging individuals to use their intellect and moral sense to discern right from wrong. By aligning our actions and decisions with the harmony and order of Nature, Cicero believes that we can uphold moral integrity and lead a righteous life. Ultimately, by following Nature as our guide, we can navigate the complexities of ethical dilemmas and ensure that our moral compass always points in the right direction.",
