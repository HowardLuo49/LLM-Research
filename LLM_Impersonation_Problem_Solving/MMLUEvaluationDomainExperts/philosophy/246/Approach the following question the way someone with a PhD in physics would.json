    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is B: logical behaviorism.\n\nLogical behaviorism is a philosophical theory that mental states are identical to behavioral dispositions. This theory suggests that mental states can be understood solely through observing and analyzing behaviors, rather than through introspection or appeal to internal mental states. It posits that mental states can be reduced to behavioral dispositions in order to provide a scientific and objective account of mental phenomena.",
