    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would argue that Plato's view on true beauty aligns with option D: not of this world. Plato believed in the existence of a separate realm of ideal forms, of which true beauty is one. According to Plato's theory of forms, true beauty is a perfect, immutable ideal that transcends the physical world we perceive with our senses. This view suggests that true beauty cannot be found in everyday objects or in the natural world, as they are merely imperfect reflections or manifestations of the true form of beauty. Therefore, true beauty, according to Plato, is not of this world.",
