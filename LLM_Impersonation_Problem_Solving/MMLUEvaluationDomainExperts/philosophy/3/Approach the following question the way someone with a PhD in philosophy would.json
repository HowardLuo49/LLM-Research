    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Plato's view on true beauty is one that extends beyond the physical realm and resides in the realm of Forms. According to Plato, true beauty is not found in everyday objects or in the natural world, as these are merely imperfect manifestations of the true Form of beauty. Instead, true beauty is transcendent, eternal, and ultimately unattainable in our material world. Therefore, Plato would support option D: not of this world as his view on true beauty.",
