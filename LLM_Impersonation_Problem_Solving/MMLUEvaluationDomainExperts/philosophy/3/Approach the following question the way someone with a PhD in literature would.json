    "gpt_response": "I would approach this question by first acknowledging Plato's significant contributions to the field of philosophy, particularly his discussions on aesthetics and metaphysics. In Plato's Symposium, he presents the concept of the Form of Beauty, which posits that true beauty is an ideal, transcendent form that exists beyond the physical world. This aligns with option D, as Plato believed that true beauty is not of this world but instead belongs to the realm of the Forms, which are eternal and unchanging. Additionally, Plato asserts that individuals are able to recognize and appreciate beauty in the physical world because they possess a innate understanding of the Forms, which allows them to perceive and be drawn towards beauty. Therefore, I would argue that Plato's view is that true beauty is not of this world.",
