According to Nagel, the problem of moral luck arises because:\nA: philosophers try to apply arbitrarily stringent standards to moral responsibility.\nB: the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events.\nC: our moral theories are hopelessly off track.\nD: our theories of human action are hopelessly off track.",

    "gpt_response": "From a perspective informed by a PhD in engineering, Nagel's analysis of the problem of moral luck points to a fundamental issue in the philosophical understanding of moral responsibility. Option D, which suggests that our theories of human action are off track, resonates strongly with Nagel's argument. He posits that the concept of moral luck challenges our conventional views on moral responsibility, highlighting the limitations of our current understanding of human action and intention.\n\nNagel argues that the problem of moral luck arises because our theories fail to adequately account for the role of luck in determining the moral worth of actions. This inadequacy stems from a broader issue in philosophical thinking, where deterministic frameworks and rigid standards for moral responsibility overlook the complex interplay of factors that influence human behavior.\n\nThrough a nuanced examination of moral luck, Nagel challenges philosophers to reevaluate their assumptions about agency, causality, and responsibility. By acknowledging the limits of our current theories of human action, we can strive towards a more comprehensive understanding of morality that integrates the role of luck and chance into our ethical frameworks.",
