According to Nagel, the problem of moral luck arises because:\nA: philosophers try to apply arbitrarily stringent standards to moral responsibility.\nB: the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events.\nC: our moral theories are hopelessly off track.\nD: our theories of human action are hopelessly off track.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The problem of moral luck, as identified by Nagel, arises primarily because the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events. This dissolution occurs when individuals are held morally responsible for outcomes that were influenced by factors beyond their control, such as external circumstances or luck. This challenges traditional views of moral responsibility, which typically hold individuals accountable for their intentional actions only. Additionally, the problem of moral luck highlights the limitations of our theories of human action, as they often fail to adequately account for the role of luck in shaping moral outcomes. Thus, according to Nagel, the problem of moral luck ultimately stems from the complex interplay between individual agency, external factors, and our understanding of moral responsibility.",
