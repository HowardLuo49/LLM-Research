According to Nagel, the problem of moral luck arises because:\nA: philosophers try to apply arbitrarily stringent standards to moral responsibility.\nB: the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events.\nC: our moral theories are hopelessly off track.\nD: our theories of human action are hopelessly off track.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The problem of moral luck, as identified by Nagel, arises from the fact that our traditional theories of moral responsibility and human action are inadequate to fully account for the role of luck in determining moral judgments. Nagel argues that our attempts to apply overly stringent standards to moral responsibility fail to incorporate the influence of luck on our actions and the outcomes of those actions. This results in a discrepancy between our intuitions about moral responsibility and the reality of how luck can impact the moral evaluation of individuals. Therefore, in order to properly address the problem of moral luck, we must reevaluate and potentially revise our theories of moral responsibility and human action to incorporate the role of luck in a more meaningful way.",
