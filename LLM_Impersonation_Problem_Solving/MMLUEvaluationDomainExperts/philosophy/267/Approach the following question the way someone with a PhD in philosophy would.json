According to Nagel, the problem of moral luck arises because:\nA: philosophers try to apply arbitrarily stringent standards to moral responsibility.\nB: the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events.\nC: our moral theories are hopelessly off track.\nD: our theories of human action are hopelessly off track.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "B: the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events. \n\nNagel's argument is centered around the idea that moral luck poses a unique challenge to our understanding of morality because it exposes the inherent vulnerability of the self to external factors beyond its control. The very essence of moral responsibility is called into question when outcomes are influenced by luck or circumstances outside of one's agency. This threat of dissolution of the self arises from the merging of one's actions with the broader scope of events, leading to a breakdown in the traditional boundaries that separate individual agency from external factors. Ultimately, Nagel argues that this challenge highlights the limitations of our current moral frameworks and calls for a reevaluation of how we understand the relationship between individual actions, responsibility, and the unpredictable forces of luck.",
