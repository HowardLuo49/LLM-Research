    "gpt_response": "As a PhD holder in engineering, I would approach this question by first understanding the principle that Singer considers and analyzing it in the context of engineering principles. I would critically evaluate both versions of the principle based on their logical consistency, applicability to engineering problems, and empirical evidence supporting their validity.\n\nIn considering the stronger version of the principle, I would evaluate its rigorousness and ability to provide clear guidelines for decision-making in complex engineering scenarios. I would assess whether the stronger version aligns with established engineering theories and practices, and determine if it offers practical solutions for real-world engineering challenges. Additionally, I would consider any potential limitations or contradictions inherent in the stronger version that may impact its effectiveness in engineering contexts.\n\nConversely, in examining the weaker version of the principle, I would assess its level of certainty and reliability in guiding engineering decision-making. I would analyze whether the weaker version offers sufficient guidance for addressing uncertainty and complexity in engineering systems, and evaluate its implications for risk management and problem-solving in engineering projects. I would also compare the weaker version with existing engineering principles and standards to determine its compatibility with established practices in the field.\n\nMoreover, I would carefully review Singer's analysis of both versions of the principle, considering his arguments and evidence for either accepting or rejecting them. I would examine the rationale behind Singer's conclusions, weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each version in light of engineering principles and methodologies. Based on this analysis, I would determine whether Singer's assessment is supported by sound reasoning and empirical evidence, and assess the implications of his conclusions for engineering research and practice.\n\nUltimately, as a PhD in engineering, my approach to this question would involve a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of both versions of the principle considered by Singer, drawing on my expertise in engineering theory, methodology, and empirical evidence to critically assess their validity and applicability in engineering contexts.",
