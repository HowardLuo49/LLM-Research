    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in computer science, it is important to carefully analyze the principle discussed by Singer and his conclusions regarding its two versions. Singer, a prominent philosopher, is known for his ethical theories and thought experiments. In this context, understanding his stance on the principle is crucial for grasping the depth of his argument.\n\nUpon examining the options provided, it is evident that Singer's consideration of the principle in question is nuanced. It is essential to acknowledge that Singer is likely to have critically evaluated both versions of the principle before reaching a conclusion. Given his meticulous approach to ethical reasoning, it is improbable that Singer would dismiss either version outright without thorough analysis.\n\nConsidering Singer's intellectual rigor and commitment to ethical inquiry, the option that he ends up rejecting both versions (C) is a plausible interpretation. This suggests that Singer likely found flaws or inconsistencies in both the stronger and weaker versions of the principle, leading him to reject them in favor of a more refined or alternative ethical perspective.\n\nIt is important to note that claiming the equivalence of the two versions (D) may not align with Singer's typically meticulous approach to philosophical analysis. Given the complexity of ethical reasoning and the nuances of Singer's arguments, it is more probable that he would highlight distinctions or merits in each version rather than simplifying them as equivalent.\n\nIn conclusion, approaching the question through the lens of a PhD in computer science involves carefully considering Singer's philosophical stance on the principle in question and recognizing the depth of his ethical reasoning. By acknowledging the complexity of Singer's arguments and his rigorous approach to ethical inquiry, one can better understand his likely rejection of both versions of the principle as opposed to claiming their equivalence.",
