    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by breaking down the options and analyzing them based on logic and reasoning. \n\nFirst, option A states that acting virtuously consists of acting in accordance with our strongest inward principle. This suggests that there is a hierarchy or strength associated with our inward principles, which may not necessarily align with Butler's view of virtue ethics.\n\nSecond, option B suggests that acting virtuously consists of acting in accordance with our highest inward principle. This option implies that there is a single overarching principle that determines virtuous actions, which could align more closely with Butler's perspective on acting in accordance with a particular inward principle.\n\nNext, option C proposes that acting virtuously consists of acting in accordance with all of our inward principles. This option suggests a more comprehensive approach to virtue ethics, considering all of our internal motivations and principles in determining virtuous actions.\n\nLastly, option D suggests that acting virtuously consists of following the commands of God. This option introduces a religious perspective on virtue ethics, which may or may not align with Butler's more secular view on moral philosophy.\n\nBased on this analysis, a PhD in mathematics would likely consider option B, our highest inward principle, to be the most accurate representation of Butler's view on acting virtuously. However, further research and analysis would be needed to definitively determine the correct answer.",
