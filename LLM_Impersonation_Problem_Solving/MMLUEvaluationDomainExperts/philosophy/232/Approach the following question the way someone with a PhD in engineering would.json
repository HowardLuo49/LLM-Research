    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first acknowledging that Butler's view on virtue ethics is rooted in the concept of rational self-interest and the internal motivations of individuals. Butler argued that acting virtuously involves aligning our actions with our highest inward principle, which is identified as our conscience or moral sense. This principle serves as a guide for ethical decision-making and dictates what is morally right or wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer in Butler's view would be B: our highest inward principle. This aligns with Butler's belief that acting virtuously entails following the dictates of reason and conscience, rather than simply obeying external rules or commands. This approach to ethics emphasizes the importance of self-reflection, moral intent, and the cultivation of virtuous character traits.",
