    "gpt_response": "In Butler's view, the concept of acting virtuously entails aligning one's actions with the dictates of one's highest inward principle. This principle serves as a guiding force for moral decision-making and behavior, and its supremacy is underscored by Butler as essential for the cultivation of virtue. This approach stands in contrast to a more fragmented understanding of moral agency, which may prioritize various conflicting inward principles or external sources of guidance. Butler's emphasis on the centrality of this highest inward principle highlights the importance of internal moral coherence and integrity in ethical conduct.",
