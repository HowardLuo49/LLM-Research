This aligns with evolutionary biology, which posits that individuals are driven by innate principles or instincts that have evolved over time to promote survival and reproduction. Our highest inward principle can be seen as our intrinsic moral compass, shaped by evolutionary processes to guide us towards behaviors that benefit both ourselves and our social group.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, acting in accordance with our highest inward principle can be viewed as adaptive behavior that promotes individual and group fitness. By following this principle, individuals are more likely to make decisions that lead to successful outcomes and ultimately contribute to the overall well-being of the group.\n\nTherefore, a PhD in biology would likely argue that acting virtuously in accordance with our highest inward principle aligns with the principles of evolutionary biology and the study of human behavior.",
