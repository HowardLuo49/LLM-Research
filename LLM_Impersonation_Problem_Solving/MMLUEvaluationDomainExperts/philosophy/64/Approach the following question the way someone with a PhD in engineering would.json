    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing it from a logical and systematic perspective. \n\nFirstly, I would define the term \"mores\" as the values and customs of a particular society or group, which typically guide social behavior. Therefore, a rule being part of the mores of a group implies that it is deeply ingrained in the cultural and ethical norms of that group.\n\nSecondly, I would consider the concept of universality in teaching a rule. This suggests that the rule should be applicable and understandable by all members of the group, regardless of their background or beliefs. This ensures that the rule is effectively communicated and adhered to by all individuals within the group.\n\nLastly, I would examine the distinction between a rule being merely a taboo versus a fundamental moral principle. A taboo is often associated with a cultural prohibition or restriction, whereas a moral principle is a broader ethical guideline that guides behavior and decision-making.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, I would conclude that for a rule to belong to the morality of a group, it must meet all three criteria outlined in options A, B, and C. This leads me to choose option D: all of the above as the correct answer.",
