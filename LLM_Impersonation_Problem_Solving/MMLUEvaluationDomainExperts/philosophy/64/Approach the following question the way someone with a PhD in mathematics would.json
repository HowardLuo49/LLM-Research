    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by analyzing each statement provided in order to determine the correct answer. \n\nFirstly, the concept of \"mores\" refers to the traditional customs and manners of a group, which are considered morally correct and important. So, statement A asserts that for a rule to belong to the morality of a group, it must be part of the mores of the group. This suggests that a rule must align with the established customs and values of the group in order to be considered moral by that group.\n\nSecondly, statement B posits that for a rule to belong to the morality of a group, it must be universally teachable. This implies that a moral rule should be able to be understood and taught to all members of the group, without exceptions or restrictions.\n\nLastly, statement C states that for a rule to belong to the morality of a group, it must not merely be a taboo. This implies that a moral rule must be more than just a socially prohibited action; it must have deeper ethical implications and be perceived as morally right by the group.\n\nGiven these considerations, it can be deduced that in order for a rule to belong to the morality of a group, it must meet all three criteria mentioned in statements A, B, and C. Therefore, the correct answer is D: all of the above.",
