The death of two individuals involves multiple factors such as relationships, emotional impact, societal consequences, and the uniqueness of each person's life. \n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, it is difficult to definitively prove or disprove Taurek's claims without a clear and universally accepted metric for measuring the \"badness\" or value of human life. The notion of the sum of two people's losses should not be rejected outright, as it may hold value in certain ethical or philosophical contexts. \n\nUltimately, the question of whether the death of two people is worse, less bad, or exactly as bad as the death of one is a deeply complex and subjective issue that may not have a straightforward answer.
