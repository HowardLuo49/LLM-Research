    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "According to Kant's deontological ethics, the moral worth of an action depends on the maxim that is acted on. Kant believed that in order for an action to be morally worthy, it must be done from a sense of duty, guided by the adherence to certain universal moral principles or maxims. The moral character of the agent and the consequences of the action are secondary factors that do not determine the moral worth of the action in Kant's ethical framework. Therefore, the correct answer is C: the maxim that is acted on.",
