    "gpt_response": "It is important to critically evaluate Cleanthes' analogy by considering its logical validity, relevance, and coherence with established engineering principles. Cleanthes' analogy may be deemed strong if it successfully aligns with fundamental engineering concepts and logic, providing a clear and rational argument. Conversely, it may be considered weak if it lacks support from established engineering principles or contains logical inconsistencies. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of Cleanthes' analogy is necessary to determine its legitimacy in the context of engineering reasoning.",
