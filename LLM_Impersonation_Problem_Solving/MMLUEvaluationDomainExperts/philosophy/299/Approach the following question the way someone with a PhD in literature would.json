    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by examining the complex philosophical underpinnings of John Stuart Mill's theory of utilitarianism. Mill posits that the principle of utility, which holds that actions are morally right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness or pleasure, can be validated through the application of his ethical framework.\n\nIn considering the options presented, it is important to note that Mill argues for the principle of utility based on a combination of both self-evident principles and empirical evidence. Mill asserts that the concept of happiness as the ultimate end of human action is self-evident, while the specific calculations of maximizing utility are derived from empirical observation and experience.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question would be B: can be proven from principles that are known empirically. This aligns with Mill's reliance on empirical evidence and observation in supporting his theory of utilitarianism. It is crucial to understand the nuanced philosophical arguments and intricate reasoning behind Mill's ethical theory in order to accurately address this question from a scholarly perspective.",
