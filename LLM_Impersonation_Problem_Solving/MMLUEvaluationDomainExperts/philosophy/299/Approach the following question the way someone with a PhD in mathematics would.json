Therefore, the idea of \"proving\" the principle of utility from self-evident principles or empirical evidence is not a viable approach in the same way that mathematical theorems are proven.\n\nIn this context, Mill's assertion that the principle of utility cannot be proven may be more accurately interpreted as acknowledging that ethical principles, including the principle of utility, rely on ethical intuitions, values, and judgments that cannot be definitively proven or demonstrated in the same way as mathematical or empirical propositions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that option D is the most appropriate answer from a mathematical perspective, as it recognizes the inherent limitations of proving ethical principles in the same manner as mathematical first principles.",
