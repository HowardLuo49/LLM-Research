    "gpt_response": "An individual with a PhD in computer science would likely approach this question by drawing on their background in logical reasoning and critical thinking. They would recognize that the principle of utility, as proposed by philosopher John Stuart Mill, is a foundational concept in utilitarian ethics that advocates for actions that maximize overall happiness or pleasure.\n\nIn assessing Mill's claim about the principle of utility, a computer scientist would likely analyze the logical basis of the principle and consider possible methods of demonstrating its validity. They would understand that the principle of utility is a normative theory that seeks to guide ethical decision-making based on quantifiable outcomes.\n\nGiven this understanding, a computer scientist might argue that the principle of utility cannot be proven from self-evident principles, as ethical principles are inherently subjective and contingent on individual values and beliefs. Similarly, they might argue against the possibility of deriving the principle of utility from empirical evidence, as ethical principles are typically based on normative or prescriptive judgments rather than empirical observations.\n\nFurthermore, a computer scientist might be inclined to agree with option D, which suggests that the principle of utility cannot be proven but that this is a common challenge faced by all first principles. They would likely appreciate the complexities of foundational principles in ethics and philosophy, acknowledging the inherent limitations in demonstrating the veracity of such principles through logical or empirical means.\n\nIn conclusion, a computer scientist with a PhD in computer science would approach the question of the principle of utility with a rigorous and analytical mindset, critically assessing the logical basis of the principle and evaluating the feasibility of proving its validity.
