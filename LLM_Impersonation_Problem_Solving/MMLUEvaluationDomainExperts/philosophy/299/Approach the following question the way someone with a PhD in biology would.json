The principle of utility, also known as utilitarianism, is a normative ethical theory that suggests the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being. \n\nIn considering Mill's claim regarding the proof of the principle of utility, it is important to note that he argued for the principle based on empirical evidence and observation of human behavior. Mill believed that through the observation of human actions and consequences, one could derive the principle of utility as a guiding ethical principle.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, the idea that ethical principles can be derived from empirical observations aligns with the naturalistic approach to ethics. This approach suggests that ethical norms and principles can be understood through observation of human behavior and its consequences on individuals and societies.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate option in this context would likely be B: can be proven from principles that are known empirically.
