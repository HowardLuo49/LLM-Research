    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of ethical skepticism and its relationship to metaphysical, epistemological, religious, and scientific theories. Ethical skepticism refers to the questioning or doubting of moral principles or ethical beliefs.\n\nBased on Baier's claim, it is likely that ethical skepticism is often attributed to confused epistemological theories. This is because epistemology deals with the nature of knowledge, belief, and justification, and confusion in this area could lead to a lack of understanding or acceptance of ethical principles.\n\nWhile metaphysical theories can involve discussions about the nature of reality and existence, and religious views may influence one's moral beliefs, confusion in these areas may not necessarily directly lead to ethical skepticism. Similarly, while scientific theories may provide a framework for understanding the natural world, confusion in this area may not directly relate to questioning ethical principles.\n\nTherefore, as a PhD in engineering, I would argue that B: confused epistemological theories are likely the key factor in contributing to ethical skepticism.",
