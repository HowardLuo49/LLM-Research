    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing Baier's claim in the context of ethical skepticism. Ethical skepticism is the philosophical position that questions the possibility of knowledge or certainty in ethical matters. Baier suggests that ethical skepticism is often due to confused metaphysical theories, epistemological theories, religious views, or scientific theories.\n\nIn this context, a PhD in computer science would likely lean towards choosing option B: confused epistemological theories as the cause of ethical skepticism. Epistemology deals with the nature of knowledge, how it is acquired, and the justification for beliefs. Confusion or skepticism about ethical principles could very well stem from uncertainties or inconsistencies in our epistemological understanding of ethics and how we come to know ethical truths.\n\nWhile confused metaphysical, religious, or scientific theories could also potentially contribute to ethical skepticism, a computer scientist may gravitate towards epistemology as a key factor influencing ethical belief formation and skepticism. The scientific method and rational inquiry are foundational to computer science, making epistemological considerations a relevant and compelling option to consider in this context.",
