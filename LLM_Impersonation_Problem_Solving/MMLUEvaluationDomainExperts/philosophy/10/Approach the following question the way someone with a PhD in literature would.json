According to Gauthier, the basis of morality is:\nA: maximizing the utility of all sentient beings.\nB: God\u2019s commands.\nC: the agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction.\nD: the purposive order of nature.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "According to Gauthier, the basis of morality is the agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction. This aligns with a contractualist approach to ethics, in which moral principles are established through mutual agreement among rational individuals. In this view, morality is not derived from external sources such as God's commands or the order of nature, but rather from the rational deliberation and agreement of individuals working together to maximize their collective well-being. This perspective emphasizes autonomy, rationality, and cooperation as foundational principles in ethical decision-making.",
