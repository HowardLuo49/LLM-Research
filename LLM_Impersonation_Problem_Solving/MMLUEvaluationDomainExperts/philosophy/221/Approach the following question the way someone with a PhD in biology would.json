    "gpt_response": "As a biologist, I would approach this question from the perspective of Tolstoy's psychological and spiritual development following his crisis of meaning. It is widely known that Tolstoy experienced a profound existential crisis in his life, leading him to question the meaning and purpose of existence. This crisis ultimately resulted in Tolstoy undergoing a significant transformation in his beliefs and worldview.\n\nSpecifically, after his crisis of meaning, Tolstoy did not simply experience a boost in income or develop a general distrust of others. Instead, he underwent a profound spiritual and philosophical evolution. Tolstoy became increasingly preoccupied with questions of spirituality and morality, eventually rejecting conventional religious dogma and embracing a more personalized form of Christianity that emphasized pacifism, nonviolence, and social justice.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate representation of how Tolstoy's life changed after his crisis of meaning would be that he became religious, embracing a deeply spiritual and moral vision that guided the remainder of his life and work.",
