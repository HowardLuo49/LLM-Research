Tolstoy's crisis of meaning, which he experienced in midlife, had profound implications for his personal and philosophical development. It prompted him to delve deeply into questions of morality, spirituality, and the nature of existence. \n\nWhile it is true that Tolstoy did become more religious after his crisis of meaning, it would be simplistic to say that this was the only significant change in his life. Tolstoy's religious beliefs evolved over time, eventually leading him to develop his own unique brand of Christian anarchism. \n\nFurthermore, Tolstoy's crisis of meaning also had a significant impact on his relationships with others. While he did become more trusting of certain individuals who shared his beliefs, he also became more skeptical and distrusting of those who did not. This is reflected in his later works, such as \"Resurrection,\" in which he portrays a skeptical view of society and its institutions.\n\nIn addition, Tolstoy's crisis of meaning led him to question traditional authorities and institutions, including the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian government. This questioning ultimately led him to reject organized religion and embrace a more individualistic form of spirituality.\n\nOverall, Tolstoy's crisis of meaning had a profound and multifaceted impact on his life, leading him to reassess his beliefs, relationships, and place in the world. While he did become more religious, this was just one aspect of the transformative journey he underwent as a result of his crisis of meaning.",
