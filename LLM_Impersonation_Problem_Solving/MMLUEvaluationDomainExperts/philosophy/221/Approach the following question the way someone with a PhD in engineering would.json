    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a trained engineer with a PhD, I would approach this question by examining the historical and biographical context of Leo Tolstoy's life. Tolstoy's crisis of meaning, often referred to as his spiritual awakening, occurred in the late 1870s. This period marked a significant turning point in his life, prompting him to reevaluate his beliefs, values, and priorities.\n\nTolstoy's spiritual awakening led to a profound transformation in his personal and professional life. He became increasingly disillusioned with the materialistic and hedonistic lifestyle that had previously characterized his existence. This newfound sense of purpose and meaning led Tolstoy to embrace a simpler, more altruistic way of living.\n\nOne of the most notable changes in Tolstoy's life after his crisis of meaning was his deepening commitment to religious and moral principles. He became deeply interested in Christian teachings, particularly the ethical and humanitarian aspects of the faith. This newfound spirituality not only influenced his personal conduct and lifestyle but also inspired several of his later works, such as \"The Kingdom of God is Within You\" and \"What I Believe.\"\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome of Tolstoy's crisis of meaning would be that he became religious (option C). This transformation had a profound impact on his worldview, relationships, and literary output, shaping the latter part of his life and cementing his legacy as one of the greatest writers of Russian literature.",
