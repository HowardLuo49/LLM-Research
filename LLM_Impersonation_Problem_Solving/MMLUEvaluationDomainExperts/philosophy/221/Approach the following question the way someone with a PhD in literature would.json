    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with expertise in literature, I would approach this question with a nuanced understanding of Tolstoy's life and work. Tolstoy's crisis of meaning, also known as his spiritual crisis, marked a significant turning point in his life and writing. After experiencing deep existential despair and questioning the purpose of life, Tolstoy underwent a profound spiritual transformation. This crisis led him to reject his previously held beliefs and embrace a newfound sense of religious faith.\n\nTolstoy's newfound religious beliefs influenced not only his personal life but also his literary output. He began to explore themes of morality, ethics, and spirituality in his later works, such as \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina.\" This shift in perspective also led Tolstoy to advocate for social and political change, ultimately influencing his later writings on nonviolent resistance and social justice.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to this question would be: C) He became religious.",
