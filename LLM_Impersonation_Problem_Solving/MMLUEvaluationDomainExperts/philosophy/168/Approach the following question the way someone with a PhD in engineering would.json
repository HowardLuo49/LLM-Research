In the context of decision-making, deliberative justification may not fully account for the moral dimension of choices. Once moral requirements are acknowledged, they take precedence over purely rational justifications, and therefore deliberative justification is replaced by the recognition of moral considerations. This suggests that moral requirements should inform and guide our decision-making process, rather than being dismissed or ignored in favor of purely rational justifications.",
