    "gpt_response": "According to Gauthier, deliberative justification is a concept in moral philosophy that pertains to the justification of decisions based on reasons and rationality. In the context of moral decision-making, deliberative justification involves reasoning and reflecting on our actions to ensure they align with moral requirements and principles.\n\nGauthier argues that deliberative justification is not refuted by moral requirements, but rather complemented by them. In fact, once we acknowledge moral requirements, our deliberative justification becomes more robust and helps us make ethically sound decisions. Therefore, option B is the most accurate interpretation of Gauthier's viewpoint on the relationship between deliberative justification and moral requirements.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Gauthier does not suggest that deliberative justification refutes morality or replaces it. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of incorporating moral considerations into our deliberative reasoning process. Therefore, options A, C, and D are not reflective of Gauthier's perspective on this issue.",
