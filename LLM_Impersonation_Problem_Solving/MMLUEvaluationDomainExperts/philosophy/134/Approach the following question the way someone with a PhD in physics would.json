Principled relativism involves the belief that moral truths are relative to specific principles or frameworks that guide ethical decision-making, rather than being determined by the specific situation at hand. This represents a conflicting viewpoint with situation ethics, which emphasizes the importance of context in determining the morality of actions. \n\nTherefore, as a physicist with a PhD, I would argue that option B: Principled relativism is not associated with the stance of situation ethics.",
