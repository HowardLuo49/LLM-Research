    "gpt_response": "In response to Craig's argument, a PhD in computer science would likely assert that based on the impossibility of traversing an actually infinite series of events in finite time, it can be concluded that the universe is finite in the past and began to exist. This aligns with the notion that a universe with a beginning is more logically sound than one with an infinite past. Therefore, the answer would be A: the universe is finite in the past and began to exist.",
