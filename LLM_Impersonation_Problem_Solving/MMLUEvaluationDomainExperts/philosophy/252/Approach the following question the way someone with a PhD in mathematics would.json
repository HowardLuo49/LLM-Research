In mathematics, an actual infinite set is a set that has an infinite number of elements. \n\nCraig's argument against the actual infinite in the context of the series of events in time is based on the notion that an actual infinite cannot exist in the physical world. This argument stems from mathematical and philosophical principles that suggest that an actual infinite set would lead to logical contradictions and paradoxes. \n\nGiven this reasoning, Craig is asserting that the series of events in time cannot be actually infinite because it would lead to these same logical contradictions. Therefore, according to Craig, we can conclude that the universe is finite in the past and began to exist. This aligns with option A: the universe is finite in the past and began to exist.",
