    "gpt_response": "Hume, a prominent figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, offers a nuanced understanding of virtue, positing it as more than simply a means to maximize happiness or pursue justice. In his treatise on ethics, Hume defines virtue as that which elicits a sentiment of approbation in a spectator. This suggests that virtue is subjective and contingent upon the perceptions and judgments of individuals within a given social context. While the pursuit of justice and the promotion of happiness may indeed be intertwined with virtuous actions, Hume's conception of virtue transcends these traditional notions by emphasizing the role of moral sentiment in evaluating ethical conduct. Ultimately, Hume's definition underscores the complexity and relational nature of virtue, providing a valuable framework for examining the moral landscape from a philosophical perspective.",
