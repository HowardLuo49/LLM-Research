Therefore, a PhD in computer science might not prioritize this definition as the correct answer.\n\nInstead, they might lean towards option D: \"whatever mental action or quality brings about the best consequences for all.\" This definition aligns more closely with a utilitarian or consequentialist approach, which could be seen as a more logical and systematic interpretation of virtue from a computer science perspective. It focuses on the outcome and impact of virtuous actions, which can be quantified and measured, making it more appealing to someone with a background in computer science.",
