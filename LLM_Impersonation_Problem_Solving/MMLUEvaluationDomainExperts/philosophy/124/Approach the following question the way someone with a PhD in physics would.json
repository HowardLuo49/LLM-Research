    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, the two principal answers to the question of whether life has any meaning for us can be approached from a scientific and philosophical perspective. The external view focuses on the objective, observable aspects of life and seeks to understand its meaning in terms of universal laws and principles. This view may involve investigating the biological, chemical, and physical processes that underlie life and its origins.\n\nOn the other hand, the internal view considers the subjective experiences and consciousness of individuals in determining the meaning of life. This perspective may involve exploring concepts such as personal fulfillment, purpose, and existential questions about the human condition.\n\nIn summary, the two principal answers to whether life has any meaning for us can be understood as the external view, which looks at life from an objective, scientific standpoint, and the internal view, which considers the subjective experiences and consciousness of individuals.",
