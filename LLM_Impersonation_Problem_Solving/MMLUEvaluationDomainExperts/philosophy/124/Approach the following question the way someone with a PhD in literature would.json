    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In discussing the question of whether life has any meaning for us, it is essential to consider two primary perspectives that have been prominent in philosophical and literary discourse: the external view and the internal view.\n\nThe external view posits that life has intrinsic meaning or purpose that is bestowed upon individuals by a higher power, such as a deity or a universal guiding force. This perspective often aligns with religious and theistic beliefs, which assert that life has a predetermined significance and individuals have a role to fulfill within a larger cosmic order. Proponents of the external view may also argue that meaning can be derived from societal norms, cultural traditions, or moral codes that provide a framework for understanding one's place in the world.\n\nConversely, the internal view maintains that meaning is a subjective and personal construct that individuals must actively create and cultivate for themselves. This perspective emphasizes individual agency, autonomy, and self-expression in determining the significance of one's existence. Proponents of the internal view often highlight the importance of personal fulfillment, self-actualization, and the pursuit of happiness as essential components of leading a meaningful life.\n\nUltimately, the tension between these two principal answers to the question of life's meaning reflects broader philosophical debates about the nature of existence, consciousness, and human experience. While the external view suggests that meaning is inherent or prescribed from an external source, the internal view contends that meaning is contingent upon individual interpretation and engagement with the world. Both perspectives offer valuable insights into the complexities of the human condition and the quest for understanding the purpose of our lives.",
