    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach the notion of \"meaning in life\" from a more empirical and rational perspective. The notion of \"meaning in life\" generally refers to the subjective sense of purpose, significance, and fulfillment that individuals experience in their lives. This concept can be classified into two main categories: internal meaning, which is derived from personal values, goals, relationships, and accomplishments, and external meaning, which may refer to factors outside of oneself such as societal contributions, impact on the world, or adherence to cultural or religious beliefs.\n\nWhile some individuals may find \"meaning in life\" through religious beliefs or a belief in an afterlife (option D: meaning in an afterlife), others may derive meaning from personal aspirations, relationships, or the pursuit of knowledge and creativity. It is important to note that the notion of \"meaning in life\" is subjective and can vary greatly among individuals based on their unique experiences, values, and beliefs. Therefore, as a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by recognizing the multifaceted nature of the concept of \"meaning in life\" and the importance of understanding and respecting individual differences in how people derive meaning and purpose in their lives.",
