    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach the notion of \"meaning in life\" from a philosophical perspective. In this context, \"meaning in life\" refers to the overarching purpose or significance that individuals attribute to their existence and experiences. It encompasses the subjective sense of fulfillment, coherence, and value that individuals perceive in their lives. This notion is often explored in existential philosophy and psychology, where questions about the meaning of life and the human experience are central themes of inquiry. As such, options A, B, and D may be viewed through a philosophical lens, with external meaning potentially referring to societal or cultural constructs, god's plan to religious or spiritual beliefs, and meaning in an afterlife to questions about existence beyond the physical realm. On the other hand, internal meaning emphasizes the personal and individual aspects of finding purpose and fulfillment in life based on one's values, beliefs, and experiences.",
