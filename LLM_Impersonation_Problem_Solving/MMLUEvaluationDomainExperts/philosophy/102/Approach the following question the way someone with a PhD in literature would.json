    "gpt_response": "Hare's assertion that ethics and science share similarities in seeking to provide us with true beliefs about the world can be viewed through a lens of epistemological inquiry. Both disciplines engage in critical analysis and investigation in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of underlying truths or principles. Additionally, Hare's suggestion that ethics and science are essential components of a worthwhile life speaks to the value and importance of both fields in shaping our perspectives and guiding our actions. Furthermore, the idea that both ethics and science involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences highlights the rigorous and systematic methodologies employed in each discipline. In considering these points collectively, it can be argued that all of the above options are valid interpretations of Hare's assertion regarding the similarities between ethics and science.",
