    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first understanding the definitions and principles of ethics and science. Ethics deals with moral principles and values that govern individuals' behavior, while science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the natural world.\n\nIn considering the assertion made by Hare, it is important to recognize that both ethics and science seek to provide us with understanding and knowledge about the world. In ethics, individuals seek to understand what is right or wrong, good or bad, based on moral principles and values. Similarly, in science, researchers strive to uncover and understand the truth about how the natural world works through observation, experimentation, and analysis.\n\nFurthermore, both ethics and science involve the rigorous testing and examination of principles. In science, hypotheses and theories are subject to testing through experimentation and observation to determine their validity and accuracy. Similarly, in ethics, moral principles and values are examined through the logical consequences of actions to determine their ethical implications.\n\nTherefore, as a scholar in engineering, I would agree with the assertion that ethics and science are similar in that they both seek to provide us with true beliefs about the world, involve testing general principles through logical consequences, and are essential components of a worthwhile life. Thus, the correct answer would be D: all of the above.",
