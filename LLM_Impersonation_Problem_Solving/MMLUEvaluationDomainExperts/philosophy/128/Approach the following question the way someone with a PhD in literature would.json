In his seminal work \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill argues that pleasures differ not just quantitatively but also qualitatively. When faced with the claim that utilitarianism reduces all pleasures to mere animalistic pursuits, Mill contends that pleasures vary in their quality, encompassing intellectual, aesthetic, and moral dimensions. These higher pleasures, according to Mill, are inherently superior to base physical pleasures and are characteristic of human nature and dignity. Thus, Mill's response emphasizes the nuanced distinctions in the types of pleasures and contends that utilitarianism, when properly understood and applied, promotes the cultivation of higher, more refined pleasures that are distinct from mere sensual gratification.
