Moore argues that goodness is a non-natural property that we apprehend through a special intellectual faculty, separate from our senses or emotions. This intrinsic value is what makes something good, regardless of whether it brings pleasure or satisfies our desires. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is C: intrinsic value.",
