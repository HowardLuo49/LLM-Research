    "gpt_response": "According to Moore's ethical theory, the concept of \"good\" cannot be equated with pleasure or things that we desire, as those are subjective and contingent upon individual perspectives. Instead, Moore argues that goodness is a non-natural property that is separate from any physical or psychological attributes. This intrinsic value of goodness is distinct from pleasure or desire, and thus, according to Moore, we are thinking about good whenever we consider this independent and fundamental quality. Therefore, the correct answer is C: intrinsic value.",
