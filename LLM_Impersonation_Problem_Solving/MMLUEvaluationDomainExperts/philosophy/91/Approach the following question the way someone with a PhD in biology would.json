    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would.  According to Socrates, the task of the wise and virtuous person is not simply to learn various examples of just or virtuous actions but to learn the essence of justice or virtue, because:\nA: by knowing enough examples of justice or virtue, we will live a worthwhile life even if we do not know what makes them examples of justice or virtue.\nB: knowledge of individual examples alone would not prepare someone for situations of justice or virtue to which the examples do not immediately apply.\nC: what makes an action just or virtuous can be known only by asking people for their opinions and respecting each answer as equally valuable.\nD: justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, even if people do not always agree on how to achieve those ends.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by considering the philosophical implications of Socrates' assertion. In this context, it is important to understand the underlying concept of justice and virtue as essential aspects of human behavior and societal interactions. Socrates' emphasis on the essence of justice or virtue suggests a deeper, more fundamental understanding beyond just knowledge of individual examples.\n\nOption B aligns with the idea that knowledge of individual examples alone may not adequately prepare individuals for various complex situations requiring the application of justice or virtue. This resonates with the notion that a true understanding of the underlying principles and essence of justice or virtue is necessary to navigate the complexities of moral decision-making.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that justice and virtue are universal goals for all human beings, as stated in option D, highlights the inherent importance of these concepts in guiding human behavior and interactions. This universal nature implies that a deeper understanding of the essence of justice or virtue is crucial for individuals to strive towards these virtuous goals.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in biology would likely support option B as the most plausible explanation of why the wise and virtuous person should seek to understand the essence of justice or virtue, according to Socrates' teachings.",
