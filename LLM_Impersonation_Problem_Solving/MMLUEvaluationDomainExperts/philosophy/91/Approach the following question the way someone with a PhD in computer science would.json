    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would.  According to Socrates, the task of the wise and virtuous person is not simply to learn various examples of just or virtuous actions but to learn the essence of justice or virtue, because:\nA: by knowing enough examples of justice or virtue, we will live a worthwhile life even if we do not know what makes them examples of justice or virtue.\nB: knowledge of individual examples alone would not prepare someone for situations of justice or virtue to which the examples do not immediately apply.\nC: what makes an action just or virtuous can be known only by asking people for their opinions and respecting each answer as equally valuable.\nD: justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, even if people do not always agree on how to achieve those ends.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer science PhD, I would approach this question from a logical and analytical perspective. Socrates is suggesting that it is not enough to simply memorize examples of just or virtuous actions, but rather one must understand the essence or underlying principles of justice and virtue. This is akin to learning the underlying algorithms or data structures in computer science, rather than just memorizing code snippets.\n\nOption A can be disregarded as it does not align with the idea of understanding the essence of justice or virtue. Option C can also be dismissed as it suggests a subjective approach to determining justice and virtue, which contradicts the idea of seeking universal truths.\n\nOption B aligns with Socrates' notion that knowledge of individual examples alone is not sufficient to handle all situations involving justice or virtue. Understanding the underlying principles allows one to apply that knowledge to various contexts. This aligns with the concept of generalization in computer science, where a deep understanding of fundamental concepts allows for more versatile problem-solving.\n\nOption D emphasizes the universal nature of justice and virtue, which supports the idea that seeking the essence of these concepts is important for all human beings. This aligns with the idea of universal principles in computer science, such as the concept of algorithms being applicable across different computing systems.\n\nTherefore, as a computer science PhD, I would argue that option B is the most aligned with Socrates' view on the importance of understanding the essence of justice or virtue.",
