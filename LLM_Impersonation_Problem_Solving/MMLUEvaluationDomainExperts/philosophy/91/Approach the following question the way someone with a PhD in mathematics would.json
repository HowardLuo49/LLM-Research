    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, it is important to approach this question by analyzing it in a logical and rigorous manner. According to Socrates, the task of the wise and virtuous person is not simply to learn various examples of just or virtuous actions but to learn the essence of justice or virtue. This implies a deeper understanding and knowledge beyond surface level examples.\n\nOption A suggests that by knowing enough examples of justice or virtue, one can live a worthwhile life even without knowing what makes them examples of justice or virtue. However, this contradicts the idea that understanding the essence of justice or virtue is crucial for wise and virtuous behavior.\n\nOption B aligns more closely with the idea that knowledge of individual examples alone would not prepare someone for situations of justice or virtue to which the examples do not immediately apply. This implies the need for a deeper understanding and essence of justice or virtue in order to apply them in various situations.\n\nOption C suggests that what makes an action just or virtuous can only be known by asking people for their opinions and respecting each answer as equally valuable. This goes against the idea of seeking the essence of justice or virtue through deeper understanding and knowledge.\n\nOption D states that justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, even if people may not always agree on how to achieve those ends. While this option acknowledges the universal nature of justice and virtue, it does not directly address the importance of understanding the essence of justice or virtue as suggested by Socrates.\n\nIn conclusion, as a mathematician with a PhD, the most appropriate answer would be option B, as it aligns with the idea that a deeper understanding of the essence of justice or virtue is necessary for wise and virtuous behavior.",
