However, Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, suggests that the virtuous man should feel undisturbed by such a tragedy.\n\nOne could argue that this perspective aligns with the concept of emotional regulation, which has been linked to better mental health and well-being. By remaining undisturbed in the face of adversity, the virtuous man may be better able to focus on his own personal growth and moral development.\n\nOverall, a biologist with a PhD would likely view the Stoic idea of remaining undisturbed in the face of loss as a potential strategy for managing emotions and maintaining psychological resilience in difficult situations.",
