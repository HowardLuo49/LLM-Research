Epictetus claims that if the wife and children of a virtuous man were to die, he should feel:\nA: righteous indignation.\nB: moderate grief.\nC: undisturbed.\nD: envy of those who still have their loved ones.",

    "gpt_response": "Epictetus, a prominent Stoic philosopher, posits that a virtuous individual should maintain a mindset of equanimity and rationality in the face of adversity, including the loss of loved ones. According to Stoic principles, one's inner tranquility and moral excellence should not be compromised by external events, such as the death of family members.\n\nTherefore, the response that aligns most closely with Epictetus' teachings would be option C: undisturbed. This suggests that a virtuous individual should strive to accept the natural course of events, recognizing that death is an inevitable part of human existence, and that one's ultimate well-being does not depend on external circumstances.\n\nIn contrast, options such as A (righteous indignation), B (moderate grief), and D (envy of those who still have their loved ones) are not consistent with Stoic philosophy, as they reflect emotional responses that are deemed excessive, irrational, or counterproductive in the pursuit of virtue and tranquility.",
