    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is important to consider the philosophical ideas of David Hume in relation to morality. Hume, a prominent figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, argued that morality is ultimately based on sympathy. In his work, Hume explores the concept that human beings are naturally inclined to feel empathy and compassion towards others, which forms the foundation of moral sentiment.\n\nHume posits that reason alone is insufficient to explain moral judgments, as emotions and sentiments play a crucial role in shaping our moral beliefs and actions. Furthermore, Hume rejects the idea that morality is derived from God's commands or social agreements, instead emphasizing the importance of human emotions and social relationships in understanding moral behavior.\n\nTherefore, according to Hume, morality is ultimately based on sympathy, as it is through our ability to feel compassion and empathy towards others that we are able to form moral principles and guide our actions. This perspective offers a nuanced and complex understanding of the nature of morality that is rich in philosophical depth and invites further exploration and analysis.",
