    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in computer science, I would analyze Hume's perspective on morality from a rational and analytical viewpoint. Hume, a prominent philosopher of the 18th century, argued that morality is ultimately based on sympathy. He believed that our moral judgments stem from our ability to empathize with others and feel a sense of fellow-feeling or sympathy towards them. This sentiment arises from our natural instincts and emotions rather than being dictated by reason, God's commands, or social agreements. Hume's theory emphasizes the role of human emotions and sentiments in shaping our moral beliefs and behaviors, rather than relying solely on rational or divine sources.",
