In his work \"A Treatise of Human Nature,\" Hume famously stated that \"reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.\" This means that moral beliefs and actions arise from our emotions and sentiments, rather than from rational thought alone.\n\nBased on Hume's perspective, the correct answer to the question would be option D: sympathy. Hume believed that our moral judgments are ultimately rooted in our capacity for empathy and sympathy towards others. He argued that we feel sentiments of approval or disapproval towards certain actions based on how they affect others, and these sentiments form the basis of morality.\n\nTherefore, from a Humean perspective, morality is ultimately based on sympathy, rather than reason, God's commands, or social agreements.",
