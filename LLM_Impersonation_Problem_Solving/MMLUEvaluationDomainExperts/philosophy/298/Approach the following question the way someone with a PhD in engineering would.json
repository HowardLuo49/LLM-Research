    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I understand the naturalistic fallacy as a philosophical concept that pertains to the relationship between nature and ethics. Moore defines the naturalistic fallacy as the view that goodness or value cannot be equated with any natural property or characteristic. Therefore, the correct answer is C: good is identical to a natural property. This reflects Moore's argument against the idea that people can derive moral judgments from natural properties or facts. Goodness, according to Moore, is a non-natural property that cannot be reduced to or defined by any natural characteristics.",
