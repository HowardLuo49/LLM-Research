    "gpt_response": "D: the result of a fair agreement or bargain\n\nFrom a perspective rooted in the principles of justice, a PhD in engineering would likely approach Rawls' concept of the veil of ignorance in terms of rational decision-making and impartiality. The idea behind the veil of ignorance is to make decisions about principles of justice without knowing one's own position in society, such as their social status, wealth, race, or gender. This allows individuals to make fair and unbiased decisions that uphold principles of justice. Rawls argues that behind the veil of ignorance, individuals would choose principles that are the result of a fair agreement or bargain, as this would ensure fair treatment for all members of society. Therefore, a PhD in engineering would likely see Rawls' principles of justice as the result of a fair agreement or bargain behind the veil of ignorance.",
