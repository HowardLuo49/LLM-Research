    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by considering the impact of stress and emotional responses on the body. Research in biological psychology has shown that when individuals experience anger, their bodies release stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can have negative effects on health if prolonged.\n\nIn the context of Epictetus' claim, it is possible to argue that the individual's own judgment plays a significant role in their emotional response to being struck. From a biological perspective, when someone perceives a physical or emotional threat, their brain processes this information and activates the body's stress response. This response, in turn, may be influenced by the individual's interpretation of the situation and their beliefs about themselves and others.\n\nTherefore, it can be suggested that Epictetus' assertion that what truly angers an individual when they are struck is their own judgment may have a basis in biological processes related to stress and emotional regulation. By recognizing and challenging their own negative thoughts and beliefs about the situation, individuals may be able to better manage their emotional responses and reduce the negative impact of anger on their health and well-being.",
