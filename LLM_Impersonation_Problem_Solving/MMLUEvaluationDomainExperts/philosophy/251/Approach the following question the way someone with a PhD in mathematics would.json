    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question from a mathematical perspective, one must consider the underlying principles of Epictetus' Stoic philosophy. In Stoicism, the central tenet is the belief that one's emotions are caused by their own thoughts and judgments, rather than external events themselves. Therefore, when someone strikes you, it is not the physical force of the blow or the malicious intentions behind it that truly anger you. Instead, it is your own judgment and interpretation of the situation that elicits the emotional response.\n\nIn mathematical terms, we can think of this as a cognitive appraisal process, where an individual evaluates the significance and meaning of a given event based on their internal beliefs and values. This process of assessment ultimately determines their emotional reaction, rather than the external circumstances alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to Epictetus' claim would be option C: your own judgment. It is the way in which you interpret and perceive the situation that leads to feelings of anger or resentment, rather than the external factors themselves. This perspective aligns with the Stoic notion that one has control over their own thoughts and can choose how to respond to external events with rationality and equanimity.",
