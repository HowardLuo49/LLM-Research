    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. Epictetus claims that when someone strikes you, what really angers you is:\nA: the force of the blow.\nB: their malicious intentions.\nC: your own judgment.\nD: the insult involved.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar in engineering, it is important to consider the question of anger and its underlying causes from a rational and logical perspective. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, posits that it is not the external event of being struck that incites anger, but rather one's own internal judgment and interpretation of the event. This principle aligns with the Stoic belief in the power of self-control and mastery over one's emotions.\n\nFrom an engineering standpoint, we can analyze this concept through the lens of control systems theory. In this framework, the external event of being struck can be viewed as the input to the system, while one's internal judgment serves as the feedback mechanism that determines the system's response. In this case, the feedback loop of judgment plays a critical role in shaping the individual's emotional reaction to the external stimulus.\n\nTherefore, based on Epictetus' teachings and the analysis from an engineering perspective, the answer to the question would be: C) your own judgment. It is one's interpretation and evaluation of the situation that ultimately determines their emotional response, rather than the external factors such as the force of the blow, malicious intentions, or the insult involved.",
