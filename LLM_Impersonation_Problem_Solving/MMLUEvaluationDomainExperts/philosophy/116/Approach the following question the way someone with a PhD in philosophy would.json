Augustine, in his work \"Against the Academicians,\" engages with the arguments put forth by the Academic skeptics, who challenge the possibility of attaining certain knowledge.\n\nAugustine ultimately rejects the claims of the Academic skeptics, arguing that true knowledge can indeed be attained through a higher form of certainty provided by divine illumination. He contends that while human reasoning alone may be subject to doubt and uncertainty, divine truth transcends these limitations and offers a more secure foundation for knowledge.\n\nTherefore, based on Augustine's perspective, I would argue that option D: \"is false and can be refuted,\" is the most appropriate response. Augustine believes that Academic skepticism is ultimately false and can be effectively countered through his own philosophical framework that emphasizes the role of divine illumination in the search for truth.",
