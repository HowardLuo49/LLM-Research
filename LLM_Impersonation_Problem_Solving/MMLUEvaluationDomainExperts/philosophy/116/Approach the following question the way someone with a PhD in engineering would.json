    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach Augustine's claim regarding Academic skepticism from a rational and analytical perspective. Academic skepticism, as posited by philosophers such as Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus, is the philosophical position that argues for the suspension of judgment in order to achieve peace of mind and tranquility.\n\nIn terms of Augustine's claim, it is important to note that Academic skepticism challenges the certainty of knowledge claims and emphasizes the limitations of human cognition. From an engineering perspective, we can analyze the validity of Augustine's claim by considering the nature of skepticism and the realm of provability in philosophical discourse.\n\nAs an engineer, I would argue that Academic skepticism, by its very nature, cannot be proven or disproven definitively. The skepticism inherent in this philosophical position prevents one from making absolute claims about the truth or falsity of knowledge. It is based on the recognition of the fallibility of human reason and the limitations of empirical evidence.\n\nTherefore, I would align with option B: Academic skepticism is true, but cannot be proven. This position acknowledges the rational basis of skepticism while also recognizing its inherent limitations in terms of definitive proof. This interpretation is in line with the fundamental principles of critical thinking and epistemological humility that underpin Academic skepticism.",
