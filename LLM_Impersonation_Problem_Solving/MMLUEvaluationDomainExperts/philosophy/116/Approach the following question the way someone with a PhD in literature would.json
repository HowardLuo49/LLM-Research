Augustine was a prominent Christian theologian and philosopher who engaged with various philosophical schools of thought, including skepticism.\n\nIn considering Augustine's views on Academic skepticism, we must first understand that Academic skepticism is a philosophical position that doubts the possibility of knowledge and truth. In this context, Augustine's stance on Academic skepticism is crucial in understanding his philosophical framework.\n\nAugustine's writings suggest that he was critical of Academic skepticism, particularly because of the skepticism's denial of certainty and truth. Augustine's Christian beliefs emphasized the importance of faith, divine knowledge, and the existence of absolute truth. Therefore, it is likely that Augustine would argue against the truth claims of Academic skepticism.\n\nGiven Augustine's philosophical and theological convictions, it is reasonable to conclude that he would support option D: Academic skepticism is false and can be refuted. Augustine would likely argue that skepticism's denial of truth and certainty is fundamentally flawed, particularly when viewed within the context of divine revelation and faith.\n\nIn summary, Augustine's perspective on Academic skepticism would align with option D, as he would likely contend that Academic skepticism is false and can be refuted based on his broader philosophical and theological framework.",
