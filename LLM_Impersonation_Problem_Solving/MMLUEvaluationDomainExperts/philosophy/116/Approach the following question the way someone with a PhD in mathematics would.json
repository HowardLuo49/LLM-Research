Academic skepticism is a philosophical position that asserts that we cannot have knowledge of the external world beyond our own senses and perceptions. This position is inherently skeptical and casts doubt on the possibility of absolute knowledge.\n\nIn terms of Augustine's claim, we must first analyze the nature of Academic skepticism. Since Academic skepticism posits that absolute knowledge is impossible, it would be contradictory to claim that it can be proven true. Therefore, option A is not plausible.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of Academic skepticism does not lend itself to being proven false either, as it is a philosophical perspective rather than a factual statement. Therefore, option D is also not a valid response.\n\nOption B, which states that Academic skepticism is true but cannot be proven, aligns more closely with the nature of skepticism. Since skepticism inherently doubts the possibility of absolute knowledge, it would be reasonable to propose that it cannot be definitively proven.\n\nUltimately, as a PhD in mathematics, it would be most accurate to suggest that option B is the most appropriate response to Augustine's claim regarding Academic skepticism.",
