    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, it is important to approach this question from a logical and analytical perspective. Aquinas, a renowned theologian and philosopher, posits that the first efficient cause of everything is God. This belief is rooted in his philosophical arguments and theological reasoning, which emphasize the existence of a prime mover or first cause that is transcendent and outside the natural world.\n\nFrom a mathematical standpoint, one can consider Aquinas' assertion in terms of the concept of causality and the principle of sufficient reason. In mathematical terms, causality can be seen as a relationship between variables or events where one is the cause of affecting the other. The idea of a first efficient cause implies a starting point or origin from which all subsequent causes stem.\n\nIn the context of Aquinas' teachings, God is posited as the ultimate cause from which all other causes originate. This belief is not based on empirical evidence or scientific observation, but rather on philosophical and theological reasoning that seeks to explain the existence of the universe and the natural order of things.\n\nTherefore, as a mathematician with a PhD, one can approach Aquinas' assertion that the first efficient cause of everything is God with a critical and analytical mindset, considering the implications of such a belief within the framework of causality and logical reasoning.",
