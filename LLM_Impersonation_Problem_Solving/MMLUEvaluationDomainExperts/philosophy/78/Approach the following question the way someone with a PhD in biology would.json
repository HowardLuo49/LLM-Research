David Hume, a philosopher known for his empiricism, argued that moral sentiments, including those related to justice, are based on utility and usefulness to society.\n\nIn this context, justice is seen as having value because it contributes to the stability and functioning of society as a whole. From an evolutionary perspective, behaviors and traits that enhance societal cohesion and cooperation are selected for, as they increase the chances of survival and reproduction for individuals within that society.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be B: justice has value in part because it is useful to society. This aligns with Hume's perspective that moral principles, including those related to justice, are ultimately grounded in their utility and benefits to individuals and society as a whole.",
