    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question from a mathematical perspective, one would first consider the premise laid out by Hume regarding the concept of justice. Hume posits that justice derives its value from being useful to society. In mathematical terms, this could be seen as a utility function where the value of justice is directly proportional to the benefits it provides to society.\n\nGiven this perspective, option C is the most aligned with Hume's views as it states that justice has value solely because it is useful to society. Option B could also be considered as a valid interpretation, as it acknowledges that justice has value in part due to its utility to society.\n\nIn contrast, options A and D do not accurately reflect Hume's stance on the value of justice. Option A implies that justice has no inherent value, which contradicts Hume's belief that its value stems from its utility. Option D suggests that justice's value is solely derived from its usefulness to the agent, which does not align with Hume's societal-centric view of justice.\n\nIn summary, a mathematician with a PhD would likely choose option C as the most appropriate answer based on Hume's beliefs about the value of justice.",
