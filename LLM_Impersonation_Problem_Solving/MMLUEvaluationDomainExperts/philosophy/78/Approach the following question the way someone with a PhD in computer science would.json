    "gpt_response": "A PhD in computer science would likely approach this question by comparing and contrasting Hume's views on justice with other philosophical perspectives. In this case, Hume's views on justice would be analyzed in the context of his larger philosophical framework, including his considerations on ethics, human nature, and the role of reason and sentiment in moral decision-making.\n\nHume's position on justice is often characterized by his emphasis on the role of utility and societal benefit. He argues that justice is valuable because it is useful to society as a whole, promoting stability, cooperation, and the protection of individual rights. This aligns with option C, which suggests that justice has value solely because it is useful to society.\n\nIn contrast, other philosophical perspectives may prioritize different reasons for valuing justice. For example, a deontological approach might argue that justice has intrinsic value, independent of its consequences or utility. A consequentialist perspective, on the other hand, might evaluate the value of justice based on its individual or societal outcomes.\n\nOverall, a PhD in computer science would likely engage with Hume's arguments on justice in a nuanced and critical manner, considering the complexities of his views in relation to broader ethical theories and debates.",
