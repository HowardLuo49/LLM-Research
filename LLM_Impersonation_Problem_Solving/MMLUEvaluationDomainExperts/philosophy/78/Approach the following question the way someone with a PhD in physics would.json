    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I would approach this question by analyzing Hume's philosophical views on justice through the lens of empirical evidence and logical reasoning. Hume, a renowned 18th-century Scottish philosopher, posited that justice is a human construct that derives its value from its utility to society.\n\nHume argued that justice promotes social order, stability, and cooperation, which are necessary for the flourishing of society. Therefore, according to Hume, justice has value because it serves a practical purpose in maintaining social harmony and benefiting the well-being of individuals within a community.\n\nIn this context, the answer that aligns most closely with Hume's perspective on justice would be:\n\nB: has value in part because it is useful to society.",
