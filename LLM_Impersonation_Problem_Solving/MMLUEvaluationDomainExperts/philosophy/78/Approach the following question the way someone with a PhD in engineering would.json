    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a philosophical perspective by considering the views of David Hume, a prominent philosopher in the 18th century. Hume's ethical theory is based on the idea that moral judgments are rooted in sentiment and emotional responses rather than reason. \n\nIn regards to the concept of justice, Hume believed that it is not inherently valuable in and of itself. Instead, he argued that justice is valuable because it is useful to society. This view aligns with option B, which states that justice has value in part because it is useful to society. From an engineering perspective, Hume's reasoning could be understood as the societal benefits that come from a just system, such as stability, order, and cooperation, which ultimately contribute to the overall well-being and functionality of society. Therefore, the correct answer would be B: justice has value in part because it is useful to society.",
