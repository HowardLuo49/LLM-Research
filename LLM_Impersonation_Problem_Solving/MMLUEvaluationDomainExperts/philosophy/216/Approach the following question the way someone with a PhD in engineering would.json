    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first examining Augustine's philosophical and ethical framework. Augustine, a prominent Christian theologian and philosopher, argued that lying is inherently evil because it goes against the principles of truth and honesty, which are fundamental to moral behavior. In Augustine's view, lying is a sin that damages the social fabric and undermines trust among individuals.\n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer would be D: never permissible. Augustine's perspective on lying aligns with a strict adherence to moral principles and a rejection of situational ethics that may justify deceit for perceived positive outcomes. Engaging in dishonesty, according to Augustine, is always morally wrong and should be avoided under any circumstances.",
