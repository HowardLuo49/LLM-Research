    "gpt_response": "In considering Stevenson's philosophical perspective on the word \"good,\" it is essential to first understand his theory of emotivism. Stevenson posits that ethical statements are not expressions of objective facts or properties, but rather expressions of emotion or attitudes. In this framework, the word \"good\" carries a distinct emotive meaning that is more suited for influencing the attitudes or emotions of others rather than making descriptive or factual claims about the world.\n\nAs such, based on Stevenson's theory, the correct answer to the question would be B: constructive use. The emotive meaning of \"good\" is intended to construct or shape the attitudes or emotions of individuals, rather than simply describe or make statements about the world. This aligns with Stevenson's broader philosophy of moral language as expressions of personal feeling and influence rather than objective truths.",
