Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative states that in order to determine the moral permissibility of an action, one must consider whether the maxim of that action can be consistently willed as a universal law. This means that the action must be able to be applied universally to all similar situations without contradiction. Therefore, the correct answer is C: a universal law.",
