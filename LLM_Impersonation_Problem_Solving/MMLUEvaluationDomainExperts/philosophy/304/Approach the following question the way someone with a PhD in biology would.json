Kant's categorical imperative states that an action is morally permissible if we can consistently will that the maxim of our action should become a universal law that applies to all rational agents. This concept aligns with principles of ethical consistency and universality, which are crucial in scientific research and biological studies. Therefore, the correct answer is C: a universal law.",
