Bentham, a prominent philosopher and founder of utilitarianism, argues that actions are right or wrong based on their outcomes, specifically in terms of maximizing overall happiness or pleasure and minimizing overall suffering or pain. This aligns with option B, which states that actions are right or wrong in virtue of their consequences. Therefore, I would argue that Bentham's perspective on ethics fits within the consequentialist framework, and the correct answer to the question is B: their consequences.",
