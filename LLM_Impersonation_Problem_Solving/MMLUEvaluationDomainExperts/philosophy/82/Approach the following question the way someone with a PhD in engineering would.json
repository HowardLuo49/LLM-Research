Utilitarianism, as developed by philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham, asserts that the moral worth of actions is determined by their consequences. In other words, the rightness or wrongness of an action is judged based on the overall utility it produces, with the goal of maximizing the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n\nTherefore, in response to the question posed, Bentham would argue that actions are right or wrong in virtue of their consequences (option B). While the motives behind an action may be important in some ethical frameworks, such as deontological ethics, utilitarianism focuses on the outcomes of actions as the primary determinant of their moral value. Thus, option C (both a and b) would also be a valid interpretation, as motives can certainly influence consequences. Option D (neither a nor b) would not align with Bentham's utilitarian perspective, as it emphasizes the importance of considering the effects of actions on overall happiness or well-being.",
