    "gpt_response": "In her seminal work \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Elizabeth Anscombe critiques Immanuel Kant's concept of legislating for oneself as fundamentally absurd. She argues that Kant's emphasis on individuals being able to establish moral principles for themselves, independent of external influences, is inherently flawed due to its lack of grounding in concrete, empirical reality. Anscombe contends that moral principles must be rooted in a coherent metaphysical framework that accounts for the complexities of human nature and the surrounding world. By questioning the validity of Kant's notion of self-legislation, Anscombe challenges the very foundation of Kantian ethics and advocates for a more nuanced and contextually grounded approach to moral philosophy.",
