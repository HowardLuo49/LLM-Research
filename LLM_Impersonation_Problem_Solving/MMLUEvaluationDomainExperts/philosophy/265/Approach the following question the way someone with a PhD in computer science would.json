    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Anscombe criticizes as absurd Kant\u2019s idea of legislating for oneself. This critique stems from her overarching criticism of Kantian ethics and the role of obligation in moral decision-making. Kant asserts that individuals must act according to a sense of duty and moral law, which involves rational beings legislating for themselves in a universal and categorical manner. Anscombe contends that this notion of autonomous self-legislation is incoherent and fails to provide a solid foundation for ethics. She argues that morality should be rooted in embodied virtues and dependent on particular contexts rather than universal rules. In summary, Anscombe's critique of Kant's idea of legislating for oneself reflects her broader rejection of deontological ethics and her advocacy for a more virtue-centered approach to moral philosophy.",
