Anscombe, a renowned philosopher, is known for her sharp criticism of various philosophical ideas.\n\nIn this case, Kant's concept of \"the thing in itself\" refers to the noumenon, which is the object as it is in itself, independent of our perceptions. It is argued by Anscombe that this concept is absurd because it is impossible for us to know anything about objects independent of our perceptions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be:\nA: the thing in itself.",
