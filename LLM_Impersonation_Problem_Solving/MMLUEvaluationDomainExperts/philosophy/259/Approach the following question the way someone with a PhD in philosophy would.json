Prudence, according to Aquinas, is one of the cardinal virtues and involves the ability to discern the right course of action in any given situation in order to achieve the ultimate good. While pleasure and desire may play a role in the decision-making process, the ultimate focus of prudence is on what is morally virtuous and aligns with the objective moral order established by God. Piety, on the other hand, pertains more to one's religious devotion and reverence towards higher powers, and is not synonymous with the concept of prudence as understood within Aquinas's framework.",
