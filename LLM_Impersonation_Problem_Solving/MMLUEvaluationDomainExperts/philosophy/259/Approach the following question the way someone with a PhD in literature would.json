    "gpt_response": "In Aquinas's view, acts of prudence are primarily concerned with matters of moral virtue. Prudence, in the context of Aquinas's ethics, is the virtue that enables an individual to make sound judgments about what is right or good in a particular situation, and then to act accordingly. It involves practical reasoning guided by moral considerations, such as the pursuit of the cardinal virtues of justice, temperance, and courage. This stands in contrast to actions driven solely by pleasure or desire, which may be morally neutral or ethically questionable. Additionally, while piety may play a role in informing one's moral decisions, it is not the central focus of prudence as understood by Aquinas.",
