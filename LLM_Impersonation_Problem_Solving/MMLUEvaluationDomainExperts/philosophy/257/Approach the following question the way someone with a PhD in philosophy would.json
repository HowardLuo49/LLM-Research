    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. In spite of the fact that Socrates claims to be ignorant of the essence or nature of certain things like justice, he is wise insofar as he recognizes that without such knowledge actions are rationally unjustified.  That is, his wisdom consists in his recognition not only that he is ignorant of such essences but also that:\nA: justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.\nB: he knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.\nC: knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\nD: his method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "From a philosophical standpoint, Socrates' acknowledgment of his ignorance regarding the essence of certain things, such as justice, is a crucial aspect of his wisdom. This admission of ignorance is not a mere confession of lack of knowledge, but rather a recognition of the limits of human understanding. Socrates understands that without a clear understanding of the essence of something like justice, our actions are essentially unjustified.\n\nIn this context, option C is the most pertinent to Socrates' philosophical perspective. Socrates would argue that knowledge of the essences of things is impossible because it would require us to know what we are looking for before we even know what it is that we are seeking. This aligns with Socratic dialectic, in which the pursuit of truth involves a continual process of questioning and seeking, rather than a definite endpoint of knowledge.\n\nTherefore, Socrates' wisdom lies in his acceptance of his own ignorance and his commitment to the pursuit of truth through questioning and dialogue. This approach challenges traditional notions of knowledge and understanding, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and self-examination in the quest for wisdom.",
