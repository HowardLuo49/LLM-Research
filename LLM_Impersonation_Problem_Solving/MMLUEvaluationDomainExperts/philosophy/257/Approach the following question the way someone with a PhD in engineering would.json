In spite of the fact that Socrates claims to be ignorant of the essence or nature of certain things like justice, he is wise insofar as he recognizes that without such knowledge actions are rationally unjustified.  That is, his wisdom consists in his recognition not only that he is ignorant of such essences but also that:\nA: justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.\nB: he knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.\nC: knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\nD: his method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.",

    "gpt_response": "A person with a PhD in engineering would approach this question by analyzing Socrates' philosophical stance and his approach to knowledge and wisdom. From an engineering perspective, the importance of recognizing one's limitations and the need for justification in actions would be emphasized.\n\nIn this context, the correct answer would be:\n\nB: he knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.\n\nThis answer acknowledges Socrates' understanding that in order to pursue knowledge or wisdom, one must have a clear understanding of what they are seeking. Socrates' wisdom lies in his recognition of this goal and his willingness to pursue it through questioning and dialogue, despite his acknowledgment of his own ignorance. This aligns with the logical and systematic approach to problem-solving that is characteristic of an individual with a PhD in engineering.",
