    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. In spite of the fact that Socrates claims to be ignorant of the essence or nature of certain things like justice, he is wise insofar as he recognizes that without such knowledge actions are rationally unjustified.  That is, his wisdom consists in his recognition not only that he is ignorant of such essences but also that:\nA: justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.\nB: he knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.\nC: knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\nD: his method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "A Ph.D. in literature would likely approach this question by examining the philosophical implications of Socrates' stance on knowledge and wisdom. They may discuss how Socrates' acknowledgment of his own ignorance serves as a starting point for his philosophical inquiries, as seen in his method of questioning and dialogue in pursuit of truth. The scholar may also explore the paradoxical nature of seeking knowledge of essences while admitting to ignorance, and how this tension reveals deeper insights into the nature of justice and wisdom. Ultimately, they may argue that Socrates' wisdom lies in his humility and commitment to the pursuit of truth, even in the face of inherent limitations in human understanding.",
