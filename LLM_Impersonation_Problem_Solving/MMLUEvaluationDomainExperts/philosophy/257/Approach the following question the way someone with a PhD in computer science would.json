    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. In spite of the fact that Socrates claims to be ignorant of the essence or nature of certain things like justice, he is wise insofar as he recognizes that without such knowledge actions are rationally unjustified.  That is, his wisdom consists in his recognition not only that he is ignorant of such essences but also that:\nA: justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.\nB: he knows what he is supposed to be looking for--knowledge of the essences of things.\nC: knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\nD: his method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.",

    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the logic and reasoning behind Socrates' views on ignorance and wisdom. Socrates' acknowledgment of his own ignorance regarding the essences of things like justice is a central tenet of his philosophy. He believes that true wisdom lies in recognizing the limits of one's knowledge and questioning one's own beliefs.\n\nIn this context, Socrates' wisdom can be seen as a form of intellectual humility, where he understands that true knowledge is elusive and that certainty is unattainable. His method of questioning and seeking knowledge, known as the Socratic method, is a way for him to engage in critical thinking and self-reflection.\n\nOption A suggests that justice, like knowledge, requires us to admit that we know nothing and never will. This aligns with Socrates' emphasis on humility and self-awareness in the pursuit of truth. Option B highlights that Socrates knows what he is supposed to be looking for\u2014an understanding of the essences of things, which guides his philosophical inquiries.\n\nOption C posits that knowledge of essences is impossible because it requires knowing what we are looking for before we know it, reflecting the complexity and paradoxical nature of seeking absolute truths. Finally, option D critiques Socrates' method of questioning as unjustified because he does not fully understand why he engages in this practice, raising questions about the validity and purpose of his philosophical pursuits.\n\nIn conclusion, a deep dive into Socrates' philosophy reveals the intricate interplay between ignorance and wisdom, certainty and doubt, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge despite its elusive nature. Through critical analysis and logical reasoning, someone with a PhD in computer science can appreciate the depth and complexity of Socrates' views on ignorance and wisdom.",
