    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. According to Socrates, a clear sign that a person has _____ is her exclusive pursuit of social status, wealth, power, and pleasure.\nA: philosophical ambition\nB: worldly wisdom\nC: exceptional desires\nD: an unhealthy soul",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Firstly, it is important to note that Socrates, being a prominent figure in Ancient Greek philosophy, often used dialogues to explore various topics related to ethics, morality, and the human soul. In this context, the phrase \"a clear sign that a person has _____\" suggests that Socrates is making a broad generalization about the nature of individuals based on certain characteristics or behaviors.\n\nSecondly, the mention of social status, wealth, power, and pleasure as the objects of exclusive pursuit provides insight into the values and priorities that Socrates believed were indicative of an unhealthy soul. By emphasizing the singular focus on material gains and external validation, Socrates highlights the potential dangers of placing too much importance on superficial markers of success.\n\nTherefore, when considering the options provided, it is evident that the most suitable choice in the context of Socrates' philosophy would be option D: an unhealthy soul. This aligns closely with Socrates' emphasis on the importance of intellectual and moral development, as well as his belief in the intrinsic connection between virtue and genuine happiness. Ultimately, Socrates would argue that true fulfillment and meaning in life can only be achieved through the cultivation of wisdom, self-awareness, and a commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and truth.",
