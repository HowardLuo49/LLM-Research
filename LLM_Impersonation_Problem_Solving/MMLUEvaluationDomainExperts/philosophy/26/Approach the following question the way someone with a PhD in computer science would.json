Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:\nA: would likewise be destroyed.\nB: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\nC: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\nD: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.",

    "gpt_response": "A PhD in computer science would likely approach this question from a more analytical and logical perspective, rather than delving deeply into philosophical theories like Aristotle's metaphysics. \n\nFrom a logical standpoint, the essence or form of a species can be seen as a conceptual abstraction that represents the essential characteristics or properties shared by all members of that species. If all members of a species were destroyed, then there would be no physical instantiation of that species in the world. \n\nGiven this understanding, the essence or form of the species would not exist apart from the individuals that make up the species. Therefore, if all members of a species were destroyed, the essence or form of that species would likewise be destroyed. \n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer to the question would be:\nA: would likewise be destroyed.",
