    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:\nA: would likewise be destroyed.\nB: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\nC: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\nD: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Aristotle's position on essence and form would lead him to choose option A: that if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form would likewise be destroyed. This is because Aristotle believed that essence is inextricably linked to individual beings in the world. In his view, essence is not something that exists separately in a realm of ideal Forms, as Plato suggested, but rather is immanent in the particular beings themselves. Therefore, if all the members of a species were to be destroyed, there would be nothing left to instantiate the essence or form of that species, and so it would cease to exist. This reflects Aristotle's rejection of the idea of universal essences existing independently of individual beings.",
