    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:\nA: would likewise be destroyed.\nB: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\nC: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\nD: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Aristotle's concept of essence, as discussed in his work \"Metaphysics,\" revolves around the idea that essence is not a separate, independent entity from the individuals that possess it. Instead, essence is inherent in the individual objects themselves. This aligns with Aristotle's rejection of Plato's theory of Forms, which posited the existence of universal, transcendent forms that defined the essence of all things.\n\nGiven this understanding, if all the members of a species were destroyed, then according to Aristotle, their essence or form would cease to exist. This aligns with option A: the essence would likewise be destroyed along with the individuals who possessed it. Option D, which suggests that there was no essence or form to begin with, goes against Aristotle's belief in the inherent essence of individual objects. Option C, which posits the existence of essence in some other realm, contradicts Aristotle's rejection of a separate realm of Forms.\n\nIn conclusion, from an Aristotelian perspective, the essence or form of a species is intimately tied to the existence of the individuals that embody it, and if those individuals were destroyed, their essence would cease to exist as well.",
