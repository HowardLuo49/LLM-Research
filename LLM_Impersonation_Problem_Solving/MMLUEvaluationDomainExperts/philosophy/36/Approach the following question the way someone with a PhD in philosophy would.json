    "gpt_response": "In accordance with Mill's utilitarian philosophy, the determination of whether one pleasure is more valuable than another necessitates a consideration of the quality or intensity of the pleasure itself. Mill asserts that higher pleasures, which involve higher faculties of the mind such as intellectual pursuits and moral reflection, are inherently more valuable than lower pleasures, which are of a more simple and physical nature. Therefore, to ascertain the comparative value of different pleasures, one must consider the level of intellectual stimulation or moral consideration involved in each experience. This entails a nuanced evaluation of the intrinsic qualities of the pleasures themselves, rather than relying on external factors such as the preferences of experienced individuals, past philosophers, or scientific measurements.",
