    "gpt_response": "A: determine which one is objectively most pleasurable\n\nA PhD in literature would approach this question by analyzing Mill's utilitarian philosophy and his views on pleasure. Mill believed that pleasures differ in quality, not just quantity, and that some pleasures are inherently more valuable or higher in quality than others. To determine which pleasure is more valuable, one must assess the objective quality of the pleasure rather than just the quantity. This aligns with Mill's idea of pursuing higher pleasures over lower pleasures based on their inherent quality. Therefore, according to Mill, to determine whether one pleasure is more valuable than another, one must determine which one is objectively most pleasurable.",
