According to Mill, to determine whether one pleasure is more valuable than another, we must _____.\nA: determine which one is objectively most pleasurable\nB: determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer\nC: consult philosophers of the past\nD: consult science",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "A: determine which one is objectively most pleasurable\n\nAs a PhD in biology, it is important to approach the question from a scientific perspective. In this case, John Stuart Mill's utilitarian philosophy suggests that the value of a pleasure can be determined by its quality rather than simply its quantity. This implies that an objective evaluation of the pleasurable experiences in question is necessary in order to ascertain which one is more valuable. Utilizing scientific methods to quantify and assess various aspects of pleasure, such as physiological markers or brain activity patterns, may aid in determining the objective quality of a particular pleasure. This approach aligns with Mill's emphasis on maximizing the overall happiness or pleasure in society, by prioritizing higher quality pleasures over lower quality ones.",
