    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I must clarify that the question presented references the philosophical work of Derek Parfit, rather than a concept within biological theory. Parfit's moral philosophy delves into questions surrounding ethical obligations and decision-making. In this context, the obligation to give priority to the welfare of one's children would likely fall under the category of agent-relative, as it pertains to the specific relationship and responsibilities that exist between a parent and their offspring. This obligation is not universal or impartial, but rather centered around the individual agent and their personal connections. Therefore, the correct answer would be A: agent-relative.",
