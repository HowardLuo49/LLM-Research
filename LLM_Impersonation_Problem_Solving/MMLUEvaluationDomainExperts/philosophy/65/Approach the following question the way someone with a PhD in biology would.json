    "gpt_response": "If I were to approach this question as someone with a PhD in biology, I would consider it from a philosophical and existential perspective rather than focusing solely on scientific principles. Sartre, a renowned existentialist philosopher, posited that if God does not exist, then moral values are not objectively determined by a higher power but instead are created and defined by individuals themselves. In this view, moral values would still exist, but they would be subjective and contingent upon human existence and agency. Therefore, the answer to the question would likely be C: moral values still exist.",
