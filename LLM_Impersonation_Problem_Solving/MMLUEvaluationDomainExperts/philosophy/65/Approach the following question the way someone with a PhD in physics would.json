    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, it is important to approach philosophical questions with an analytical and logical mindset. In regards to the statement made by Sartre, it is important to address the implications of a world without God in a rational manner.\n\nSartre famously stated that if God does not exist, everything is permissible. This statement can be interpreted in the sense that without a higher power to dictate moral values, individuals are free to act as they wish without any constraints. This does not necessarily mean that moral values do not exist in a godless world, but rather that individuals have the freedom to determine their own moral values.\n\nFrom a physics perspective, the concept of morality can be seen as a societal construct that has evolved over time. Without the need for a divine being to provide moral guidance, individuals have the autonomy to develop their own moral values based on reason, empathy, and societal norms.\n\nTherefore, according to Sartre, if God does not exist, moral values still exist, but individuals are responsible for creating and upholding these values in a godless world.",
