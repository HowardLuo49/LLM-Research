    "gpt_response": "As a scholar well-versed in the philosophy of existentialism, particularly the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, I would approach this question by examining the implications of Sartre's assertion that if God does not exist, everything is permissible. Sartre believed that in a godless universe, there is no inherent morality or objective standards of right and wrong. Instead, individuals are free to create their own values and define their own morals. This radical freedom, while empowering, also comes with great responsibility, as individuals must take ownership of their choices and the consequences that result from them. Therefore, according to Sartre, in the absence of a divine authority dictating moral values, individuals are solely responsible for determining their own ethical guidelines.",
