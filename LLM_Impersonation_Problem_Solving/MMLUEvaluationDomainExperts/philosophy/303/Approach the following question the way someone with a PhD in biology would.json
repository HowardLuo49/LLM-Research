This could be due to a variety of reasons such as better infrastructure, lower levels of corruption, or specific partnerships with organizations in these regions. \n\nBased on this, I would argue that option A: more effectively than we could get it to our close neighbors, is the most likely answer. However, it is important to consider that the effectiveness of aid delivery can vary depending on the specific organizations involved and the circumstances of the famine relief efforts. It is not a one-size-fits-all answer, and further research and analysis would be needed to fully evaluate the efficiency of directing aid to distant refugees compared to close neighbors.",
