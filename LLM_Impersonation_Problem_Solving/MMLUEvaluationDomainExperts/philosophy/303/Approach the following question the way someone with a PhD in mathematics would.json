They could potentially conduct a cost-benefit analysis or compare different distribution methods to assess the effectiveness of providing aid to distant refugees versus close neighbors.\n\nBased on their analysis, a mathematician might conclude that option A, B, C, or D is the most accurate representation of the efficiency of famine relief organizations in directing aid to different groups. This determination would be rooted in objective data and mathematical reasoning, reflecting the rigorous approach and analytical skills commonly associated with a PhD in mathematics.",
