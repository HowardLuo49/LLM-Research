    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is A: are interdependent. Rawls' theory of justice as fairness consists of two parts, the principles of justice and the concept of the original position. These two parts are intrinsically linked and mutually dependent on one another. One cannot fully accept and understand one part without also accepting the other, as they form a coherent and unified theory of justice. This interdependence is a key aspect of Rawls' overall philosophical framework and underscores the importance of considering both parts in tandem when evaluating his theory.",
