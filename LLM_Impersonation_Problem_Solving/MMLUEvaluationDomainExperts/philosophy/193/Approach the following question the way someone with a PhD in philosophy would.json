Mill claims that the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds perfectly to the distinction between:\nA: perfect and imperfect obligations.\nB: positive and negative duties.\nC: strong and weak duties.\nD: absolute and relative obligations.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In his seminal work \"Utilitarianism\", John Stuart Mill posits that the distinction between justice and other moral obligations is tantamount to the dichotomy of perfect and imperfect obligations. This notion underscores the idea that justice, as a concept rooted in principles of fairness and equality, necessitates stringent duties that are clear-cut and absolute in nature, thereby aligning with perfect obligations. Conversely, other moral obligations, which are more flexible and contingent on context and circumstance, can be classified as imperfect obligations. In essence, Mill's assertion emphasizes the foundational role of justice in the moral landscape, highlighting its unique and paramount status among moral imperatives.",
