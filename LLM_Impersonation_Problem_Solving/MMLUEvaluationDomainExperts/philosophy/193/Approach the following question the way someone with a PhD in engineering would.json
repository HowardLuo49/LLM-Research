Mill claims that the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds perfectly to the distinction between:\nA: perfect and imperfect obligations.\nB: positive and negative duties.\nC: strong and weak duties.\nD: absolute and relative obligations.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing the definitions and implications of each of the given pairs of distinctions. \nFirstly, the distinction between perfect and imperfect obligations relates to whether a duty must be fully fulfilled or can be partially fulfilled. Perfect obligations require complete fulfillment, while imperfect obligations allow for some discretion in how they are met. \nSecondly, the distinction between positive and negative duties involves the presence or absence of a specific action. Positive duties require specific actions to be taken, while negative duties involve refraining from certain actions. \nThirdly, the distinction between strong and weak duties refers to the strength or intensity of the obligation. Strong duties are considered more morally binding and carry greater weight, while weak duties are seen as less obligatory. \nLastly, the distinction between absolute and relative obligations pertains to whether the obligation always holds regardless of circumstances or is dependent on a particular context. Absolute obligations are universal and unconditional, while relative obligations are contingent on specific conditions. \nIn analyzing Mill's claim, it is evident that the distinction between justice and other moral obligations aligns most closely with the strong and weak duties. Justice encompasses a strong moral obligation that is held to a higher standard compared to other moral obligations, which may be considered weaker in nature. Therefore, the correct answer is C: strong and weak duties.",
