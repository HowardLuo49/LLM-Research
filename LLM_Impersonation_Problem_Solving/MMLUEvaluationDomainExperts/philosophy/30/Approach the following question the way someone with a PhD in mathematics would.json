    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first recognizing that Leo Tolstoy was a renowned Russian novelist and philosopher, not a mathematician. However, I can still analyze the question from a mathematical perspective.\n\nIn mathematics, art can be viewed as a form of expression through various mediums such as painting, sculpture, music, and literature. It can also be seen as a representation of ideas, emotions, and experiences in a symbolic or abstract way. Therefore, based on these definitions, I would argue that Tolstoy's statement aligns most closely with option A: expression. This is because art often serves as a means for individuals to convey their thoughts and feelings creatively, which resonates with Tolstoy's emphasis on the emotional and communicative aspects of art.",
