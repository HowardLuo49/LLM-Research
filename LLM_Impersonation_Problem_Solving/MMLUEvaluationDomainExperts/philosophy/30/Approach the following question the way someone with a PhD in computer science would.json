    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Based on Leo Tolstoy\u2019s perspective, as a computer scientist with a PhD, we can interpret art as a form of expression that conveys abstract ideas and emotions through various forms of representation. Tolstoy believed that art serves as a medium for artists to express their innermost thoughts and feelings, creating a unique form that can be interpreted and understood by others. By combining elements such as form, structure, and representation, art transforms intangible concepts into tangible creations that can be experienced and appreciated by individuals. Therefore, from a computational perspective, art can be seen as a complex system of symbolic communication that enables the sharing of ideas and emotions between artists and audiences.",
