Apart from the fact that it is \"not a nice thing to do\", what is an important ethical disadvantage of deceiving participants?\nA: It can damage the professional reputation of the researcher and their discipline.\nB: It makes it more difficult to gain access to deviant or hidden populations.\nC: It means that records of personal data about the participants cannot be made anonymous.\nD: None of the above.",

    "gpt_response": "The important ethical disadvantage of deceiving participants lies in the violation of the principle of autonomy and informed consent. By deceiving participants, researchers undermine the individuals' ability to make autonomous decisions about their participation in research. This compromises the fundamental ethical principle of respect for persons and can lead to potential harm to participants. Furthermore, it erodes the trust between researchers and participants, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of the research process and potentially damaging the reputation of the researcher and the field of study. Thus, the ethical implications of deceiving participants extend beyond mere niceties to foundational principles of research ethics.",
