As researchers, we have a responsibility to uphold high ethical standards in our work, and deceiving participants goes against the principles of honesty and transparency that are fundamental in the scientific community. If participants were to discover that they were deceived, it could not only harm the reputation of the individual researcher but also undermine the trust that the public has in the field of mathematics as a whole. This can lead to a loss of credibility and respect for the research findings and the discipline itself. Therefore, it is important for researchers to conduct their studies with the utmost ethics and integrity to maintain the trust and confidence of both their participants and the wider community.",
