    "gpt_response": "Epicurus conceives of death as C: the deprivation of all sensation.\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, we can analyze this concept by considering the nature of sensation and the absence of it upon death. Epicurus believed that death is merely the cessation of sensation, because when we die, our senses stop functioning and we are no longer aware of anything. Therefore, death is the deprivation of all sensation, according to Epicurus. This can be thought of as a mathematical limit, as our sensory experiences approach zero as we approach death.",
