Epicurus conceives of death as:\nA: the beginning of the afterlife.\nB: one component of the continuous cycle of rebirth.\nC: the deprivation of all sensation.\nD: the greatest harm that one can suffer.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher, conceptualizes death as the deprivation of sensation. He argues that death is the cessation of all conscious experience, and therefore cannot be experienced as a harm or a benefit. In his view, since death entails the absence of all feeling and perception, it is not something to be feared or dreaded. Instead, Epicurus encourages individuals to embrace a philosophy of ataraxia, or tranquility, by cultivating a state of mental equanimity and acceptance of their mortality. This perspective on death contrasts with the notion that it is the greatest harm that one can suffer, as Epicurus posits that it is simply the end of all conscious existence.",
