    "gpt_response": "Schopenhauer's attitude toward life can be best characterized as one of pessimism. He believed that life was inherently filled with suffering and that the world was ultimately meaningless. In his work \"The World as Will and Representation,\" Schopenhauer posited that the underlying force of the universe, the will, is perpetually striving and never fully satisfied. This perpetual striving leads to suffering and ultimately a lack of fulfillment in life. Therefore, Schopenhauer did not hold a hopeful or optimistic view of life, but rather one that acknowledged the inherent difficulties and suffering that come with existence.",
