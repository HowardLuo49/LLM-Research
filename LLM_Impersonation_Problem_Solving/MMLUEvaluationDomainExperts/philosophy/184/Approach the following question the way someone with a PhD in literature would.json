    "gpt_response": "Schopenhauer's attitude toward life can be best encapsulated by his belief that life is ultimately devoid of inherent meaning. In his philosophical work, particularly in his magnum opus \"The World as Will and Representation,\" Schopenhauer posits that human existence is marked by an inherent dissatisfaction, a constant striving and yearning that can never be fully satisfied. He viewed life as filled with suffering, fueled by the insatiable nature of human desires and the futility of trying to find lasting happiness in this world.\n\nSchopenhauer famously likened life to a constant state of pendulum swing between pain and boredom, with moments of fleeting pleasure serving as mere distractions from the underlying suffering that characterizes human existence. For Schopenhauer, the only escape from this cycle of suffering was through a renunciation of desires and a denial of the will to live, a concept he borrowed from Eastern philosophies such as Buddhism.\n\nIn conclusion, Schopenhauer's attitude toward life was one of pessimism, seeing it as a futile and ultimately meaningless pursuit. He believed that true fulfillment could only be found through a rejection of desires and a transcendence of the self, rather than in any form of worldly achievement or material success.",
