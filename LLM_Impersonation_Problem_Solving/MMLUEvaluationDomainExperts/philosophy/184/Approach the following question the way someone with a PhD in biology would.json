    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question with a focus on Schopenhauer's philosophical views on life and existence. Schopenhauer, a German philosopher in the 19th century, is known for his pessimistic view on life and his belief in the inherent suffering and futility of human existence.\n\nSchopenhauer believed that life was characterized by an inherent will to live, which resulted in endless suffering and dissatisfaction. He saw life as a constant struggle, full of pain and frustration, with fleeting moments of pleasure and happiness. This perspective led him to conclude that life was ultimately devoid of meaning and purpose.\n\nTherefore, based on Schopenhauer's philosophical writings and beliefs, the most accurate answer to the question would be C: He thought life was bereft of meaning.",
