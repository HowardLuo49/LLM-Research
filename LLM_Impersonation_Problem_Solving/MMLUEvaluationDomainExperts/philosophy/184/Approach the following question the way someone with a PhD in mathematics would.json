From my understanding, Schopenhauer's philosophy centered around the concept of the \"will to live\" as the driving force behind human actions and desires. He believed that life was characterized by suffering and ultimately devoid of inherent meaning, leading him to a pessimistic view of existence.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding of Schopenhauer's philosophy, I would argue that his attitude toward life could most accurately be described as:\n\nC: He thought life was bereft of meaning.",
