    "gpt_response": "To analyze this question from a mathematical perspective, we can consider the concept of moral code \"currency\" in a society as a binary variable. In this context, a moral code has currency in a society if it is widely adopted by the majority of adults in the society (option A) and/or if it is officially recognized as the moral code of the society (option B).\n\nMathematically, we can represent these conditions as follows:\n- Let A be the event that a high proportion of adults in the society subscribe to the moral code.\n- Let B be the event that the moral code is recognized as the official moral code of the society.\n\nAccording to Brandt's terminology, a moral code has currency in a society if either condition A or B is satisfied, which corresponds to option C (both A and B).\n\nThus, a moral code has currency in a society only if both a high proportion of the adults in the society subscribe to its principles and it is recognized as the moral code of the society.",
