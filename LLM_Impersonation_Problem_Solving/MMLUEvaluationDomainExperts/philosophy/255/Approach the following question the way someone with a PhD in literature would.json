In Brandt\u2019s terminology, a moral code has currency in a society only if:\nA: a high proportion of the adults in the society subscribe to its principles.\nB: it is recognized as the moral code of the society.\nC: both a and b.\nD: neither a nor b.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from the perspective of someone with a PhD in literature, it is important to first consider the theoretical framework presented by Brandt in his work. Brandt's concept of moral currency entails the idea that a moral code gains significance and influence within a society based on both the level of adherence to its principles by individuals (option A) and the recognition of the code as a prevailing standard within the societal context (option B).\n\nFrom a literary perspective, the notion of moral currency can be seen as analogous to the ways in which moral values and ethical frameworks are portrayed and explored within literary texts. In many works of literature, authors often examine the interplay between individual adherence to moral principles and the broader societal acceptance or rejection of certain moral codes. This dynamic is integral to character development, plot progression, and the thematic resonance of literary works.\n\nTherefore, in considering Brandt's concept in relation to literature, it becomes clear that both options A and B are essential for a moral code to have currency within a society. The moral code must not only be embraced by a significant portion of individuals within the society but also recognized and acknowledged as a guiding standard within the societal framework.\n\nUltimately, option C (both a and b) accurately reflects Brandt's perspective on the conditions necessary for a moral code to hold currency in a society. By recognizing the nuanced relationship between individual adherence and societal recognition of moral principles, we can gain deeper insights into the interconnected nature of ethics, literature, and societal dynamics.",
