    "gpt_response": "A: representational\n\nAs someone with a PhD in biology, I would approach this question from an art historical perspective. The Mona Lisa, created by Leonardo da Vinci in the early 16th century, is a representational piece of art. This means that it portrays recognizable objects or figures in a way that is intended to represent reality. In the case of the Mona Lisa, da Vinci's use of chiaroscuro, perspective, and attention to detail in depicting the human figure make it a prime example of representational art. The painting captures the subject's likeness and expression in a realistic manner, while also highlighting da Vinci's skill as an artist and anatomist.",
