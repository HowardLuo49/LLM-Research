    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the various interpretations and theories surrounding the nature of art and its representation. In the case of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the painting can be considered representational as it depicts a naturalistic representation of a human figure, specifically a woman. However, it is also important to consider that the Mona Lisa contains elements of ambiguity and mystery, leading some to interpret it as being obscure or abstract in its representation. Ultimately, the categorization of the Mona Lisa as either representational or abstract is subjective and open to debate within the realm of philosophical aesthetics.",
