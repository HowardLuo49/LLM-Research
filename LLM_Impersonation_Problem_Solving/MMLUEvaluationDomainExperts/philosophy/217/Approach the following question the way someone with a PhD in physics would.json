Whereas the social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, economics) ask questions about how people think and act, philosophy is the study of:\nA: how people with different beliefs or backgrounds disagree with one another.\nB: what beliefs mean and whether people with different beliefs are justified in having them.\nC: the reasons why philosophic questions never have better or worse answers.\nD: questions that can be answered better by appealing to scientific experiments.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is B: what beliefs mean and whether people with different beliefs are justified in having them. Philosophy examines the nature of beliefs, the reasons for holding them, and whether or not those beliefs are rational and justified. It delves into the underlying assumptions and principles that guide our thinking and decision-making processes. Unlike the sciences, philosophy is concerned with abstract concepts and fundamental truths that cannot always be tested through empirical experiments.",
