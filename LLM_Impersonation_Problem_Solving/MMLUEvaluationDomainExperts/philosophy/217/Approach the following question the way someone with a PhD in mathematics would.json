While social sciences focus on understanding human behavior and societal structures, philosophy delves into the underlying principles and assumptions that shape how we view the world.\n\nPhilosophy is concerned with the examination of beliefs, reasoning, and the nature of reality, among other things. In this context, option B, \"what beliefs mean and whether people with different beliefs are justified in having them,\" best captures the essence of what philosophy entails. Philosophers examine the rationale behind beliefs, the implications of those beliefs, and whether they can be logically justified or defended.\n\nWhile social sciences may ask how people think and act, philosophy goes beyond that to question the very foundations of thought and action. It seeks to uncover the underlying principles that govern our beliefs and behaviors, and to critically analyze and evaluate them.
