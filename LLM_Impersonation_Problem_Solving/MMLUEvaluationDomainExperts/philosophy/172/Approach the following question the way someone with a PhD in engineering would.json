    "gpt_response": "A PhD in engineering would likely approach this question by analyzing Hume's views on reason and passion in a logical and critical manner. In David Hume's philosophy, reason is seen as the slave of the passions. This means that reason alone cannot motivate action; it is our passions that ultimately drive us to act. Therefore, option A: \"should serve our passions,\" aligns with Hume's perspective on the relationship between reason and passion. Hume believed that reason can guide us in achieving our passions, but it is ultimately our passions that determine our actions.",
