From my knowledge, Hare is known for his extensive discussions on moral philosophy and ethical reasoning.\n\nBased on my understanding of Hare's arguments, I would interpret his stance as aligning with option D: all might be successful, but at a price. Hare likely acknowledges that individuals can attempt to escape moral arguments through various strategies, such as shifting the focus of the argument or utilizing logical fallacies. However, he would also emphasize that these tactics come at a cost, potentially undermining the integrity of moral discourse and the pursuit of ethical truth.\n\nIn conclusion, drawing upon my expertise in literature and moral philosophy, I would argue that Hare's perspective on escaping moral arguments is best represented by option D.",
