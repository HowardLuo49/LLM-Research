This perspective allows for a nuanced understanding of the complexities of moral arguments and the potential consequences of attempting to escape them. It recognizes that while certain strategies may be effective in avoiding moral arguments in the short term, they may come with ethical costs or long-term implications that need to be considered.\n\nAdditionally, my training in biology would likely lead me to appreciate the interconnectedness of systems and the need to consider the broader impact of decisions.
