In this context, a PhD in computer science would likely analyze the implications of each of the options presented in relation to ethical principles and societal norms. \n\nFirstly, addressing option A, that the gods do not care what we do, a computer scientist with a PhD may argue that this belief could potentially lead to a lack of accountability and ethical behavior. In a similar vein, option D, which suggests that it is sometimes permissible to lie, may also be viewed as detrimental to societal harmony and trust, thus supporting Cicero's assertion.\n\nMoving on to option B, positing that a thing may be expedient without being morally right, a computer scientist may analyze the ethical implications of prioritizing practicality over moral integrity, potentially leading to negative consequences in decision-making processes.\n\nLastly, option C, proposing that moral rightness is relative to one's culture, may be approached from a cultural relativism standpoint. A PhD in computer science may delve into the complexities of cultural diversity and its impact on ethical norms, highlighting the potential drawbacks of moral relativism in creating a universal code of conduct.\n\nIn conclusion, a computer scientist with a PhD would likely engage in a rigorous analysis of Cicero's statement by critically evaluating each option in light of ethical theories, societal implications, and the broader philosophical discourse on morality.",
