    "gpt_response": "A PhD in biology would likely approach this question from a biological and evolutionary perspective. In this context, the ultimate end of utilitarianism as proposed by Mill can be seen as aiming for an existence that maximizes overall well-being and happiness for individuals. From a biological standpoint, this can align with the concept of promoting behaviors and conditions that lead to increased fitness and reproductive success.\n\nIn this light, the answer could be \"D: enjoyments.\" This is because maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain can be seen as driving individuals towards behaviors and experiences that are evolutionarily beneficial, such as seeking out resources, forming social bonds, and reproducing. Enjoyments, in this sense, can encompass a wide range of activities and experiences that contribute to overall happiness and well-being.",
