This principle states that the right action is the one that produces the greatest overall happiness or utility for the greatest number of people.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that Sidgwick would likely align with option B: the expected consequences of an action. This is because utilitarianism emphasizes the importance of maximizing overall happiness, which would require considering the expected consequences of an action rather than just its actual consequences.\n\nWhile options C and D could also play a role in ethical evaluations, they are not as central to Sidgwick's utilitarian framework as the consideration of expected consequences. Therefore, I would argue that on Sidgwick's view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of its expected consequences.",
