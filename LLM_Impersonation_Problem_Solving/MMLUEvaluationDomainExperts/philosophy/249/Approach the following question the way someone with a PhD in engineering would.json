Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of:\nA: its actual consequences.\nB: its expected consequences.\nC: whether it violates any duties.\nD: whether it violates divine law.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD holder in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the principles of ethics that underpin the philosophy of ethics. First and foremost, it is important to understand that Sidgwick was a renowned philosopher who contributed significantly to the field of ethics.\n\nIn analyzing Anscombe's claim on Sidgwick's view, it is crucial to recognize that Sidgwick was a proponent of utilitarianism, a moral theory that suggests the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by its consequences. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Sidgwick, posits that the greatest good for the greatest number should be the guiding principle in ethical decision-making.\n\nWith this understanding, we can deduce that on Sidgwick's view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of its expected consequences rather than its actual consequences. This aligns with the utilitarian principle of maximizing overall utility, where the morality of an action is judged based on its anticipated outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to Anscombe's claim would be option B: its expected consequences. This perspective underscores the importance of foresight and rational calculation in assessing the ethical implications of an action, a key tenet in Sidgwick's ethical framework.",
