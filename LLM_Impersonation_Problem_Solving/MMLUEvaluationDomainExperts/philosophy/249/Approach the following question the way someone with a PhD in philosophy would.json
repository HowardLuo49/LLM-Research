    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of:\nA: its actual consequences.\nB: its expected consequences.\nC: whether it violates any duties.\nD: whether it violates divine law.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick's ethical framework, it is essential to delve into the intricacies of teleological ethics and the evaluation of actions based on their consequences. Sidgwick's utilitarian perspective suggests that the morality of an action should be judged based on the goodness or badness of its outcomes. Anscombe, on the other hand, challenges this perspective by highlighting the limitations of consequentialist ethics and the absence of a foundational moral framework.\n\nAccording to Anscombe, Sidgwick's approach fails to adequately consider the significance of moral duties and obligations in ethical decision-making. She argues that a purely consequentialist approach overlooks the essential role of moral principles and rules that guide our actions. In this light, the badness of an action must be assessed not simply based on its actual or expected consequences, but also in relation to whether it violates any moral duties or obligations.\n\nFurthermore, Anscombe raises the issue of divine law as a possible criterion for evaluating the badness of an action. By introducing the concept of divine law, she underscores the importance of a higher moral authority or transcendent source of ethics in guiding our moral deliberations. This perspective challenges a purely secular or utilitarian approach to ethics, emphasizing the significance of religious or metaphysical principles in moral decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, while Sidgwick's utilitarian perspective focuses on the consequences of actions in determining their moral value, Anscombe's critiques highlight the necessity of considering moral duties, obligations, and potentially divine law in evaluating the badness of an action. By engaging with these complex philosophical dimensions, we can further explore the foundations of ethical theory and the diverse perspectives that shape our understanding of morality.",
