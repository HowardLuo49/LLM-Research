Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of:\nA: its actual consequences.\nB: its expected consequences.\nC: whether it violates any duties.\nD: whether it violates divine law.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, it is important to approach ethical questions such as this one from a scientific and rational standpoint. In this case, Anscombe's claim about Sidgwick's view on the evaluation of the badness of an action raises the question of how ethical considerations can be approached in a systematic and logical manner.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, the consequences of an action are crucial in determining its ethical implications. The concept of expected consequences, as opposed to actual consequences, is also relevant in ethical decision-making. In the field of biology, scientists often consider the potential outcomes of their actions and decisions based on probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that considering both actual and expected consequences is essential in evaluating the ethical nature of an action.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of whether an action violates any duties is also a relevant consideration in ethical decision-making. In biology, researchers and scientists adhere to professional codes of conduct and ethical guidelines in their work. Violating these duties can have serious consequences, both professionally and ethically. Therefore, the concept of duty is an important factor to consider when evaluating the ethical implications of an action.\n\nOn the other hand, the notion of whether an action violates divine law may not be as relevant from a biological perspective. While some individuals may use religious beliefs as a basis for their ethical framework, biology as a scientific discipline typically relies on empirical evidence and rational reasoning to guide ethical decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, a biologist with a PhD would likely approach Anscombe's claim about Sidgwick's view on the badness of an action by considering the actual and expected consequences, as well as any duties or ethical guidelines that may be relevant to the situation. The consideration of divine law may not be a primary concern in this context.",
