Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of:\nA: its actual consequences.\nB: its expected consequences.\nC: whether it violates any duties.\nD: whether it violates divine law.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar in the field of literature with a focus on moral and ethical philosophy, I would approach this question by drawing on the works of Anscombe and Sidgwick in their respective discussions on the evaluation of actions. Anscombe, known for her groundbreaking work on virtue ethics, would likely argue that on Sidgwick's view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of its expected consequences. \n\nSidgwick, a renowned utilitarian philosopher, traditionally holds the view that the morality of an action should be determined by its consequences. This aligns with the utilitarian principle that actions are morally right if they result in the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Therefore, in evaluating the badness of an action on Sidgwick's view, one would consider the potential outcomes or consequences of that action.\n\nThis stance contrasts with the deontological perspective which emphasizes duties and obligations as the primary criteria for determining the moral status of actions. While duty ethics, such as Kantian ethics, prioritize the intention or duty behind an action, utilitarian ethics focus on the overall consequences of that action.\n\nIn conclusion, Anscombe's claim that on Sidgwick's view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of its expected consequences aligns with the utilitarian framework that evaluates actions based on their outcomes rather than their intentions or adherence to duties.",
