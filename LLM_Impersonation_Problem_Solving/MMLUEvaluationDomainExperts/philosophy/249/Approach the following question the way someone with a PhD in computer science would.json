Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of:\nA: its actual consequences.\nB: its expected consequences.\nC: whether it violates any duties.\nD: whether it violates divine law.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "From a computer science perspective, Sidgwick's view on the badness of an action can be analyzed using decision-making algorithms. In this context, Anscombe's claim can be interpreted as asserting that Sidgwick believes the badness of an action should be estimated based on the actual outcomes it produces. This aligns with the concept of outcome-based evaluation in decision-making algorithms, where the effectiveness of a decision is judged by the actual consequences it generates rather than just the intended outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer according to Anscombe's claim would be:\n\nA: its actual consequences.",
