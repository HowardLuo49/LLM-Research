    "gpt_response": "For Aristotle, the reference of each virtue term is fixed by a combination of grounding experiences and a thick description of the virtue. This understanding is derived from Aristotle's conception of virtue ethics, where virtues are understood as character traits that enable individuals to live a flourishing life. Grounding experiences refer to the practical experiences and behaviors that facilitate the development and understanding of virtues, while a thick description of the virtue involves a comprehensive and multifaceted analysis of the virtue in its various dimensions and contexts. This holistic approach reveals the complexity and richness of virtue terms, going beyond mere conventional use or adherence to tradition to fully capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of virtues in Aristotelian ethics.",
