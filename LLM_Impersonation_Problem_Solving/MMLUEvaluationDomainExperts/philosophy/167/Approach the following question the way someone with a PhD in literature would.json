    "gpt_response": "Aristotle's conception of virtue is deeply rooted in his philosophical framework, particularly his ethical theory outlined in the Nicomachean Ethics. According to Martha Nussbaum, a prominent scholar in the field of ethics and virtue theory, the reference of each virtue term in Aristotle's understanding is fixed by a complex interplay of factors.\n\nFirst and foremost, Aristotle argues that virtues are not simply a matter of individual preference or societal convention. Instead, he believes that virtues are grounded in objective human goods and flourishing. In this sense, the reference of each virtue term is fixed by what he calls \"grounding experiences,\" which are the lived realities that shape our understanding of virtue.\n\nFurthermore, Aristotle emphasizes the importance of a \"thick description\" of each virtue, meaning that virtues cannot be reduced to simple definitions or general principles. Instead, virtues are complex and multifaceted qualities that are revealed through the thoughtful examination of specific contexts and situations. Nussbaum suggests that this detailed and context-dependent understanding of virtue is essential for fixing the reference of each virtue term.\n\nAdditionally, tradition plays a crucial role in Aristotle's conception of virtue. Aristotle acknowledges the influence of cultural and historical practices on our understanding of virtue, and he argues that tradition can provide valuable insights into the nature of virtuous behavior. Thus, tradition is another factor that contributes to fixing the reference of each virtue term according to Aristotle.\n\nIn conclusion, Nussbaum's interpretation highlights the nuanced and multifaceted nature of Aristotle's understanding of virtue, emphasizing the importance of grounding experiences, a thick description of the virtue, and tradition in fixing the reference of each virtue term.",
