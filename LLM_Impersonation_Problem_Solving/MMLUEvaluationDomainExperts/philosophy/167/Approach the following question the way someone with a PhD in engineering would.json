    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing Nussbaum's interpretation of Aristotle's views on virtue terms. Nussbaum argues that for Aristotle, the reference of each virtue term is fixed by grounding experiences. This means that Aristotle believed that virtues are not merely defined by conventional use or tradition, but rather by actual experiences that provide a deep understanding of the virtue in question. By experiencing and understanding the practical application of virtues, individuals can develop a richer and more complex understanding of virtues beyond superficial definitions. Therefore, option B, grounding experiences, aligns with the nuanced and experiential approach that Aristotle took towards virtue ethics.",
