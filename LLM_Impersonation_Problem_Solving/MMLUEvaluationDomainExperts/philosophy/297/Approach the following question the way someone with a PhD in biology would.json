    "gpt_response": "Bad constitutive moral luck refers to factors beyond an individual's control that shape their character or predispositions in a negative way. A person who is by nature envious and ungenerous, as in option A, exemplifies bad constitutive moral luck because these traits are not chosen by the individual but rather inherent to their nature. Living in Nazi Germany in 1940, as in option B, could also be considered an example of bad constitutive moral luck since it exposes the individual to a harmful and oppressive environment beyond their choosing. Option C, a person who drives drunk and hits a child, falls more under the category of resultant moral luck as it involves a specific action with foreseeable consequences. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: all of the above examples represent instances of bad constitutive moral luck.",
