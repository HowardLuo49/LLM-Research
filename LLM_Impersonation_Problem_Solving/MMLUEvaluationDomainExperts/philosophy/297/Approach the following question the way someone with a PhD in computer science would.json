    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by understanding the concept of constitutive moral luck. Constitutive moral luck refers to factors beyond an individual's control, such as their genetic makeup or upbringing, that influence their moral character or choices.\n\nIn this context, one example of bad constitutive moral luck would be option A: a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous. This individual did not choose to be envious and ungenerous, but rather inherited these traits through factors outside of their control, such as genetics or upbringing.\n\nOption B, a person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940, does not directly relate to constitutive moral luck as it pertains to innate characteristics that influence moral character. This example would be more closely linked to circumstantial moral luck, as the individual's surroundings and historical circumstances influenced their actions.\n\nOption C, a person who drives drunk and hits a child, does not exemplify constitutive moral luck either. This scenario involves a deliberate choice made by the individual, rather than an inherent trait or characteristic that they possess.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous, as this example aligns with the concept of bad constitutive moral luck.",
