    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question like someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to consider the concept of constitutive moral luck. Constitutive moral luck refers to factors beyond an individual's control that influence their moral character. This concept is separate from resultant moral luck, which pertains to the outcomes of an individual's actions.\n\nIn this context, a bad constitutive moral luck involves factors that predispose an individual towards negative moral traits or actions. Option A, a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous, fits this description as it suggests that the individual's character flaws are inherent and not chosen.\n\nOption B, a person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940, does not necessarily fall under constitutive moral luck. While living in a particular time or place may expose an individual to certain influences, it does not determine their moral character or actions.\n\nOption C, a person who drives drunk and hits a child, involves a deliberate choice to engage in harmful behavior, rather than a factor beyond their control.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous, as an example of bad constitutive moral luck.",
