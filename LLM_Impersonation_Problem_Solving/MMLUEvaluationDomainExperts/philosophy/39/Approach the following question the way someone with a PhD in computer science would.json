Hare claims that the two essential features of the logic of moral judgments are:\nA: consequentialism and hedonism.\nB: universalizability and prescriptivity.\nC: contractualism and rule-following.\nD: consistency and coherence.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, it is important to approach this question through a logical and analytical lens. In this context, Hare's claim regarding the essential features of the logic of moral judgments should be examined based on established principles and theories within the field of ethics.\n\nFirstly, consequentialism is a moral theory that evaluates the moral worth of actions based on their outcomes or consequences. It asserts that the right action is the one that produces the best overall consequences. Hedonism, on the other hand, is a theory that prioritizes the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain as the ultimate goals of human life. These two features, consequentialism and hedonism, focus on the outcomes and motivations behind moral actions.\n\nUniversalizability refers to the principle that moral judgments and actions should be applicable to all individuals in similar circumstances. Prescriptivity, on the other hand, emphasizes the normative nature of moral judgments by prescribing certain actions as morally obligatory or impermissible. These two features, universalizability and prescriptivity, address the universality and normativity of moral principles.\n\nContractualism involves the idea that moral principles are derived from agreements or social contracts between individuals in a society. Rule-following, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of adhering to moral rules or principles in making ethical decisions. While these features, contractualism and rule-following, are important aspects of moral reasoning, they may not necessarily capture the essence of the logic of moral judgments as comprehensively as other options.\n\nConsistency refers to the logical coherence and non-contradictory nature of moral judgments, while coherence emphasizes the overall rationality and interconnectedness of moral principles. These two features, consistency and coherence, highlight the need for moral reasoning to be systematic and coherent in order to be justifiable and persuasive.\n\nIn conclusion, Hare's claim regarding the two essential features of the logic of moral judgments can be best represented by option D: consistency and coherence. These features encapsulate the logical and systematic nature of moral reasoning, emphasizing the importance of rationality and coherence in ethical decision-making.",
