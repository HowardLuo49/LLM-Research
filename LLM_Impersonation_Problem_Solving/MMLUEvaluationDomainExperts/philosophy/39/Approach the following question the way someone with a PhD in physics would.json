While these are important considerations in moral philosophy, they do not encompass the entirety of moral judgment logic.\n\nB: Universalizability and prescriptivity are principles that are commonly associated with deontological ethics, which emphasizes duties and obligations. These principles are indeed key aspects of the logic of moral judgments, as they relate to the universal applicability and normative force of moral principles.\n\nC: Contractualism and rule-following are concepts that are often associated with social contract theory and deontological ethics, but they do not fully capture the essential features of moral judgment logic. \n\nD: Consistency and coherence are crucial aspects of moral reasoning, as they ensure that moral judgments are rational and well-founded. These principles help to maintain logical integrity in moral decision-making processes.\n\nBased on my analysis, I would argue that option B, universalizability and prescriptivity, best captures the essential features of the logic of moral judgments.
