Hare claims that the two essential features of the logic of moral judgments are:\nA: consequentialism and hedonism.\nB: universalizability and prescriptivity.\nC: contractualism and rule-following.\nD: consistency and coherence.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Hare's assertion regarding the two essential features of the logic of moral judgments necessitates a careful unpacking and analysis in order to grasp its underlying complexity and philosophical implications. In considering Hare's claim, it is essential to first elucidate the concepts of consequentialism and hedonism as potential candidates for these essential features, and to critically examine their compatibility with the logical structure of moral judgments. Consequentialism posits that the moral worth of an action is determined by its outcomes or consequences, while hedonism presupposes that pleasure and pain are the ultimate criteria for evaluating ethical decisions.\n\nMoreover, the alternative options presented - universalizability and prescriptivity, contractualism and rule-following, and consistency and coherence - each offer distinct perspectives on the nature of moral reasoning and justification. Universalizability and prescriptivity suggest a focus on the ethical principles that can be applied universally and prescribe action based on such principles. Contractualism and rule-following, on the other hand, emphasize the role of social agreements and rules in guiding moral behavior. Lastly, consistency and coherence underscore the importance of internal consistency and logical coherence in moral reasoning.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it can be argued that Hare's proposed essential features of the logic of moral judgments - universalizability and prescriptivity - offer a nuanced and comprehensive framework for understanding the normative structure of moral reasoning. By emphasizing the importance of principles that can be universally applied and prescribing action based on such principles, Hare's framework seeks to establish a logical basis for ethical decision-making that is both principled and action-guiding. Furthermore, the integration of universalizability and prescriptivity highlights the interconnectedness of moral principles and moral actions, thereby highlighting the systematic and rigorous nature of moral judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, Hare's claim regarding the essential features of the logic of moral judgments, as articulated through universalizability and prescriptivity, reflects a sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the logical underpinnings of moral reasoning. By elucidating the interplay between ethical principles and moral actions, Hare's framework offers a compelling and insightful account of the normative structure of moral judgments that is both logically rigorous and ethically robust.",
