This suggests that option B, which suggests that moral education should be based entirely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions, is not in line with Feinberg's beliefs.\n\nFeinberg also shares that a good moral education should not produce individuals who do the right thing out of deference to authority, indicating that option C is not consistent with his ideas.\n\nInstead, Feinberg asserts that a good moral education should cultivate individuals who do the right thing simply because it is right. This aligns with option D, which suggests that moral education should produce individuals who act morally based on intrinsic motivations rather than external rewards or punishments.\n\nIn conclusion, a thorough analysis of Feinberg's perspective on moral education reveals that option D, which emphasizes the development of individuals who do the right thing simply because it is right, best captures the essence of a good moral education according to Feinberg.",
