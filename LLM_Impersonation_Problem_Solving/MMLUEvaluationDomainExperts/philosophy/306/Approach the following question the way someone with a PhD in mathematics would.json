According to Feinberg, a good moral education:\nA: will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions.\nB: will be based entirely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions.\nC: will produce someone who does the right thing out of deference to authority.\nD: will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I understand that the question presented involves the principles of moral education as proposed by Feinberg. Feinberg posited that a good moral education will lead to individuals who do the right thing for the sake of doing what is right, rather than seeking pleasure or avoiding pain as incentives. This aligns with the concept of intrinsic motivation, where individuals are motivated by internal factors rather than external rewards or punishments.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question would be option D: will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right. This suggests that individuals who have received a good moral education will act morally not because of external factors such as pleasure or pain, authority, or rewards, but rather because they have internalized a sense of what is right and ethical.",
