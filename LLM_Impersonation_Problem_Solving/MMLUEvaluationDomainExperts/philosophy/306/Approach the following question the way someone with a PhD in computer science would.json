    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by analyzing Feinberg's argument within the context of moral education. Feinberg's perspective suggests that a good moral education should not rely on pleasure or pain as sanctions, which aligns with a deontological ethical framework. This means that an individual should do the right thing simply because it is the right thing to do, rather than for any external incentives or consequences.\n\nTherefore, based on Feinberg's viewpoint, the correct answer would be D: will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right. This aligns with a more principled approach to ethics and moral decision-making, which focuses on individual autonomy, integrity, and an intrinsic sense of duty to do what is morally right.",
