    "gpt_response": "Feinberg argues that a good moral education, according to his position, would be one that ultimately produces individuals who are intrinsically motivated to do the right thing because it is morally correct. This aligns with option D, which posits that a good moral education will lead to individuals who act morally out of a sense of duty or intrinsic moral obligation rather than external factors such as pleasure or pain as sanctions or deference to authority. Feinberg emphasizes the importance of cultivating moral autonomy and integrity in individuals through moral education, which will enable them to make ethical decisions based on moral principles rather than external rewards or punishments.",
