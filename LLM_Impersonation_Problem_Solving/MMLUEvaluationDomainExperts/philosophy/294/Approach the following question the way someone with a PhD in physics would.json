In particular, logic plays a fundamental role in the study of philosophy by providing a systematic framework for evaluating arguments and reasoning. It encompasses both formal logic, which focuses on the structure of valid arguments, and informal logic, which concerns the practical application of reasoning in everyday discourse.
