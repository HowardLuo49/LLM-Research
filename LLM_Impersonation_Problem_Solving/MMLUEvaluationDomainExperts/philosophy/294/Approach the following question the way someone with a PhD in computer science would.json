Logic is concerned with the principles of valid reasoning and inference, which are essential for constructing sound arguments and evaluating the validity of deductive reasoning. In the context of the four main divisions of philosophy, logic plays a crucial role in shaping the methodology and structure of philosophical inquiry, making it a natural complement to metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology.
