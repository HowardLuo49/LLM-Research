According to Hobbes, the right of nature is:\nA: an entitlement to the fruits of one\u2019s labors.\nB: a claim not to be harmed by others.\nC: the right of the king to rule his subjects.\nD: the liberty to use one\u2019s powers to preserve one\u2019s life.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "According to Hobbesian political philosophy, the right of nature, as articulated by Thomas Hobbes in his seminal work Leviathan, can be understood as the liberty granted to individuals to utilize their inherent powers in order to safeguard their own lives. This conception of the right of nature rests on the fundamental Hobbesian premise that in a state of nature, where there is no overarching authority to enforce societal norms, individuals are free to act according to their own self-interest. In this context, the right of nature serves as the foundational principle that underpins Hobbes' argument for the necessity of a strong sovereign authority to impose order and security in society. Therefore, the correct answer is D: the liberty to use one's powers to preserve one's life.",
