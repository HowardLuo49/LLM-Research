    "gpt_response": "According to Thomas Hobbes, the right of nature is best understood as the liberty to use one's powers to preserve one's own life. In his seminal work \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes argues that in the state of nature, individuals have the inherent right to defend themselves and protect their own lives by any means necessary. This right is based on the fundamental natural instinct of self-preservation and forms the basis of his social contract theory, where individuals surrender some of their natural rights to a sovereign authority in exchange for protection and security.
