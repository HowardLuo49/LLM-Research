This includes the use of one's powers and abilities to secure one's safety and well-being, even if this involves taking actions that may harm others. This fundamental right forms the basis of Hobbes's social contract theory, which posits that individuals relinquish some of their natural rights in exchange for protection and security provided by a sovereign ruler.",
