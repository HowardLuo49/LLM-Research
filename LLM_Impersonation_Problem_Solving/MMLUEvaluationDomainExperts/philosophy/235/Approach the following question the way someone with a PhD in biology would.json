    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD biologist, it is important to apply a scientific lens when examining philosophical concepts such as Thomas Hobbes's view on the laws of nature. In Hobbes's view, a law of nature is not specifically related to religious doctrine or intuition, but rather a principle discerned through reason that guides individuals to act in ways that preserve their own lives and well-being. This aligns with a biological perspective, as survival and fitness are key concepts in the field of biology. Therefore, the correct answer is C: a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one\u2019s life.",
