In Hobbes\u2019s view, a law of nature is:\nA: a command of God.\nB: a principle of duty, known by intuition.\nC: a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one\u2019s life.\nD: None of the above.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing Hobbes's philosophical perspective on the concept of a law of nature. According to Hobbes, a law of nature is a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one's life. This aligns with Hobbes's belief in the importance of self-preservation and the need for individuals to adhere to rational principles in order to maintain a civil society. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question would be:\n\nC: a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one\u2019s life.",
