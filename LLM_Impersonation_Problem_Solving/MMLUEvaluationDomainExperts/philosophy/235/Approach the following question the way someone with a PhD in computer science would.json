    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In Hobbes's view, a law of nature can be understood as a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one's life. This perspective aligns with Hobbes's naturalistic approach to ethics and governance, where the laws of nature guide individuals towards self-preservation and societal order. This interpretation is grounded in Hobbes's philosophical framework that emphasizes rationality and self-interest as the key drivers of human behavior. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one's life.",
