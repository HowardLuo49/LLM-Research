In Hobbes\u2019s view, a law of nature is:\nA: a command of God.\nB: a principle of duty, known by intuition.\nC: a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one\u2019s life.\nD: None of the above.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I would approach this question by first acknowledging that Thomas Hobbes was a political philosopher rather than a physicist, and therefore his concept of a law of nature may not align precisely with the scientific understanding of natural laws. However, in Hobbes's view, a law of nature can be understood as a principle derived from reason that prohibits individuals from engaging in actions that would be destructive to their own lives. This aligns with the idea that laws of nature can be based on rational principles that guide human behavior towards self-preservation and the maintenance of social order. Therefore, I would select option C: a principle, known by reason, which forbids one from doing something destructive of one\u2019s life.",
