    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the nature of virtue and vice from a biological perspective. Virtue and vice can be thought of as behavioral traits that are shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. \n\nIn terms of genetics, individuals may have predispositions towards certain virtuous or vicious behaviors due to their genetic makeup. For example, some individuals may have a genetic predisposition towards impulsivity, which may make it more difficult for them to exhibit virtuous behaviors such as self-control. \n\nOn the other hand, environmental factors also play a significant role in shaping virtue and vice. Factors such as upbringing, culture, and social influences can all affect an individual's propensity towards virtuous or vicious behaviors. \n\nUltimately, I would argue that both virtue and vice are within our power to some extent. While genetic factors may influence our predispositions towards certain behaviors, we also have the ability to consciously cultivate virtuous behaviors through effort and practice. Similarly, we have the ability to minimize and control our vices through self-awareness and intentional behavior change. Therefore, I would lean towards option A: virtue is in our power, and so is vice, as being the most accurate statement based on our understanding of biology and human behavior.",
