Ross\u2019s prima facie duties are a concept proposed by philosopher W.D. Ross, which includes duties such as fidelity (keeping promises), beneficence (promoting well-being), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and justice (fairness).\n\nIn this context, I would analyze each option to determine which one does not align with Ross's prima facie duties. Upon examination, it becomes evident that the duty of legality is not explicitly included in Ross's list of prima facie duties. Legality refers to conformity to the law or rules of society, which may or may not align with ethical considerations. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D: Legality.",
