    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the following is not one of Ross's prima facie duties, we must first understand what prima facie duties are and how they are defined by W.D. Ross in the field of ethics. \n\nPrima facie duties, as defined by Ross, are moral obligations that hold a special status in that they are binding unless overridden by another duty that is more compelling in a particular situation. Ross identified several prima facie duties, including fidelity (keeping promises), beneficence (promoting the well-being of others), non-maleficence (preventing harm), and justice (giving each their due).\n\nTo ascertain which of the options is not one of Ross's prima facie duties, we must assess each option in light of Ross's ethical framework. \n\nFidelity, beneficence, and non-maleficence are all explicitly mentioned as prima facie duties by Ross. These duties form the foundational principles of his ethical theory. \n\nLegality, on the other hand, is not explicitly listed as one of Ross's prima facie duties. While obeying the law is generally considered a moral obligation, it is not necessarily synonymous with Ross's specific concept of prima facie duties. Moreover, Ross's ethical theory focuses on more intrinsic ethical principles rather than legal obligations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Legality, as it is not one of Ross's prima facie duties according to his ethical framework.",
