    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first recognizing that prima facie duties are a concept introduced by W.D. Ross, a philosopher, as a way to prioritize moral principles. In this framework, fidelity, beneficence, non-maleficence, and legality are all considered to be important prima facie duties.\n\nHowever, based on my understanding of the concept of prima facie duties, I would point out that legality is not typically considered as one of Ross's prima facie duties. Instead, Ross's classical prima facie duties are typically identified as fidelity, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, self-improvement, gratitude, and reparations. Therefore, out of the options provided, D: Legality is the correct answer as it does not align with Ross's original formulation of prima facie duties.",
