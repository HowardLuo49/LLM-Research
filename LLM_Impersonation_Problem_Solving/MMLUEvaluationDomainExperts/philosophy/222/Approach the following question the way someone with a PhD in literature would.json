    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is important to consider the context of the question being asked. In this case, the reference to \"Ross's prima facie duties\" suggests a connection to the ethical theory of W.D. Ross, a British philosopher known for his work on deontological ethics.\n\nIn the realm of deontological ethics, Ross proposed a set of seven prima facie duties that individuals should consider when making ethical decisions. These duties include fidelity, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, reparation, gratitude, and self-improvement.\n\nGiven this background, the question is asking which of the listed options does not align with Ross's prima facie duties. In this case, the correct answer would be D: Legality. While legality is certainly an important consideration in ethical decision-making, it is not typically included as one of Ross's specific prima facie duties. Instead, Ross focused on principles such as fidelity, beneficence, and non-maleficence as the primary moral obligations that individuals should uphold.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in literature would approach this question by understanding the philosophical foundation of Ross's ethical theory and identifying the duty that does not align with his specific set of prima facie duties.",
