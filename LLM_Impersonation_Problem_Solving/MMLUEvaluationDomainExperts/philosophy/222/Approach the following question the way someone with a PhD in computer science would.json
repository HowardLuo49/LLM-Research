    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist and academic with a PhD, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of prima facie duties as proposed by philosopher W.D. Ross. Prima facie duties are moral obligations that one should follow unless they conflict with a more pressing duty.\n\nIn this context, Ross identifies several prima facie duties, including fidelity (keeping promises), beneficence (doing good to others), non-maleficence (preventing harm), and legality (acting within the framework of the law).\n\nTherefore, to answer the question, I would analyze each option and determine which one does not align with Ross's concept of prima facie duties. After considering the options, I would conclude that the correct answer is D: Legality, as this duty is based on following the law rather than on fundamental moral principles as outlined by Ross.",
