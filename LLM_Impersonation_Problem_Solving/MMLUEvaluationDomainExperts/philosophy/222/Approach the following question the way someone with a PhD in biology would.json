Ross's prima facie duties are a concept in moral philosophy introduced by W.D. Ross, who proposed a list of moral obligations that are binding unless they conflict with a more pressing duty. \n\nFrom a moral philosophy perspective, the correct answer to this question is D: Legality. Ross's prima facie duties include fidelity (keeping promises), beneficence (doing good), and non-maleficence (avoiding harm). Legality, while important in a societal context, is not typically considered a primary moral duty in the same way as the other three listed options. It is important to note that this analysis is based on philosophical reasoning and not strictly related to biological studies.",
