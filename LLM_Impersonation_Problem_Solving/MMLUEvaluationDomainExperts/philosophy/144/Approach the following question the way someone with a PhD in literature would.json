Nagel claims that prior to reflection, it is plausible that people cannot be morally assessed for:\nA: actions that affect only themselves.\nB: their character.\nC: what is due to factors beyond their control.\nD: actions that do not violate anyone\u2019s rights.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Nagel's assertion suggests that individuals should not be morally judged or held accountable for aspects of their behavior or character which are beyond their control or for actions that do not harm others. In essence, he posits that a person's moral assessment should be based on factors that they have agency over and can intentionalize. This notion is grounded in the philosophical principle of moral responsibility and the delineation between actions that are within an individual's capacity to control and those that are not. Therefore, according to Nagel, the correct answer to the question would be C: what is due to factors beyond their control.",
