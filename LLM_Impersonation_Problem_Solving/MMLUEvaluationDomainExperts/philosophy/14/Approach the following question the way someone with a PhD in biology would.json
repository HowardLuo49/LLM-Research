    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "From a biological perspective, Rawls' concept of \"justice as fairness\" can be viewed through the lens of evolutionary biology and sociobiology. The term conveys the idea that the principles of justice are agreed to in an initial position that is rational. This rationality can be understood as a product of the evolutionary pressures that have shaped human societies to prioritize cooperation and fairness in order to promote group cohesion and overall fitness. Therefore, the principles of justice as fairness are not arbitrary or artificial, but rather the result of an evolutionarily advantageous trait that has been selected for over time. Additionally, these principles can be seen as constitutional in that they form the basis for societal structures and norms that help to regulate human behavior and maintain social order. Ultimately, the concept of justice as fairness aligns with the principles of rationality and fairness that underlie the biological mechanisms of cooperation and social behavior in human societies.",
