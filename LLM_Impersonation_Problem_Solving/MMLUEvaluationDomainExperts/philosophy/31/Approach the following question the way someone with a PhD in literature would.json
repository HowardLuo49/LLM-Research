Aquinas, a prominent medieval philosopher and theologian, famously espoused a Thomistic view based on Aristotelian principles. In his Summa Theologica and other works, he grappled with complex questions related to human nature, ethics, and metaphysics.\n\nIn this context, it is important to note that Aquinas viewed the ultimate goal or final purpose of human life as attaining perfect happiness or beatitude. This concept of beatitude encompasses a sense of fulfillment, harmony, and union with the divine, which goes beyond mere pleasure or satisfaction of desires. Aquinas believed that true happiness could only be achieved through virtuous living and aligning one's will with the divine will.\n\nTherefore, as someone with a PhD in literature, I would argue that Aquinas would likely choose option B: happiness or beatitude as the last end of man, as it best represents his philosophical stance on the ultimate aim of human existence. This interpretation is supported by a close reading of Aquinas's key texts and scholarly commentary on his works, which emphasize the primacy of virtuous living and spiritual fulfillment in the pursuit of true happiness.",
