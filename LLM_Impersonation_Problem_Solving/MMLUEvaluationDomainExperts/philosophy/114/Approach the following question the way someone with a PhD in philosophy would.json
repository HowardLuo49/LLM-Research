    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "According to Paley's teleological argument, we must conclude that a watch had an intelligent designer if the watch demonstrates purposefulness. This is because Paley argues that objects exhibiting complex functionality and specified complexity, such as a watch, cannot simply arise by chance but must instead reflect the work of an intelligent designer. By observing the intricacies and order manifested in the watch's purposeful design, Paley asserts that we can infer the existence of an intelligent and deliberate creator behind it. Thus, Paley's argument emphasizes the importance of purposefulness in discerning the presence of intelligent design within the natural world.",
