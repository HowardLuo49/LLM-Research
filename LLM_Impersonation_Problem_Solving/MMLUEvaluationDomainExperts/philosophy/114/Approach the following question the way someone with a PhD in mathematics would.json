Paley's famous analogy of the watchmaker argues that if we were to come across a watch in nature, we would infer that it was designed by an intelligent being due to the complexity and purposefulness of its structure.\n\nTherefore, according to Paley, we must conclude that a watch had an intelligent designer if the watch shows purposefulness (option A). This is because the presence of purposefulness and complexity in an object such as a watch suggests that it was designed by an intelligent agent rather than arising by chance or natural processes. From a mathematical standpoint, this reasoning aligns with the principles of probability and information theory, which suggest that highly ordered and complex systems are unlikely to emerge randomly and are more likely the result of intentional design.",
