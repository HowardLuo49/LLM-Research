In this analogy, Paley asserts that if one were to come across a watch in nature, one would conclude that it must have been designed by an intelligent creator due to its intricate structure and purposefulness.\n\nThus, the correct answer to the question would be A: shows purposefulness. According to Paley, the presence of purpose and design in the watch would lead one to infer the existence of an intelligent designer. This argument is central to Paley's teleological view of the universe, where he sees evidence of design and purpose in the natural world as a proof of a divine creator.",
