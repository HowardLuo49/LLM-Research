    "gpt_response": "The answer according to Paley's argument would be A: shows purposefulness. In his famous analogy, Paley compares the complexity and purposefulness of a watch to that of living organisms. He argues that just as a watch could not have come about by chance, neither could complex biological systems. Therefore, the presence of purposefulness or design in a watch suggests the existence of an intelligent designer.",
