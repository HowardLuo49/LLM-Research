This is in line with his method of radical doubt, where he questions the reliability of his senses and perceptions in order to arrive at indubitable truths through reason alone. By doubting the veracity of his sensory experiences, Descartes aims to uncover foundational truths that are beyond doubt or error.\n\nTherefore, option B: FALSE would be the most appropriate answer from the perspective of someone with a PhD in literature familiar with Descartes' philosophical principles.",
