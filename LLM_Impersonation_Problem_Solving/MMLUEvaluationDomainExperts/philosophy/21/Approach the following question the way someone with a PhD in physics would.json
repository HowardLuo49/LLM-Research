Baier's argument suggests that genuine moral rules must prioritize the well-being and interests of individuals, whether they are human or sentient beings. This perspective aligns with the principles of ethics and moral philosophy which emphasize the importance of compassion, empathy, and interconnectivity among all living beings.
