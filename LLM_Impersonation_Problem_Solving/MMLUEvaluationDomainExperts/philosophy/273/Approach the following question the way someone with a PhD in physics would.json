    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of determinism in physics. Determinism posits that all events, including human actions, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Soft determinism, on the other hand, suggests that even though events are determined, individuals still have some level of freedom and autonomy in their choices.\n\nGiven this understanding, I would argue that option C: \"the thesis of determinism is false\" best aligns with the concept of soft determinism. Soft determinism acknowledges the presence of determinism but asserts that it does not completely eliminate individual agency and choice. Therefore, soft determinism entails that while events may be determined to some extent, the thesis of strict, all-encompassing determinism is false.",
