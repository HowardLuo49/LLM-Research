    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first recognizing that soft determinism is a philosophical concept that seeks to reconcile determinism with free will. Determinism argues that all events, including human actions, are determined by causes external to the will. Soft determinism posits that although these external causes influence our actions, we still have some degree of free will.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC: the thesis of determinism is false\n\nSoft determinism asserts that while there are external factors that influence our actions, we are still ultimately free to make choices and decisions. This perspective rejects the strict determinism that everything is preordained and instead allows for some level of agency and autonomy in our behavior.",
