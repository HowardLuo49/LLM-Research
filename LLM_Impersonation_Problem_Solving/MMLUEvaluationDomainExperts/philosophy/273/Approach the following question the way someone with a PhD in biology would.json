    "gpt_response": "In the context of biology, soft determinism entails that the thesis of determinism is true, but that human behavior is still influenced by factors such as genetics, environment, and upbringing. This means that while our actions are ultimately determined by these factors, there is still an element of free will in our decision-making process. Therefore, option D, \"the thesis of determinism is true,\" would be the most appropriate answer from a PhD in biology perspective.",
