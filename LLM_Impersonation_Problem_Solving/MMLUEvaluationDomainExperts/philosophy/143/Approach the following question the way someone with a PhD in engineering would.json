Parfit's claim implicates the issue of measuring and quantifying subjective experiences, such as pain, which can be challenging due to their inherently personal and contextual nature.\n\nIn the field of engineering, we often deal with quantitative measurements and precise comparisons of physical phenomena. However, when it comes to subjective experiences like pain, the process becomes more complex. While it is possible to use standardized scales and metrics to compare pains within individuals, comparing them between individuals becomes more challenging due to differences in tolerance, perception, and context.\n\nBased on my expertise in engineering, I would argue that option C - \"can be compared within individuals, but not between individuals\" - is the most scientifically defensible position. This aligns with the idea that pain is inherently subjective and can be interpreted and assessed differently by different individuals. Therefore, while comparisons within the same person may be possible through standardized methods, extrapolating these comparisons across different individuals may not be as reliable or accurate.",
