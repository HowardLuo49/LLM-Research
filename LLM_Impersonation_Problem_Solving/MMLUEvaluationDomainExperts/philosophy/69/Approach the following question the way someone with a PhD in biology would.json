Descartes, a renowned philosopher and mathematician, is known for his skepticism and emphasis on reason and evidence-based thinking. It is highly unlikely that he would have been disillusioned by discovering truths learned in his youth that were actually true. In fact, one could argue that Descartes would have been more disillusioned by discovering that the alleged truths were false. This is because as a scholar dedicated to seeking knowledge and understanding the natural world, he would value the pursuit of truth and would be more likely to question and investigate any discrepancies. Therefore, the correct answer is C: FALSE.",
