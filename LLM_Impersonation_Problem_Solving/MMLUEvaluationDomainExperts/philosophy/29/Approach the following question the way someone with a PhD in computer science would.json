According to Epicurus, a law is unjust when:\nA: it is not in accordance with natural law.\nB: it is not in accordance with the traditions of society.\nC: it is offensive to the gods.\nD: it is not beneficial to those it affects.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "From a philosophical perspective grounded in Epicurean ethics, a law can be deemed unjust when it fails to align with natural law, which is understood as the principles governing the universe that promote harmony, reason, and tranquility. Epicurus argued that following such natural laws, which uphold individual well-being and societal harmony, is essential for living a good life. Thus, a law that contradicts these natural laws would be considered unjust according to Epicurus. The notion of a law being deemed unjust based on tradition or the opinions of the gods would not hold the same weight in Epicurean philosophy, as the focus is primarily on human flourishing and the pursuit of pleasure and tranquility. Therefore, option A best reflects Epicurus's perspective on the concept of justice in relation to laws.",
