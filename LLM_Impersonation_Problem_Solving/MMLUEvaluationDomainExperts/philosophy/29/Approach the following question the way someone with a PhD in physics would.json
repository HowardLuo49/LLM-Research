According to Epicurus, a law is unjust when:\nA: it is not in accordance with natural law.\nB: it is not in accordance with the traditions of society.\nC: it is offensive to the gods.\nD: it is not beneficial to those it affects.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by examining it through the lens of Epicurean philosophy. Epicurus believed that laws are unjust when they are not in accordance with natural law. This means that an unjust law goes against the fundamental laws of nature that govern the universe. In Epicurean thought, the ultimate goal of human life is to live in harmony with nature, so any law that goes against this principle would be considered unjust.\n\nAdditionally, Epicurus believed that laws should be based on reason and the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Therefore, a law that is not beneficial to those it affects would also be considered unjust by Epicurean standards.\n\nIn summary, according to Epicurus, a law is unjust when it goes against natural law and is not beneficial to those it affects. This aligns with the principles of Epicurean philosophy, which values living in harmony with nature and pursuing a life of pleasure and tranquility.",
