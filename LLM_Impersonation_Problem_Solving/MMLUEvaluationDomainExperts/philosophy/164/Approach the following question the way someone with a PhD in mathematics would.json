In Rawls' theory of justice, entering the original position is a thought experiment where rational individuals behind a \"veil of ignorance\" deliberate on principles of justice without knowing their own characteristics or position in society. This thought experiment is not contingent on leaving society, following a certain procedure, or forgetting one's identity. Therefore, the correct answer is D: none of the above.",
