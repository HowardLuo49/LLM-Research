    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the concepts and theories put forth by John Rawls in his work on justice and the original position. Rawls' theory of justice involves individuals making decisions behind a \"veil of ignorance\" in the original position, where they do not know their own personal characteristics or circumstances.\n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer would be B: at any time, by simply following a certain procedure. In the original position, individuals are able to enter and make decisions by following a specific procedure that allows them to consider principles of justice without knowledge of their own biases or advantages. This process is theoretical and does not require individuals to physically leave society or forget who they are.",
