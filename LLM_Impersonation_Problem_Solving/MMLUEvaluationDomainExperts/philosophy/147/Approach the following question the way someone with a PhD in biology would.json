    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.  For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\nA: from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB: since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC: our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.",

    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing it through the lens of innate knowledge and biological development. Plato's argument hinges on the concept that all knowledge is innate and not derived from sensory experience alone. \n\nFrom a biological perspective, the idea of innate knowledge raises questions about the role of genetics and the environment in shaping cognitive development. Studies in developmental psychology have shown that infants are born with certain innate abilities and predispositions that influence their learning and understanding of the world. However, this innate knowledge is often refined and shaped through sensory experiences and interactions with the environment.\n\nIn terms of Plato's argument, option D aligns most closely with the idea that knowledge is triggered by sensory experience rather than solely derived from it. This concept resonates with current understanding in biology, which emphasizes the complex interplay between genetics, experience, and cognition in shaping an individual's knowledge and understanding of the world.\n\nTherefore, as a biologist, I would argue that while innate knowledge may play a role in shaping our understanding of the world, it is not the sole determinant of knowledge acquisition. Sensory experience and interactions with the environment also play a crucial role in shaping our cognitive development and understanding of the world.",
