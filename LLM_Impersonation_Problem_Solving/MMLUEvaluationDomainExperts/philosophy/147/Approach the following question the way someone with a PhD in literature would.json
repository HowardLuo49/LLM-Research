    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.  For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\nA: from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB: since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC: our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.",

    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is essential to approach this question by delving into Plato's philosophical perspective on knowledge and the nature of reality. Plato posits that true knowledge can only be attained by transcending the world of appearances and sensory perception to access the realm of the Forms or essences. This means that genuine knowledge is not derived from empirical observation or sensory experience alone, but rather from a deeper understanding of the universal, unchanging principles that underlie the physical world.\n\nTherefore, in considering the various options presented in the question, it becomes apparent that the correct answer is D. Plato argues that since knowledge cannot be based on the constantly changing and imperfect world of sensory experience, it must stem from a deeper, innate source within the human mind. In other words, our innate knowledge is triggered by sensory experiences but is ultimately grounded in a higher form of understanding that transcends the material world.\n\nIt is crucial to understand the nuanced philosophical implications of Plato's theory of knowledge in order to appreciate the depth and complexity of his ideas. By engaging with the text and considering the implications of Plato's arguments, a scholar with a PhD in literature can provide a nuanced and insightful analysis of this question.",
