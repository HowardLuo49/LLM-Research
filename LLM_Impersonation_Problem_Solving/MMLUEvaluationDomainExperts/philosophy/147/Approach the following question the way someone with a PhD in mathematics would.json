    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.  For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\nA: from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB: since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC: our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.",

    "gpt_response": "D: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n\nBased on Plato's theory of Forms, knowledge is not acquired through sensory experience but rather through accessing these perfect, unchanging Forms that exist beyond the physical world. Therefore, our innate knowledge must be triggered by sensory experience, but it is not derived from it. This is because the changing and imperfect nature of sensory experience cannot provide the foundation for the certain and unchanging knowledge that Plato believed in.",
