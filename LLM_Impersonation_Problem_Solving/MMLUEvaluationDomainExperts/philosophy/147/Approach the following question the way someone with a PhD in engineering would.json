    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.  For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\nA: from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB: since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC: our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.",

    "gpt_response": "From a PhD in engineering perspective, the idea that all knowledge is innate according to Plato can be understood in terms of how engineers approach understanding and constructing systems. Engineers rely on fundamental principles and theories to design and analyze systems, and these principles are often based on idealized models that represent the true essence of the system in question.\n\nIn engineering, for example, when designing a bridge, engineers do not base their understanding of structural mechanics solely on examining individual bridges in the physical world. Instead, they rely on mathematical models and theories that describe the ideal behavior of structural elements to ensure the safety and stability of the bridge. This approach allows engineers to have a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the system they are working with, beyond just the specific instances they encounter in the physical world.\n\nSimilarly, Plato's idea that knowledge is innate because it is based on grasping the Forms or essences of things reflects a similar approach to understanding the world. By looking beyond the particular, changing objects in the sensible world and focusing on the ideal Forms that underlie them, we can attain a more profound and enduring knowledge of the world. This perspective emphasizes the importance of abstract reasoning and critical thinking in acquiring knowledge, rather than relying solely on sensory experience.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to why knowledge is innate according to Plato would be D: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience. This aligns with the idea that true knowledge transcends the particulars of the sensory world and is grounded in the immutable and eternal Forms that shape our understanding of reality.",
