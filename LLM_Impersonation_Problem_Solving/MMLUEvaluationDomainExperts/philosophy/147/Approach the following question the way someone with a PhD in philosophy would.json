    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.  For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\nA: from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB: since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC: our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by delving into Plato's theory of Forms and the nature of knowledge. According to Plato, knowledge is not derived from sensory experience but from the contemplation of the Forms or universal essences that exist beyond the material world. These Forms are the true reality, while the objects we perceive through our senses are merely imperfect copies or reflections of these Forms.\n\nPlato argues that true knowledge is innate because it is based on our ability to access these Forms through reason, rather than through sensory experience. This is in contrast to opinion, which is based on the changing and uncertain world of sensory perception. Therefore, the answer choice that best aligns with Plato's reasoning would be D: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience. This reflects Plato's view that sensory experience can only trigger our recollection of innate knowledge, rather than being the source of true knowledge itself.",
