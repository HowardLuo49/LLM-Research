    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing the concept of prima facie duties within the context of ethical theories such as deontology. Prima facie duties are moral principles that are binding unless they conflict with a stronger moral obligation. In engineering ethics, these duties could include principles such as honesty, integrity, and protection of public safety.\n\nC: is right.\n\nPrima facie duties serve as guidelines for ethical decision-making and help engineers navigate complex moral dilemmas in their professional practice. These duties are not absolute, but they provide a framework for ethical reasoning and action. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that a characteristic of an act in virtue of which the act is right.",
