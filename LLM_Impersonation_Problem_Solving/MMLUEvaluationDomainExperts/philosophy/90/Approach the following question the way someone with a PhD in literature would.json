A prima facie duty is a characteristic of an act in virtue of which the act:\nA: seems to be right, although this might be illusory.\nB: tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.\nC: is right.\nD: is the first thing that an agent ought to do, above all else.",

    "gpt_response": "A prima facie duty is a type of moral obligation that appears to be right at first glance, although upon closer examination, it may be determined to be overridden by other moral considerations. This concept, introduced by philosopher W.D. Ross, suggests that there are multiple factors to consider when determining the moral rightness of an action, and that prima facie duties serve as initial guidelines rather than absolute rules. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\nB: tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.",
