In the context of ethical decision-making, a prima facie duty does not necessarily always dictate the correct course of action, but rather provides a presumptive reason to act in a certain way.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of an act in virtue of which the act is considered a prima facie duty is that it seems to be right, although this perception may be illusory in cases where other, more compelling moral obligations exist.
