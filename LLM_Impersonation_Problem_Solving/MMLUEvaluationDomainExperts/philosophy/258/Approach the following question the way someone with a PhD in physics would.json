In this case, the question is discussing the behavior of individuals who endorse ideals without considering whether those ideals align with promoting people's interests. \n\nIn the context of ethics and moral philosophy, individuals who adhere strictly to their ideals without regard for the consequences on others could be considered as either amoralists, immoralists, or fanatics. \n\nAmoralists are individuals who do not consider morals or ethics in their actions or decisions. They may not actively seek to harm others, but they also do not prioritize the well-being of others in their decision-making. \n\nImmoralists, on the other hand, actively reject moral norms and principles, intentionally acting against them even if it causes harm to others. \n\nFanatics are individuals who are extremely zealous or enthusiastic about a particular cause or belief, often to the point of being overly dogmatic and intolerant of differing perspectives.
