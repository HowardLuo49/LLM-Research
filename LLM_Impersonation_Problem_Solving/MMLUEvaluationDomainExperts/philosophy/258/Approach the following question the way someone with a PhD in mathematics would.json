A PhD in mathematics would approach this question by first recognizing that the terms \"fanatics,\" \"amoralists,\" \"immoralists,\" and \"maniacs\" all carry different connotations and implications.\n\nTaking a deductive approach, a PhD in mathematics would likely start by defining each term:\n\n- Fanatics are people who have an extreme and uncritical enthusiasm or zeal for a particular cause or belief, often to the point of irrationality. They may blindly endorse ideals without considering the consequences for individuals.\n- Amoralists are individuals who do not consider moral principles or concerns when making decisions or endorsing ideals. They may prioritize their own interests or objectives without regard for ethical considerations.\n- Immoralists are individuals who actively violate moral principles or standards, knowingly acting in ways that harm others or contradict societal norms.\n- Maniacs are individuals who exhibit extreme or violent behavior, often as a result of mental instability or emotional distress.\n\nBased on these definitions, a PhD in mathematics would likely reason that Hare, who endorses ideals without regard for whether people\u2019s interests are pursued by them, could be most appropriately categorized as an amoralist. This classification suggests that Hare lacks moral considerations in their actions and decision-making processes, prioritizing other factors over ethical concerns.",
