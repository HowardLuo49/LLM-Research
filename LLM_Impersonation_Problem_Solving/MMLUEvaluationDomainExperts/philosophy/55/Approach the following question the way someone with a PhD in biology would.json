    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. Socrates' claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" is often cited as a central theme in the activities of people.  By it, Socrates is typically understood to mean that:\nA: it is sometimes simply not worth all the effort of examining life and its problems in great detail; sometimes it is better simply to \"go with the flow.\"\nB: while taking a reflective attitude toward life is interesting and even sometimes important, most of what makes life worth living is not worth examining.\nC: simply doing whatever everyone else does without thinking about why we should do what we do can hardly be thought of as worthwhile, noble, or admirable.\nD: it is a waste of time to sit around thinking about whether life is worth living; we should leave such reflection to talk-show hosts, political figures, and religious leaders.",

    "gpt_response": "C: simply doing whatever everyone else does without thinking about why we should do what we do can hardly be thought of as worthwhile, noble, or admirable.\n\nAs a person with a PhD in biology, I would interpret Socrates' claim in a way that emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and self-reflection in our actions and decisions. The scientific process involves questioning assumptions, examining evidence, and critically evaluating information in order to gain a deeper understanding of the natural world. In the same way, Socrates is urging individuals to question societal norms, personal beliefs, and the meaning of life itself in order to live a more fulfilling and meaningful existence. This approach aligns with the scientific method, which emphasizes the value of skepticism, curiosity, and the pursuit of truth through rigorous examination and analysis. Therefore, option C best captures the essence of Socrates' assertion from a biological perspective.",
