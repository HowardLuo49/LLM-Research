    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Socrates' claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" is often cited as a central theme in the activities of people.  By it, Socrates is typically understood to mean that:\nA: it is sometimes simply not worth all the effort of examining life and its problems in great detail; sometimes it is better simply to \"go with the flow.\"\nB: while taking a reflective attitude toward life is interesting and even sometimes important, most of what makes life worth living is not worth examining.\nC: simply doing whatever everyone else does without thinking about why we should do what we do can hardly be thought of as worthwhile, noble, or admirable.\nD: it is a waste of time to sit around thinking about whether life is worth living; we should leave such reflection to talk-show hosts, political figures, and religious leaders.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by analyzing Socrates' claim through a logical and rational lens. Socrates' assertion that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" can be interpreted as advocating for a mindful and introspective approach to life.\n\nOption A suggests that sometimes it is not worth the effort to examine life in great detail and that it is better to simply go with the flow. This goes against the essence of Socrates' claim, as it implies a passive and uninquisitive attitude towards life, contradicting the idea of living a meaningful and examined life.\n\nOption B acknowledges the importance of a reflective attitude towards life but implies that most of what makes life worth living is not worth examining. This interpretation downplays the significance of self-reflection and critical thinking in shaping one's values and beliefs, which is fundamental to Socrates' philosophy.\n\nOption D dismisses the act of contemplating the value and purpose of life as a waste of time, suggesting that such reflection should be reserved for certain individuals like talk-show hosts, political figures, and religious leaders. This view diminishes the importance of personal introspection and intellectual inquiry in fostering personal growth and self-awareness, which goes against Socrates' emphasis on the examined life being the only one worth living.\n\nIn conclusion, as a mathematician, I would argue that option C aligns most closely with Socrates' original intent, as it emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and self-examination in determining the worth and value of one's life. Socrates' claim encourages individuals to question societal norms and conventions, fostering personal growth and ethical integrity through introspection and self-awareness.",
