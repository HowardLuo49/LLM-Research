    "gpt_response": "As a Ph.D. in engineering, my approach to this question would be grounded in a rational and analytical perspective. Augustine, a theologian and philosopher, identifies evil as the absence of good, which aligns with his philosophical framework of metaphysical dualism. In this view, evil is not a unique force in opposition to goodness, but rather the lack or deficiency of goodness. This understanding is consistent with Augustine's Christian beliefs, where evil is seen as a privation or distortion of the perfect goodness that God embodies. Therefore, the correct answer would be B: the absence of good.",
