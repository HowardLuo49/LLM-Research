Descartes was a prominent philosopher and mathematician who made significant contributions to the fields of metaphysics and epistemology.\n\nDescartes argued that the chief characteristic of physical things is that they have extension. This means that physical things occupy space and have three-dimensional size and shape. This concept of extension is fundamental to the material world and is a key aspect of our understanding of physical objects.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer to the question would be:\n\nD: they have extension\n\nI would also consider the other options provided and explain why they are not the most appropriate choice based on Descartes' philosophy and our understanding of physical objects in the context of engineering.",
