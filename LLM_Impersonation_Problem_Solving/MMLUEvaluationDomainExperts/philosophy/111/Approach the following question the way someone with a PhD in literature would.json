    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would interpret Descartes' assertion in the context of his philosophical beliefs regarding the nature of physical things. Descartes is renowned for his dualistic philosophy, which distinguishes between the mind (res cogitans) and the body (res extensa). In this framework, physical things are associated with extension, meaning they occupy space and have geometric properties such as length, width, and depth. Therefore, the correct answer is D: they have extension. This characteristic is central to Descartes' understanding of the physical world as separate from the realm of consciousness and thought.",
