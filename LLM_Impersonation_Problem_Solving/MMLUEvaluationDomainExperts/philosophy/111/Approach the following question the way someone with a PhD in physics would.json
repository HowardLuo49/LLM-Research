    "gpt_response": "D: they have extension\n\nDescartes believed that the chief characteristic of physical things is that they have extension, meaning they occupy space and have a definitive shape and size. This belief was foundational to his understanding of the physical world and its interactions with the mind and consciousness. As a result, he argued that physical things could be quantified and studied using mathematics and the scientific method. This perspective on extension and physical characteristics continues to influence modern physics and our understanding of the natural world.",
