    "gpt_response": "In accordance with Aquinas' philosophical teachings, an infinite regress of causes is deemed impossible. Aquinas posited that an infinite regress of causes violates the principle that everything in the world must have a sufficient reason or cause for its existence. This leads to the conclusion that there must be a first cause, or uncaused cause, which Aquinas identified as God. Consequently, Aquinas believed that an infinite regress of causes is not feasible within his philosophical framework.",
