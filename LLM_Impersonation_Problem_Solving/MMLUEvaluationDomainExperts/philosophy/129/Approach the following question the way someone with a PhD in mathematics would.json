Aquinas, a prominent medieval philosopher and theologian, argued that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.\n\nTo support this claim, Aquinas would likely rely on his understanding of causal chains and the notion of a first cause, which he identified as God. In his famous cosmological argument, Aquinas posited that for any series of causes and effects to exist, there must ultimately be a first cause that initiates the chain of causation. Without this first cause, the entire causal chain would lack a foundation and could not exist. \n\nIn the context of an infinite regress of causes, Aquinas would argue that such a chain would never have a beginning or ultimate cause, leading to an infinite regression that is logically untenable. This is because an infinite regress would necessitate an infinite number of causes, which Aquinas believed was absurd and contradictory.
