    "gpt_response": "In Aquinas's view, man's ultimate happiness consists in contemplating God. This belief stems from Aquinas's metaphysical framework, which posits that God is the ultimate source of all that is good and perfect. Therefore, by contemplating God and seeking to understand His divine nature, man can achieve true fulfillment and ultimate happiness. This notion is grounded in Aquinas's understanding of the hierarchy of goods, in which spiritual goods are considered superior to material goods. Consequently, acts of the moral virtues and loving God are seen as means to an end \u2013 namely, contemplation of God \u2013 rather than ends in themselves.",
