In Aquinas's philosophical perspective, man's ultimate happiness is intricately tied to his understanding of his relationship with God. Aquinas believed that true happiness and fulfillment could only be achieved through the contemplation and love of God.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question would be:\n\nD: Contemplating God.\n\nThis perspective aligns with Aquinas's belief that true happiness comes from seeking a deeper understanding and connection with God, rather than seeking fleeting pleasures or simply following moral virtues. It is through this contemplation and love of God that man can find ultimate fulfillment and happiness according to Aquinas's philosophy.",
