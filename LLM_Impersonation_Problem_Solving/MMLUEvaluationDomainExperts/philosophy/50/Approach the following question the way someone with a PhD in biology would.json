    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by considering Aquinas's philosophical and theological perspectives on the nature of human happiness and fulfillment. Aquinas, a renowned medieval theologian and philosopher, believed that man's ultimate happiness lies in contemplation of and union with God. This aligns with his overall belief in the existence of a divine creator and the idea that humans are most fulfilled when they are connected to and aligned with their ultimate purpose and source of being.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, one could argue that contemplation and union with God may have physiological and psychological benefits for humans. It is well-established in scientific research that practices like meditation and mindfulness, which involve focused attention and contemplation, can have positive effects on mental health, stress levels, and overall well-being. Therefore, one could potentially make the case that striving for a state of contemplation and union with God, as advocated by Aquinas, could contribute to a person's overall happiness and sense of fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Aquinas's views and considering potential biological implications, it can be argued that man's ultimate happiness consists in contemplating and loving God.",
