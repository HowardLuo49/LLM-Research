In this framework, the meaning of a term is not determined solely by empirical observations or psychological causes and effects, as options A and B suggest. \n\nOption D, which proposes that the meaning of a term is determined by its synonyms, also does not align with Stevenson's view. He would argue that the meaning of a term is not confined to its relationship with other words, but rather is rooted in the emotions and attitudes that it conveys.\n\nTherefore, Stevenson would most likely align with option C, which posits that the meaning of a term is determined by the psychological causes and effects it tends to be connected with. This aligns with Stevenson's view that moral terms are expressions of emotions and attitudes, and that their meaning is derived from the emotional reactions they provoke.",
