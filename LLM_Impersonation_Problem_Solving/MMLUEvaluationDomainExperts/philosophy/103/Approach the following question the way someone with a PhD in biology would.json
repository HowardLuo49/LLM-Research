    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, it is important to understand that aesthetic value is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be influenced by various cognitive and emotional factors. Hume, a prominent philosopher, argues that the criteria for judging aesthetic value are entirely subjective. This view aligns with the idea that individual perceptions and preferences play a significant role in determining the aesthetic value of an object or experience. However, it is also crucial to acknowledge that certain objective factors, such as symmetry, color contrast, and complexity, can also influence our aesthetic judgments to some extent. Ultimately, the exact criteria for judging aesthetic value remain a topic of ongoing debate and research within the field of aesthetics.",
