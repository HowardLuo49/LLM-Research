In his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume posits that aesthetic judgments are based on individual sentiments and emotions, rather than objective standards or universal principles. According to Hume, beauty is not an inherent property of an object but rather exists in the mind of the beholder. Therefore, aesthetic value is ultimately determined by the subjective experience and perception of the individual. Hume's perspective challenges the notion of fixed criteria for evaluating aesthetics and emphasizes the importance of personal preference and cultural context in shaping our aesthetic judgments.",
