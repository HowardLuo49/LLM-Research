    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by considering the philosophical implications of Hume's argument. Hume, a prominent figure in the field of aesthetics, is known for his empiricist philosophy. In his work, he explores the nature of aesthetic judgment and the criteria for determining aesthetic value.\n\nBased on my mathematical background, I would analyze Hume's argument in terms of epistemological and ontological considerations. Hume's position on aesthetic value may be rooted in his broader philosophical framework, which emphasizes the importance of experience and sensory perception in shaping our understanding of the world.\n\nTherefore, in response to the question, I would argue that Hume likely posits that the criteria for judging aesthetic value are entirely subjective, as they are based on individual perceptions and experiences rather than universal or objective standards. This aligns with Hume's empiricist views, which prioritize sensory experience as the foundation of knowledge and understanding.",
