David Hume, a prominent figure in the history of philosophy, presents a perspective that may not directly align with the scientific method typically employed in physics, but his insights can still be valuable in considering the nature of aesthetic judgment.\n\nHume's argument regarding the criteria for judging aesthetic value being entirely subjective takes into account the inherent variability in individual perceptions and emotions that influence our aesthetic preferences. From a physics standpoint, this aligns with the understanding that human experiences and interpretations can be influenced by a multitude of factors, making it difficult to establish a definitive set of objective criteria for determining aesthetic value.\n\nWhile the subjective nature of aesthetic judgment is a key aspect highlighted by Hume, it is important to note that this does not necessarily negate the existence of objective elements that can contribute to our appreciation of art and beauty. Ultimately, the question of whether aesthetic value is entirely subjective, entirely objective, unchangeable, or unknown remains a matter of philosophical debate that may not have a definitive answer and can be approached from different perspectives, including that of a physicist with a PhD.",
