    "gpt_response": "A: cause behavior\n\nLogical behaviorism is a philosophical position that emphasizes the idea that mental states are identical to behavioral dispositions or tendencies. This perspective rejects the notion of mental states as separate entities or properties and instead asserts that mental states can be fully and exhaustively described in terms of observable behaviors. Therefore, from the perspective of logical behaviorism, mental states directly cause behavior as they are essentially one and the same. This is in line with the scientific approach of explaining phenomena in terms of observable and measurable outcomes, which is the foundation of modern biology.",
