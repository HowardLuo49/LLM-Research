According to logical behaviorism, mental states are not causally related to behavior; rather, they are simply behavioral dispositions or tendencies. This perspective denies the existence of mental states as independently existing entities and instead sees them as nothing more than ways of describing behavior. This rejection of the causal relationship between mental states and behavior challenges our everyday understanding of how our thoughts, beliefs, and desires influence our actions.",
