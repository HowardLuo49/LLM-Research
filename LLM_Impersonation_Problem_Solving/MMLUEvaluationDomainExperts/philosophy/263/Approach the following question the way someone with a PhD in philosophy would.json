    "gpt_response": "Logical behaviorism challenges our commonsense intuitions by asserting that mental states are simply dispositions to behave in certain ways. This view holds that there are no independent mental processes or entities that govern behavior, but rather that our mental states can be identified solely by observing our external actions. This stands in direct opposition to the common belief that mental states exist as distinct entities that cause behavior. Therefore, it can be argued that from a logical behaviorist perspective, mental states do not exist in the traditional sense that we commonly understand them, but are instead reducible to behavioral dispositions.",
