Singer's argument challenges the traditional distinction between egoism and altruism, as it centers around the concept of effective altruism and the moral imperative to alleviate suffering and promote well-being on a global scale.\n\nBy advocating for individuals to maximize their impact through reasoned and evidence-based charitable giving, Singer argues that traditional egoistic considerations such as self-interest or personal gain should be subordinate to the greater good and the alleviation of global poverty and suffering. In this sense, Singer's argument challenges the binary distinction between egoism (acting in self-interest) and altruism (selfless concern for the well-being of others), proposing a more nuanced approach that prioritizes effective altruistic actions based on rational and ethical considerations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question posed is:\n\nB: egoism and altruism.",
