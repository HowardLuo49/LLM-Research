    "gpt_response": "A PhD in biology would likely approach this question by analyzing Singer's argument in the context of ethical considerations related to biology, including the relationship between individuals and their environments, as well as the principles of altruism and egoism in evolutionary biology. They may consider how Singer's argument challenges traditional ethical frameworks in biology, particularly in terms of social behaviors and cooperation among species. \n\nBased on this analysis, the PhD in biology would likely conclude that Singer's argument upsets the traditional distinction between egoism and altruism (option B). This is because Singer's argument often promotes the idea of altruism, particularly in terms of helping others and reducing suffering, which goes against the self-serving nature of egoism. \n\nIn summary, the PhD in biology would approach this question by applying principles of evolutionary biology and ethical considerations to analyze Singer's argument and determine how it challenges traditional distinctions between egoism and altruism.",
