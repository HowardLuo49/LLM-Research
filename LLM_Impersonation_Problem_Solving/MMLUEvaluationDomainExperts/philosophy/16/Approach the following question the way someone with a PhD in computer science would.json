    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question with a focus on logic and critical thinking. Singer's argument challenges conventional ethical frameworks by critiquing the traditional distinction between self-interest (egoism) and concern for others (altruism). He argues for a more utilitarian approach that prioritizes maximizing overall welfare, regardless of whether the beneficiary is oneself or others. This challenges the binary thinking that often characterizes debates on ethics and morality. Therefore, the answer is B: egoism and altruism.",
