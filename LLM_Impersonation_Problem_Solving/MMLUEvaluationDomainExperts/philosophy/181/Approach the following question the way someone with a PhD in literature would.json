    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The biblical account of the soul is at odds with the idea of a monistic soul. In the biblical tradition, the soul is often described as a distinct entity that exists separately from the body, capable of surviving after death and facing judgment. This dualistic view contrasts with the monistic conception of the soul, which posits that the soul and body are ultimately inseparable and constitute a unified whole. This tension between dualism and monism in the understanding of the soul raises profound questions about the nature of human existence and the relationship between mind, body, and spirit. Scholars of literature may explore these conflicting perspectives on the soul through textual analysis and historical research, illuminating the complex interplay of religious beliefs, philosophical ideas, and cultural influences that shape our understanding of the soul.",
