    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "C: soul-body dualism\n\nFrom a philosophical and theological perspective, the biblical account of the soul is often interpreted as supporting a view of soul-body dualism. This notion posits that the soul and body are distinct and separable entities, with the soul being the spiritual, immortal essence of a person and the body being the physical, mortal aspect. This is in contrast to a unitary concept of the soul, which sees the soul and body as one holistic entity. Additionally, the biblical account contradicts the identity theory, which posits that the mind and brain are the same thing, by emphasizing the immaterial nature of the soul. Finally, the biblical account also conflicts with the idea of a monistic soul, which argues for a singular, unified essence of the self, rather than distinct parts like the soul and body.",
