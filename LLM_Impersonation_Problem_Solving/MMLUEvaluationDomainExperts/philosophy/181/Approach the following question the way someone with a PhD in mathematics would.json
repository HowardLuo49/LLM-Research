Given this approach, the PhD in mathematics would likely argue that option D, the idea of a monistic soul, is at odds with the biblical account of the soul. The concept of a monistic soul suggests that the soul is a single, unified entity, while the biblical account of the soul often portrays it as having several distinct aspects or properties. This discrepancy in understanding the nature of the soul could lead to mathematical inconsistencies and challenges in interpreting the biblical text.",
