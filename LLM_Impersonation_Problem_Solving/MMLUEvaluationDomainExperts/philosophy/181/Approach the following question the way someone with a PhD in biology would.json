    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "A PhD in biology would approach this question by focusing on empirical evidence and scientific analysis to examine the concept of the soul as presented in the Bible. The biblical account typically portrays the soul as a distinct, immaterial entity that is separate from the physical body. This perspective is at odds with the concept of a unitary soul, which suggests that the mind and body are inseparable and interdependent. In addition, the biblical portrayal of the soul conflicts with the identity theory, which posits that mental states are identical to physical brain states. Similarly, the biblical view of a soul-body dualism contradicts the idea of a monistic soul, which asserts that the mind and body are ultimately reducible to one underlying substance. Thus, a PhD in biology would likely highlight these discrepancies and explore how scientific understanding of consciousness and the mind-body relationship can inform and potentially challenge traditional religious perspectives on the nature of the soul.",
