These factors can be considered \"free and unhindered\" in the sense that we have the ability to exert our will and make choices within our power.\n\nOn the other hand, in biology, there are numerous external factors and variables that are beyond our control, such as environmental conditions, genetic predispositions, and evolutionary pressures.
