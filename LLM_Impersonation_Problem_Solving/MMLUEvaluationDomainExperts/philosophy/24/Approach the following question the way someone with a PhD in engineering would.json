Epictetus suggests that our true power lies in our ability to control our own attitudes and reactions to external events, while external circumstances and events themselves are beyond our control and subject to the whims of fate.\n\nTherefore, \"things within our power are free and unhindered\" because we have the freedom to choose our responses and actions in any given situation, while \"things not in our power are servile and subject to hindrance\" because they are determined by external factors that we cannot influence. This distinction helps individuals focus on what they can control and accept what is beyond their control, leading to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.",
