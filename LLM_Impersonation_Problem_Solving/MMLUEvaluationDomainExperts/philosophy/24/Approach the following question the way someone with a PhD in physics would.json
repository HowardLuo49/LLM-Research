    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I would approach this question by analyzing the dichotomy presented by Epictetus in the context of determinism and free will. In physics, the concept of determinism suggests that all events are predetermined by physical laws, while free will implies that individuals have the power to make choices that are not bound by external factors. \n\nIn this context, Epictetus's assertion that things within our power are \"free and unhindered\" suggests that individuals have control over their own thoughts, beliefs, and actions, which are not predetermined by external factors. This aligns with the concept of free will, where individuals have the ability to make choices that are not subject to external constraints.\n\nOn the other hand, Epictetus's claim that things not in our power are \"servile and subject to hindrance\" implies that external events and circumstances are beyond our control and can influence our lives in a deterministic way. This aligns with the concept of determinism, where events are predetermined by external factors that are beyond individual control.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the correct answer would be:\n\nC: servile and subject to hindrance; free and unhindered.",
