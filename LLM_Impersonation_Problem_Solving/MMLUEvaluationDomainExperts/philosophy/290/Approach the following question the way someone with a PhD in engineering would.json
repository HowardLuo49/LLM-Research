    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is D: All of the above.\n\nResearchers and scholars with a PhD in engineering often encounter frustrations when writing or reading about research ethics. One common frustration is the differing opinions on what is considered ethically acceptable in research. This can lead to debates and disagreements among researchers and scholars on the ethical implications of their work.\n\nAnother common frustration is the repetition of the same ethical debates and discussions over the course of decades. Despite advancements in research ethics and guidelines, certain ethical dilemmas continue to resurface, leading to a sense of stagnation in the field.\n\nMoreover, cases of ethical violations in research are often associated with certain research methods, such as data fabrication or plagiarism. These cases can undermine the credibility of research and highlight the importance of consistently addressing and upholding ethical standards in research practices.\n\nOverall, the field of research ethics is complex and multifaceted, with numerous challenges and frustrations that researchers and scholars with a PhD in engineering must navigate in their work.",
