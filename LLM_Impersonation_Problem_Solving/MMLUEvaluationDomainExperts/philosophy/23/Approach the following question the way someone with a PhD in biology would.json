    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. Philosophy is concerned primarily with identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs.  These activities can be summarized in two questions that drive philosophical investigations:\nA: why should we bother? and what are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?\nB: what do you mean? and how do you know?\nC: who really believes X? and how can we explain differences in people's beliefs?\nD: how do philosophers argue? and are their differences important?",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The approach of a biologist with a PhD to these questions would likely focus on empirical evidence and logical reasoning. \n\nIn response to question A, a biologist would likely consider the importance of understanding human existence from a scientific perspective. They may argue that investigating beliefs about human existence can lead to a greater understanding of the biological and evolutionary factors that shape our perceptions and behaviors.\n\nRegarding question B, a biologist may interpret this as a call for clarity and precision in definitions and evidence. They may emphasize the importance of using scientific methods to test and validate hypotheses about human existence.\n\nFor question C, a biologist may examine the genetic, environmental, and social factors that influence individuals' beliefs about human existence. They may also explore how these beliefs can vary across cultures and populations.\n\nIn addressing question D, a biologist may analyze the methods and techniques used by philosophers to build and evaluate arguments about human existence. They may assess the validity and relevance of these differences in philosophical approaches, and consider how they may impact our understanding of human existence from a biological perspective.",
