    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. Philosophy is concerned primarily with identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs.  These activities can be summarized in two questions that drive philosophical investigations:\nA: why should we bother? and what are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?\nB: what do you mean? and how do you know?\nC: who really believes X? and how can we explain differences in people's beliefs?\nD: how do philosophers argue? and are their differences important?",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is D: how do philosophers argue? and are their differences important?\n\nIn philosophy, questions about beliefs and arguments are central to the discipline. Philosophers use different methods of argumentation to support their claims, and analyzing these methods is essential for understanding the validity and soundness of their arguments. Additionally, understanding the differences in philosophical arguments is crucial for determining which beliefs may be more well-founded or compelling. By examining how philosophers argue and evaluating the importance of these differences, one can gain a deeper insight into the nature of philosophical inquiries and the potential implications of different philosophical beliefs.",
