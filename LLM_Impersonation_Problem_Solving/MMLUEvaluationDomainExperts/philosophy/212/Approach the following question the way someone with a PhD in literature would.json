    "gpt_response": "When examining Euthyphro's attempted definition of the holy as prosecuting wrongdoers, one must consider the nuances and complexities of the concept. A PhD in literature would approach this question by delving into the deeper implications of Socrates' objection. In this context, Socrates' objection that there are many other things that are also holy speaks to the multifaceted nature of the concept of holiness and the limitations of reducing it to a single action such as prosecuting wrongdoers. Furthermore, Socrates' objection that prosecuting wrongdoers is not always holy highlights the ethical ambiguity surrounding the pursuit of justice and the potential for moral nuance in determining what actions are truly virtuous or pious. Lastly, Socrates' objection that there is disagreement about what counts as \"wrongdoing\" draws attention to the subjective nature of moral judgments and the challenges of reaching a consensus on ethical matters.\n\nTherefore, a PhD in literature would likely argue that all of the above objections raised by Socrates are valid and contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in defining the holy. This interpretation would emphasize the importance of critically analyzing and interrogating philosophical concepts in order to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of moral and ethical principles.",
