    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would.  In his discussion of the Divided Line, Plato says that, in contrast to mere belief or opinion, knowledge is a belief for which we give reasons or justifications by appealing:\nA: to what our senses reveal to us about how things appear to us, not how they  really are.\nB: beyond the Forms to images of goodness, beauty, and truth obtained from particular objects.\nC: to what we sincerely believe is true about the Forms based on our experiences in the world.\nD: beyond sense experience to unchanging ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing Plato's concept of the Divided Line and the different layers of knowledge he presents within it. In this context, Plato distinguishes between mere belief or opinion on one end of the spectrum, and true knowledge on the other end. Knowledge, according to Plato, is a belief that is justified through reasoned argument or appeal to certain foundations.\n\nIn considering Plato's options in this question, it is clear that the correct answer aligns with Plato's epistemology, which posits that true knowledge transcends mere sensory experience and belief. The correct answer, D, points towards knowledge being grounded in unchanging ideas or Forms that are accessible through rational perception, rather than through our senses or empirical experiences alone.\n\nThis understanding of Plato's philosophical framework allows us to appreciate the deeper implications of his theory of knowledge and the role that reason plays in distinguishing true knowledge from mere belief. Through a critical engagement with Plato's Divided Line and his broader philosophy, we can gain insight into the nature of knowledge, perception, and reality as explored by this foundational thinker in the history of philosophy.",
