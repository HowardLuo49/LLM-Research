    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. According to Socrates, an unexamined life is not worth living; and it certainly could not be a virtuous life.  Why not?\nA: Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.\nB: Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.\nC: Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.\nD: Because a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own.",

An unexamined life, according to Socrates, is one in which an individual fails to critically reflect on their beliefs, values, and actions. Without this self-examination, one cannot truly understand what it means to live a virtuous life. \n\nIn order to act virtuously, one must understand the reasons behind their actions and beliefs. Without critically assessing these beliefs and values, one may simply be following societal norms or personal desires without questioning whether these actions are morally right. This lack of self-awareness and reflection ultimately leads to a superficial and inauthentic way of life that Socrates would argue is not worth living.",
