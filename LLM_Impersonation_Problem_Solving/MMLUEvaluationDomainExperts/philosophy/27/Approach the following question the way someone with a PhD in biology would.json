    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. According to Socrates, an unexamined life is not worth living; and it certainly could not be a virtuous life.  Why not?\nA: Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.\nB: Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.\nC: Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.\nD: Because a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own.",

By examining one's life and actions, individuals are able to understand the underlying principles that govern virtuous behavior. Without this introspection and analysis, individuals would merely be following societal norms without truly understanding the reasons behind their actions. This lack of self-awareness and understanding would prevent individuals from truly embodying virtue in their lives. Thus, an unexamined life would not be considered virtuous according to Socrates' philosophical principles.",
