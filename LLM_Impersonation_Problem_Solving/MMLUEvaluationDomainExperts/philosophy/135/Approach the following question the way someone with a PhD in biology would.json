    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. For Plato, ordinary sensible objects exist and are knowable as examples or instances of Ideas or \"Forms\" that do not exist in our ordinary sensible world.  Forms do not exist in the sensible world because:\nA: in the sensible world only mathematical objects (e.g., triangles) can be known using hypotheses which are recollected when we are asked the right kinds of questions.\nB: unlike everything in the sensible world, Forms are not individual things but rather the universal essences or natures by which individual things are what they are and are known.\nC: nothing in the sensible, experienced world could exist or be identified as one particular thing or another unless there were a \"Sensible World\" Form (like the Form of beauty or justice).\nD: the sensible world consists of changing Forms that exist and are known in terms of other changing Forms, which in turn exist and are known in terms of yet others in an endless regress.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "B: unlike everything in the sensible world, Forms are not individual things but rather the universal essences or natures by which individual things are what they are and are known. \n\nA person with a PhD in biology would approach this question by considering Plato's theory of Forms within the context of biological concepts. In the study of biology, individuals are classified based on their shared characteristics and universal essences. This idea of universal essences aligns with Plato's notion of Forms as the universal natures by which individual things are defined.\n\nIn biology, organisms are grouped into categories based on their common traits, such as genetic similarities or ecological roles. These categories serve as universal concepts that help scientists understand the relationships between different organisms and their place within the natural world. This parallels Plato's belief that Forms are the underlying essences that define and distinguish individual objects in the sensible world.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of Forms as universal essences ties into the idea of classification and taxonomy in biology. Just as biologists use classification systems to organize and study organisms, Plato's theory of Forms suggests that there are overarching universal principles that govern the nature of all things in the sensible world.\n\nTherefore, a person with a PhD in biology would likely choose option B as the reason why Forms do not exist in the sensible world, as it resonates with the principles of classification and universal essences that are fundamental to the study of biology.",
