    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For Plato, ordinary sensible objects exist and are knowable as examples or instances of Ideas or \"Forms\" that do not exist in our ordinary sensible world.  Forms do not exist in the sensible world because:\nA: in the sensible world only mathematical objects (e.g., triangles) can be known using hypotheses which are recollected when we are asked the right kinds of questions.\nB: unlike everything in the sensible world, Forms are not individual things but rather the universal essences or natures by which individual things are what they are and are known.\nC: nothing in the sensible, experienced world could exist or be identified as one particular thing or another unless there were a \"Sensible World\" Form (like the Form of beauty or justice).\nD: the sensible world consists of changing Forms that exist and are known in terms of other changing Forms, which in turn exist and are known in terms of yet others in an endless regress.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "B: unlike everything in the sensible world, Forms are not individual things but rather the universal essences or natures by which individual things are what they are and are known. \n\nIn Platonic philosophy, Forms are the ultimate reality, existing beyond the physical world of our senses. These Forms are universal concepts or essences that give rise to the particular objects and phenomena we experience in the sensible world. Therefore, the reason why Forms do not exist in the sensible world is because they are not individual entities but rather the underlying principles that govern and define the individual things in the world. This distinction highlights the transcendental nature of Forms and their role in shaping our understanding of reality.",
