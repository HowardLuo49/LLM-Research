    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember that angular momentum is equal to the product of the mass, velocity, and radius of the orbit. Since the satellites are identical, they have the same mass and velocity. Therefore, the only difference between them is the radius of their orbits.\n\nGiven that the orbital radius of A is twice that of B, we can calculate the ratio of their angular momentum by squaring the ratio of their orbital radii: (2)^2 = 4.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 4.",
