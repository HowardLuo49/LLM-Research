By definition, the electric displacement current through a surface S is proportional to the\nA: rate of change of the electric flux through S\nB: electric flux through S\nC: time integral of the magnetic flux through S\nD: rate of change of the magnetic flux through S",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "A: rate of change of the electric flux through S\n\nThis is because the electric displacement current is directly related to how the electric flux is changing over time through a particular surface. As the electric flux through the surface S changes, the displacement current will also change accordingly.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to A?: A: rate of change of the electric flux through S\n\nThis is because the electric displacement current is directly related to how the electric flux is changing over time through a particular surface. As the electric flux through the surface S changes, the displacement current will also change accordingly.",
