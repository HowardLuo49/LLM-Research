Under certain conditions, a beam of electrons impinging on a crystal surface will diffract and a scattering pattern of the beam can be obtained. What is the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons needed in order to see the pattern? (Assume the lattice spacing of the crystal to be 0.4 nm.)\nA: 0.1 eV\nB: 1 eV\nC: 10 eV\nD: 100 eV",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so I remember learning about diffraction in chemistry class. I know that in order for diffraction to occur, the kinetic energy of the electrons needs to be enough to overcome the forces holding the atoms in the crystal lattice together. Let's see, the lattice spacing is 0.4 nm, which means the distance between the atoms in the crystal. I think I need to calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons using the formula lambda = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the electron. Then I can find the kinetic energy using the formula KE = (hc) / lambda - work function. \n\nOk, let's do the math. The de Broglie wavelength is about 0.04 nm, so the kinetic energy needed should be around 1 eV. So my answer is B: 1 eV.",
