In the case of a superconductor, the ideal conditions imply that the electric and magnetic fields inside it are zero. \n\nJust outside the surface of the superconductor, the behavior of the magnetic field can be inferred using Maxwell's equations. One of Maxwell's equations states that the magnetic field B is divergence-free in the absence of magnetic monopoles. This implies that the magnetic field lines must close upon themselves and flow either perpendicular or tangential to the surface.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C: B is tangential to the surface. This is because the magnetic field lines cannot penetrate the superconductor and must flow parallel to its surface. Additionally, the fact that the magnetic field inside the superconductor is zero implies that there cannot be a sharp discontinuity in the field at the boundary, further supporting the notion that the magnetic field must be tangential to the surface.",
