The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of the Doppler effect. In this scenario, the police car is moving towards a wall and emitting a siren sound at a frequency of 600 Hz. The sound waves emitted by the siren will be compressed in front of the moving car and the frequency perceived by the driver will be higher than 600 Hz.\n\nThe formula for the apparent frequency (f') heard by the driver due to the Doppler effect when the source is moving towards a stationary observer is given by:\n\nf' = f ((v + v\u2080) / (v + vS))\n\nwhere:\nf is the frequency of the source (600 Hz),\nv is the speed of sound (350 m/s),\nv\u2080 is the speed of the observer (3.5 m/s),\nvS is the speed of the source (which is negative since it is moving towards the observer).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf' = 600 ((350 + 3.5) / (350 - 3.5))\nf' = 600 (353.5 / 346.5)\nf' = 611.885 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 612 Hz. The closest answer choice is D: 612 Hz.",
