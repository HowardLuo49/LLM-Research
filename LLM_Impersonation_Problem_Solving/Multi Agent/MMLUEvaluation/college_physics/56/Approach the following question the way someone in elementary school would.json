At one instant, the particle\u2019s speed is 10 meters per second and is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second squared. The angle between the particle\u2019s velocity and acceleration vectors is\nA: 0\u00b0\nB: 30\u00b0\nC: 45\u00b0\nD: 60\u00b0",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so imagine a particle moving in a circle like a merry-go-round. It's going at a speed of 10 meters per second and getting faster by 10 meters per second every second. That's like going faster and faster on the merry-go-round.\n\nNow, the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors is like the angle between how fast it's going and how fast it's getting faster. Since the acceleration is always pointing towards the center of the circle, it's kind of like what happens when you're on a merry-go-round and you feel like you're getting pushed towards the middle.\n\nSo, to find the angle, you think about how the velocity and acceleration vectors are related on the circle. That means the angle between them is 90\u00b0. But since the acceleration is always pointing towards the center of the circle, the angle is actually half of that, which is 45\u00b0.\n\nSo, the answer is C: 45\u00b0.",
