    "gpt_response": "Guys, we know that in the particle's rest frame it decays in 2.0 ms. But now it's moving at 0.60c in the lab frame. So, we need to figure out how far it will travel in the lab frame before decaying. To solve this, we can use the time dilation formula t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2). \n\nPlugging in the values, we get t' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 2.7 ms. \n\nNow, we know the particle will travel at a speed of 0.60c for 2.7 ms before decaying. Therefore, distance traveled = speed x time = 0.60c x 2.7 ms. \n\nAfter calculating this, we find out that the particle will travel 450 m in the lab frame before decaying. So the correct answer is D: 450 m.",
