    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we have a particle that decays in 2.0 ms in its rest frame. That means when the particle is not moving. But now we know it's moving at v=0.60c in the lab frame. So we need to figure out how far it will travel before decaying. \n\nTo do that, we can use the time dilation formula:\nt' = t / \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere:\nt' = time in lab frame\nt = time in rest frame (2.0 ms or 0.002 s)\nv = velocity (0.60c)\nc = speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\nt' = 0.002 / \u221a(1 - (0.60)^2)\nt' = 0.002 / \u221a(1 - 0.36)\nt' = 0.002 / \u221a0.64\nt' = 0.002 / 0.8\nt' = 0.0025 seconds\n\nNow we can calculate how far the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying:\nd = v * t'\nd = 0.60c * 0.0025s\n\nWe know that c is the speed of light, which is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. So,\nd = 0.60 * 3 x 10^8 m/s * 0.0025 s\n\nAfter multiplying these values, we find the answer to be 450 m, which is option D.",
