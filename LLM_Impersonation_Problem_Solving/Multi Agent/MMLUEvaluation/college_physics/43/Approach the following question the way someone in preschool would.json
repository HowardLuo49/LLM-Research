But as it starts to roll, it gets faster and faster. Now, if we think about how much of its energy comes from spinning around (that's called rotational kinetic energy), it's like a piece of the pie. If we were to slice up the whole energy pie for our rolling circle, just one part out of four would be rotational energy. So, the answer is A: 1/4! Yay for rolling circles and learning new things!",
