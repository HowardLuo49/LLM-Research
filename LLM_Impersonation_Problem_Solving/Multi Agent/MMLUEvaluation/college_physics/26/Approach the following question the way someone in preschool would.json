An astronomer observes a very small moon orbiting a planet and measures the moon\u2019s minimum and maximum distances from the planet\u2019s center and the moon\u2019s maximum orbital speed. Which of the following CANNOT be calculated from these measurements?\nA: Mass of the moon\nB: Mass of the planet\nC: Minimum speed of the moon\nD: Period of the orbit",

    "gpt_response": "Ooh, I love space! If the astronomer knows the moon's distance from the planet and its speed, then they can find out lots of things! But I think the mass of the planet might be tricky to figure out with just those measurements. So I think the answer is B: Mass of the planet!",
