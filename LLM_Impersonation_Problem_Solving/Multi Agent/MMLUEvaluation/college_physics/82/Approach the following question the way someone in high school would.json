    "gpt_response": "Okay, so when the electron is in the l = 2 state, that means l is equal to 2. The quantum number m_l can have values from -l to +l. In this case, since l = 2, the possible values for m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. So the number of allowed values for m_l is 5, which means the answer is A: 5.",
