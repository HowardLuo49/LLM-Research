If the Sun were suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass, it would have a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m. What effect, if any, would this change have on the orbits of the planets?\nA: The planets would move directly toward the Sun.\nB: The planets would move in spiral orbits.\nC: The planets would oscillate about their former elliptical orbits.\nD: The orbits would remain unchanged.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by considering the Schwarzschild radius of the hypothetical black hole that replaced the Sun. The Schwarzschild radius represents the radius at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light, defining the event horizon of a black hole. In this case, with a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m, this black hole would have a very small size in comparison to the Sun.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is the same as that of the Sun, the gravitational pull it exerts on the planets would remain unchanged. Therefore, the orbits of the planets would not be affected by the swap of the Sun with a black hole of the same mass. Thus, the correct answer is D: The orbits would remain unchanged.",
