In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest. If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\nA: 0\nB: 1/4\nC: 1/3\nD: 1/2",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So, in this question we've got two particles, one with a mass of 2m and one with a mass of m. The second one is just hanging out, not moving. Then, bam! They crash into each other and stick together. \n\nNow, we need to figure out how much of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision. Well, since they stick together and move as one big particle afterwards, all of their kinetic energy gets transferred into the new big particle. So, that means none of the kinetic energy is lost in the collision.\n\nSo, the answer is A: 0. Yay, we solved it!",
