    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we are talking about a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a temperature reservoir at temperature T. The average total energy of the oscillator is related to the equipartition theorem, which states that each degree of freedom in the system has an average energy of (1/2) k T, where k is the Boltzmann constant. Since we are dealing with a three-dimensional oscillator, we have 3 degrees of freedom.\n\nTherefore, the average total energy of the oscillator would be:\n(3 degrees of freedom) x (1/2) k T = (3/2) k T\n\nSo the answer is C: (3/2) k T.",
