Now, if this bouncy ball is hanging out with a group of friends at a temperature T, we want to figure out how much energy it has on average.\n\nSo, the average total energy of the bouncy ball will be (3/2) k T. That means it's bouncing around with 3 times the temperature T. So the answer is C: (3/2) k T. Keep on bouncing, little bouncy ball!",
