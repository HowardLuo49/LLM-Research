At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the work-energy principle. The work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. In this problem, the work done by the constant force when applied is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the box is given by KE_initial = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s)^2 = 5 J\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the box is given by KE_final = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(10 kg)(2 m/s)^2 = 20 J\n\nThe work done on the box is equal to the change in kinetic energy:\n\nWork = KE_final - KE_initial = 20 J - 5 J = 15 J\n\nSince work = force * distance, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the magnitude of the force:\n\nForce = Work / distance = 15 J / 5 m = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C.",
