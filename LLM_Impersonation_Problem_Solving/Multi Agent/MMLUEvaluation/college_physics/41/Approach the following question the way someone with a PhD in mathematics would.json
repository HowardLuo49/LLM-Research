A gas cell with an optical path length of 10 cm is placed in one arm of a Michelson interferometer. If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics would, let's first understand the concept of interference in an interferometer. In an interferometer, interference fringes are produced when light waves interfere constructively and destructively, leading to bright and dark bands. The number of fringes observed depends on the difference in optical path lengths between the two arms of the interferometer.\n\nIn this case, we are given that 100 fringes are observed when the gas cell is evacuated. This implies that the change in optical path length due to the gas is equal to half the wavelength of the laser light, as 100 fringes correspond to a total change in optical path length of one full wavelength.\n\nThe change in optical path length due to the gas cell can be calculated using the formula:\n\n2 * n * d = m * \u03bb,\n\nwhere:\n- n is the refractive index of the gas (which we want to find),\n- d is the length of the gas cell (10 cm),\n- m is the number of fringes counted (100),\n- \u03bb is the wavelength of the laser light (632.8 nm = 632.8 * 10^(-9) m),\n- and the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that the change in optical path length due to the gas cell is half the wavelength of the laser light.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula and solving for n, we get:\n\n2 * n * 0.1 = 100 * 632.8 * 10^(-9),\n2n = 633 * 10^(-7),\nn = 633 * 10^(-7) / 2,\nn = 316.5 * 10^(-7),\nn = 3.165 * 10^(-5).\n\nThe refractive index n of the original gas is approximately 1.00032, which corresponds to answer choice B.",
