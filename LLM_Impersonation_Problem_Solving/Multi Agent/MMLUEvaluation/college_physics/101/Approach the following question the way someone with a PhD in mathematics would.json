    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the period of revolution of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. In this case, the satellite is orbiting the planet, so we can consider the radius R of the circular orbit as the semi-major axis. \n\nTherefore, the period T of revolution of the satellite is proportional to R^(3/2), as stated in option D. This means that the time required for one revolution is proportional to the radius R raised to the power of 3/2.",
