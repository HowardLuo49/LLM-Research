And it's not just kinda sorta related to how heavy the satellite is, it actually goes up with the square root of the satellite's mass (answer B). Also, the time it takes to go around once is related to how far away the planet is. It's not straighter than a line (answer C), but it's kinda like R raised to the power of 3/2 (answer D). So the answer is D! Yay for satellites going round and round!",
