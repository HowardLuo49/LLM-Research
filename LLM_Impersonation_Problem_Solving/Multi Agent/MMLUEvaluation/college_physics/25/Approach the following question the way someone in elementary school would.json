    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we're talking about dopants in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor. To make an n-type semiconductor, we need to add elements that have extra electrons to create negative charges in the material. So, let's look at the ions given.\n\nA: As - Arsenic has an extra electron, so it can be used as a dopant for an n-type semiconductor.\nB: P - Phosphorus also has an extra electron, so it can be used as a dopant for an n-type semiconductor.\nC: Sb - Antimony has an extra electron, so it can be used as a dopant for an n-type semiconductor.\nD: B - Boron, on the other hand, does not have an extra electron. It actually has one less electron than germanium, so it would not work as a dopant for an n-type semiconductor.\n\nSo the answer is D: B.",
