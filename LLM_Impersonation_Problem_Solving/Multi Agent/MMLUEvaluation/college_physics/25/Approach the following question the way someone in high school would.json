To figure this out, we need to remember that n-type semiconductors are created by adding a dopant that increases the number of free electrons in the crystal lattice.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA: As (Arsenic) can be used as a dopant in germanium to create an n-type semiconductor.\nB: P (Phosphorus) can be used as a dopant in germanium to create an n-type semiconductor.\nC: Sb (Antimony) can also be used as a dopant in germanium to create an n-type semiconductor.\nD: B (Boron) is the dopant that cannot be used to create an n-type semiconductor in germanium. Boron creates p-type semiconductors by adding holes to the crystal lattice instead of free electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: B.",
