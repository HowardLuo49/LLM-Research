Einstein\u2019s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the\nA: work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency\nB: work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength\nC: current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength\nD: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency",
