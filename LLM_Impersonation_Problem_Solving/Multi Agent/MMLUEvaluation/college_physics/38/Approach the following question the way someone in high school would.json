    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. Since the dielectric constant is 4.0, we need to divide the speed of light in a vacuum by the square root of the dielectric constant (4.0) to get the speed of light inside the nonmagnetic dielectric material.\n\nSo, the speed of light inside the nonmagnetic dielectric material is:\n3.0 x 10^8 m/s / \u221a4.0 = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s / 2 = 1.5 x 10^8 m/s\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.",
