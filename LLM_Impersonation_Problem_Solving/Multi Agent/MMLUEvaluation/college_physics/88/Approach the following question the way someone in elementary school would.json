Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, this question is a bit tricky but I'll try my best to answer it like a student in elementary school would.\n\nSo, when sound waves come out of a speaker, they spread out in all directions. When they go through a narrow opening, like a rectangular slit, they can diffract, which means they spread out even more.\n\nIn this question, the sound waves are diffracting out of a rectangular slit that is 0.14 meters across. The sound will disappear at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face. \n\nTo figure out at what frequency the sound will first disappear at that angle, we need to use some fancy math. Luckily, the answer choices give us some hints.\n\nI see that the sound waves are moving at 350 m/s and the slit is 0.14 m across. So, we can use the formula: frequency = speed of sound / wavelength. \n\nSince we know the angle and the width of the slit, we can also use the formula for diffraction to find the wavelength. \n\nLet's plug in the numbers and do some calculations. \n\nAfter going through the calculations, I think the answer is D: 3,500 Hz.",
