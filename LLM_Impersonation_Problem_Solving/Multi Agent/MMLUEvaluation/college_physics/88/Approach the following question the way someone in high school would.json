Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so we know that the sound waves are moving at 350 m/s and the opening of the speaker is 0.14 m across. We want to find the frequency at which the sound will first disappear at a 45 degree angle from the normal. I remember learning in physics that the equation for diffraction is given by sin\u03b8 = \u03bb / a, where \u03b8 is the angle of diffraction, \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave, and a is the width of the opening. \n\nSince we are looking for the frequency at which the sound first disappears at a 45 degree angle, we can plug in the values we know: sin(45) = \u03bb / 0.14. Solving for the wavelength, we get \u03bb = 0.14 * sin(45) = 0.14 * \u221a2 \u2248 0.198 m.\n\nNext, we know that the speed of sound (v) is equal to the frequency (f) times the wavelength (\u03bb), so we can rearrange the equation to solve for frequency: f = v / \u03bb = 350 / 0.198 \u2248 1767.67 Hz.\n\nSince the closest answer is 1,750 Hz, I would choose option B.",
