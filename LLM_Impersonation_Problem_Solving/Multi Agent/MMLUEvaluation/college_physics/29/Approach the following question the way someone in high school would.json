    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. We have a circular coil with an area of 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. The magnetic field is increasing from 0.01 T to 0.06 T in 0.25 seconds.\n\nTo find the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction which states that the induced EMF is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil. The formula for this is EMF = -N * A * (change in B / change in t), where N is the number of turns, A is the area of the coil, B is the magnetic field, and t is the time interval.\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.06 - 0.01) / 0.25\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * 0.05 / 0.25\nEMF = -10 V\n\nSince EMF is defined as the change in potential energy per unit charge, we need to consider the absolute value of the EMF. Therefore, the average induced EMF in the coil is 10 V.\n\nSo the answer is D: 10 V.",
