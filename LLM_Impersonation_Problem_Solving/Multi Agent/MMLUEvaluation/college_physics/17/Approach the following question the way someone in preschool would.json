    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. One end of a horizontal, massless spring is attached to a wall. A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "\"Let's see, the spring has a mass on one side and it's moving back and forth. It starts at one point and goes back to the middle with some speed. So we have to figure out the total energy. Hmm... I think it's 0.48 mJ. Yes, that's it! Total energy is 0.48 mJ because of the movement and the speed of the spring.\"",
