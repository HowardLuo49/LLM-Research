So we have one spring that we stretch a little bit, and then a second spring that we stretch even less, but it takes more work. \n\nSo, let's see... the second spring takes twice as much work but it's only stretched by half the distance of the first spring. Hmm, well if it takes more work but less of a stretch, maybe the second spring is stronger!\n\nSo, I think the force constant of the second spring is... D: 8k! Yay, we did it!",
