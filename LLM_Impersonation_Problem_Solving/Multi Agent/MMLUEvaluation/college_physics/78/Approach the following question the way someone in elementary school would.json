It takes twice as much work to stretch a second spring by half this distance. The force constant of the second spring is\nA: k\nB: 2k\nC: 4k\nD: 8k",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so imagine we have a spring called Spring 1. We stretch it a certain distance. It's not easy work, but we do it.\n\nNow, we have another spring called Spring 2. We only stretch it half the distance of Spring 1, but it takes us twice as much work. That's a lot of work!\n\nSo, which spring is stronger? Is it Spring 1 with force constant k, or Spring 2 with force constant 2k, 4k, or 8k?\n\nWell, since Spring 2 takes twice as much work to stretch by half the distance of Spring 1, that means Spring 2 is stronger. And if it's stronger, that means the force constant is higher.\n\nSo, the answer is D: 8k.\n\nSpring 2 has a force constant of 8k because it takes more work to stretch it by half the distance, even though the distance is shorter.",
