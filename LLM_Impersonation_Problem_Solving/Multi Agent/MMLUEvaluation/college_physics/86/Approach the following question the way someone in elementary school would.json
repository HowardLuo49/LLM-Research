    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. So, we know that lasers can use different methods to create light. A diode laser uses semiconductors, a dye laser uses organic molecules, and a free-electron laser uses accelerated electrons. But a gas laser? That sounds like it could involve transitions of free atoms' energy levels. So, I think the answer is D: Gas laser!",
