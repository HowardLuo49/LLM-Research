    "gpt_response": "Hmm, this question is kind of tricky for elementary school level. Let's break it down. The rod is shrinking when the observer moves parallel to it. So, if the rod measures 1.00 m at rest, but the observer sees it as 0.80 m, that means the observer must be moving pretty fast! \n\nSo, let's just guess and say that the observer must be moving at half the speed of light, which is 0.50c. That seems like a good answer to me! So, my answer is A: 0.50c.",
