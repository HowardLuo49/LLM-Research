    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so in the rest system of the rod, its length is 1.00 m. But if an observer is moving parallel to the rod, they will measure a shorter length. To find out how fast the observer must be moving, we can use the Lorentz contraction formula. \n\nThe Lorentz contraction formula is given by: L = L\u2080 * \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2), where L is the measured length, L\u2080 is the rest length (1.00 m in this case), v is the observer's velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe want to find v when L is 0.80 m. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n0.80 m = 1.00 m * \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSolving for v, we get v = \u221a(1 - (0.80/1.00)^2) = \u221a(1 - 0.64) = \u221a0.36 = 0.60.\n\nSo, the observer must be moving at a speed of 0.60c to measure the length of the rod to be 0.80 m. Therefore, the answer is B: 0.60c.",
