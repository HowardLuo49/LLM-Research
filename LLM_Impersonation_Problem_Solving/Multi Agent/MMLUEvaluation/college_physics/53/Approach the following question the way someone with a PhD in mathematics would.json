    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a mathematical perspective, we can start by applying Newton's second law, which states that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration (F = ma).\n\nGiven that the mass of object B is twice that of object A (m_B = 2m_A) and the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A (a_B = 2a_A), we can write the following equations:\n\nF_A = m_A * a_A\nF_B = m_B * a_B\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equations:\n\nF_A = m_A * a_A\nF_A = m_A * 2a_A\nF_A = 2m_A * a_A\nF_A = F_B / 2\n\nNow, we can see that F_A is half of F_B.
