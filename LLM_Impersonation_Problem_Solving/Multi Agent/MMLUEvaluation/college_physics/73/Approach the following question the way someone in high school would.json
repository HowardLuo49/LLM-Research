Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to remember an important concept from physics: length contraction. Length contraction is the shortening of an object's length in the direction of its motion as its speed approaches the speed of light.\n\nIn this scenario, the observer on Earth sees both spaceships approaching with equal speeds, but from opposite directions. The meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. This means that the length of the meterstick appears shorter to the person on the other spaceship due to length contraction.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for length contraction: L' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where L' is the contracted length, L is the original length (60 cm in this case), v is the speed of the spaceship, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSince the contracted length is measured to be 60 cm on the other spaceship, we can plug in the values and solve for the speed of the spaceship. Let's assume that the speed of the spaceship is v.\n\n60 cm = 60 cm * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n1 = sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n1 = 1 - v^2/c^2\nv^2/c^2 = 0\nv = 0\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is 0. This means that answer choice A: 0.4c, B: 0.5c, C: 0.6c, and D: 0.7c are all incorrect.",
