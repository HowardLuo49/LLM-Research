A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The energy of the photon was\nA: mc^2\nB: 2mc^2\nC: 3mc^2\nD: 4mc^2",

    "gpt_response": "This scenario can be analyzed using conservation of momentum and conservation of energy principles.\n\nLet E be the energy of the photon, m be the mass of the electron/positron, and v be the speed at which the electron, positron, and second electron move off.\n\nThe initial momentum before the interaction is zero since the electron is at rest. After the interaction, the total momentum is given by:\n\n0 = 2m*v - E/c\n\nSimilarly, the total energy before the interaction is E, and the total energy after the interaction is given by:\n\nE = 2\u221a((mc^2)^2 + (m*v^2)) + mc^2\n\nSince the speed at which the particles move off is equal, we can set v = c and solve the system of equations. Solving the equations gives us:\n\nE = 4mc^2\n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon was 4mc^2. So, the answer is:\n\nD: 4mc^2",
