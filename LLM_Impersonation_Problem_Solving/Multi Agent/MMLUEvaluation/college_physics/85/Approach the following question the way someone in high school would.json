    "gpt_response": "Let's break down the problem step by step. First, a photon strikes an electron, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon.\n\nSince the electron was initially at rest, it means all the energy of the photon went into creating the electron-positron pair and giving them kinetic energy to move off. \n\nNow, according to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy before the interaction is equal to the total energy after the interaction. In this case, the energy of the photon is equal to the total energy of the electron-positron pair plus their kinetic energy.\n\nGiven that the mass of the electron is m and the positron has the same mass as the electron, the total mass of the electron-positron pair is 2m. \n\nHence, the energy of the photon was equal to mc^2 (the rest energy of the electron-positron pair) plus the kinetic energy of the electron and the positron, which is also equal to mc^2.\n\nTherefore, the total energy of the photon is 2mc^2, which means the correct answer is B: 2mc^2.",
