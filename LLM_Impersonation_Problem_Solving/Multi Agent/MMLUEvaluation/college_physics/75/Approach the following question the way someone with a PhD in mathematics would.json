    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is C: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas.\n\nIn a metal, the electrons are confined to a lattice and are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which prohibits more than one electron from occupying the same quantum state. This leads to the formation of a degenerate Fermi gas, in which the electrons follow Fermi-Dirac statistics and occupy energy levels up to the Fermi energy.\n\nThe mean energy of the electrons in a Fermi gas is determined by the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which results in a high kinetic energy compared to the thermal energy kT at room temperature.
