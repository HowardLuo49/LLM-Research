Assume that the solar flux at Earth\u2019s surface is 1,000 W/m^2 and that the sunlight is normal to a completely reflecting surface with an area of 3 m^2. What is the total radiation force exerted on the surface?\nA: 2 x 10^-6 N\nB: 1 x 10^-5 N\nC: 2 x 10^-5 N\nD: 3 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total radiation force, first, we have to calculate the total power received by the surface. We multiply the solar flux (1,000 W/m^2) by the surface area (3 m^2) to get 3,000 watts (3,000 W). \n\nNext, we know that the total radiation force is equal to the total power divided by the speed of light. The speed of light is around 3 x 10^8 m/s. So, we divide 3,000 watts by 3 x 10^8 m/s to get 1 x 10^-5 N.\n\nTherefore, the total radiation force exerted on the surface is B: 1 x 10^-5 N.",
