A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the speed of light in a medium with an index of refraction n:\n\nv = c / n.\n\nGiven that the index of refraction of water is 4/3, the speed of light in water is:\n\nv_water = c / (4/3) = 3c / 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame. Let's denote this speed as v_lab. According to relativistic velocity addition, the formula for adding velocities is:\n\nv_lab = (v_water + v_tube) / (1 + v_water*v_tube / c^2),\n\nwhere v_tube = 1/2 c.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nv_lab = (3c / 4 + 1/2 c) / (1 + 3c/4 * 1/2c) = (11 / 8) c.\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is (11/8) c, which is approximately 5/6 c. So, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 5/6 c.",
