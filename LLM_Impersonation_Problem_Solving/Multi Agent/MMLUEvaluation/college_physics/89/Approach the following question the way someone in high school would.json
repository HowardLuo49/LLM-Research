    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we're looking at the emission spectrum of a doubly ionized lithium atom and comparing it to a hydrogen atom. The only difference between lithium and hydrogen is their atomic number, so we need to consider how that affects the wavelengths of light emitted.\n\nSince lithium has an atomic number of 3 and hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, we can calculate the ratio of their wavelengths by squaring the ratio of their atomic numbers. So, the wavelengths of light emitted by the doubly ionized lithium atom compared to hydrogen would be decreased by a factor of 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: decreased by a factor of 9.",
