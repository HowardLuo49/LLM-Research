    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's think about this in simple terms. If something gets hotter, like a blackbody, it usually gives off more energy, right? So if we increase the absolute temperature by a factor of 3, it probably means the energy radiated per second per unit area will increase as well. So, the answer is C: Increases by a factor of 9.",
