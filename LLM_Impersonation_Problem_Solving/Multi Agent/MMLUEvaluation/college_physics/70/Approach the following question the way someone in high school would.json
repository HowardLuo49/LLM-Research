The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the elevator has a mass of 1,000 kg and it fell a distance of 100 m. We know that the potential energy of an object is given by the formula PE = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height.\n\nPE = (1,000 kg)(9.8 m/s^2)(100 m) = 980,000 J\n\nSince the elevator was brought to rest by the emergency brakes, all of the potential energy was converted to heat, so the brakes must dissipate 980,000 J, which is closest to option D: 1,000,000 J.",
