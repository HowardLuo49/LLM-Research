Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the minimum thickness of the oil film that will result in the most intense reflection of blue light (with a wavelength of 480nm), we can use the concept of constructive interference in thin films.\n\nThe condition for constructive interference in a thin film is given by the equation:\n\n2nt = (m + 1/2)\u03bb\n\nwhere:\nn - refractive index of the film (1.2 for oil)\nt - thickness of the film\nm - order of the interference (assume m = 0 for the most intense reflection)\n\u03bb - wavelength of the light (480nm = 480 x 10^-9 m)\n\nWe are given that the light is incident near normal to the film, so we can use the condition for constructive interference for normal incidence:\n2nt = m\u03bb\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n2(1.2)t = 480 x 10^-9\n2.4t = 480 x 10^-9\nt = 480 x 10^-9 / 2.4\nt = 200 x 10^-9 = 200nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film to achieve the strongest reflection of blue light is 200nm, which corresponds to option B.",
