Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",

    "gpt_response": "I would calculate the minimum thickness of the oil film using the formula for destructive interference in thin films: 2nt = m\u03bb, where t is the thickness of the film, n is the index of refraction of the oil, \u03bb is the wavelength of the light, and m is the order of the interference (in this case, m=1 for minimum thickness).\n\nPlugging in the values we know:\nn = 1.2\n\u03bb = 480 nm\nm = 1\n2(1.2)t = 1(480)\n2.4t = 480\nt = 480/2.4\nt = 200 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film is 200 nm, which corresponds to option B.",
