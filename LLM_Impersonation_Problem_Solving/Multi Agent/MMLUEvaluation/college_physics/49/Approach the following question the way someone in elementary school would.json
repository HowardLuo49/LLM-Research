    "gpt_response": "Hmm, this question looks a little tricky! But remember, total energy and momentum are related to mass. So, we need to find the mass of the particle.\n\nFirst, we see that the particle has a total energy of 5.0 GeV and a momentum of 4.9 GeV/c. Now, we use the formula E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 to find the rest mass, where E is the total energy, p is the momentum, c is the speed of light, and m is the rest mass.\n\nPlugging in the values we have, we get\n(5.0 GeV)^2 = (4.9 GeV/c)^2 + (mc^2)^2.\n\nSolving for m, we find m \u2248 0.1 GeV/c^2.\n\nSo, the answer is A: 0.1 GeV/c^2. Great job!",
