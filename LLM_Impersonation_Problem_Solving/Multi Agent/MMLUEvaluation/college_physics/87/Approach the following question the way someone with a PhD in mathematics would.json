Unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers whose transmission axes make an angle of 45q with each other. The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\nA: 100%\nB: 75%\nC: 50%\nD: 25%",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's consider the effect of each polarizer individually. \n\nWhen unpolarized light is incident on a linear polarizer, only the component of light parallel to the transmission axis is transmitted. Since the transmission axis of the first polarizer is at a 45-degree angle to the incident light, the intensity of the light transmitted through the first polarizer is cos^2(45\u00b0) = 0.5 or 50% of the incident intensity.\n\nNext, we consider the light transmitted through the second polarizer. Since the transmitted light from the first polarizer is polarized, the second polarizer will only transmit the component of light parallel to its transmission axis. The second polarizer's transmission axis is also at a 45-degree angle to the polarized light, so the intensity of the light transmitted through the second polarizer is also cos^2(45\u00b0) = 0.5 or 50% of the incident intensity.\n\nTherefore, the overall intensity of the light transmitted through both polarizers is 50% \u00d7 50% = 25% of the incident intensity. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 25%.",
