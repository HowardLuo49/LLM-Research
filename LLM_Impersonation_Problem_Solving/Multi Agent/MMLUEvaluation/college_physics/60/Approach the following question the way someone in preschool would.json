The first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Which of the harmonics, if any, will survive once the pipe is closed at one end?\nA: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\nB: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\nC: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\nD: None",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. When an organ pipe is open at both ends, it makes certain sounds called harmonics. But when you close one end of the pipe, some of those sounds might go away. So, which of the sounds will still be there? Let's think about it. The harmonics we have are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. If we close one end of the pipe, the even numbered harmonics will disappear. That means we will be left with the odd numbered harmonics. So, the harmonics that will survive once the pipe is closed at one end are 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz. So, the answer is A: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only. Yay, we figured it out!",
