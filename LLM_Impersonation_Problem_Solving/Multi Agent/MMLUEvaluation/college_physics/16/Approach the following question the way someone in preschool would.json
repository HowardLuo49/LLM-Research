Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",

    "gpt_response": "Wow, let's talk about helium atoms and their different states! So, there are two types of excited states in helium atoms - para and ortho. Para has antiparallel electron spins and ortho has parallel electron spins. The cool thing is that ortho states have lower energy than para states! This has to do with something called the Pauli exclusion principle. It's like a rule that says electrons don't like to be in the same state as each other. So, because of this principle, ortho states end up having lower energy. Isn't that neat? \ud83c\udf88",
