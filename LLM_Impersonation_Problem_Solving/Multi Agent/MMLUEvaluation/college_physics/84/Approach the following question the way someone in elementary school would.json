And it says we need to figure out the factor by which the wavelengths are changed. \n\nI remember that the lithium atom has an atomic number of 3 and a mass number of 7, while hydrogen just has an atomic number of 1. So, that means that lithium atom has two electrons missing compared to hydrogen.\n\nI think, because the lithium atom is missing two electrons, the wavelengths of the emission spectrum for Li++ would be decreased compared to hydrogen. And since there are two missing electrons, I think the factor should be squared, which would be 9.\n\nSo, I am going to go with:\nA: decreased by a factor of 9.",
