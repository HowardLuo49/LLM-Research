If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's play with magnets and coils! So, the magnetic field is going up and down around our circle coil. It's like magic! Let's see, the area of the coil is 0.2 square meters and there are 250 turns in the coil. Let's count together, 1, 2, 3...250 turns! And the magnetic field is increasing from 0.01 T to 0.06 T in 0.25 seconds. Hmmm, let's think about this. \n\nThe average induced EMF in the coil is like a really cool number that shows us how much energy is being made in the coil because of the changing magnetic field. I think it's like when we spin around really fast and get dizzy! \n\nLet's see, the formula for average induced EMF is EMF = -N * A * (\u0394B/\u0394t)\n\nSo, EMF = -250 turns * 0.2 m^2 * ((0.06 T - 0.01 T) / 0.25 s)\n\nLet's put the numbers in our magic calculator and see what we get!\n\n*poof poof poof*\n\nHmm, the answer is 2.5 V! Yay, we did it! We found the average induced EMF in the coil. Good job, little scientists!",
