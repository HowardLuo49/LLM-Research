A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down step by step. First, we have a circular coil with an area of 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. That means the coil has lots of wire wound around in a circle!\n\nNext, we are told that a magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the coil. This means the magnetic field is going straight across the coil.\n\nThen, the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T in a time interval of 0.25 seconds. That means the magnetic field gets stronger over that short time.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the average induced EMF in the coil. EMF stands for electromotive force, which is another way of saying voltage.\n\nTo find the average induced EMF, we use this equation: EMF = -N * A * (change in B / change in t).\n\nN is the number of turns in the coil (250), A is the area of the coil (0.2 m^2), change in B is the change in the magnetic field strength (0.06 T - 0.01 T = 0.05 T), and change in t is the time interval (0.25 s).\n\nNow, plug in the numbers: EMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.05 / 0.25) = -10 V.\n\nBut remember, the negative sign just tells us the direction of the current flow. So, the average induced EMF in the coil is actually 10 V.\n\nSo, the answer is D: 10 V.",
