If the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is increased by a factor of\nA: 2\nB: 4\nC: 8\nD: 16",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so imagine a magic box that has energy inside of it that can melt ice. If we double the temperature inside the box, that means there is more energy to melt the ice, right? So, if we double the temperature, we can melt double the amount of ice! That means the answer is A: 2.",
