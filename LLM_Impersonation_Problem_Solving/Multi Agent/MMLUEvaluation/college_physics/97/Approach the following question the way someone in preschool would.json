A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's think about this using colors! When white light goes through the oil layer, it reflects off the water underneath. Since the oil has a higher index of refraction than the water, some colors of light will reflect more strongly than others.\n\nSo, let's remember our colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The colors with shorter wavelengths, like violet and blue, are more likely to be reflected strongly than longer wavelengths.\n\nOut of the choices given, 500 nm is the shortest wavelength, which is more likely to be reflected strongly. So, the answer is A: 500 nm!",
