    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon, we must consider that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees. \n\nFor a 10-gon, the sum of the interior angles is (10-2) * 180 = 1440 degrees.\n\nAn acute angle is defined as an angle that measures less than 90 degrees. Therefore, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon would occur if all the other angles were obtuse.\n\nLet's consider a scenario in which all interior angles of the 10-gon are obtuse, so each angle would be at least 90 degrees. If all the angles are at least 90 degrees, the sum of the interior angles would be greater than 1440 degrees, which contradicts the initial condition.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible for all angles in a 10-gon to be obtuse. Consequently, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon must happen when 8 angles are obtuse and 2 angles are acute. \n\nHence, the correct answer is B: 2.",
