    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will use the information provided in the equation f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)] for every integer n. \n\nLet's first substitute n = 4 into the equation to find f(8):\n\nf(8) = 4^2 + f[2(4 - 1)]\nf(8) = 16 + f[8 - 2]\nf(8) = 16 + f(6)\n\nNext, let's substitute n = 3 into the equation to express f(6) in terms of f(4):\n\nf(6) = 3^2 + f[2(3 - 1)]\nf(6) = 9 + f[6 - 2]\nf(6) = 9 + f(4)\n\nThus, we can combine these results to find f(8) in terms of f(4):\n\nf(8) = 16 + 9 + f(4)\nf(8) = 25 + f(4)\n\nContinuing this process, we can express f(4) in terms of f(2) and f(2) in terms of f(0) since the function passes through the origin.\n\nf(4) = 4^2 + f[2(4 - 1)] = 16 + f(2)\nf(2) = 2^2 + f[2(2 - 1)] = 4 + f(0)\n\nNow, substituting f(2) into the equation for f(4), we find:\n\nf(4) = 16 + 4 + f(0)\nf(4) = 20 + f(0)\n\nSubstituting f(4) back into the equation for f(8), we find:\n\nf(8) = 25 + 20 + f(0)\nf(8) = 45 + f(0)\n\nSince the function passes through the origin, f(0) = 0.
