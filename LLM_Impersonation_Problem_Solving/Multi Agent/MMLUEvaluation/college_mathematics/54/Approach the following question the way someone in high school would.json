    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about abelian groups of order n. We know that abelian groups are groups where the group operation is commutative. And when we're looking for the value of n where there are exactly two abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism, we need to consider the different ways we can decompose n into a product of prime powers.\n\nFor n = 4, we have 4 = 2^2. There is only one abelian group of order 4, which is the cyclic group of order 4, so this doesn't fit our criteria.\n\nFor n = 7, 7 is a prime number so there is only one way to decompose it as 7 = 7^1. Therefore, there is only one abelian group of order 7, so this doesn't work either.\n\nFor n = 8, we have 8 = 2^3. There are two abelian groups of order 8, which are the cyclic group of order 8 and the direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 4. So, it seems like this could be the value we're looking for.\n\nFor n = 12, we have 12 = 2^2 * 3. There are more than two abelian groups of order 12, including the cyclic group of order 12 and the direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 6. So, this doesn't fit our criteria either.\n\nTherefore, the value of n where there are exactly two abelian groups of order n up to isomorphism is C: 8.",
