    "gpt_response": "Hmm, to figure out how many structurally distinct Abelian groups have order 72, I need to consider the prime factorization of 72, which is 2^3 * 3^2. Since Abelian groups are direct products of cyclic groups of prime power order, I need to think about how I can combine these prime power orders to form different structures.\n\nFirst, I know that for each prime factor, there can be multiple ways to split them up into cyclic groups. So for 2^3, I can have one cyclic group of order 2^3, or two cyclic groups of order 2 and 4, or three cyclic groups of order 2. And for 3^2, I can have one cyclic group of order 3^2 or two cyclic groups of order 3.\n\nAfter carefully considering the different combinations, I realize that there are 6 structurally distinct Abelian groups with order 72. So, my answer is B: 6.",
