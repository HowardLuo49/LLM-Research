    "gpt_response": "Let's look at the math problem here. We have some fancy letters and symbols to deal with, but don't worry, it's not too scary!\n\nFirst, let's figure out what f(x, y) means. It's a function that takes in two numbers, x and y, and does some calculations with them. In this case, the function is f(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^3.\n\nNow let's look at the answer choices. We have to figure out which one is true based on what we know about the function f(x, y).\n\nAnswer choice A says that f has all of its relative extrema on the line x = y. Hmm, let's think about that. When x and y are the same, what happens to f(x, y)? Does it have any special points?\n\nAnswer choice B says that f has all of its relative extrema on the parabola x = y^2. Okay, so when x is equal to y squared, what does f(x, y) look like? Are there any high points or low points on that curve?\n\nAnswer choice C says that f has a relative minimum at (0, 0). Hmm, what does f(0, 0) equal? And is that a relative minimum, or is there a lower point somewhere else?\n\nAnswer choice D says that f has an absolute minimum at (2/3, 2/3). Well, we already know from answer choice C that (0, 0) might be a relative minimum. But what about (2/3, 2/3)? Could that be an even lower point for f(x, y)?\n\nIt looks like we need to compare these answer choices with what we know about the function f(x, y). Let's see if we can figure it out using our math skills!",
