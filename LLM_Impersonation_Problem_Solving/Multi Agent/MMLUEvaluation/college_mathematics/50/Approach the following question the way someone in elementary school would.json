Remember, in math, x and y are the variables that make up our graph.\n\nLet's think about it. The graph of x^(log y) = y^log x can be simplified to y = x. This means that our graph is a straight line that goes through the origin (0,0) and extends into the other quadrants.\n\nSo, the answer is... A: the open first quadrant! That's where our line is going. We did it! Great job everyone!",
