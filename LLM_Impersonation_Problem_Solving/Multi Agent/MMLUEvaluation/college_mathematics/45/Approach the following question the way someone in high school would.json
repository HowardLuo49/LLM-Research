    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. For statement 1, it says f is continuous and X is compact, so f must be uniformly continuous. Well, I remember learning that if a function is continuous on a compact set, then it must be uniformly continuous. So, statement 1 is true.\n\nNow for statement 2, it says if f and g are everywhere differentiable, then f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable. I think this might be true too because if both functions are differentiable, then their composition should also be differentiable. So, statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, my answer is A: True, True.",
