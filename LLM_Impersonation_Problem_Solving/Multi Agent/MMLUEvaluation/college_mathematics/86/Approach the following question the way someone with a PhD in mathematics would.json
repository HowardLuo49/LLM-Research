Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to analyze the implications of each condition on the matrix M.\n\nCondition A states that any pair of distinct column vectors of M are linearly independent. This implies that the columns of M are linearly independent, which in turn implies that the determinant of M is nonzero (since linear dependence among columns would result in a zero determinant).\n\nCondition B states that the homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution. This implies that the columns of M are linearly independent (as the existence of nontrivial solutions would imply linear dependence among the columns).\n\nCondition C states that the system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This implies that the columns of M span the 5-dimensional space and are linearly independent, which again implies that the determinant of M is nonzero.\n\nCondition D states that the determinant of M is nonzero, which as mentioned earlier, implies that the columns of M are linearly independent.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we see that conditions A, B, C, and D are all equivalent to each other, as they all imply that the columns of M are linearly independent and that the determinant of M is nonzero.\n\nNow let's consider condition E: \"The system of equations Mx = b has at least one solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\" This condition does not imply linear independence of the columns of M, as there could be multiple solutions for some b vectors even if the determinant of M is nonzero. Therefore, condition E is equivalent to none of the other four conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, condition E is the one that is not equivalent to any of the other four conditions.",
