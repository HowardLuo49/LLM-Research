Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",

    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's play a fun game with X and Y! They are like little numbers that we get to roll a dice for. Each number has a special chance of happening. If we add up all the probabilities for X and Y being greater than 3, we get 1/8. But wait, we have to subtract the probability of both X and Y being less than or equal to 3, which is 1/8. So, the final answer is 1/8 - 1/8 = 0. Yay, we did it! So the probability is 1/64, which is option A!",
