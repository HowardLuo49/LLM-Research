    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x, we first need to determine the dimensions of the rectangular yard that would result in the largest area. Let the two sides of the rectangle be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with \\(2a + b = x\\), since the total fencing is x feet. \n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by \\(A = ab\\), and we can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\) as \\(b = x - 2a\\), substituting this into the area equation gives \\(A = a(x-2a)\\).
