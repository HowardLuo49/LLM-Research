    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum possible area of the rectangular yard, we need to use calculus. Let the length of the yard be 2a and the width be b. The total amount of fencing used would be 2a + 2b + x = x, so 2a + 2b = x. This simplifies to a + b = x/2. \n\nWe need to maximize the area, which is given by A = ab. Substituting a = x/2 - b into the equation for area gives A = (x/2 - b)b = (x/2)b - b^2.\n\nTo maximize the area, we take the derivative of A with respect to b and set it equal to 0.\ndA/db = x/2 - 2b = 0\nx/2 = 2b\nb = x/4\n\nSubstitute b = x/4 back into the equation for area gives A = (x/2)(x/4) = x^2/8\n\nSo, the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x is B: x^2/8.",
