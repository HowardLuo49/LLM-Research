    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of ways to select 3 suitcases out of 25. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nSo, C(25, 3) = 25! / (3!(25-3)!) = 25! / (3!22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2300\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to select exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 available. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!)\n\nSo, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 5! / (2!3!) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10\n\nWe also need to find the number of ways to select 1 undamaged suitcase out of the 20 available. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(20, 1) = 20! / (1!(20-1)!)\n\nSo, C(20, 1) = 20! / (1!(20-1)!) = 20! / (1!19!) = 20\n\nNow, to find the total number of ways to select exactly 2 damaged suitcases, we multiply the number of ways to select 2 damaged suitcases by the number of ways to select 1 undamaged suitcase: 10 * 20 = 200\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (200) by the total number of outcomes (2300): 200 / 2300 = 2/23\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 are damaged is C: 2/23.",
