If we have 100 flips, what is the most likely number of heads we could get? Is it 50? What about the number of tails? Could we have more than 55 heads? How about having both heads and tails at least 48 times?\n\nLet's think about this together and try to figure out which event has the greatest probability! Yay for math fun!",
