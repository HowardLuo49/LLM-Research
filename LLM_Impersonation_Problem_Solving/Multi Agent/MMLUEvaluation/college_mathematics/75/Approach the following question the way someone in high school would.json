The probability is 0.08, because there are 100 coin tosses and only one way you can get exactly 50 heads.\n\nB: T >= 60. This means there are 60 or more tails. The probability is 0.009, because there are 100 coin tosses and multiple ways to get 60 or more tails.\n\nC: 51 <= H <= 55. This means there are between 51 and 55 heads. The probability is around 0.22, because there are different ways to get between 51 and 55 heads.\n\nD: H >= 48 and T >= 48. This means there are 48 or more heads and 48 or more tails.
