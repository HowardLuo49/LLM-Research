We know the coin is fair, so it's 50/50 chance of getting a head.\n\nIf the first player goes first, they have a 1/2 chance of getting a head and winning. If the second player goes first, they also have a 1/2 chance of getting a head and winning.\n\nSo, that means the probability of the first player winning is 1/2 because it's fair for both players. So the answer is C: 1/2.",
