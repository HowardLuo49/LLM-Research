    "gpt_response": "Oh man, this question seems tricky. I think I remember something about groups from math class. Okay, so a group is a set combined with an operation that follows some rules. And they're the same if they're isomorphic, right? So for which integers between 3 and 11 are there only one group with that order? I think the answer is B: 3, 5, 7, and 11 only. Those numbers seem prime, maybe that has something to do with it? But yeah, I'm going with B.",
