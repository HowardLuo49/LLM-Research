It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down the information given in the problem. \n\nWhen Kate starts, it takes 10 days to complete the test. So, Kate writes for 2 days, then John writes for 2 days, and this cycle continues until 5 cycles have been completed (10 days total). \n\nWhen John starts, it takes 10.5 days to complete the test. So, John writes for 2 days, then Kate writes for 2 days, and this cycle continues until 5.25 cycles have been completed (10.5 days total). \n\nNow, if Kate and John work together simultaneously, they will both be writing for 2 days in each cycle. Therefore, it will take them half the time it would take one person working alone, since they are working together. \n\nSince it takes 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts, the average time it would take them to complete the test working together is (10 + 10.5)/2 = 10.25 days. \n\nThis is equal to 41/4 = 41/8 days, so the correct answer is C: 41/8 days.",
