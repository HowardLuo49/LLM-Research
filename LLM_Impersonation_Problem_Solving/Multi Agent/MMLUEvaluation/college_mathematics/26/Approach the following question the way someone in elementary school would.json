It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. Kate takes k days and John takes j days to write a GRE math practice test.\n\nWhen they work in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. This means that when Kate starts, she works for 2 days, then John works for 2 days, and they keep alternating like that.\n\nSo, if Kate starts, in 10 days, Kate will work for 4 days and John will work for 6 days. If John starts, in 10.5 days, Kate will work for 5 days and John will work for 5.5 days.\n\nNow, if they work together, we can find the combined work rate of Kate and John:\n\nKate's work rate = 1/k practice test per day\nJohn's work rate = 1/j practice test per day\n\nWhen Kate starts: 4/k + 6/j = 1/10\nWhen John starts: 5/k + 5.5/j = 1/10.5\n\nNow, let's solve these equations to find k and j. Then we can find the time they take when working together simultaneously.",
