Let (Z_{10} , +, x) be the ring of integers modulo 10, and let S be the subset of Z_{10} represented by {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Which of the following statements is FALSE?\nA: (S, +, x) is closed under addition modulo 10.\nB: (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\nC: (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\nD: (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the statements is false, we need to carefully analyze each one.\n\nStatement A: The set S = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} is closed under addition modulo 10. This means that for any two elements a, b in S, the sum a + b is also in S. Since the sum of any two elements in S will still be in S, Statement A is true.\n\nStatement B: The set S = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} is also closed under multiplication modulo 10. This means that for any two elements a, b in S, the product a x b is also in S. Since the product of any two elements in S will still be in S, Statement B is also true.\n\nStatement C: For (S, +, x) to have an identity element under addition modulo 10, there must exist an element e in S such that for all a in S, e + a = a + e = a. In this case, the element 0 serves as the identity element for addition, as 0 + a = a + 0 = a for all a in S. Therefore, Statement C is true.\n\nStatement D: For (S, +, x) to have an identity element under multiplication modulo 10, there must exist an element e in S such that for all a in S, e x a = a x e = a. In this case, there is no element in S that serves as the identity element for multiplication, as none of the elements in S multiplied by any other element in S result in the same element. Therefore, Statement D is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the false statement is Statement D: (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.",
