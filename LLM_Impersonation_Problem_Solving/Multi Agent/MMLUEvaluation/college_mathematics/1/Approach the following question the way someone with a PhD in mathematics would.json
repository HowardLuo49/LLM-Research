    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the structure of additive abelian groups of order 16. \n\nThe condition x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G implies that 4x = 0 for all x in G. This means that the additive order of each element in G divides 4. \n\nSince the order of G is 16, the possibilities for the order of elements in G are 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. \n\nFor an element of order 1, we have G = {0}, but this does not satisfy the condition. \n\nFor an element of order 2, we have G = {0, a} where a+a=0. This only works if a = 0. \n\nFor an element of order 4, we have G = {0, a, 2a, 3a} where a+a+a+a=0. This only works if a = 0. \n\nFor an element of order 8, we have G = {0, a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a} where a+a+a+a=0.
