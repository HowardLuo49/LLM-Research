    "gpt_response": "Hmm, well when we have a factorial, we are basically multiplying all the numbers from 1 up to that number. So, to get 99 zeros at the end, we need to have at least 99 factors of 10. And since 10 is made up of 2 and 5, we need to have at least 99 factors of 2 and 99 factors of 5 in the prime factorization of k!. \n\nIn k!, there will definitely be more factors of 2 than 5. So we just need to count how many factors of 5 we have. \n\nWhen k = 25, we have 5^5 in 25! (which is 120). \n\nIn 50!, we have 5 additional factors of 5 because there are more numbers multiplied together. \n\nIn 75!, we have 5 more factors of 5. \n\nThen in 100!, we have 5 more factors of 5. \n\nSo in total, there are 5 factors of 5 in the prime factorization of 100!. Therefore, the answer is D: Five.",
