    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find out how many positive integers k will make the number k! end in exactly 99 zeros. This means we need to find out how many pairs of 2's and 5's are in the prime factorization of k!. Since 10 = 2*5, we need equal numbers of 2's and 5's in order to have a trailing 0 in the decimal representation.\n\nSince there are always more 2's than 5's in a prime factorization, we need to count how many 5's there are. To do this, we can use the formula k/5 + k/25 + k/125 + ... until k/5^m is less than 1.\n\nWhen we calculate this for k = 25, we see that there are 5 5's in the prime factorization of 25! which is enough to have 99 zeros at the end.\n\nSo, the answer is B: One.",
