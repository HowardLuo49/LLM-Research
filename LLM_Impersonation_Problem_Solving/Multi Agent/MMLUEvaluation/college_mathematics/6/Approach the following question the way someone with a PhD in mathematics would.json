    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A ladder 9 meters in length is leaning against a vertical wall on level ground. As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\nA: 12*sqrt(2)\nB: 6*sqrt(2)\nC: 4*sqrt(2)\nD: 1/(2*sqrt(2))",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use related rates. Let the distance of the bottom of the ladder from the wall be x meters and let the distance of the top of the ladder from the ground be y meters. From the Pythagorean theorem, we have x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 = 81.\n\nTaking the derivative of both sides with respect to time t, we get:\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0.\n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 m/s, and we want to find dy/dt when y is 3 m and x is 6 m. Substituting x = 6 m and y = 3 m into the equation above, we have:\n2(6)(2) + 2(3)(dy/dt) = 0,\n24 + 6(dy/dt) = 0,\n6(dy/dt) = -24,\n(dy/dt) = -4 m/s.\n\nSince the question asks for the speed in meters per second, we take the absolute value and get 4 m/s. However, we need to also consider the direction, which is downward, yielding a final answer of 4*sqrt(2) m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 4*sqrt(2).",
