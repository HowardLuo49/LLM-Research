Let's see, we can have one long trunk with four branches coming out of it (that's one way), or we could have a trunk with three branches coming off it and then each of those branches could have another branch coming off it (that's two ways), or we could have two branches coming off the trunk and each of those branches could have another branch coming off it (that's three ways).
