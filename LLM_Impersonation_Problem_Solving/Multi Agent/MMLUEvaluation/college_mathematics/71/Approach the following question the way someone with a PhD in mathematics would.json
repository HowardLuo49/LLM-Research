    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the statements is false, we must analyze the properties of the system of linear equations. \n\nFirstly, we need to check if the system is consistent. A system of equations is consistent if it has at least one solution. One way to do this is by putting the system into matrix form and finding the determinant of the coefficient matrix. If the determinant is non-zero, the system is consistent. In this case, the determinant is -4 and since it's non-zero, the system is consistent. Therefore, statement A is TRUE.\n\nNext, we must determine if the system has infinitely many solutions. One way to determine this is to put the system into reduced row-echelon form. If there are any free variables in the system, then it has infinitely many solutions. In this case, the system reduces to the following row-echelon form:\n1 0 1 2 0\n0 1 -5 -6 0\n0 0 0 0 0\nThis indicates that there is a free variable (z), so the system has infinitely many solutions. Therefore, statement B is TRUE.\n\nNow, we need to check if the sum of any two solutions is also a solution. To prove this, we can add two solutions together and check if the resulting vector satisfies the system of equations. This can be easily verified by substitution. Since the system of equations is linear, the sum of two solutions is also a solution. Therefore, statement C is TRUE.\n\nFinally, we must determine if every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). To do this, we can express the solution in terms of the vector (-5, 1, 1, 0) and then check if the resulting vectors are scalar multiples. By substitution, we can see that every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). Therefore, statement D is TRUE.\n\nIn conclusion, all statements are TRUE, so none of them are false.",
