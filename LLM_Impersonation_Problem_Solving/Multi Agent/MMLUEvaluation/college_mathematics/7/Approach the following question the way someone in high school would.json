Points A and B are chosen randomly such that A and B divide the segment into three smaller segments. What is the probability that the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle?\nA: 0\nB: 10%\nC: 25%\nD: 50%",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, let's think about what conditions are needed for the three smaller segments to form a triangle. In a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. \n\nSo let's consider the possible lengths of the three segments. Since the total length of the segment is 10, the smallest a segment can be is 0 and the largest it can be is 10.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. If one of the segments is at 0 and the other two segments are 5 each, they can't form a triangle because 5 + 5 = 10 which is equal to the length of the whole segment.\n\n2. If one of the segments is at 0, one is at 5, and one is at 5, they can't form a triangle because 5 + 5 = 10 which is equal to the length of the whole segment.\n\n3. If one of the segments is at 1, one is at 4, and the other is at 5, they can't form a triangle because 4 + 5 is 9, which is less than the length of the whole segment.\n\n4. If one of the segments is at 2, one is at 4, and the other is at 4, they can form a triangle because 4 + 4 is 8, which is greater than 2.\n\nSo out of all the possible combinations, only one allows the three segments to form a triangle. Therefore, the probability is 1 out of the total number of possible combinations. \n\nSince there's only 1 combination out of a total of 3 possible combinations (choosing points A and B out of 3 possible divisions of the segment), the probability is 1/3 or 33.33% which is closest to 25%. So the answer is C: 25%",
