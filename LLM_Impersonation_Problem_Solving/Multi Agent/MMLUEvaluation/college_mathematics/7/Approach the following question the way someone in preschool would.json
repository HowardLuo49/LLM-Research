    "gpt_response": "Hmm... to make a triangle, the sum of the lengths of two of the smaller segments must be greater than the length of the third smaller segment. Let's imagine playing with some blocks to see which ones could make a triangle. Hmm... after trying different ways, I think the probability is 50% because sometimes the smaller segments can make a triangle, but sometimes they can't. So the answer is D: 50%.",
