To do this, we usually look for the critical points where the derivative is zero.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = e^x - c. Setting this equal to zero, we get e^x - c = 0, which means e^x = c. So, x = log c.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f occurs at x = log c. Substituting this back into the original function, we get f(log c) = e^(log c) - c*log c = c - c*log c = c(1 - log c).\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: f(log c).",
