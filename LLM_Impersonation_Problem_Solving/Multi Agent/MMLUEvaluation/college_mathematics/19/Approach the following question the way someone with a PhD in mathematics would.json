Taking the limit of both sides of the given recurrence relation as n approaches infinity, we have:\n\nL = sqrt(3 + 2L)\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get:\n\nL^2 = 3 + 2L\n\nRearranging the equation, we have:\n\nL^2 - 2L - 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation which can be factored as:\n\n(L - 3)(L + 1) = 0\n\nTherefore, the fixed points of the given recurrence relation are L = 3 and L = -1.
