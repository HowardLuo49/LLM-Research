    "gpt_response": "In order to analyze the first statement, we should apply the first derivative test. Let f : [a, b] be a function with a local maximum at c. This means that f(c) is larger than or equal to f(x) for all x in a small interval around c. In order for f'(x) to exist at c, the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(c+h) - f(c)]/h must exist. This limit represents the derivative of f at c. In cases where a function has a local maximum, the derivative of the function at that point will be 0. This is because, for values of x close to c, the function slopes downward, indicating that the derivative is negative, and for values of x slightly larger than c, the function slopes upward, indicating that the derivative is positive. Therefore, the only possible value for the derivative at a local maximum (or minimum) is 0. In this case, statement 1 is true.\n\nFor the second statement, we are asked to determine whether non-constant continuous maps from R (the set of real numbers) to Q (the set of rational numbers) exist. We know that rational numbers are countable and real numbers are uncountable. Thus, there are more real numbers than rational numbers. Because of this difference in cardinality, it is possible to construct a continuous map between the two sets that is non-constant. An example of such a map is the function f(x) = 0 for all x in R. Therefore, statement 2 is also true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
