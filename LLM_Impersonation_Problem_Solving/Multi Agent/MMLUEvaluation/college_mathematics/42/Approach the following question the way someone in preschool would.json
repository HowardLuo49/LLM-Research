If f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on the open interval (-1, 4) such that f(3) = 5 and f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, what is the greatest possible value of f(0)?\nA: 3\nB: 4\nC: 5\nD: 8",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! The function f is a special function that changes smoothly, and we know that at x = 3, f equals 5. We also know that the slope of the function is always greater than or equal to -1. So, if we want to find the greatest possible value of f at x = 0, we can try to draw a line that starts at f(3) and has a slope of -1 until x = 0. \n\nLet's draw our line starting at (3, 5) with a slope of -1. If we keep going down by 1 for every 1 we go to the right, we get to x = 0 when y = 5 - 3 = 2. \n\nSo, the greatest possible value of f(0) is 2. \n\nLet's keep working on our math and practicing our drawing skills to find more fun answers!",
