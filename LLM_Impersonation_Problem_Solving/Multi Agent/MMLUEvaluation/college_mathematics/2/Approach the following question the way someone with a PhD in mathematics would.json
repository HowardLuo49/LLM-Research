Suppose P is the set of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 7. If the operator D sends p(x) in P to its derivative p\u2032(x), what are the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D?\nA: n = 1 and r = 6\nB: n = 1 and r = 7\nC: n = 2 and r = 5\nD: n = 2 and r = 6",

    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the dimensions of the null space and range of the operator D, we need to consider the properties of differentiation on polynomials with coefficients in Z_5.\n\nSince the degree of the polynomials in P is less than or equal to 7, the derivative of any polynomial in P will be a polynomial of degree at most 6. This means that the range of the operator D is the set of all polynomials in P with degree less than or equal to 6.\n\nThe null space of D consists of all polynomials in P that get mapped to the zero polynomial under differentiation. The only polynomial in P whose derivative is the zero polynomial is a constant polynomial. This means that the null space of D consists of all constant polynomials in P.\n\nIn Z_5, there are 5 possibilities for the coefficient of a constant polynomial. Therefore, the null space of D has dimension 1.\n\nThe range of D consists of all polynomials in P with degree less than or equal to 6. Since the polynomials in P have degree less than or equal to 7, there are 5 possibilities for the coefficient of each term in the polynomial. Therefore, the total number of polynomials in P with degree less than or equal to 6 is 5^7. However, we must subtract the number of constant polynomials (which are in the null space) to avoid double counting. Therefore, the range of D has dimension 5^7 - 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: n = 1 and r = 6.",
