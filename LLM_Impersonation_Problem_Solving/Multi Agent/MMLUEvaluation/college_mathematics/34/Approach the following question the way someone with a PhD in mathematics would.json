    "gpt_response": "Let A be an invertible matrix of order n. A matrix B of order n is said to be similar to A if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^-1AP.  It is easy to verify that if A and B are similar matrices, then they must have the same eigenvalues. \n\nI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices if B = P^-1AP. Since A and B are already similar matrices, let B = P^-1AP, where P is an invertible matrix. Then B - 2I = P^-1AP - 2P^-1IP = P^-1(A-2I)P. Therefore, A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices. \n\nII. The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries. Let tr(A) and tr(B) denote the traces of matrices A and B, respectively. Since A and B are similar matrices, they have the same eigenvalues, which implies that they have the same sum of diagonal entries, i.e., tr(A) = tr(B). Therefore, statement II is true.\n\nIII. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices if A^-1 and B^-1 have the same eigenvectors. Since A and B are similar matrices, they have the same eigenvalues, and therefore A^-1 and B^-1 will also have the same eigenvalues. However, this does not necessarily imply that they have the same eigenvectors. So, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: I only.",
