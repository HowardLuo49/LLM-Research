If A and B are similar matrices, which of the following statements must be true?\tI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices. II. A and B have the same trace.\t III. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I, II, and III",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, this question is a little tricky for preschoolers since it involves matrices and inverse operations. Let's break it down into simple terms!\n\nWell, if A and B are similar matrices, that means they are related in a special way. It's like they are twins or best friends! So, if A and B are similar matrices, then their inverses (A^-1 and B^-1) are also related in a special way. This means that statement III is true!\n\nAs for statement I, if A and B are similar matrices, that doesn't necessarily mean that A - 2I and B - 2I are also similar. So, statement I might not be true.\n\nLastly, for statement II, it says that A and B have the same trace. Hmmm, the trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements. So, if A and B are similar matrices, their diagonal elements might be related, but it doesn't necessarily mean they have the same trace. So, statement II might not be true either.\n\nSo, the answer is... C: III only!",
