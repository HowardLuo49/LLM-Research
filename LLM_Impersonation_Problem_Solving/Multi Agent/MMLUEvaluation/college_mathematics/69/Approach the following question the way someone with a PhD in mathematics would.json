    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week that will be 10^(10^(10)) days from now, we can start by finding the day of the week for 10 days from now, then 100 days from now, then 1000 days from now, and so on, until we reach 10^(10^(10)) days from now.\n\nTo find the day of the week for a specific number of days from now, we can use the fact that there are 7 days in a week and that the remainder when dividing the number of days by 7 will give us the day of the week.\n\n10 days from now: 10 mod 7 = 3 (Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday)\n100 days from now: 100 mod 7 = 2 (Saturday + 2 days = Monday)\n1000 days from now: 1000 mod 7 = 5 (Monday + 5 days = Saturday)\n10000 days from now: 10000 mod 7 = 6 (Saturday + 6 days = Friday)\n100000 days from now: 100000 mod 7 = 3 (Friday + 3 days = Monday)\n.\n.\n.\nAfter completing this process multiple times, we will eventually reach 10^(10^(10)) days from now. Since the process cycles through repeating patterns of days of the week, we can see that the pattern for the remainder when dividing by 7 is 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, and so on. Therefore, 10^(10^(10)) mod 7 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the day of the week that will be 10^(10^(10)) days from now is Wednesday, which corresponds to option D.",
