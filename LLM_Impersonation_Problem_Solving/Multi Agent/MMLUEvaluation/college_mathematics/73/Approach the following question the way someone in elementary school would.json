Suppose A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix such that det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, where I is the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix. Which of the following are TRUE of A?\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nII. The determinate of A is \u22123.\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues \u22123 and 1.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To find the trace of A, we need to add up the values on the diagonal of A. Since det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3, when we plug in \u03bb = 1, we get 1 + 3 + 1 - 3 = 2, not 3. So I is actually not true.\n\nTo find the determinant of A, we need to plug in \u03bb = 0 in the equation det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3. When we do this, we get -(-3) = 3, not -3. So II is also not true.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of A, we need to set det(A - \u03bbI) = 0 and solve for \u03bb. When we do this, we find that the eigenvalues of A are actually -3, 1, and 1, not just -3 and 1. So III is also not true.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements are actually true. So the correct answer is none of the above.",
