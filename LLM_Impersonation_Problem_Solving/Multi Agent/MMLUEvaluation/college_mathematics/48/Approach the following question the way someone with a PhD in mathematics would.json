The interval of convergence for a power series typically excludes the endpoint where the series diverges, which in this case is x = 3. Therefore, (I) [\u22121, 3) is not a valid interval of convergence.\n\nFor (II) (\u2212\u221e, 0], we need to analyze the behavior of the series as x approaches 0 from the left.
