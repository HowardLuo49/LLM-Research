    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first let's look at the curve with the parametric equations x = cos t and y = sin t. When t is between 0 and pi, we have to find the length of this curve.\n\nWe know the curve is a circle because x = cos t and y = sin t are the parametric equations for a circle. A circle has a circumference of 2pi, but we only want the length from 0 to pi.\n\nSo, the length of the curve is half of the circumference of the circle, which is pi. So, the answer is B: pi.",
