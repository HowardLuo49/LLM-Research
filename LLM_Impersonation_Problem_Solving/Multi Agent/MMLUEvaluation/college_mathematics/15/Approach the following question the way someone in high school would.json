If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

A compact set is always bounded, so if K is compact, every continuous real-valued function defined on K will be bounded. And if every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K must be compact. As for statement III, I don't think it necessarily has to be true.",
