It's bounded and Lebesgue integrable. \n\nA: This answer choice is asking if f must also be Riemann integrable. Hmm, well I know that just because a function is Lebesgue integrable doesn't mean it's always Riemann integrable. So, this one might not be true.\n\nB: This answer choice is talking about nondifferentiability at certain points. I remember learning that not every Lebesgue integrable function is differentiable at every point, so this one might be true.\n\nC: This answer choice is similar to B but instead talks about uncountable subsets. I'm not sure about this one... \n\nD: This answer choice says none of the above are true. Hmm, maybe this is the right answer since I wasn't sure about B and C.\n\nSo, after thinking about all the answer choices, I think the answer is D: None of the above.",
