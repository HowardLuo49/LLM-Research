    "gpt_response": "Oh, I love playing with forces and paths! So, this question is asking about the work done by a force F on a particle moving along a path in xyz-space. The force F is constant and parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1). The path of the particle is given by (t, t^2, t^3) between time t=0 and time t=1.\n\nTo find the work done by the force, we need to calculate the dot product of the force and the displacement of the particle along the path. The displacement vector is the difference between the final position (when t=1) and the initial position (when t=0).\n\nLet's first find the displacement vector:\nDisplacement vector = (1, 1^2, 1^3) - (0, 0^2, 0^3)\nDisplacement vector = (1, 1, 1)\n\nNow, let's find the dot product of the force F and the displacement vector:\nF dot displacement = (-1, 0, 1) dot (1, 1, 1)\nF dot displacement = -1(1) + 0(1) + 1(1)\nF dot displacement = -1 + 0 + 1\nF dot displacement = 0\n\nSince the dot product is zero, the work done by the force on the particle is zero. So, the answer is C: 0.\n\nYay, we did it! Good job, everyone!",
