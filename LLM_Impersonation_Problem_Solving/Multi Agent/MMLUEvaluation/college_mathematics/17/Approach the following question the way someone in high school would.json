What is the work done by F on a particle that moves along the path given by (t, t^2, t^3) between time t=0 and time t=1?\nA: -1/4\nB: -1/(4sqrt(2))\nC: 0\nD: sqrt(2)",

    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the equation for the work done by a force. The work done by a force is given by the dot product of the force and the displacement of the object. Mathematically, this can be expressed as W = F * d, where W is the work done, F is the force vector, and d is the displacement vector.\n\nSince the force F is given as (-1, 0, 1) and the path the particle moves along is given as (t, t^2, t^3), we can find the displacement vector by subtracting the initial position vector (0, 0, 0) from the final position vector (1, 1, 1). This gives us the displacement vector d as (1, 1, 1).\n\nTo find the work done, we take the dot product of the force vector F and the displacement vector d:\n\nW = (-1, 0, 1) * (1, 1, 1) \n= -1*1 + 0*1 + 1*1\n= -1 + 0 + 1\n= 0\n\nTherefore, the work done by the force F on the particle moving along the given path is 0. So, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 0",
