For which of the following rings is it possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero?\nA: The ring of complex numbers\nB: The ring of integers modulo 11\nC: The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]\nD: The ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}",

    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the given rings allow for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero, we need to consider the zero divisors in each ring. A zero divisor is a nonzero element that when multiplied by another nonzero element results in zero.\n\nA: The ring of complex numbers does not have zero divisors, as the product of two nonzero complex numbers is always nonzero. Thus, it is not possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero in this ring.\n\nB: In the ring of integers modulo 11, zero divisors do exist. For example, 2 * 6 = 0 (mod 11). Therefore, it is possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero in this ring.\n\nC: In the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1], there exist functions which are zero at certain points. For example, the constant function f(x) = 0 is a nonzero element whose product with any other nonzero function would result in zero. Therefore, it is possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero in this ring.\n\nD: In the ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}, zero divisors exist. For example, (1 + sqrt(2)) * (1 - sqrt(2)) = 1 - 2 = -1, which is zero in this ring.
