Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors.

T is like a magic machine that turns the block rectangles into block towers. The kernel of T is like the blocks that get squished down to nothing when they go through the machine. So, since the rectangles are size 2x3, the dimension of the subspace kernel of T is 3, which is answer B! Yay for blocks!",
