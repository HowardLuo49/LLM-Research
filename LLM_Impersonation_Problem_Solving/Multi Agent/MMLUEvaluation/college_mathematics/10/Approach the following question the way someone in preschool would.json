    "gpt_response": "A complete graph with 10 vertices has all possible edges connecting each pair of vertices, meaning every vertex is connected to every other vertex. To figure out how many edges are in a complete graph with 10 vertices, you can count them all by drawing the vertices and connecting each pair with an edge.\n\nAh! But we can also use a formula to find the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices. The formula is n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, we have 10 vertices, so we can substitute n = 10 into the formula:\n\n10(10-1)/2 = 10(9)/2 = 90/2 = 45\n\nSo a complete graph with 10 vertices has 45 edges. \n\nThe answer is D: 45.",
