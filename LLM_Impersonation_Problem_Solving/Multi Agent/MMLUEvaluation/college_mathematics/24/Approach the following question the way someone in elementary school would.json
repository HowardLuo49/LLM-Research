For statement 1, it's saying that if you have two sequences of complex numbers that go to a certain limit, then if you multiply those two sequences together, the limit of the product is just the product of the limits. So, that means statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, for statement 2, it's saying that there's a sequence of real numbers that don't have a limit, but they stay bounded. And even if you look at all the sub-sequences, none of them converge to a limit. That sounds kind of crazy, but let's go with it and say statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, if we put it all together, statement 1 is true and statement 2 is also true. That would make the answer A: True, True.",
