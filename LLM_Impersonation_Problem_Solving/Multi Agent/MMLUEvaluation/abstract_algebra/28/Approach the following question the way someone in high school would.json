    "gpt_response": "Well, if Statement 1 says that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements, then that means it's possible for a group of 6 elements to map to a group of 12 elements. And if Statement 2 says that there is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements, then that also supports the idea that a group of 6 elements can map to a group of 12 elements. So I think the answer is A: True, True.",
