    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's count together to find the answer. \n\nFirst, we need to figure out the order of the factor group. We have Z_11 x Z_15, which means we have 11 elements in the first group and 15 elements in the second group. \n\nNext, we need to consider the element <1, 1> that we are dividing by. If we divide by this element, that means we are making it equal to the identity element (1, 1). \n\nSo, if we divide by <1, 1>, we are left with:\n(1, 1) * (a, b) = (a, b)\n\nThis means that any element multiplied by <1, 1> is equal to itself. \n\nLet's think about what this means for our factor group. Since multiplying by <1, 1> doesn't change any element, our factor group really only has one element in it! \n\nSo the order of the factor group is 1. Let's pick answer choice A: 1! Yay for math!",
