    "gpt_response": "Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me explain it in a simpler way.\n\nStatement 1 says that every permutation is a cycle. Well, a permutation is when you change the order of things, like switching the positions of numbers. A cycle is when you have a group of things that go in a circle, like a bicycle wheel. So, it makes sense that every permutation could be a cycle because you're changing the order of things.\n\nStatement 2 says that every cycle is a permutation. So, if you have a group of things that go in a circle, like a bicycle wheel, that could also be considered a permutation because you're changing the order of things.\n\nSo, I think both statements are true. Every permutation can be a cycle, and every cycle can be a permutation. So, the answer is A: True, True.",
