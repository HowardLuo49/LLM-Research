    "gpt_response": "Hmm, looking at Statement 1, I remember learning that a group is non-Abelian if the group operation does not commute. So if S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3, that means it doesn't commute, right? And for Statement 2, I know that the order of a permutation that is an m-cycle is m, and same for an n-cycle. And when you multiply permutations, the order is the least common multiple of the orders. So if a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n). Putting it together, both statements seem to be true. So I think the answer is A: True, True.",
