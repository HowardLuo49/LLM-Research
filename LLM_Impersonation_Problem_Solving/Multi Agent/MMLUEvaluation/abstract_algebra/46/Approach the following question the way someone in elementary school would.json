    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let me think about this in a simpler way. \n\nFor the first statement about homomorphisms having empty kernel, that means the only way for it to be false is if homomorphisms always have a kernel. I remember that a kernel is like the set of things that turn into the identity element, right? So, it could be possible for a homomorphism to not have anything turning into the identity element, which would make the kernel empty. So, I think Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, for the second statement, it is saying that you can't have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. A nontrivial homomorphism is when things other than the identity element get mapped to the identity element in the group. Since a finite group has only a limited number of elements, it might be hard to find a way to map everything to the identity element in an infinite group. So, I think Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, my final answer is A: True, True.",
