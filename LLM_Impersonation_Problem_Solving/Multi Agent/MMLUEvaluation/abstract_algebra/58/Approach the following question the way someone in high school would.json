I remember something about cyclic groups being ones where all the elements are generated by just one element. So that might be true.\n\nFor statement 2, it's saying that every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. I think normal subgroups are those that stay the same under conjugation. And nontrivial proper normal subgroups are ones that are not just the whole group itself. So that might be true too.\n\nSo I would go with answer choice C: True, False.",
