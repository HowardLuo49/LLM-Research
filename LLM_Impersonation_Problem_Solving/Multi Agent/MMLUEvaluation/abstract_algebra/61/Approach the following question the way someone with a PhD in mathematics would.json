To prove this, we need to show that the set of all 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant satisfies the four group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element. \n\nThe closure property holds because the product of two 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant will also have integer entries and nonzero determinant.\n\nThe associativity property holds because matrix multiplication is associative.\n\nThe identity element is the 2x2 identity matrix, which has integer entries and nonzero determinant.\n\nThe inverse element exists for each matrix in the set because the determinant is nonzero, so the inverse matrix will also have integer entries and nonzero determinant.\n\nTherefore, the set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant forms a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nThe second statement is false. The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is not closed under matrix multiplication.
