    "gpt_response": "To find the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25, we need to determine the order of 25 modulo 30. \n\nThe order of an element a modulo n is the smallest positive integer k such that a^k is congruent to 1 modulo n. In this case, we are looking for the smallest positive integer k such that 25^k is congruent to 1 modulo 30.\n\nWe can start by calculating the powers of 25 modulo 30:\n25^1 \u2261 25 (mod 30)\n25^2 \u2261 25 * 25 \u2261 625 \u2261 25 (mod 30)\n25^3 \u2261 25 * 25 * 25 \u2261 15625 \u2261 25 (mod 30)\n\nWe can observe that 25^k is always congruent to 25 modulo 30, and it never becomes congruent to 1. Therefore, the order of 25 modulo 30 is infinite, and the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 contains infinitely many elements.\n\nSo, the correct answer is not among the options provided.",
