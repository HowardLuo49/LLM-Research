    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. Statement 1 is saying that the function f must be injective, which means that different elements in set A cannot map to the same element in set B. Statement 2 is saying that the function f must be surjective, which means that every element in set B has a pre-image in set A.\n\nAlright, so let's think about this. If g(f(a)) = a for all a in set A, that means that function g must be the inverse of function f. In other words, g undoes what f does. \n\nIf function g is the inverse of function f, that means that if f is injective, then g must be surjective. And if f is surjective, then g must be injective. \n\nSo, if g is surjective (Statement 2), then f must be injective. This makes Statement 1 true. But if g is injective (Statement 1), then f must be surjective. This makes Statement 2 false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: C) True, False.",
