If we have groups H and K inside group G, then the formula says that the size of the product group HK is equal to the product of the sizes of H and K divided by the size of their intersection. So that sounds like it could be true! And for the second statement about a group of order 2p where p is an odd prime, it could either be a cyclic group or isomorphic to something called D_p. I'm not sure what that means, but it could be true or false. Let's go with A: True, True!",
