    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We're talking about the element (4,2) in Z_12 x Z_8. That means we have two numbers to work with. Now, to find the order of this element, we need to keep adding it to itself until we get back to the original element. Let's see, if we add (4,2) to itself 4 times, we get (0,0). So, the order of (4,2) is 4. That means the answer is A: 4! Yay!",
