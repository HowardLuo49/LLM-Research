So if we want to find the inverse of a number, we need to think about what we can add to a to get 0. Let's try the options!\n\nA: 0 - If we add 0 to any number in our group, we get a+0+1 = a+1, not 0. So A is not the inverse.\n\nB: -2 - If we add -2 to a, we get a+(-2)+1 = a-1, not 0. So B is not the inverse.\n\nC: a-2 - If we add a-2 to a, we get a+(a-2)+1 = 2a-1, not 0. So C is not the inverse.\n\nD: (2+a)*-1 - If we add (2+a)*-1 to a, we get a + (2+a)*-1 + 1 = a + (2 + a)*-1 + 1, which simplifies to 0. So D is the inverse!\n\nYay, we found it!
