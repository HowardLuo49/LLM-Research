    "gpt_response": "Statement 1 says that if R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain. That means if you have a ring where you can add, subtract, and multiply, R[x] is also a ring where you can add, subtract, and multiply. This statement is true.\n\nStatement 2 says that if you have two polynomials f(x) and g(x) in the ring R[x], then the degree of the product f(x)g(x) is equal to the sum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x). For example, if f(x) is x^2 and g(x) is x^3, then the degree of the product f(x)g(x) would be 5 (2+3). This statement is also true.\n\nSo the answer is A: True, True.",
