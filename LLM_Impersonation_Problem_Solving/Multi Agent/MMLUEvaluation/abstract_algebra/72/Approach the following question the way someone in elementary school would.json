    "gpt_response": "First, let's write down the theorem: \"Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a^p - a is an integer multiple of p.\"\n\nIn this case, we have p = 23 and a = 3. So, according to Fermat's theorem, 3^23 is congruent to 3 mod 23.\n\nTherefore, we can simplify the problem down to finding the remainder of 3^2 when divided by 23, because 47 is one more than a multiple of 23 (since 47 = 2 * 23 + 1).\n\nBy squaring 3, we get 9. Therefore, the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is the same as the remainder of 9 when divided by 23, which is 9.",
