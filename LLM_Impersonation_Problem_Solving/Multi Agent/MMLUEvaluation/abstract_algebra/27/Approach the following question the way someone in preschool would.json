Let's see if we can find a number that when dividing all the coefficients of our polynomial by it, at least one of them won't be divisible by it. Oh yes, I remember, we need to look for a prime number! Let's try dividing all the coefficients by 2 first. Hmm, no luck, all of them are divisible by 2. Now let's try dividing them by 3. Oh no, they all still are divisible by 3. Let's try 5 this time. Yes, when we divide them by 5, they're not all divisible by 5! Yay, that means the polynomial in Z[x] satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q with p=5. So the answer is C: Yes, with p=5.",
