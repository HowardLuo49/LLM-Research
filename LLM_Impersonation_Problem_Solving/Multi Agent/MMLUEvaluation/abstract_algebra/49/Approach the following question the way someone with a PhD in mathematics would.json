The order of an element in a direct product of groups is the least common multiple of the orders of its components.\n\nIn this case, the orders of Z_8, Z_10, and Z_24 are 8, 10, and 24, respectively. The least common multiple of these numbers is 120. Therefore, the maximum possible order for some element of Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24 is 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 120.",
