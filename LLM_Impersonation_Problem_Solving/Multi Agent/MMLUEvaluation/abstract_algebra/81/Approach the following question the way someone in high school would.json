    "gpt_response": "Um, I think both statements are true. Because even in high school math, we learned that a free abelian group means a group with a basis. And since a nonzero free abelian group would have at least one basis, it makes sense that it would have an infinite number of bases. And for the second statement, if a free abelian group has a rank of at least 2, then it would have more than one basis, right? So it should also have an infinite number of bases. So I think the answer is A: True, True.",
