And Statement 2 is saying that every homomorphism is a one-to-one map. What's a one-to-one map? I think it means that each thing in the first group goes to a different thing in the second group. But I don't think that's always true. Sometimes things in the first group can go to the same thing in the second group. So, I think Statement 2 is false. So my answer is C: True, False.",
