    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. Statement 1 says that if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. That seems reasonable, because if you have one element of order 15, you can generate more elements of order 15 by raising that element to different powers.\n\nNow let's look at Statement 2. It says that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This doesn't make sense to me. If you have more than 8 elements of order 15, that just means you have a lot of elements with that order, not necessarily exactly 16.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. I guess that means the answer is C: True, False.",
