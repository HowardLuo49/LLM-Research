    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count together and find the zeros of the polynomial in Z_5. We start with x=0. When we plug in x=0 into the polynomial, we get 0^5 + 3(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 2(0) = 0. So, x=0 is a zero of the polynomial in Z_5. Let's try x=1 now. When we plug in x=1, we get 1^5 + 3(1)^3 + (1)^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 2. So, x=1 is not a zero of the polynomial in Z_5. Finally, let's try x=4. Plugging in x=4, we get 4^5 + 3(4)^3 + (4)^2 + 2(4) = 4 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 1. So, x=4 is also a zero of the polynomial in Z_5. Therefore, the zeros of the polynomial in Z_5 are x=0 and x=4. So, the answer is D: 0, 4.",
