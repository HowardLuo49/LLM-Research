This is not necessarily true for an abelian group. While it is true for certain abelian groups such as the trivial group, it does not hold true for all abelian groups in general.\n\nOption B states that g = g^2 for every g in G. This is also not necessarily true for an abelian group. Again, it may hold true for specific abelian groups, but not all abelian groups in general.\n\nOption C states that (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G. This property actually does hold true for all abelian groups, due to the commutative nature of the group operation. Therefore, Option C is the correct answer.\n\nOption D states that G is of finite order. This statement is not guaranteed to be true for an abelian group. Abelian groups can be either finite or infinite in terms of order, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question would be Option C.",
