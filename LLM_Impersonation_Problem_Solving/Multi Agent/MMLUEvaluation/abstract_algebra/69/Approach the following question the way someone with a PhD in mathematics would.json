    "gpt_response": "To approach this question with a mathematical mindset, we need to analyze the statements provided in a precise and logical manner.\n\nStatement 1 states that there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank. This is a well-known fact in group theory, as it is known that for every positive integer n, there exists a free abelian group of rank n. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 states that a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. This statement is also true. The Betti number of a group is the rank of the free part of its homology, and for a finitely generated abelian group, this Betti number is equal to the number of elements in a generating set if and only if the group is free abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True",
