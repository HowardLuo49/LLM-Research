    "gpt_response": "Umm, okay so for the first statement, it's saying that you can have a free abelian group for any positive integer rank. I think that's true because you can basically just have a bunch of copies of Z added together. And for the second statement, it's saying that a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if the Betti number equals the number of elements in a generating set. I'm not really sure what a Betti number is, but I do know that a free abelian group is one where you can have a basis where the elements are independent. So I think that one is false because just having the same number of elements in a generating set doesn't necessarily mean the group is free abelian. So I would go with option C: True, False.",
