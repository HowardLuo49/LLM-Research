    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to understand the concepts of maximal ideals and prime ideals, as well as the relationship between an ideal being maximal and the quotient ring being a field.\n\nStatement 1: Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.\nThis statement is true. A maximal ideal is an ideal that is not properly contained in any other proper ideal. A prime ideal is an ideal such that if a product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of the elements is in the ideal. It can be shown that every maximal ideal is also a prime ideal. This is a fundamental result in ring theory.\n\nStatement 2: If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field.\nThis statement is also true. If I is a maximal ideal of a ring R, then the quotient ring R/I is a field. This is because the maximality of the ideal ensures that the elements of R/I behave like units in a field, with inverses in the quotient ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA: True, True",
