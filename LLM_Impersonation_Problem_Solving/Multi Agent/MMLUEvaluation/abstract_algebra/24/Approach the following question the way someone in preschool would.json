    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. So the first statement says that every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. That means if something is a maximal ideal, it must also be a prime ideal. And the second statement says that if you have a maximal ideal of a commutative ring, then the ring divided by the ideal is a field. So if we put these statements together, it seems like both of them could be true. So I think the answer is True, True!",
