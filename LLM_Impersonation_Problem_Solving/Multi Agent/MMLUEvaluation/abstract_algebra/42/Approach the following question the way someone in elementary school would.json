    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... Statement 1 is talking about a group having a subgroup of a certain size. And Statement 2 is talking about the number of left and right cosets in a group. I remember that a normal subgroup is one where the left and right cosets are the same. So, I think Statement 1 is true because an abelian group of order 45 can have a subgroup of order 10. And I think Statement 2 is false because a subgroup being normal doesn't just depend on the number of left and right cosets being equal. So, my answer is C: True, False.",
