Statement 2 | A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if thenumber of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\nA: True, True\nB: False, False\nC: True, False\nD: False, True",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "I think the answer is D: False, True. The first statement seems true because abelian groups can have subgroups of any order. However, the second statement is definitely true because a subgroup being normal does mean that the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets.",
