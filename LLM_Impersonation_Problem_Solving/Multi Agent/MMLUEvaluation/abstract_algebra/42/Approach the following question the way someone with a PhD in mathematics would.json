    "gpt_response": "To approach this question with a PhD in mathematics, we first need to understand the definitions and properties of abelian groups, orders of groups, subgroups, and normal subgroups.\n\nAn abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative. Order refers to the number of elements in a group. A subgroup of a group is a subset of the group that is itself a group under the same operation.\n\nStatement 1 is saying that there exists an abelian group of order 45 that has a subgroup of order 10. This statement is actually false. This is because the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group by Lagrange's theorem, and 10 does not divide 45.\n\nStatement 2 is describing the property of normal subgroups, where a subgroup is normal if and only if the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets. This statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: B: False, False",
