    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. First, Statement 1 says that any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent. Well, since R^2 is a two-dimensional space, any two vectors will span the space and will be linearly independent. So, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, Statement 2 is saying that if V is the span of v1 to vk and those vectors are linearly independent, then the dimension of V is equal to k. This makes sense because if the vectors are independent, they can't be written as linear combinations of each other, so they span a k-dimensional subspace. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, the answer is A: True, True.",
