    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. Statement 1 says that any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent. That means they are not just multiples of each other. So, that could be true. Statement 2 says that if we have a span of vectors that are linearly independent, then the dimension of that span is equal to the number of vectors. That makes sense too. So, I think the answer is A: True, True.",
