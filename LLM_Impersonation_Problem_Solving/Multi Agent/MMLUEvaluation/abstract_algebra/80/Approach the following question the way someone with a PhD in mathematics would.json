When we take the external direct product of two cyclic groups, we essentially combine the elements of both groups to form a new group. Since cyclic groups are generated by a single element, the external direct product of cyclic groups will also be cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12.\n\nThis statement is false. The dihedral group D_n is defined as the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon. The dihedral group D_3 has 6 elements, while D_4 has 8 elements. The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 would have 6*8 = 48 elements, which is not isomorphic to D_12.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: True, False.",
