That means that our identity friend must be the one that when added to any friend, gives us the same friend back! Who could that be? Let's try each one out and see which one works best! Let's try adding 0 to a friend, like 3. 0 * 3 = 0 + 3 + 1 = 4. Oh no, that's not right! Let's try 1. 1 * 3 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5. Hmm, that's not right either. Let's try -1. -1 * 3 = -1 + 3 + 1 = 3! That worked! So our identity friend must be -1. Yay, we did it! The answer is C: -1.",
