    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so statement 1 is saying that every field is also a ring, and statement 2 is saying that every ring has a multiplicative identity. Well, I remember learning that fields are a special kind of ring that also have division, so statement 1 sounds true to me. And I also remember learning that rings have a multiplicative identity, so statement 2 sounds true as well. So I think the answer is A: True, True.",
