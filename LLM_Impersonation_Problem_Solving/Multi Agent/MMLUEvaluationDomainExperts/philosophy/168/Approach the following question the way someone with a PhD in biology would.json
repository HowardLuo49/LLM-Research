However, I can provide some insight into how a biologist might approach this question.\n\nAccording to Gauthier, deliberative justification is a theory that emphasizes the importance of rational deliberation and decision-making in ethical decision-making. In this context, deliberative justification does not necessarily refute morality itself, but rather suggests that moral decisions should be justified through rational deliberation.\n\nGiven this understanding, option D, which suggests that deliberative justification ignores morality and replaces it, seems to be a misinterpretation of Gauthier's theory. In reality, deliberative justification is intended to complement moral considerations by providing a framework for making ethical decisions based on rational reasoning.\n\nTherefore, as a biologist, I would argue that option D is incorrect and that deliberative justification does not ignore morality, but rather seeks to enhance our moral decision-making by incorporating rational deliberation.",
