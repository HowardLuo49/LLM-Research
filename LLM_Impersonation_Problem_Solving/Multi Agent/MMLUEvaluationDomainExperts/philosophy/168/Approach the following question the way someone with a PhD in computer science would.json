    "gpt_response": "According to Gauthier, deliberative justification is an important concept in the realm of moral philosophy. It is not refuted by moral requirements, as some may argue, but rather is enhanced and complemented by them. Deliberative justification does not ignore morality, as it is actually intertwined with moral principles and considerations. In fact, once we acknowledge moral requirements, deliberative justification becomes even more pertinent and necessary in ensuring ethical decision-making processes.
