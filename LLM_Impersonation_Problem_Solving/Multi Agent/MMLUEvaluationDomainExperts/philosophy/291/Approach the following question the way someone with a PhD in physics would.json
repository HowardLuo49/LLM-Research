Cicero's assertion that immorality is repugnant to Nature suggests a belief that ethical behavior aligns with fundamental principles governing the universe. On the other hand, expediency, which prioritizes convenience or utility over moral considerations, is seen as conflicting with the inherent order and balance of nature. Therefore, the correct answer would be that according to Cicero, immorality is in accord with Nature, and expediency is repugnant to Nature.",
