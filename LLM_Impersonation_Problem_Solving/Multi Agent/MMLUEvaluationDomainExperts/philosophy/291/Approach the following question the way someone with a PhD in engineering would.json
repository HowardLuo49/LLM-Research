Cicero, as a philosopher, believed that immorality goes against the natural order of things and is therefore considered repugnant to Nature. On the other hand, expediency, which often involves taking shortcuts or morally questionable actions for personal gain or advantage, is also seen as contradictory to the natural order and therefore repugnant to Nature. This understanding aligns with option C, where immorality is in accord with Nature and expediency is repugnant to Nature.",
