Hume claims that a person who is unaffected by images of human happiness or misery will also be indifferent to:\nA: art and beauty.\nB: virtue and vice.\nC: his own well-being.\nD: all of the above.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, it is important to consider the biological basis of emotions and empathy in humans. Hume's claim suggests that an individual who is unaffected by images of human happiness or misery lacks the emotional capacity to connect with others on a basic level. This lack of emotional empathy may extend beyond human interactions to include a lack of appreciation for art and beauty, which often evoke emotional responses in individuals. Additionally, the absence of empathy may also lead to indifference towards virtues and vices, as moral emotions are integral to understanding and adhering to ethical principles. This lack of emotional connection may also extend to the individual's own well-being, as self-preservation and self-care are often driven by emotional cues and responses. Therefore, based on Hume's claim, it is plausible that a person who is indifferent to images of human happiness or misery will also be indifferent to art and beauty, virtue and vice, and their own well-being, suggesting that the correct answer is D: all of the above.",
