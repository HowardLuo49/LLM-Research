Contractarianism typically involves individuals agreeing to abide by certain rules or constraints for mutual benefit, whereas Kantian ethics is often understood as a deontological theory based on the inherent worth of moral agents.\n\nIn conclusion, the interpretation of Kant's ethics as consisting of a finite set of constraints presents a complex and nuanced philosophical issue that requires careful examination and consideration of its implications for moral theory and practice.",
