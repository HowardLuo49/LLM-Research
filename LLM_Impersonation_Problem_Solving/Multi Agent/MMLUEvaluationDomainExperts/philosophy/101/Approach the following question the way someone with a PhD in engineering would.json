    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a utilitarian perspective. Brandt's theory suggests that an ideal moral rule is one that maximizes utility, where utility is defined as maximizing the overall well-being or happiness of individuals. In this context, utility includes both positive and negative aspects, as the goal is to maximize overall welfare or happiness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to Brandt's theory would be:\n\nC: maximize utility, with both positive and negative utilities being counted.",
