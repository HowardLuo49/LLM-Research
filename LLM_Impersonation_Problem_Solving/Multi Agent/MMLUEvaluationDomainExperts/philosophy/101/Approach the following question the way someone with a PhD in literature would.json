    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by analyzing Brandt's theory within the context of moral philosophy and ethical decision-making. Brandt's theory is based on the principle of utilitarianism, which suggests that the ideal moral rule should aim to maximize overall utility, often understood in terms of promoting happiness or pleasure and minimizing suffering or pain.\n\nIn this context, an ideal moral rule according to Brandt would be one that maximizes utility, taking into account both positive and negative consequences. This aligns with option C, where both positive and negative utilities are considered in determining the ethical decision.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that according to Brandt's theory, an ideal moral rule is one that maximizes utility, with both positive and negative utilities being accounted for.",
