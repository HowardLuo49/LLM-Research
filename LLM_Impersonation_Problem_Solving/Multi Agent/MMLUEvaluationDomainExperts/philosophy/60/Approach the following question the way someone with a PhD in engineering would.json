According to Baier\u2019s theory, the second step in assessing whether an action is morally permissible is to find out:\nA: whether it is forbidden by a moral rule of one\u2019s group.\nB: whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.\nC: whether it is forbidden by a law.\nD: whether one can approve of it.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "B: whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.\n\nIn Baier's theory, the second step in assessing whether an action is morally permissible involves determining the authenticity and legitimacy of the moral rule that prohibits the action. This requires a critical examination of the moral framework within which the rule is situated, the rationale behind the rule, and its consistency with broader ethical principles. By scrutinizing the genuineness of the moral rule, one can better evaluate the ethical implications of the action in question and make an informed judgment on its moral permissibility.",
