According to Parfit, both Taurek and Lewis assume that for there to be a \u201csum of pain,\u201d it must be:\nA: all felt at a single time.\nB: all felt by a single person.\nC: all be caused by a single source.\nD: all of the above.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In examining the perspectives of Taurek and Lewis on the concept of a \"sum of pain,\" it is crucial to consider that both philosophers share the assumption that for this sum to exist, certain conditions must be met. One such condition is that the pain must be experienced by a single person, as indicated by option B. This requirement implies that the accumulation or aggregation of pain is contingent upon it being felt by a solitary individual. Additionally, it is important to note that Taurek and Lewis do not necessarily assert that the pain must be all felt at a single time (option A) or all caused by a single source (option C) for it to constitute a sum. Therefore, the correct answer to the question posed is option B: all felt by a single person.",
