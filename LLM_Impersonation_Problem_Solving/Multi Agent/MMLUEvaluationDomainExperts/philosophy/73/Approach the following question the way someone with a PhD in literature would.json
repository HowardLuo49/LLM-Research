This assumption is challenged by Parfit, who argues that the identity of the person experiencing the pain should not matter in assessing the total amount of pain. Therefore, options A and C can be directly disregarded.\n\nOption B, all felt by a single person, is the position taken by both Taurek and Lewis.
