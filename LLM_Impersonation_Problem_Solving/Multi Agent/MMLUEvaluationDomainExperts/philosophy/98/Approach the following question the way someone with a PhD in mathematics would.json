Ethical judgments often serve as a way to guide behavior and decision-making by influencing individuals or groups towards certain moral values or principles. \n\nWhile ethical judgments may also involve stating facts or describing one's own approval of things, these functions are secondary to the overarching goal of influencing the interests of others through moral guidance.
