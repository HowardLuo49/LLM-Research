    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first recognizing the importance of ethics in engineering practice. Ethical judgments play a crucial role in decision-making processes within engineering, particularly when it comes to ensuring the safety, well-being, and integrity of projects and their impact on society. \n\nIn this context, Stevenson's assertion that the primary use of ethical judgments is to influence the interests of others is particularly relevant. This aligns with the notion that ethical judgments guide engineers in balancing competing interests, such as economic considerations, social responsibilities, and environmental impacts. By making ethical judgments, engineers can influence the decisions and actions of others in order to promote ethical behavior and outcomes in engineering projects.\n\nTherefore, based on this perspective, I would argue that option B: influence the interests of others, is the most appropriate answer to the question posed by Stevenson. Ethics in engineering is not merely about stating facts or describing personal approval, but rather about influencing the behavior and decisions of individuals and organizations to align with ethical principles and values.",
