    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, it is important to approach this ethical dilemma using logic and reasoning. In this scenario, Taurek argues that when faced with the choice between saving the life of X or the arm of Y, Y is obligated to choose saving the life of X. This argument is based on the concept of utilitarianism, which dictates that the action that results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people should be chosen.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this argument can be critiqued from a perspective that values individual rights and autonomy. From this perspective, one could argue that a person's arm is an essential part of their body and identity, and therefore saving it may be just as important as saving a life. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question of whether we are obligated to choose saving the life of X or the arm of Y ultimately depends on the ethical framework and values that one subscribes to. From a utilitarian perspective, Y may be obligated to choose saving the life of X. However, from a perspective that values individual rights and autonomy, the answer may be more complex and nuanced.",
