Taurek claims that if faced with the choice between saving the life of X or the arm of Y:\nA: Y is obligated to choose saving the life of X.\nB: we are obligated to choose saving the life of X.\nC: both a and b.\nD: neither a nor b.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To address Taurek's claim, we can first apply a utilitarian perspective, which aims to maximize overall well-being. In this context, saving a life would typically be deemed as having greater moral value than saving an arm. Therefore, from a utilitarian standpoint, the choice to save the life of X would be the morally superior option.\n\nNext, we can consider the ethical principle of impartiality. If we were to assign equal moral value to each individual's well-being, then saving a life would still take precedence over saving an arm. This is because the loss of an arm, while significant, does not equate to the loss of an entire life.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, we can conclude that Taurek's claim aligns with both statements A and B. It is both Y's obligation and our obligation as a society to choose saving the life of X over saving the arm of Y. This aligns with the idea that human life holds greater intrinsic value than physical possessions or bodily functions.",
