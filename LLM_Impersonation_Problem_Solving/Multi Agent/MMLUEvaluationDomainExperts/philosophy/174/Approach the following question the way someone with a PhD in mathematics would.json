In mathematics, it is common to assess the validity and soundness of a principle by analyzing its logical consistency and ability to provide meaningful results.\n\nIf Singer concludes that the stronger version of the principle is correct, he may have found that it can be more widely applicable or that it leads to greater insights and solutions in the mathematical context under consideration. This determination would likely be based on mathematical reasoning and evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, if Singer determines that the weaker version is correct, he may have found that it is sufficient for addressing the mathematical problems at hand or that it is more easily verifiable and applicable in practice. Again, this decision would likely be based on mathematical analysis and evidence.\n\nIn some cases, Singer may reject both versions of the principle if he finds that they are inconsistent, incomplete, or do not adequately address the mathematical issues being studied. This rejection would likely be based on rigorous mathematical reasoning and logical deductions.\n\nAlternatively, Singer may claim that the two versions are equivalent if he can establish a precise mathematical relationship or equivalence between them. This claim would likely be supported by mathematical proofs or formal arguments demonstrating the equivalence of the two versions.\n\nOverall, a PhD in mathematics would approach this question by carefully analyzing the logical and mathematical foundations of the principles under consideration and making a reasoned determination based on mathematical evidence and reasoning.",
