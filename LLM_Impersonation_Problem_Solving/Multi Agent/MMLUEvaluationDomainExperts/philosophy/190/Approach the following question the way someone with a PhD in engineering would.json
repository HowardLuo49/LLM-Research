    "gpt_response": "To address this question from an engineering perspective, we must first define what is meant by a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments. In the context of this question, we can interpret this as an individual who abstains from evaluating actions, behaviors, or decisions as morally right or wrong.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, we can argue that moral judgment is an essential aspect of human cognition and decision-making. It helps individuals navigate through complex social interactions, establish norms and values, and inform ethical behavior. Therefore, a person who completely refuses to engage in moral judgments may be deemed irrational in the sense that they are disregarding a fundamental component of human reasoning and societal functioning.\n\nMoreover, in the context of ethical systems, such as utilitarianism or deontology, moral judgments play a critical role in determining the right course of action or behavior. By abstaining from making positive moral judgments, an individual may be perceived as failing to uphold the ethical standards or principles that guide human conduct. This could be interpreted as a form of immorality or ethical negligence.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments cannot coherently invoke morality to protect one's own interests stems from the assumption that moral reasoning is intertwined with self-interest and social dynamics. By opting out of moral evaluation, an individual may struggle to justify their actions or defend their rights and interests within a moral framework.\n\nLastly, the assertion that a person who refuses to make positive moral judgments couldn't possibly exist may suggest the inherent nature of moral cognition and judgment in human beings. It posits that moral reasoning is an inherent feature of human consciousness and social interaction, making it highly improbable for an individual to completely exclude themselves from this cognitive process.\n\nIn conclusion, from an engineering perspective, we can argue that a person who refuses to make positive moral judgments may be deemed irrational, immoral, and incapable of coherently invoking morality to protect their own interests. The assumption that such an individual could not exist reflects the fundamental role of moral judgment in human cognition and behavior.",
