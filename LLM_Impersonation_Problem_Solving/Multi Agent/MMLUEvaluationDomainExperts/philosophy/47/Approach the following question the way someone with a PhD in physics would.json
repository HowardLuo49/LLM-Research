For the soft determinist, to say that you could have done otherwise is to say that you would have done otherwise if _____.\nA: your desires were always the same\nB: your desires were completely under your control\nC: your desires had been different\nD: your desires played no role in your decisions",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "From a soft determinist perspective, the statement \"you could have done otherwise\" implies a scenario where one's desires may have been different at the time of making a decision. Therefore, the correct completion for the question would be: C: your desires had been different. The soft determinist theory suggests that while our actions are ultimately determined by causal factors, including our desires, beliefs, and external circumstances, there is still a sense of personal agency and freedom in the choices we make. Therefore, the ability to have done otherwise is contingent upon the hypothetical alteration of one's desires in a given situation.",
