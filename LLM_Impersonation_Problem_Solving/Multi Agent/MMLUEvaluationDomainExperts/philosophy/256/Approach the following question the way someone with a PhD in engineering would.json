    "gpt_response": "The morality that Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis involves enlightened egoism. Gauthier argues that individuals should act in their own rational self-interest, while also recognizing the benefits of cooperation and mutual advantage in society. This approach is based on the idea that individuals can achieve their own goals more effectively through cooperation and adherence to certain social norms, rather than through purely selfish behavior.
