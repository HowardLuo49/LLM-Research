    "gpt_response": "As a computer science PhD, it is important to critically analyze the arguments put forth by both Anscombe and Butler in the context of moral philosophy. \n\nAnscombe's criticism of Butler likely stems from her understanding of the limitations of moral reasoning and the relationship between facts and values. She may argue that our consciences are fallible because they are based on subjective beliefs and societal norms, rather than objective truths. This aligns with her rejection of the idea that we can derive an \"ought\" from an \"is,\" as Butler may suggest. \n\nOn the other hand, Butler's concept of \"legislating for oneself\" may be seen as absurd by Anscombe if she believes that morality should be based on objective principles rather than individual discretion. Additionally, Anscombe's critique of the unclear concept of \"pleasure\" could also be rooted in her belief that moral values should be grounded in rationality and clarity.\n\nIn conclusion, as a computer science expert, I would approach this question by examining the philosophical arguments presented by Anscombe and Butler, considering their strengths and weaknesses in the context of moral reasoning and conscience.",
