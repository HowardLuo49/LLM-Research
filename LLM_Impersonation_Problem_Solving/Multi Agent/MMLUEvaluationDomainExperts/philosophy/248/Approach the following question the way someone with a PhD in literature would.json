    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. If the world that we individually perceive is limited to an internal perspective, then there is no way that we could determine whether our own perspective is useful, true, or valuable because:\nA: we know whether our internal perspective is correct only by comparing it with an objective, external perspective (the \"real\" world).\nB: whatever we appeal to in order to prove that our perspective is right itself would be part of the standard we use in evaluating that perspective.\nC: scientific research that reveals facts about the world would cause us to challenge our perceptions in a dreamworld of our own making.\nD: without limiting our perspective to an internal dreamworld, we cannot achieve any objective, external knowledge of the real world.",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by analyzing the concept of perspective and its relationship to truth and value in literary texts. In the field of literature, the idea of differing perspectives and subjective truths is often a central theme in many works. Authors frequently explore the complexities of human perception and the ways in which individuals construct their own realities.\n\nIn literary analysis, we often consider how an author's perspective shapes the narrative and influences the reader's understanding of the text. We examine how characters' viewpoints, biases, and interpretations of events can affect the overall meaning of a story. By delving into these various perspectives, we gain a deeper appreciation of the nuanced ways in which truth and value are constructed in literature.\n\nTherefore, when considering the question posed, I would argue that the limitations of our internal perspective do not necessarily diminish the value or truth of our personal experiences and interpretations. Instead, they highlight the complexities of human perception and the multifaceted nature of truth in the literary realm. Just as in literature, where multiple perspectives can coexist and enrich the narrative, so too can our individual perspectives offer unique insights and truths that contribute to a broader understanding of the world around us.",
