    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by acknowledging the references to several famous figures from Greek mythology and literature. In this case, the story of the ring of Gyges is a tale from Plato's Republic that explores the concept of justice and the temptation to act unjustly if one could do so without consequence. \nIn considering the issue of injustice with impunity, Cicero would likely refer to the story of the ring of Gyges as a prime example. The ring of Gyges is said to grant its wearer the power of invisibility, allowing them to act without fear of being caught or held accountable for their actions. This story serves as a metaphor for the idea that individuals may be tempted to act unjustly if they believe they can do so without facing any consequences.\nOverall, approaching this question from a biological perspective would involve analyzing the psychological and behavioral aspects of the characters in these stories and how they interact with the concept of injustice and impunity.",
