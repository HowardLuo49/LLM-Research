    "gpt_response": "According to Stevenson's emotivist theory of moral disagreement, moral disagreements primarily involve disagreement in belief. This is because moral statements are not capable of being objectively true or false, but rather express the speaker's attitudes or emotions towards a certain situation or action. Therefore, when individuals engage in moral disagreements, they are not arguing over an objective truth or falsity, but rather expressing their differing subjective attitudes or beliefs about the moral issue at hand. Disagreements in interest, theory, and practice may also play a role in moral disagreements, but at their core, they are fundamentally disagreements in belief according to Stevenson's emotivist framework.",
