According to Moral Relativism, moral disagreements involve differing beliefs about what is morally right or wrong based on individual or cultural perspectives. This aligns closely with option B, as moral disagreements primarily involve disagreements in belief about the moral principles and values guiding one's actions. \n\nWhile options A, C, and D may also play a role in moral disagreements to some extent, such as differing interests, theoretical frameworks, or practical applications, the core of moral disagreements lies in the differing beliefs or convictions individuals hold about what is morally right or wrong.
