    "gpt_response": "Singer's argument challenges the traditional dichotomy between duty and charity, positing that individuals have a moral obligation to alleviate suffering and promote well-being regardless of whether it falls under the realm of duty or acts of charity. This challenges the notion that charitable actions are voluntary and separate from one's obligations, suggesting instead that ethical duties should encompass considerations of global welfare and justice. Singer's argument thus blurs the boundaries between duty and charity, emphasizing the interconnectedness of moral responsibilities to others.",
