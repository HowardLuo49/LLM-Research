    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the different elements of the Mona Lisa painting and how they relate to the concepts of representational and nonrepresentational art. The Mona Lisa is a representational piece of art, as it depicts a specific subject (in this case, a woman believed to be Lisa Gherardini) in a realistic and recognizable manner. The artist, Leonardo da Vinci, used techniques such as chiaroscuro and sfumato to create a lifelike representation of the subject. This stands in contrast to abstract or nonrepresentational art, which does not represent any specific subject or object. Therefore, the correct answer is A: representational.",
