Berkeley's philosophy is rooted in the idea of immaterialism, which suggests that the only things that exist are minds and the ideas that exist within these minds. In this view, Berkeley argues that existing and perceiving are indeed one and the same thing, as the act of perceiving is the basis for existence of objects in the world.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be A: one and the same thing. This assertion is central to Berkeley's philosophy and reflects his belief that reality is fundamentally grounded in perception and the mind. By understanding and critically examining Berkeley's arguments, we can gain insights into the nature of existence and perception in philosophical thought.",
