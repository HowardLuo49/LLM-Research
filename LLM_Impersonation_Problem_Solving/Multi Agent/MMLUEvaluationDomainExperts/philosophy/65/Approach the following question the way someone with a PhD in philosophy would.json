    "gpt_response": "According to Sartre, if God does not exist, moral values still exist. Sartre posited that in the absence of a divine being dictating ethics, human beings are still capable of creating and defining their own moral values through their actions and choices. This existentialist perspective suggests that individuals have the freedom and responsibility to determine their own ethical framework, rather than relying on external sources such as a deity. Thus, for Sartre, the absence of God does not negate the existence of moral values, but rather places the burden of moral decision-making squarely on the shoulders of humanity.",
