    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by considering the relationship between myth and reason as well as their significance in the realm of philosophical thought. The statement suggests that myth and reason are inherently interconnected and play a fundamental role in defining one another. \n\nOption A suggests that mythos is based on logos, emphasizing the connection between myth and reason. In Greek philosophy, logos refers to the principle of order and knowledge, while mythos encompasses narratives and stories that convey deeper truths. This option aligns with the idea that myth is not simply a collection of fantastical stories, but rather a form of reasoning and understanding the world.\n\nOption B highlights the idea that myth reveals the interconnectedness of things rather than providing a direct explanation. This perspective emphasizes the symbolic and metaphorical nature of myth, suggesting that it offers a different mode of understanding reality beyond rational logic.\n\nOption C delves into metaphysical considerations, proposing that there is a single true answer regarding existence. This ties into the notion that myth and reason are interconnected in their pursuit of ultimate truths and meanings.\n\nOption D posits that myth and reason are essentially synonymous, with each concept defining the other. This perspective suggests that myth serves as a foundation for reasoning, while reason gives structure and coherence to myth.\n\nOverall, a PhD in literature would likely approach this question by examining the complex relationship between myth and reason, exploring how these concepts intersect and contribute to our understanding of the world and ourselves.",
