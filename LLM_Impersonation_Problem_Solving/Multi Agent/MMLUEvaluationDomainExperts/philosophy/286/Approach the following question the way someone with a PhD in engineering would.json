    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would argue that the most appropriate description of reason according to Hume would be option A: cool and disengaged. Hume believed that reason was not the source of moral actions, but rather it was driven by passions and emotions. He stated that reason was simply a tool used to achieve our desires, rather than the driving force behind them. Therefore, options B and C would not accurately represent Hume's views on reason. Option D, which implies that all of the above describe reason according to Hume, is not accurate based on his philosophical writings and beliefs.",
