According to Ross, justice is:\nA: when all laws are followed.\nB: when contracts and promises are adhered to.\nC: when the distribution of happiness is in accordance with merit.\nD: when the guilty are punished for their crimes.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a physics PhD, I would approach this question by first noting that justice is a complex philosophical concept that transcends simple binary definitions. In the context of W.D. Ross's ethical theory, justice is not solely about the adherence to laws or punishment for crimes. Ross suggests that justice involves a combination of respecting laws, fulfilling contracts and promises, as well as promoting the distribution of happiness in accordance with merit. This multi-faceted understanding of justice emphasizes the importance of both individual rights and social utility in ethical decision-making. Therefore, from a nuanced perspective informed by philosophical discourse, the most accurate answer would be C: when the distribution of happiness is in accordance with merit.",
