One must carefully consider what constitutes a public space in order to ensure that filming or taking photographs in such spaces does not violate any laws or regulations. Additionally, protecting individuals from potential harm is paramount, as capturing images or videos of individuals without their consent can lead to negative consequences. Finally, any risk of invasion of privacy must be carefully evaluated, as violating an individual's privacy rights can result in legal ramifications.
