    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question from a scientific perspective. I would argue that Augustine's claim is more aligned with option A, that to be happy, one must know the causes of natural occurrences. This is because understanding the fundamental principles that govern the physical world can lead to a sense of mastery and control, which can contribute to a sense of well-being and happiness.\n\nWhile it is true that understanding the causes of good and evil may also be important for moral and ethical decision-making, the pursuit of happiness is more closely tied to understanding the natural world. Therefore, I would argue that option A is the most appropriate answer from a physicist's perspective.",
