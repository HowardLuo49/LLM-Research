    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the philosophical concepts of efficient causality and the metaphysical arguments presented by Aquinas. Aquinas argues that the first efficient cause of everything must be God, as he posits that there must be an uncaused first cause that initiates the chain of causality in the universe. This concept aligns with Aquinas' belief in the existence of a divine being as the ultimate source of all causation. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is B: God.",
