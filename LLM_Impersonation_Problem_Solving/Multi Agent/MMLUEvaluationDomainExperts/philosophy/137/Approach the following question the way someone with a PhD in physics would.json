    "gpt_response": "Someone with a PhD in physics would likely approach this question by considering the concept of efficient causality within the framework of Aristotelian and Thomistic metaphysics. Aquinas, a prominent medieval philosopher and theologian, argued that efficient causality necessitates the existence of a first cause, or a prime mover, that initiates the chain of causal events in the universe.\n\nIn this context, the correct answer to the question would likely be B: God. Aquinas posited that God serves as the ultimate efficient cause of all things, as the uncaused cause who imparts existence and sustains the universe in motion. This concept aligns with the theological notion of God as the creator and sustainer of all things, providing a philosophical basis for understanding the origin and order of the cosmos. In contrast, options A, C, and D do not adequately capture the metaphysical and theological implications of Aquinas' argument regarding the first efficient cause.",
