In order to engage in moral philosophy effectively, one must have a comprehensive understanding of the foundational principles that underpin human thought and behavior. Anscombe's assertion suggests that without a solid grounding in the relevant philosophical disciplines, moral philosophy may lack the necessary depth and rigor to be truly fruitful.\n\nGiven the options provided, Anscombe's emphasis on the need for an adequate philosophy of psychology seems to be the most directly relevant to the study of morals. Psychology, as the study of human behavior and mental processes, provides crucial insights into the factors that shape our moral beliefs and decision-making processes. Without a solid understanding of the psychological mechanisms at play, our moral reasoning may be incomplete or even misguided.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that the correct answer to this question is C: psychology. By establishing a strong foundation in psychology, moral philosophers can more effectively analyze and address the complex ethical dilemmas that arise in the human experience.",
