    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question analytically and logically. From a theoretical perspective, Butler's claim can be interpreted through the lens of natural rights theory. In this framework, the concept of rights is often grounded in the idea of natural law, which posits that certain rights are inherent to human beings by virtue of their nature.\n\nWhen considering Butler's assertion that the only thing anyone has a right to is \"life,\" we can analyze this statement in relation to common interpretations of natural rights. Life is often considered to be a fundamental and inalienable right, as without it, other rights become meaningless. This perspective is in line with the foundational principles of natural rights theory, which prioritize the preservation and protection of life above all else.\n\nIn contrast, the concepts of \"liberty,\" \"property,\" and \"happiness\" are also frequently cited as core natural rights. Liberty refers to the freedom to act and make choices without undue constraint, property represents the ownership and control of resources, and happiness embodies the pursuit of subjective well-being.\n\nUltimately, Butler's claim that the only inherent right is to life may be seen as provocative, as it disregards other essential aspects of human existence. However, from a theoretical standpoint, it is a defensible position within the context of natural rights theory. It is important to note that interpretations and prioritization of rights may vary depending on philosophical perspectives and ethical frameworks.",
