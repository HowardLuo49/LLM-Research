In Anselm's ontological argument, he posits that a being that exists in reality is greater than a being that only exists in the understanding. This notion is based on the premise that existence in reality entails a higher level of perfection and greatness than mere conceptual existence.\n\nFurthermore, Anselm's argument can be understood in terms of modal logic, where it is argued that a necessary being (i.e., one that exists in reality) is greater than a contingent being (i.e., one that exists only in the understanding). This line of reasoning suggests that existence in reality implies a higher degree of ontological status and importance.\n\nTherefore, in response to the question posed, Anselm assumes that a being that exists in reality is greater than a being that exists only in the understanding, as this aligns with his philosophical argument regarding the nature of existence and greatness.",
