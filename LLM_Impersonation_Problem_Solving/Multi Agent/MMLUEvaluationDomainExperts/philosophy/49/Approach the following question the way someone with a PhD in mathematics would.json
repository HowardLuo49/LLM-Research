Behind this veil, Rawls argues that individuals would choose principles of justice based on fairness, reason, and rationality, and that these principles would be the result of a fair agreement or bargain among individuals with equal status. This aligns with option D, as the principles of justice behind the veil of ignorance are not arbitrary or the result of coercion, but rather the result of a fair and reasoned agreement among individuals.",
