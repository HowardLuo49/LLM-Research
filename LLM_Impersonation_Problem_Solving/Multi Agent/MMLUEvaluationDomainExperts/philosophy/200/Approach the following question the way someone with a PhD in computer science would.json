To determine which philosopher Singer's conclusions align with, I would need to closely examine the arguments and reasoning presented by each philosopher listed - Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Immanuel Kant. After a thorough analysis, I would then be able to determine which philosopher's conclusions exhibit the most similarity to Singer's and choose the corresponding option.\n\nIn this case, Singer is known for his utilitarian views on ethics, which prioritize the maximization of overall well-being and happiness. This aligns more closely with the ethical theories of utilitarian philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, rather than the philosophers listed in the options.\n\nTherefore, as a PhD in computer science applying philosophical analysis, I would conclude that Singer's conclusions are most similar to those of utilitarian philosophers like Bentham and Mill, and not necessarily to Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, or Immanuel Kant.",
