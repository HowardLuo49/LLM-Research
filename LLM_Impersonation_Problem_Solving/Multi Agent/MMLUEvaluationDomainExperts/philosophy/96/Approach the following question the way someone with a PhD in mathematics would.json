    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with advanced training in logic and reasoning, I would approach Hare's claim by evaluating it from a standpoint of formal argumentation and deductive reasoning. In this context, it is important to consider the definitions and implications of the terms \"useless,\" \"valid,\" \"ad hominem,\" and \"sound\" in the context of moral arguments.\n\nA moral argument can be considered \"useless\" if it fails to persuasively support its conclusions or if it lacks coherence and logical structure. In mathematical terms, a useless argument would be one that contains logical fallacies, invalid reasoning, or unsupported premises.\n\nOn the other hand, a moral argument is considered \"valid\" if its conclusion logically follows from its premises. In other words, a valid argument is one where the conclusion is a necessary consequence of the premises. This is analogous to the concept of validity in mathematical proofs, where an argument is valid if it follows the rules of deductive reasoning.\n\nAn argument can also be labeled as \"ad hominem\" if it attacks the person making the argument rather than engaging with the content of the argument itself. In mathematical reasoning, ad hominem attacks are considered to be fallacious and do not contribute to the validity or soundness of an argument.\n\nFinally, a moral argument is considered \"sound\" if it is both valid and has true premises. In mathematical terms, a sound argument is one that is not only valid but also based on true statements or premises. Therefore, a sound argument in moral reasoning would be one that is logically coherent and supported by accurate and relevant information.\n\nIn conclusion, as a mathematician approaching Hare's claim about moral arguments, I would analyze the statement in terms of these definitions and principles of deductive reasoning to assess its accuracy and validity.",
