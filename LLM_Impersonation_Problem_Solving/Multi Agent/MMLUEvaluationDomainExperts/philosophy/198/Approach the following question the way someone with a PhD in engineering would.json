    "gpt_response": "As a PhD engineer, I would approach this question by first analyzing the definition and characteristics of a moral saint according to Wolf. Wolf argues that a moral saint is someone who prioritizes moral goodness above all other values, to an extreme and unrealistic degree. This implies that a moral saint would refrain from engaging in activities that do not directly contribute to moral goodness.\n\nBased on this understanding, I would conclude that the correct answer is D: all of the above. A moral saint would likely avoid reading Victorian novels, having a sarcastic wit, and having an interest in gourmet cooking if they deem these activities as not aligning with their primary goal of pursuing moral goodness. These activities may be seen as frivolous or distracting from their moral goals, and therefore would not be pursued by a moral saint according to Wolf's characterization.",
