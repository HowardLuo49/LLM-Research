Epicurus conceives of death as:\nA: the beginning of the afterlife.\nB: one component of the continuous cycle of rebirth.\nC: the deprivation of all sensation.\nD: the greatest harm that one can suffer.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "C: the deprivation of all sensation.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, Epicurus' conception of death as the deprivation of all sensation aligns with the understanding that death is the cessation of biological processes that sustain life. In the absence of biological functions, including those that enable sensation and consciousness, individuals no longer experience any form of sensation. This viewpoint is consistent with the scientific understanding of death as the irreversible end of biological functions, leading to the cessation of all conscious experiences.",
