This statement can be examined by comparing historical records and examining the evolution of beliefs and attitudes towards homosexuality over time. \n\nNext, we would consider proposition B, which states that modern debates about homosexuality are interminable because there is no objective answer as to whether homosexuality is immoral. To assess this claim, we would need to investigate the ethical frameworks and philosophical perspectives that underlie discussions on morality and sexuality. \n\nFinally, proposition C asserts that modern debates about homosexuality are carried out in a manner that is not virtuous. This claim could be analyzed by examining the conduct and rhetoric used in contemporary debates on the topic, and comparing them to standards of virtuous communication and argumentation. \n\nUltimately, a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics would carefully evaluate each of these propositions using logic, reason, and evidence to determine their validity and significance in the ongoing discourse surrounding homosexuality. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D: none of the above, as a rigorous examination of each proposition would be necessary to draw any definitive conclusions about the nature of modern debates on homosexuality.",
