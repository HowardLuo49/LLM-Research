    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. Nagel claims that the problem of moral luck is closely connected to the problem of:\nA: the existence of God.\nB: freedom of the will.\nC: psychological egoism.\nD: universals.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The question at hand involves a complex and nuanced philosophical concept known as moral luck. Moral luck refers to the idea that luck or external factors beyond an individual's control can play a significant role in determining the moral praise or blame that person receives for their actions. This raises important questions about the nature of moral responsibility and whether individuals can truly be held accountable for their actions when luck plays such a significant role.\n\nIn his seminal work on the topic, philosopher Thomas Nagel delves into the complexities of moral luck and examines its connection to other fundamental philosophical issues. One such issue that Nagel identifies as closely tied to the problem of moral luck is the problem of freedom of the will. The concept of free will is central to moral philosophy, as it directly relates to questions of moral responsibility and agency. If individuals are not truly free to choose their actions, but are instead influenced by external factors such as luck, then the very notion of moral responsibility is called into question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question posed is B: freedom of the will. Nagel argues that the problem of moral luck sheds light on the limitations of our understanding of free will and its implications for moral judgment. By exploring the interplay between moral luck and freedom of the will, philosophers can deepen their understanding of the complexities inherent in moral decision-making and the nature of moral responsibility.",
