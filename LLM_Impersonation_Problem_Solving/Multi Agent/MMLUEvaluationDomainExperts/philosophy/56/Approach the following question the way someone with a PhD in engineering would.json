    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The problem of moral luck, as discussed by Nagel, is closely connected to the problem of freedom of the will. This is because moral luck involves situations where a person is held morally responsible for outcomes that are beyond their control or where their actions are influenced by factors outside of their control. This raises questions about whether individuals truly have free will and autonomy in making moral decisions, or if external circumstances and factors play a significant role in determining the outcomes of their actions. Furthermore, the concept of moral luck challenges the traditional understanding of moral responsibility and accountability, which is closely tied to the idea of free will. Therefore, the problem of moral luck is intricately linked to the broader philosophical debate surrounding the nature of free will and its implications for moral decision-making.",
