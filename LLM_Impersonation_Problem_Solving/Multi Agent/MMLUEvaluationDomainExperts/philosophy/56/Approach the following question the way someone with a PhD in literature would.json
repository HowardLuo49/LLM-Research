    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question from a philosophical perspective rather than a literary one. Nagel's exploration of the problem of moral luck delves into questions surrounding the moral responsibility of individuals for actions and outcomes that may be influenced by factors beyond their control. In this context, Nagel posits that the problem of moral luck is closely connected to the problem of freedom of the will.\n\nConsidering the complex interplay between moral responsibility and factors such as luck, chance, and external influences, the question of whether individuals truly have free will to make autonomous moral choices becomes central to the discussion. Nagel argues that the existence of moral luck highlights the limitations of individual agency and challenges the traditional notions of free will as the foundation of moral accountability.\n\nTherefore, based on Nagel's philosophical arguments, the correct answer to the question would be:\n\nB: freedom of the will.",
