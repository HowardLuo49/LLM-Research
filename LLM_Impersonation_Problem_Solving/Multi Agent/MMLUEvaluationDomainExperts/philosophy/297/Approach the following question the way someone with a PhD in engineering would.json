    "gpt_response": "As an engineering PhD, I would approach this question from a moral philosophy perspective. Constitutive moral luck refers to aspects of a person's character or circumstances that are beyond their control but significantly influence their moral actions and outcomes. In this context, examples of bad constitutive moral luck would involve factors that inherently predispose a person to make wrongful choices or be involved in harmful situations.\n\nOption A, a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous, fits the criteria of bad constitutive moral luck as their inherent character traits can lead them to act in morally detrimental ways. Option B, a person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940, also falls under this category as being born into a society that promotes heinous acts can greatly influence an individual's moral decisions. Option C, a person who drives drunk and hits a child, involves a deliberate, morally wrong action but may not necessarily be an example of constitutive moral luck as it involves a conscious decision rather than uncontrollable factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option A: a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous as an example of bad constitutive moral luck.",
