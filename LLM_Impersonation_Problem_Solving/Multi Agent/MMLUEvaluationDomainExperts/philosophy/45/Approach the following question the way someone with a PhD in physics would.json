They may argue that the key difference between the contrivance of a watch and that of nature is that the latter is greater and grander in complexity. Natural systems, such as the complexities of biological organisms or the interplay of forces in the universe, display a level of intricacy and organization that far surpasses the simple design of a man-made watch. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be D: greater and grander.",
