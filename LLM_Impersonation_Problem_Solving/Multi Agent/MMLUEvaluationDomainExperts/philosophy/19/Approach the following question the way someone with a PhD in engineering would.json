Stevenson\u2019s primary aim in this paper is to:\nA: provide an account of what makes right actions right.\nB: establish which things are good in themselves.\nC: develop a theory of good moral character.\nD: make ethical questions clear.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD holder in engineering, I must clarify that the question provided is related to moral philosophy and not directly within the realm of engineering. However, based on my academic training, I can approach this question by analyzing it in terms of methodology and theoretical frameworks that may be relevant to an engineering perspective.\n\nIn this case, Stevenson's primary aim is to make ethical questions clear, as mentioned in option D. Engineers often encounter complex ethical dilemmas in their work, such as considerations of safety, sustainability, and social responsibility. By making ethical questions clear, Stevenson may be providing a framework or methodology for systematically analyzing and approaching ethical issues, which could be beneficial for engineers facing similar dilemmas.\n\nFurthermore, developing a theory of good moral character, as mentioned in option C, could also be relevant to engineers as they often need to demonstrate integrity, honesty, and accountability in their professional practice. Understanding what constitutes good moral character could inform decision-making processes and guide ethical behavior in engineering contexts.\n\nWhile options A and B are also important considerations in moral philosophy, they may not directly relate to the practical concerns that engineers face in their professional lives. Overall, Stevenson's aim to make ethical questions clear aligns well with the needs and challenges that engineers may encounter in their work, making option D the most relevant choice in this context.",
