This is a fundamental aspect of ethical theory and aligns with the tradition of ethical analysis and justification. Stevenson's work likely focuses on the justification and criteria for determining the moral rightness of actions, which is a key concern in ethics and morality.\n\nWhile establishing which things are good in themselves, developing a theory of good moral character, and making ethical questions clear are important aspects of ethical philosophy, they may not be the primary focus of Stevenson's paper based on the information provided.
