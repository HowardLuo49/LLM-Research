This criticism is rooted in the notion that if moral obligations are dependent solely on God's dictates, then there is no inherent moral reason for God's commands to be as they are. This leads to the conclusion that God's commands could have been different, thus rendering them arbitrary. Critics often argue that this undermines the theory's ability to provide a sound foundation for objective moral truths.",
