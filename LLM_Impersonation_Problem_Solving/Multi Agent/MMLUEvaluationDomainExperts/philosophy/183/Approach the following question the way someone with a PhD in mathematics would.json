    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a mathematical perspective, we can first establish the framework of utilitarianism as a moral theory that seeks to maximize overall well-being or happiness. In this context, Mill argues that the ultimate end of utilitarianism is to maximize happiness, which he defines as the absence of pain and the presence of pleasure.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can interpret the statement as Mill believing that the ultimate end of utilitarianism is to achieve an existence that is as free of pain as possible and as rich as possible in enjoyments. This aligns with the idea that the goal of utilitarianism is to maximize overall happiness by minimizing suffering and maximizing pleasure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nD: enjoyments",
