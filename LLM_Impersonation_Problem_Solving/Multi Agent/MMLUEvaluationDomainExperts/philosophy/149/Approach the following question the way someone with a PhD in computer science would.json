Tolstoy was a Russian writer and philosopher known for his works such as \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina.\" His conversion to a more spiritual and moralistic life occurred later in his life, leading him to renounce his wealth and live a simpler lifestyle.\n\nBefore his conversion, Tolstoy was surrounded by material wealth, fame, and worldly pleasures.
