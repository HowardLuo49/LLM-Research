Hume, a prominent empiricist philosopher, argued that reason alone is incapable of motivating action; instead, our passions drive us to act. Therefore, according to Hume, reason should serve our passions \u2013 option A. This means that reason should be used to guide and inform our passions, rather than operating independently of them or attempting to extinguish them. Hume believed that reason can help us make better decisions by providing information and evaluating consequences, but ultimately our passions are what move us to act.",
