    "gpt_response": "According to Hume, reason plays a crucial role in guiding human behavior, particularly in relation to our passions. One school of thought within Humean philosophy suggests that reason should serve our passions, as our passions are the primary drivers of human action. In this view, reason acts as a tool to facilitate the realization of our desires and emotions, rather than as an independent source of guidance.\n\nFurthermore, Hume himself posited that reason alone cannot motivate us to act, as it lacks inherent causal power. Instead, reason can help us determine the most effective means to achieve our passions and desires. Ultimately, Hume argues that reason and passion are not inherently opposed, but rather work in tandem to inform and direct our actions.\n\nIn light of this perspective, it can be reasonably inferred that according to Hume, reason should be used to guide and direct our passions rather than to operate independently of them or extinguish them.",
