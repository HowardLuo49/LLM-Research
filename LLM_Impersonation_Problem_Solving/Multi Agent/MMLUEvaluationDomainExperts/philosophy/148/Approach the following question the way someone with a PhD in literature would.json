    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by considering Stevenson's perspective on empirical methods within the context of ethical disagreement. Stevenson is known for his emotivist theory, which posits that ethical statements are expressions of emotional attitudes rather than objective truths. In this light, empirical methods may be viewed as limited in their ability to fully resolve ethical disagreements, as they are contingent upon verifiable evidence and may not fully capture the complexities of moral reasoning.\n\nTherefore, based on Stevenson's philosophy, the most appropriate answer would be:\n\nB: are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreement, but are not always sufficient.\n\nThis option acknowledges that empirical methods can play a role in the resolution of ethical disagreements, but also acknowledges their limitations in capturing the nuanced and subjective nature of ethical reasoning, as posited by Stevenson's emotivist theory.",
