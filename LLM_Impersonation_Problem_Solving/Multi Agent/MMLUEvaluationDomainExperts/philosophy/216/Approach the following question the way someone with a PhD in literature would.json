In Augustine\u2019s view, lying is:\nA: often permissible if done for the right reasons.\nB: not evil in itself, although it can have bad consequences.\nC: permissible only in very rare circumstances.\nD: never permissible.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Augustine's view on lying, it is important to delve into the complex theological and ethical framework that underpins his conception of truth-telling. Augustine, drawing heavily on his Christian faith and Neo-Platonic philosophy, argues that all falsehood is inherently sinful, as it goes against the divine principle of truth which is absolute and unchanging. In his seminal work, \"On Lying,\" Augustine posits that lying is never permissible, regardless of the intention or outcome.\n\nAugustine's stringent stance on lying is rooted in his belief in the interconnectedness of the moral and spiritual realms. He argues that lying not only distorts the truth in the temporal world but also ruptures the harmonious relationship between the individual and God. For Augustine, truth-telling is a fundamental aspect of moral integrity and spiritual purity, and any deviation from this principle is a betrayal of one's ethical duty and divine mandate.\n\nIn light of Augustine's unwavering condemnation of lying, it can be inferred that the correct answer to the question would be D: never permissible. Augustine's theological and philosophical convictions leave no room for ambiguity or relativism when it comes to the moral imperative of truth-telling. Thus, lying, in Augustine's view, is unequivocally and categorically prohibited, regardless of the circumstances or perceived justifications.",
