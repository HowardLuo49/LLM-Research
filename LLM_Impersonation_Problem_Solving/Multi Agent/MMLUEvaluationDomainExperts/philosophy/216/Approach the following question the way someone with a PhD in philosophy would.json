    "gpt_response": "In Augustine's view, lying is a complex and morally significant act that cannot be considered in isolation from its ethical implications and the broader context of the individual's relationship with truth and God. Augustine, drawing on his Christian theology and philosophical understanding of the nature of reality, would likely argue that lying is inherently wrong and contrary to the pursuit of the highest good, which is the cultivation of virtue and alignment with divine truth. Thus, the answer that best aligns with Augustine's perspective is D: never permissible.",
