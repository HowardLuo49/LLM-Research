    "gpt_response": "In Augustine's view, lying is most likely considered to be never permissible. Augustine's ethical framework, heavily influenced by his Christian beliefs, likely prioritizes truthfulness and honesty as virtues, guiding individuals to always speak truthfully and avoid deception. This stance aligns with the broader Christian ethical tradition, which generally condemns lying as a violation of the ninth commandment (\"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor\") and a betrayal of the inherent trustworthiness and integrity that individuals should strive to embody. Additionally, Augustine's emphasis on the importance of moral purity and obedience to God's will suggests that lying would be viewed as morally wrong in virtually all circumstances.",
