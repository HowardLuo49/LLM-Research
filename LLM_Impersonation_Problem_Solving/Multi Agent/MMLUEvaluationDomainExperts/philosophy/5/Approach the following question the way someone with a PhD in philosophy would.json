In his work, Nagel critiques various skeptical arguments that challenge our ability to have knowledge about the external world. He argues that these skeptical arguments often rely on applying arbitrarily stringent standards, which can lead to a kind of epistemic paralysis where we are unable to know anything at all.\n\nIn considering the options presented, it is clear that option A aligns most closely with Nagel's critique of skepticism. By claiming that most skeptical arguments result from applying arbitrarily stringent standards, Nagel is highlighting the problematic nature of setting impossibly high criteria for knowledge and the negative consequences that can follow from such a stance.\n\nWhile options B and C also present interesting perspectives on skepticism, they do not fully capture Nagel's particular critique in this context. As for option D, the idea that skeptical arguments grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards seems to misunderstand Nagel's argument, as he is specifically criticizing the imposition of extreme or arbitrary standards in skepticism.\n\nIn conclusion, a philosopher with a PhD in philosophy would likely agree that Nagel's critique of skeptical arguments as the result of applying arbitrarily stringent standards is a defensible and nuanced position within the ongoing discourse on epistemology and skepticism.",
