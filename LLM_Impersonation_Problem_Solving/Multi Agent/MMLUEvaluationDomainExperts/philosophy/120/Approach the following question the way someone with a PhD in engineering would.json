    "gpt_response": "D: philosophers and nonphilosophers\n\nIn the field of engineering, aesthetics is a topic that goes beyond just the practical application of principles and theories. Aesthetics in engineering addresses questions that interest both philosophers and non-philosophers. Philosophers may delve into the underlying principles of beauty, form, and function in engineering design, while non-philosophers, such as engineers and designers, may be more concerned with the practical implications of aesthetics on the usability and acceptance of a product or system. Overall, aesthetics in engineering is a multidisciplinary topic that can attract interest from a wide range of individuals with varying backgrounds and perspectives.",
