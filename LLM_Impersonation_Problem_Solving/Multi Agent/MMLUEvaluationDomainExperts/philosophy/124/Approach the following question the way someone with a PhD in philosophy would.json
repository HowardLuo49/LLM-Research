    "gpt_response": "The two principal answers to whether life has any meaning for us can be understood through the perspectives of the theistic view and the agnostic view. The theistic view posits that life has purpose and meaning as determined by a higher power or deity. In contrast, the agnostic view contends that the question of life's meaning is inherently unknowable or uncertain, and that individuals must find or create their own meaning within the existential framework of a universe that may inherently lack intrinsic purpose. These divergent perspectives reflect broader philosophical debates regarding the nature of existence, agency, and value, and have significant implications for how individuals navigate and construct their understanding of the world.",
