    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I would approach the question by considering the formal characteristics of art through the lens of structure and organization. In this context, coherence would be the most important formal characteristic of art. Coherence refers to the internal consistency and unity of an artwork, where all elements are integrated in a harmonious and meaningful way. This formal characteristic is essential in art as it provides a foundation for understanding and interpreting the artistic expression, and allows for a cohesive and impactful presentation of ideas and emotions.",
