    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would argue that an important formal characteristic of art is coherence. Coherence in art refers to the unity, harmony, and interconnectedness of the various elements within a piece of art. This includes the relationship between form and content, the arrangement of visual or auditory elements, and the overall structure of the work. Coherence is crucial in art because it allows the viewer or audience to make sense of the artwork, engage with its meaning, and appreciate its aesthetic quality. Without coherence, art risks being disjointed, confusing, or lacking in impact. Therefore, coherence is a foundational aspect of art that contributes to its effectiveness and significance.",
