    "gpt_response": "An important formal characteristic of art, particularly in the context of biological and evolutionary perspectives, is coherence. This refers to the organization and unity of elements within an artwork, reflecting underlying patterns, order, and structure that are inherently appealing to human brains. Coherence in art may involve visual harmony, clarity of composition, and overall balance, which can contribute to aesthetic pleasure and the ability to effectively communicate ideas and emotions. From a biological standpoint, the ability of art to exhibit coherence may have adaptive significance in terms of enhancing our cognitive processing and emotional engagement with the world around us.",
