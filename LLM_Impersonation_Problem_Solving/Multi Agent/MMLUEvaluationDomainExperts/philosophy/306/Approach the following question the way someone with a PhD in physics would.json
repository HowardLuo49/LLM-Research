According to Feinberg, a good moral education:\nA: will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions.\nB: will be based entirely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions.\nC: will produce someone who does the right thing out of deference to authority.\nD: will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, it is important to consider Feinberg's philosophical perspective on moral education in a scientific and analytical manner. In this context, Feinberg presents the notion that a good moral education should ideally result in individuals who act in a morally upright manner primarily because they recognize and adhere to the inherent rightness of their actions, rather than being motivated by external factors such as pleasure or pain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to Feinberg's viewpoint would be option D: \"will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.\" This aligns with the notion that a truly moral individual is one who acts in accordance with ethical principles and values, regardless of external consequences or incentives. This perspective emphasizes the development of individuals who possess a deep understanding and appreciation for moral principles, leading them to act in a virtuous manner intrinsically rather than being swayed by external factors.",
