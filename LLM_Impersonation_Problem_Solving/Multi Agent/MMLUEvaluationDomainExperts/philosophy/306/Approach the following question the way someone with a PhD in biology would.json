    "gpt_response": "A good moral education, according to Feinberg, will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right (Option D). This aligns with the idea of moral internalism, wherein individuals act based on their own moral beliefs and values rather than external factors such as pleasure or pain as sanctions. This view emphasizes the importance of developing a strong moral compass and understanding of ethical principles to guide one's actions, rather than relying on external rewards or punishments. By cultivating a sense of moral responsibility and integrity, individuals are more likely to make ethical decisions based on their own convictions rather than external influences.",
