Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of:\nA: its actual consequences.\nB: its expected consequences.\nC: whether it violates any duties.\nD: whether it violates divine law.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist, I would approach this question by first examining the ethical framework proposed by Sidgwick. Sidgwick is known for his ethical theory of utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing overall happiness or pleasure. In this framework, the consequences of an action play a crucial role in determining its moral worth.\n\nBased on this understanding, Anscombe's claim aligns with the utilitarian perspective that the badness of an action should be estimated in light of its actual consequences. This is because utilitarianism holds that the moral value of an action is determined by the amount of overall happiness or pleasure it produces.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question would be:\n\nA: its actual consequences.",
