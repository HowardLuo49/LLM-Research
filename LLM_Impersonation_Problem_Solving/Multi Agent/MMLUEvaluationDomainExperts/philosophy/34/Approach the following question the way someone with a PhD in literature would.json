    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by looking at the writings of Judith Butler, a prominent thinker in the field of feminist and queer theory. In her work, Butler often explores questions of ethics and morality, particularly in relation to concepts of identity and performativity.\n\nBased on my understanding of Butler's work, I would argue that the correct answer to the question is B: do something of which one does not oneself approve. Butler's theory of performativity suggests that our actions are not simply expressions of our inner selves, but are also shaped by social norms and expectations. In this context, to do something of which one does not oneself approve would be to act inauthentically, violating the integrity of one's own ethical position.\n\nFurthermore, Butler's emphasis on the interconnectedness of individual and collective identity suggests that acting in a way that goes against one's own values could also have negative implications for broader social relations. In this sense, Butler's work challenges us to consider the ethical implications of our actions and the importance of aligning our behavior with our own moral beliefs.",
