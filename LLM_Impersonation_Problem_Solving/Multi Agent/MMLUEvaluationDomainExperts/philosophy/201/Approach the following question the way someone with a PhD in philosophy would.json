    "gpt_response": "PhD in Philosophy Response: In Cicero's framework, it is essential to understand that each individual is endowed by Nature with two distinct characters - the divine and the beastly. This dual nature represents the inherent complexity of human existence, reflecting the potential for both elevated spiritual qualities as well as base instinctual urges. The divine aspect signifies the capacity for moral excellence, virtuous behavior, and higher reasoning, while the beastly aspect embodies primal desires, irrationality, and potential for cruelty. Through the interplay of these contrasting elements, individuals navigate the moral landscape and strive towards self-improvement and ethical growth. Cicero's conception of the human duality serves as a philosophical lens through which to examine the complexities of human nature, moral decision-making, and the pursuit of excellence in life.",
