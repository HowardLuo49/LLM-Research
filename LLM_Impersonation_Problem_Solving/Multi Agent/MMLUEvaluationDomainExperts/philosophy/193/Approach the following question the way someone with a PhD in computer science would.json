    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. Mill claims that the distinction between justice and other moral obligations corresponds perfectly to the distinction between:\nA: perfect and imperfect obligations.\nB: positive and negative duties.\nC: strong and weak duties.\nD: absolute and relative obligations.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Mill's claim regarding the distinction between justice and other moral obligations, it is important to approach this question from a philosophical and analytical perspective. \n\nMill's utilitarian ethical framework places a strong emphasis on the concept of justice, particularly in terms of maximizing overall happiness and minimizing suffering for the greatest number of individuals. Justice, in this context, is often seen as a fundamental moral principle that guides our actions towards promoting the common good.\n\nIn contrast, other moral obligations may involve duties and responsibilities that are not as universally applicable or central to societal welfare. These may include personal commitments, promises, or obligations that are more discretionary in nature.\n\nTo address Mill's claim, we must first understand the distinctions between different types of moral obligations. Perfect obligations refer to duties that are precise, specific, and clearly defined, leaving little room for interpretation or variation. Imperfect obligations, on the other hand, are more flexible and open to interpretation, allowing some freedom in how they are fulfilled.\n\nSimilarly, positive duties involve actively doing something to benefit others, while negative duties involve refraining from harming others or violating their rights. In the context of justice, positive duties may include promoting fairness and equality, while negative duties may involve respecting the rights and autonomy of individuals.\n\nStrong duties are those that carry a high degree of moral significance and are considered to be of utmost importance, often non-negotiable or inviolable. Weak duties, on the other hand, are less stringent and may be subject to trade-offs or compromises in certain situations.\n\nAbsolute obligations are those that are unconditionally binding and must be fulfilled regardless of the circumstances. Relative obligations, in contrast, may vary depending on the context or priorities at hand, allowing for some degree of flexibility or discretion in their fulfillment.\n\nIn light of the above distinctions, it is evident that Mill's claim aligns most closely with option A: perfect and imperfect obligations. Justice, as a central moral principle in Mill's utilitarian framework, embodies a form of perfect obligation that is absolute, non-negotiable, and essential for promoting the greater good. Other moral obligations, by comparison, may be more variable, contingent, and discretionary in nature, falling under the category of imperfect duties that allow for more flexibility and interpretation.",
