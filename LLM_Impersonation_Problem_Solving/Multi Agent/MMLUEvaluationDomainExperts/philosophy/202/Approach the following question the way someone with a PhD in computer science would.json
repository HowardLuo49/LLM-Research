    "gpt_response": "From a philosophical and ethical standpoint, Aristotle viewed his theory of the virtues as open-ended and revisable. This is because virtue ethics, as put forth by Aristotle, emphasizes the importance of practical wisdom and moral excellence in guiding human actions. The notion of virtues being final and complete would be incongruent with Aristotle's belief in the ongoing process of moral development and self-improvement. Additionally, Aristotle's theory of the virtues is grounded in universal principles that are not limited to any specific culture, making option C less likely. As such, the most fitting answer would be B: open-ended and revisable.",
