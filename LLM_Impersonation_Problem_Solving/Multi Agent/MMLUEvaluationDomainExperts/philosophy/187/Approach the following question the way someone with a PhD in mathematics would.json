    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Epicurus' perspective on the wealth required for a good life, we must first turn to his teachings on the nature of happiness and well-being. Epicurus famously posited that true happiness is achieved through the absence of pain and disturbance, rather than the pursuit of ephemeral pleasures or material wealth.\n\nFrom this philosophical standpoint, we can deduce that Epicurus would likely argue that the wealth necessary for a good life is not dependent on material abundance or extravagant possessions. Instead, he would likely assert that the wealth required for a good life is easily procured, as it is fundamentally rooted in the tranquility of the soul and the absence of unnecessary desires.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer in accordance with Epicurus' teachings would be A: easily procured. This aligns with his belief that true happiness can be attained through simple pleasures and a state of inner contentment, rather than through the accumulation of material wealth or possessions.",
