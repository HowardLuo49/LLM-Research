Consistency with our considered moral judgments is a vital aspect of determining the adequacy of a moral criterion. A moral criterion that aligns with commonly accepted moral principles and values is more likely to be deemed adequate and reliable in guiding ethical decision-making. In the context of engineering ethics, adherence to established ethical norms and principles is crucial for maintaining integrity and trust in the profession. Therefore, ensuring consistency with our considered moral judgments is a key criterion for assessing the adequacy of moral principles in engineering practice.",
