Additionally, there are situations where it may be desirable to withhold certain pieces of information, such as the length of time an interview will take, in order to prevent bias or influence on the participants' responses. Furthermore, if participants knew exactly what the researcher was intending to study, they might change their behavior, which could compromise the validity and reliability of the study results.
