    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In Aquinas's theological and philosophical framework, man's ultimate happiness is intrinsically tied to his pursuit of the divine. Aquinas posits that man's ultimate happiness consists in contemplating God, as this allows individuals to commune with the divine in a way that transcends mere physical pleasures or mundane acts of virtue. By directing one's intellect and will towards the contemplation of God, individuals are able to align themselves with the ultimate source of perfection and goodness, thereby achieving a state of fulfillment and happiness that surpasses any temporal pleasures or moral acts. Ultimately, for Aquinas, loving and contemplating God represents the highest and most fulfilling end towards which human life should strive.",
