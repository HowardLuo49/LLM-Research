    "gpt_response": "Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, posits that what truly angers an individual when struck by another person is not the physical force of the blow itself, nor the malicious intentions behind the action, nor the insult involved, but rather their own judgment or interpretation of the situation. According to Epictetus, it is not the external event of being struck that causes distress, but rather the individual's internal reaction to it. This aligns with Stoic philosophy's emphasis on self-mastery and maintaining a sense of inner tranquility regardless of external circumstances. Therefore, the correct answer according to Epictetus would be C: your own judgment.",
