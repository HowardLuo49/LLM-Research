    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a deep understanding of literature and philosophy, I would approach this question by analyzing the perspective of Epictetus, a prominent Stoic philosopher. In his teachings, Epictetus emphasizes the importance of controlling one's reactions to external events and understanding the role of personal judgment in shaping our emotional responses.\n\nIn this context, when someone strikes you, according to Epictetus, what truly angers you is not the physical force of the blow itself, nor the intentions behind the action, or even the insult involved in the confrontation. Instead, it is your own judgment of the situation that leads to your anger. Epictetus teaches that it is our internal thoughts and beliefs about an event that ultimately determine our emotional response to it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be C: your own judgment. By recognizing the power of our own perception and the role it plays in shaping our emotional reactions, we can strive to cultivate a sense of inner peace and equanimity in the face of external provocations, a key tenet of Stoic philosophy as expounded by Epictetus.",
