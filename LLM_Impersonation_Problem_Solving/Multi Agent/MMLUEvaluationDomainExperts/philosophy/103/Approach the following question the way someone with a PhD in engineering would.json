    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing Hume's perspective on aesthetics from a philosophical standpoint. In his work, Hume argues that the criteria for judging aesthetic value are entirely subjective. This view is rooted in his theory of empiricism and his belief that aesthetic judgments are based on individual perceptions and emotions rather than objective truths. Hume's argument challenges the idea of unchangeable or entirely objective criteria for assessing aesthetic value, suggesting instead that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Therefore, the correct answer choice would be A: entirely subjective.",
