    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:\nA: would likewise be destroyed.\nB: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\nC: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\nD: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing it from a scientific and logical perspective.\n\nFirstly, Aristotle's theory of essence or form pertains to metaphysics, which deals with the nature of reality beyond the physical world. This concept is not testable or verifiable through empirical observation or experimentation, which are the cornerstones of the scientific method.\n\nIn the realm of physics, we focus on understanding the physical properties and behavior of objects and entities in the universe. The idea of essence or form existing separately from individuals goes beyond the scope of physics and falls within the realm of philosophy.\n\nGiven this perspective, option D would be the most scientifically grounded choice. Physics deals with the study of matter, energy, space, and time, and does not delve into abstract concepts such as universal essences or natures of things. From a physics standpoint, the essence or form of a species would not be a tangible, physical entity that could be destroyed or exist in some other realm of being. Instead, it would be a conceptual construct that is not relevant to the scientific study of the physical world.",
