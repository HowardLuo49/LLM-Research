    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:\nA: would likewise be destroyed.\nB: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\nC: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\nD: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the concept of essence or form in the context of biology. Aristotle's idea of essence or form being associated with individual members of a species aligns with the biological concept of species being defined by shared characteristics and traits. \n\nFrom a biological perspective, if all the members of a species were destroyed, it would not negate the essence or form of that species. The essence or form of a species is not tied to the physical existence of individual members but rather to the shared characteristics and genetic information that define the species. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to the question would be D: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things. This aligns with the idea that species do not possess a separate, transcendent essence or form but are defined by the collective characteristics of their individual members.",
