    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. Aristotle says  that what makes things be what they are--their essence--does not exist apart from individ-uals that exist in the world.  So if all the members of a species were destroyed, then their essence or form:\nA: would likewise be destroyed.\nB: would be destroyed only if there were no one around to remember the species.\nC: would continue existing (as with Plato's Forms) in some other realm of being.\nD: would not be destroyed because there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed; there are only individuals, not universal essences or natures of things.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by understanding the philosophical concepts of essence and forms put forth by Aristotle and Plato. Aristotle argues that the essence or form of a thing is immanent in the individual beings that exist in the physical world. Therefore, if all the members of a species were destroyed, according to Aristotle, their essence or form would also cease to exist as it is tied to the individuals that embody it.\n\nOn the other hand, Plato believed in the existence of eternal Forms or universal essences that exist in a separate realm of being independent of physical reality. In Plato's view, even if all members of a species were destroyed, their essence or form would continue to exist in this other realm of being.\n\nGiven this understanding, as an engineering PhD, I would eliminate options B and C, as they do not align with Aristotle's concept of essence being tied to individual beings in the physical world. Option A, stating that the essence or form would likewise be destroyed, is in accordance with Aristotle's perspective. Option D, claiming that there was no essence or form originally to be destroyed, contradicts Aristotle's belief in the immanence of forms in individual beings. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be A: would likewise be destroyed.",
