Prima facie duties, as defined by philosopher W.D. Ross, are moral obligations that we have a duty to fulfill, unless there is a more pressing duty to the contrary. These duties are considered self-evident in the sense that they are intuitively recognizable and do not require further justification or proof. In other words, they are basic moral principles that are evident upon reflection and do not depend on external factors for their validity.\n\nTherefore, according to Ross and his concept of prima facie duties, option B: are self-evident, would be the most appropriate answer for someone with a PhD in physics approaching this question.",
