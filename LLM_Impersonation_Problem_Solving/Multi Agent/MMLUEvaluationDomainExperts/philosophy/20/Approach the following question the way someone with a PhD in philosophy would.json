    "gpt_response": "According to Moore's ethical theory of intuitionism, we are thinking about good whenever we think about intrinsic value. Moore argued that intrinsic value is a basic, irreducible property that cannot be further analyzed or defined in terms of any other concepts. Therefore, when we think about what is good, we are ultimately thinking about things that possess intrinsic value. In this sense, pleasure and desire are not equivalent to goodness, as they are contingent upon individual preferences and experiences, whereas intrinsic value is an objective and universal quality that can be intuitively apprehended. Thus, the correct answer is C: intrinsic value.",
