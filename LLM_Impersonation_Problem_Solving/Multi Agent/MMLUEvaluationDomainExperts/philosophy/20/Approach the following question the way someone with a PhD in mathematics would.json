In the case of intrinsic value, something is considered valuable in and of itself, regardless of any external factors such as pleasure or desire. This contrasts with extrinsic value, where something is valuable because it leads to some other desired outcome.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can eliminate options A and B, as they both suggest that good is closely tied to either pleasure or desire, which would fall more under the realm of extrinsic value. This leaves us with option C: intrinsic value, as the concept of good in Moore's philosophy is likely referring to things that possess intrinsic value. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer from a perspective informed by a PhD in mathematics would be C: intrinsic value.",
