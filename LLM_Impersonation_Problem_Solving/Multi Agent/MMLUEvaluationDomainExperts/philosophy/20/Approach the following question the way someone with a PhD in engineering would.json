    "gpt_response": "In considering Moore's philosophy, we must acknowledge that his concept of \"good\" typically refers to intrinsic value rather than external factors such as pleasure or desire. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: intrinsic value. Moore argues that intrinsic value is separate from any pleasure or desire associated with an object or action, and is instead a fundamental quality that exists independently of personal experiences or inclinations. This distinction is crucial for a thorough understanding of Moore's ethical framework and its implications for societal norms and values.",
