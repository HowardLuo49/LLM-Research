The first criterion is that the rule is not harmful, which aligns with the principle of non-maleficence in ethical decision-making. This criterion ensures that the rule does not cause harm or negative consequences to individuals. \n\nThe second criterion is that the rule does not impose unnecessary restrictions, which corresponds to the principle of beneficence in ethical decision-making. This criterion ensures that the rule does not unnecessarily limit individuals' freedom or autonomy without a justifiable reason.\n\nLastly, the third criterion is that the rule promotes the good of some people, which emphasizes the importance of considering the well-being and interests of individuals or groups impacted by the rule.\n\nTherefore, according to Baier, a rule can be said to be for the good of human beings only if it meets all of the above criteria, as outlined in option D.",
