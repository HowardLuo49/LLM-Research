Firstly, the rule must not be harmful, meaning it should not cause any negative consequences or harm to individuals. Secondly, the rule should not impose unnecessary restrictions on individuals, as this would limit their freedom and autonomy without any valid reason. Finally, the rule should promote the good of at least some people, indicating that it contributes positively to the well-being or interests of individuals in some way.
