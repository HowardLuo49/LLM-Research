This theory argues that mental events and processes are not just correlated with, but are in fact identical to, certain brain states and processes. This stance is in direct opposition to theories such as epiphenomenalism, which posits that mental states are mere byproducts of brain states, and logical behaviorism, which holds that mental states can be reduced to behavioral dispositions. The identity theory maintains that mental phenomena are not distinct from physical phenomena, but are one and the same.",
