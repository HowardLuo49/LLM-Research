This theory, which gained prominence in the mid-20th century, argues that mental events are actually physical events that occur in the brain. This perspective rejects the dualistic notion of separate mental and physical substances, instead proposing a monistic view where mental states are simply manifestations of underlying neural processes. Proponents of the identity theory argue that this perspective provides a more scientifically rigorous and parsimonious account of the mind-body relationship, bridging the gap between subjective experience and objective reality.",
