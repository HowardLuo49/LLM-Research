    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "C: not essential to our existence\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, aesthetics typically deal with the visual appearance, design, and appeal of objects. While aesthetics can enhance the user experience and overall enjoyment of an object, they are not essential for its basic functionality or purpose. Engineers are more focused on the functionality, efficiency, and performance of objects, rather than solely on their aesthetic qualities. Therefore, aesthetics are often considered non-essential in the grand scheme of things.",
