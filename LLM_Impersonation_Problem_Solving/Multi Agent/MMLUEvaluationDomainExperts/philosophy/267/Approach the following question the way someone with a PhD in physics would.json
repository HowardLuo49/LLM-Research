    "gpt_response": "In considering the problem of moral luck, Thomas Nagel argues that the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events. This poses a challenge to traditional notions of moral responsibility, as it raises questions about the extent to which individuals can be held accountable for their actions in a world where external factors beyond their control can significantly influence outcomes. Nagel suggests that our understanding of human action and moral theory may need to be reassessed in order to grapple with the complexities that arise from the issue of moral luck.",
