According to Nagel, the problem of moral luck arises because:\nA: philosophers try to apply arbitrarily stringent standards to moral responsibility.\nB: the self is threatened with dissolution by the absorption of its acts into the class of events.\nC: our moral theories are hopelessly off track.\nD: our theories of human action are hopelessly off track.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The problem of moral luck as articulated by Nagel stems from the inherent tension between our intuitions of moral responsibility and the reality of luck in our lives. Nagel suggests that philosophers often attempt to uphold strict standards of moral responsibility, leading them to grapple with the concept of luck - which seems to undermine the idea of individuals having full control over their actions and their consequences.\n\nFurthermore, Nagel posits that the notion of moral luck is particularly troubling because it challenges the coherence of the self. If our actions and their moral significance are at the mercy of external factors beyond our control, then the idea of a stable, autonomous self becomes difficult to sustain. This threat of the dissolution of the self is a central concern in Nagel's discussion of moral luck.\n\nOverall, Nagel argues that the problem of moral luck points to fundamental flaws in our moral theories and our understanding of human action. By highlighting the impact of luck on moral responsibility, Nagel calls into question the adequacy of our existing moral frameworks, suggesting that they are in need of significant revision to adequately address the complexities of moral luck.",
