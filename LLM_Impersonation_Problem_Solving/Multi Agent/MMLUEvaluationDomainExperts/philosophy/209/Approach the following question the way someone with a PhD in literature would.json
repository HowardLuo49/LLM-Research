    "gpt_response": "Parfit, a prominent philosopher in the realm of ethics, has argued that the obligation to give priority to the welfare of one's children is agent-relative. This means that the duty to prioritize the well-being of one's children is specific to the individual as a parent and is not a universal moral principle that applies to all agents. In other words, this obligation is based on the particular relationship between a parent and their children, rather than a general ethical principle that is independent of personal relationships. This perspective is distinct from agent-neutral ethical theories, which prioritize the overall well-being of all individuals equally, regardless of personal relationships. Ultimately, Parfit's stance on the obligation to prioritize the welfare of one's children aligns with the agent-relative framework.",
