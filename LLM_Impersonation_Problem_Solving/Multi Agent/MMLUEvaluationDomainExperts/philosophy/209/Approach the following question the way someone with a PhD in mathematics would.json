    "gpt_response": "In his work, Derek Parfit discusses the notion of agent-relative and agent-neutral reasons, which relate to reasons for action that are dependent on the individual agent or reasons that are impartial and universal, respectively. \n\nConsidering Parfit's framework, one could argue that the obligation to give priority to the welfare of one's children is agent-relative. This is because this obligation is specific to the parent-child relationship and is influenced by personal ties and responsibilities that are unique to that relationship. In contrast, an agent-neutral obligation would apply universally and impartially to all individuals, regardless of their personal relationships.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate answer to the question would be:\nA: agent-relative.",
