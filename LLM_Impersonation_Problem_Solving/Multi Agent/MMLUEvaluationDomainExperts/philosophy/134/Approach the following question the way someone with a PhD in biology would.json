Situation ethics posits that the morality of an action is determined by the context or situation in which it occurs, rather than by fixed moral principles or guidelines.\n\nIn the context of situation ethics, the idea of \"anything goes\" suggests a complete lack of moral framework or boundaries, which is not aligned with the core principle of situation ethics that moral decisions should be based on love and the needs of the situation.\n\nPrincipled relativism, on the other hand, acknowledges the existence of universal moral principles but allows for flexibility and adaptation based on the particular circumstances of a situation. This idea is more consistent with the principles of situation ethics.\n\nSimilarly, the idea that \"the end justifies the means\" is not inherently synonymous with situation ethics, as it implies a consequentialist approach to ethics where the outcome of an action justifies any means used to achieve it, regardless of the moral implications.\n\nFinally, the idea of having \"no choice\" is not necessarily associated with situation ethics, as this moral theory emphasizes the importance of individual responsibility and decision-making in moral dilemmas.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of situation ethics, the idea not associated with this stance would be C: The end justifies the means.",
