Situation ethics is a moral theory that posits that the ethicality of an action is determined by the context of the situation rather than adherence to a set of fixed moral principles. \n\nBased on this understanding, we can analyze each of the ideas presented:\n\nA: \"Anything goes\" suggests a lack of moral principles and an ethic of total permissiveness, which aligns with situation ethics as it emphasizes the importance of context in determining the ethicality of an action.\n\nB: Principled relativism is the belief that ethical principles are relative and can vary based on individual perspectives or cultural norms. This idea is also aligned with situation ethics as it acknowledges the flexibility of moral standards in different contexts.\n\nC: \"The end justifies the means\" is a consequentialist ethical theory that focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions rather than the actions themselves. While this idea may sometimes align with situation ethics, it is not inherently associated with it as situation ethics places importance on the motives and intentions behind actions.\n\nD: \"No choice\" suggests a lack of agency or free will in decision-making, which is not consistent with the central tenet of situation ethics that emphasizes the importance of individual choice and responsibility in ethical decision-making.\n\nTherefore, the idea that is not associated with the stance of situation ethics is D: No choice.",
