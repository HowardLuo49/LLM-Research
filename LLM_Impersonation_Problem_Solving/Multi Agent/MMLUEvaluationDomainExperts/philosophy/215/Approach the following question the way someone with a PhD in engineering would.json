    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a logical and analytical standpoint. Augustine, as a theologian and philosopher, likely based his claim on a combination of reason and faith. From an engineering perspective, the idea that all created things are eternally and unchangeably good may not be consistent with scientific principles, as everything in the physical world is subject to change and degradation over time.\n\nHowever, when considering the concept of goodness in a broader sense, it is possible to argue that created things exhibit qualities or characteristics that can be considered good, even if they are not perfect or unchangeable. In the context of engineering, we often strive for improvement and innovation to create more efficient and effective systems, which can be seen as a pursuit of goodness in our creations.\n\nTherefore, I would posit that option C: all created things are good, even taken separately, aligns more closely with the principles of engineering and the understanding of goodness as it relates to the physical world.",
