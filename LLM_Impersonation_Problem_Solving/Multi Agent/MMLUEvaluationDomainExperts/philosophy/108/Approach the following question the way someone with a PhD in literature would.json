    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a scholar in the field of literature, the notion of \"meaning in life\" can be approached from various theoretical perspectives. In existential literature, for example, the concept of \"meaning in life\" often refers to the internal search for purpose and significance in an inherently ambiguous and sometimes absurd world. Writers such as Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre have explored the idea that individuals are responsible for creating their own meaning in the face of a seemingly indifferent universe.\n\nIn contrast, religious texts and beliefs often offer the notion of \"meaning in life\" as being derived from external sources such as adherence to a divine plan or fulfilling one's role within a larger cosmic order. For believers, the concept of \"meaning in life\" can be intertwined with the idea of a spiritual connection or transcendental purpose bestowed upon individuals by a higher power.\n\nFurthermore, discussions of \"meaning in life\" can also extend to considerations of an afterlife, where the question of whether there is a continuation of meaning and purpose beyond the physical realm becomes central. Writers and thinkers from various traditions have contemplated the significance of life beyond death, with some positing the existence of a metaphysical realm where the true essence of human existence is revealed and fulfilled.\n\nOverall, the notion of \"meaning in life\" is a complex and multifaceted concept that spans philosophical, religious, and existential domains, offering rich material for literary analysis and interpretation.",
