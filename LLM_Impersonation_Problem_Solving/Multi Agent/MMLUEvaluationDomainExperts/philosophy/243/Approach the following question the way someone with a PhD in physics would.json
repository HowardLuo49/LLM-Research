    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In Butler's philosophical framework, injustice is posited to be primarily caused by the inherent desires for external goods that drive human behavior. According to Butler, individuals are motivated by a pursuit of these external goods, such as material wealth or social status, leading them to act in ways that perpetuate injustice within society. This emphasis on the role of desires for external goods as a root cause of injustice aligns with Butler's broader ethical theory, which centers on the importance of self-examination and moral reflection in order to align one's desires with virtuous action. Therefore, the correct answer in this context would be A: desires for external goods.",
