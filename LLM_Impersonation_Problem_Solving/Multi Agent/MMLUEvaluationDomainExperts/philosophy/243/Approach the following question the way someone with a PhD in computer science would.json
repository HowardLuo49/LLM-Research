    "gpt_response": "In Butler's view, injustice is primarily caused by one's desires for external goods. This perspective aligns with her ethical framework, which emphasizes that individuals are often enticed by the pursuit of material wealth, power, and status at the expense of acting in a just and ethical manner. Additionally, Butler argues that the love of injustice, which may stem from a lack of empathy or moral fortitude, can also contribute to the perpetuation of unjust actions. While ill-will toward others and self-hatred may play a role in certain instances of injustice, Butler places particular emphasis on the corrupting influence of desires for external goods as a root cause of injustice in society.",
