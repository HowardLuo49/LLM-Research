In Descartes' philosophical exploration of skepticism and doubt, he initially supposes that everything he sees is true in order to systematically doubt and question the foundations of his beliefs. This key premise sets the stage for his method of radical doubt, leading to his famous conclusion \"Cogito, ergo sum\" (I think, therefore I am). By initially assuming that everything he sees is true, Descartes is able to methodically question and deconstruct his previous beliefs, ultimately arriving at a deeper understanding of his own existence.",
