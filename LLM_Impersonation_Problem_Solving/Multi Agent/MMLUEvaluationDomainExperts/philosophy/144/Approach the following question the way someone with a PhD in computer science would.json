    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Nagel subscribes to a form of moral skepticism that posits that individuals cannot be morally assessed for actions that do not violate anyone's rights prior to deep reflection. This aligns with a Kantian understanding of morality, where actions are only morally significant when they involve the infringement of another person's rights. Therefore, according to Nagel, individuals cannot be held morally accountable for actions that are self-regarding, as they do not involve the imposition on others' rights. This perspective highlights the importance of moral reflection and consideration of the rights and interests of others in moral assessment.",
