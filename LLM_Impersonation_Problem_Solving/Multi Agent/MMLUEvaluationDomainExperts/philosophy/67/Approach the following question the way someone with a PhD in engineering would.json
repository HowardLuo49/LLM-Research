    "gpt_response": "As a researcher with a PhD in engineering, I would define deception in business research as any practice in which the researcher intentionally misleads or withholds information from research participants in order to gather data. Based on this definition, the most clear example of deception in business research among the options provided is option C: The researcher representing their research as being about a different topic. This practice directly misleads participants about the true nature of the research, potentially leading to biased or unreliable data collection. While options A, B, and D also involve ethical considerations and potential violations of research protocols, option C is the most explicit example of deception in this context.",
