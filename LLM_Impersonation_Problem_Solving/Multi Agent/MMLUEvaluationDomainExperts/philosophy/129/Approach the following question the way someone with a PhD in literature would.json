Aquinas argued that there must be a first cause, or unmoved mover, in order to avoid an infinite regression of causes. This is based on his belief in the existence of God as the ultimate, uncaused cause. By positing an infinite regress of causes, one would undermine the idea of a first cause and the existence of God as the necessary foundation of existence. Thus, Aquinas concludes that an infinite regress of causes is impossible within his philosophical framework.",
