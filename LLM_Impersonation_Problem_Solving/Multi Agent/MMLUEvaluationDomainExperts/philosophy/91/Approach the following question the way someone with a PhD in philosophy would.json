According to Socrates, the task of the wise and virtuous person is not simply to learn various examples of just or virtuous actions but to learn the essence of justice or virtue, because:\nA: by knowing enough examples of justice or virtue, we will live a worthwhile life even if we do not know what makes them examples of justice or virtue.\nB: knowledge of individual examples alone would not prepare someone for situations of justice or virtue to which the examples do not immediately apply.\nC: what makes an action just or virtuous can be known only by asking people for their opinions and respecting each answer as equally valuable.\nD: justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, even if people do not always agree on how to achieve those ends.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Socrates posits that the task of the wise and virtuous person is not simply to learn various examples of just or virtuous actions, but to understand the essence of justice or virtue. This is because mere knowledge of specific instances of such actions is insufficient for leading a truly virtuous life. By grasping the underlying principles of justice and virtue, one is equipped to apply them in a wide range of situations, even those that may not have been explicitly encountered before. In this way, the wise and virtuous person is able to navigate the complexities of moral decision-making with a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of what constitutes justice and virtue. Ultimately, by delving into the essence of justice and virtue, one can strive towards the universal goals of all human beings, regardless of differing opinions on the methods of achieving those ends.",
