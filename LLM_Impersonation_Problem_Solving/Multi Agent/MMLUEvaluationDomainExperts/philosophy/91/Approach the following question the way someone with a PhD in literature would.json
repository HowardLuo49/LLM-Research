    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would.  According to Socrates, the task of the wise and virtuous person is not simply to learn various examples of just or virtuous actions but to learn the essence of justice or virtue, because:\nA: by knowing enough examples of justice or virtue, we will live a worthwhile life even if we do not know what makes them examples of justice or virtue.\nB: knowledge of individual examples alone would not prepare someone for situations of justice or virtue to which the examples do not immediately apply.\nC: what makes an action just or virtuous can be known only by asking people for their opinions and respecting each answer as equally valuable.\nD: justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, even if people do not always agree on how to achieve those ends.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a literary scholar with a deep understanding of philosophy, it is crucial to approach Socrates' assertion with a nuanced perspective. Socrates posits that true wisdom and virtue entail not merely the rote memorization of examples of just or virtuous actions, but a profound comprehension of the essence of justice or virtue itself. This concept, rooted in the Socratic method of inquiry and dialectics, speaks to the transformative power of knowledge that transcends superficial understanding.\n\nA PhD in literature, well-versed in textual analysis and critical thinking, would likely argue that option B best encapsulates the essence of Socrates' teachings. Socrates suggests that a mere accumulation of individual examples of justice or virtue would not adequately equip an individual to navigate the complexities and nuances of ethical decision-making in various situations. True wisdom lies in grasping the underlying principles and ideals that govern just and virtuous actions, enabling one to apply these principles effectively across diverse contexts.\n\nFurthermore, a scholar with expertise in literature would be attuned to the nuances of language and rhetoric, recognizing the importance of precise wording in philosophical discourse. Option B elegantly captures the essence of Socrates' argument by emphasizing the limitations of relying solely on isolated examples without a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles at play.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in literature would approach Socrates' assertion with a keen awareness of the philosophical nuances inherent in his teachings. By emphasizing the importance of grasping the essence of justice or virtue rather than mere examples, Socrates challenges us to cultivate a deeper understanding of ethical principles that can guide our actions in a meaningful and transformative way.",
