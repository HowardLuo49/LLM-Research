    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by considering the philosophical views of David Hume on aesthetics. In his treatise \"Of the Standard of Taste,\" Hume argues that beauty is not a quality inherent in objects themselves, but rather a subjective response that is dependent on the individual's personal taste and sensibility. Hume posits that our perception of beauty is shaped by a combination of factors, including our cultural background, personal experiences, and emotional responses.
