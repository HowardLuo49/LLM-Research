    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. To say that \"philosophy\" (like \"love\" or \"art\") is not a closed concept means that we cannot state the necessary and sufficient conditions by which it is defined.  Rather, philosophic issues are identifiable as having \"family resemblances\" with one another.  In other words:\nA: there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another.\nB: the way we come to think about philosophy, love, or art really depends on how we were raised by our families to identify things as resembling one another.\nC: the necessary and sufficient condition for something to be considered philosophic is that it answers either of these questions: What does it mean? and How do you know?\nD: philosophy is not a closed discipline insofar as it is willing to accept any answer suggested by the \"human family\" as being true.",

    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by highlighting the similarities between the concept of philosophy and the concept of biological classification. In both cases, there is not a single defining feature that can be used to cleanly separate one entity from another. Instead, we rely on a set of characteristics that are shared among different entities, leading to a classification system based on \"family resemblances.\"\n\nIn the context of philosophy, this means that there is not a strict set of necessary and sufficient conditions that can be used to definitively define a philosophic issue. Instead, we recognize that philosophic issues share certain common traits and themes, allowing us to group them together based on these similarities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question would be A: there is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another. This aligns with the idea that philosophy, like biology, is a dynamic and evolving field that does not have rigid boundaries.",
