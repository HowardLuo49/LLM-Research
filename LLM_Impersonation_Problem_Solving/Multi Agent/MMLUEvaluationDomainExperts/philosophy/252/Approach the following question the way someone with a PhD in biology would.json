    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach Craig's argument from a scientific perspective. It is well established in astrophysics and cosmology that the universe has a finite age, approximately 13.8 billion years old, based on observations such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the expansion of the universe. This finite age suggests that at some point in the past, the universe began to exist, supporting Craig's assertion that the series of events in time cannot be actually infinite. Therefore, the most scientifically supported answer would be A: the universe is finite in the past and began to exist.",
