According to Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, the absence of a common authority to enforce order and maintain control over individuals would result in a state of nature characterized by a perpetual \"war of every man against every man.\" This condition is rooted in human nature, which Hobbes believed to be inherently self-interested and driven by a desire for power and survival. The lack of a centralized power to keep individuals in check would lead to a constant state of conflict and competition, as each person seeks to protect their own interests at the expense of others. Therefore, the correct answer is D: war of every man against every man.",
