Aquinas, as a renowned theologian and philosopher, believed that the end or ultimate goal of every action is the attainment of some good. This aligns with his broader philosophical framework that posits the existence of a transcendental reality of ultimate goodness, which serves as the foundation for moral action and the ultimate fulfillment of human beings.
