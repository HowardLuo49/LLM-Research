Therefore, in considering the characteristic of an act with respect to a prima facie duty, we must understand that it:\n\nB: Tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.\n\nPrima facie duties provide a framework for ethical decision-making by highlighting important moral principles that should guide our actions, but they also acknowledge that conflicts between duties may arise, requiring careful deliberation to determine the most appropriate course of action. The existence of prima facie duties underscores the complexity of moral decision-making and the need to consider various factors in determining the rightness of an action.",
