    "gpt_response": "To answer this question from the perspective of someone with a PhD in mathematics, we must first establish a clear understanding of the concept of prima facie duties in ethics. Prima facie duties are moral obligations that hold true unless overridden by a stronger moral obligation in a particular situation. \n\nIn mathematics, we often deal with principles and concepts that are self-evident or axiomatic, serving as the foundation for further mathematical reasoning. In the context of ethical reasoning, a prima facie duty can be seen as a fundamental principle that guides moral decision-making. \n\nGiven this understanding, we can approach the question by considering the nature of prima facie duties. Option A suggests that a prima facie duty may seem right, but this perception could be misleading. While this acknowledges the potential for ambiguity or uncertainty in moral judgment, it does not fully capture the nature of prima facie duties as conditional moral obligations.\n\nOption B recognizes that prima facie duties tend to be right, but may be outweighed by conflicting moral considerations. This aligns with the definition of prima facie duties as conditional or defeasible moral principles that can be overridden by stronger moral obligations in specific circumstances. This option effectively captures the concept of prima facie duties in ethical theory.\n\nOption C straightforwardly states that a prima facie duty is inherently right, but this fails to acknowledge the conditional nature of these moral obligations. Prima facie duties are not absolute moral imperatives, but rather provisional guidelines that must be weighed against other moral considerations.\n\nOption D suggests that a prima facie duty is the first thing an agent ought to do above all else. While prima facie duties do carry moral weight, they are not necessarily ranked above all other moral principles. The conditional nature of prima facie duties allows for flexibility in moral decision-making based on the specific circumstances at hand.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in mathematics would likely choose option B as the most accurate representation of the concept of prima facie duties in ethical theory, as it captures the conditional and defeasible nature of these moral obligations.",
