This concept is often associated with the ethical theory of prima facie duties developed by philosopher W.D. Ross. According to Ross, there are several basic moral principles or duties that individuals should adhere to, including duties such as fidelity, non-injury, and veracity.\n\nIn the context of biology, a researcher or practitioner may encounter ethical dilemmas when conducting experiments on animals, for example. In such cases, the principle of non-injury would be considered a prima facie duty that should guide decision-making. However, this duty may be outweighed by other considerations such as the potential benefits of the research or the welfare of human patients who could benefit from the results.\n\nTherefore, in the context of biology, a prima facie duty is a characteristic of an act in virtue of which the act tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations (option B). This perspective acknowledges the complexity of ethical decision-making in biology and the need to balance competing moral obligations in a thoughtful and conscientious manner.",
