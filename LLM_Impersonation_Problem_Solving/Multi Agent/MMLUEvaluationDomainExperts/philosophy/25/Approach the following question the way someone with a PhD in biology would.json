In his work \"A Treatise of Human Nature,\" David Hume delineates our perceptions into two fundamental categories: impressions and ideas. Impressions refer to the more immediate, vivid, and forceful mental experiences derived from our sensory perceptions or internal emotions. Ideas, on the other hand, are fainter copies of our original impressions, representing thoughts or beliefs that are derived from our experiences but lack the same degree of liveliness. This division is central to Hume's epistemological framework and understanding of human cognition.",
