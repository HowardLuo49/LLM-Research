    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is B: impressions and ideas.\n\nHume distinguishes between impressions, which are vivid and immediate perceptions that arise from direct sensory experience or emotional states, and ideas, which are fainter copies or reconstructions of these impressions that are generated through processes such as memory, imagination, or reasoning.\n\nThis distinction is fundamental to Hume's epistemological framework and plays a central role in his analysis of human knowledge and perception. It serves as the basis for his famous dictum that all ideas are ultimately derived from impressions, and it underpins his skeptical critique of the traditional views of causality, induction, and personal identity.",
