Augustine, a theologian and philosopher, believed in the concept of original sin and the fallibility of human nature due to the disobedience of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.\n\nConsidering Augustine's theological beliefs, we can infer that he would argue that humans can err due to their inherent sinful nature, ignorance, or moral weakness. Option B, \"except through ignorance,\" aligns with Augustine's view that humans are prone to error due to their lack of knowledge or understanding. This can be seen as a manifestation of original sin, which distorts human perception and judgment.\n\nWhile temptation and wickedness are also factors that can lead to error according to Augustine's perspective, they can ultimately be linked back to ignorance or a lack of spiritual awareness. Therefore, I would interpret Augustine's stance as being most closely aligned with option B: except through ignorance.",
