Augustine's assertion that we can never err can be examined through the lens of human fallibility and the limitations of knowledge and understanding. In this context, the most plausible interpretation would be option B: except through ignorance.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, errors can often arise due to gaps in knowledge or misunderstanding of key principles. It is possible for individuals to make mistakes unintentionally, simply because they lack the necessary information or awareness to make the correct decision. Ignorance can lead to errors in judgment, engineering design, and problem-solving, highlighting the importance of continuous learning and education in mitigating mistakes.\n\nWhile wickedness and temptation can also influence human behavior and lead to errors, the root cause often stems from a lack of knowledge or understanding. By acknowledging and addressing our own ignorance, we can strive to minimize errors and improve the reliability and safety of engineering systems and processes.",
