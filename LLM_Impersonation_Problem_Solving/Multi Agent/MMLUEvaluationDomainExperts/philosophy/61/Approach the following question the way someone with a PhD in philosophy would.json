    "gpt_response": "According to Hume's moral theory, morality is ultimately based on the sentiment of sympathy. Hume argues that moral judgments are not derived from reason or divine command, but rather from our capacity for empathy and understanding of the emotions and sentiments of others. In his view, moral distinctions are rooted in our natural tendency to feel and share in the joys and sorrows of our fellow human beings.
