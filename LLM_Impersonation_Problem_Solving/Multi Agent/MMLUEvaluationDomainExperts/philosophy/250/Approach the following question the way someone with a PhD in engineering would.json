    "gpt_response": "In the field of engineering, the most commonly associated method with a lack of informed consent is covert observation. Covert observation involves observing subjects without their knowledge or consent, which raises ethical concerns regarding privacy, autonomy, and potential harm to the individuals being observed. This method is often considered unethical and can result in serious repercussions if not properly handled. Therefore, engineering researchers must carefully consider the ethical implications and seek informed consent from participants to uphold ethical standards in their research practices.",
