    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would interpret Kant's statement as advocating for a universal law when determining the moral permissibility of an action. Kant's categorical imperative suggests that one should act according to the maxim that they would want to be universally applied, implying that moral actions should be consistent across all individuals in all situations. Therefore, the correct answer is C: a universal law. This aligns with the fundamental principles of ethical decision-making and the concept of universality in moral philosophy.",
