    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "A: it is not in accordance with natural law.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, Epicurus' reasoning aligns with the idea that laws should be based on principles that are inherent in natural order. As a PhD in biology, one would argue that natural laws govern the behavior of living organisms and the functioning of ecosystems. Therefore, a law that goes against these natural laws would disrupt the balance and harmony of the natural world. Epicurus believed that laws should aim to promote well-being and happiness, which are ultimately tied to adhering to natural laws. A biologist would likely agree with this perspective, as nature provides the foundation for understanding the complexities of life and the environment. Ultimately, laws that are not in accordance with natural law may lead to negative consequences for both individuals and the broader ecosystem.",
