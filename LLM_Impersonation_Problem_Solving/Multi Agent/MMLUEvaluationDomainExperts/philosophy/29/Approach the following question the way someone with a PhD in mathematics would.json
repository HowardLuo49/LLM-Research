    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. According to Epicurus, a law is unjust when:\nA: it is not in accordance with natural law.\nB: it is not in accordance with the traditions of society.\nC: it is offensive to the gods.\nD: it is not beneficial to those it affects.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To analyze this question from a mathematical perspective, we must first define the criteria for a law being unjust according to Epicurus. In his ethical philosophy, Epicurus emphasizes the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain as the ultimate goals of life. Therefore, a law can be considered unjust if it does not promote the well-being and happiness of individuals.\n\nFrom this perspective, option D: it is not beneficial to those it affects, aligns most closely with Epicurus' criteria for unjust laws. If a law does not contribute to the happiness and well-being of individuals, it would be considered unjust according to Epicurean principles.\n\nThus, a PhD in mathematics would approach this question by carefully analyzing the logical implications of each option in relation to Epicurean philosophy and selecting option D as the most reasonable and mathematically sound choice.",
