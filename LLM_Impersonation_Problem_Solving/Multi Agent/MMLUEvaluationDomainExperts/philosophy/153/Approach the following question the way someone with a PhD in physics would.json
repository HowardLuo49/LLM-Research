Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, is known for his teachings on personal ethics and self-control. In this quote, he is asserting that the only thing one truly has control over and ownership of is the way one chooses to perceive and respond to external stimuli, or \"impressions.\" \n\nFrom a physics standpoint, we can understand this concept as the idea that while we may have physical possessions such as family, friends, and our bodies, ultimately the only thing within our control is our thoughts and actions. Our interactions with the world around us, including our relationships and the state of our bodies, are subject to external forces beyond our control. However, our thoughts, attitudes, and responses to these external forces are something we can consciously choose and shape.\n\nIn this way, we can see how Epictetus' claim aligns with principles of both philosophy and physics, emphasizing the importance of personal agency and inner strength in navigating the complexities of existence.",
