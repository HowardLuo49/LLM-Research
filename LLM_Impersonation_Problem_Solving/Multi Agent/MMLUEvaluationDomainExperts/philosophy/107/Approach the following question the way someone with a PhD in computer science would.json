Rawls argues that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because:\nA: it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.\nB: doing so would be too risky.\nC: it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.\nD: they would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.",

    "gpt_response": "From a philosophical standpoint, Rawls argues that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because of the inherent risk involved in maximizing happiness. Utilitarianism requires individuals to make decisions based on the overall maximization of happiness, which can often lead to unjust outcomes, such as the execution of innocent people. This goes against the principles of justice and fairness that would be prioritized by parties behind the veil of ignorance in Rawls' original position. Additionally, the complexity of determining which policies would truly maximize happiness adds another layer of uncertainty and potential harm, further dissuading parties from accepting utilitarianism as the guiding principle in decision-making.",
