Rawls argues that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because:\nA: it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.\nB: doing so would be too risky.\nC: it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.\nD: they would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by analyzing Rawls' argument through the lens of evolutionary biology and social psychology. Rawls posits that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness. This argument aligns with evolutionary perspectives on decision-making, which suggest that humans have evolved cognitive biases that make it challenging to accurately predict future outcomes. Additionally, from a social psychology standpoint, individuals are often risk-averse and may be wary of the potential negative consequences of implementing a utilitarian framework, as suggested by option B. This aligns with the concept of loss aversion, where individuals are more motivated to avoid losses than to acquire gains.\n\nFurthermore, Rawls' argument that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism due to the requirement to enact unjust actions, such as executing innocent people, can be understood through the lens of moral psychology. Research in moral cognition has shown that individuals have intuitive moral principles that guide their decision-making and that violating these principles can lead to cognitive dissonance and moral distress. Therefore, the prospect of having to make moral compromises under a utilitarian framework may be unappealing to parties in the original position.\n\nFinally, Rawls' assertion that parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because they would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus unaware of utilitarianism can be interpreted as a critique of the historical development and dissemination of ethical theories. This raises questions about the accessibility and dissemination of ethical principles within societies and the impact of this dissemination on decision-making processes.\n\nOverall, a PhD in biology would approach Rawls' argument against utilitarianism by drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from evolutionary biology, social psychology, moral cognition, and ethics to provide a comprehensive analysis of the rationale behind parties in the original position rejecting utilitarianism.",
