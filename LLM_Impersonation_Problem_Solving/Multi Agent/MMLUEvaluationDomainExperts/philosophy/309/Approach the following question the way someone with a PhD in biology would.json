    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by examining the historical context and understanding Descartes' theory of mind-body interaction. Descartes proposed that the pineal gland was the seat of the soul and the point of interaction between the immaterial mind and the material body. He believed that the pineal gland was the only structure in the brain that was not bilaterally symmetrical and therefore served as a unifying point for the dualistic nature of the mind and body. Therefore, the correct answer is C: the pineal gland.",
