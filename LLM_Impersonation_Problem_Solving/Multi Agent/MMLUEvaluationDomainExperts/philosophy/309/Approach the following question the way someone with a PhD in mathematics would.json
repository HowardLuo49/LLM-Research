    "gpt_response": "As a mathematical expert, I would approach this question by analyzing the historical context and Descartes' theories regarding the interaction between the body and mind. Descartes, a renowned philosopher and mathematician, proposed that the interaction between body and mind occurs in the pineal gland. This concept is grounded in his dualist philosophy, in which he distinguished between the physical body and the immaterial mind. The pineal gland was seen as the seat of the soul or where these two aspects of human existence converged. Therefore, based on Descartes' teachings, a PhD in mathematics would assert that the interaction between body and mind takes place in the pineal gland.",
