    "gpt_response": "A person with a PhD in philosophy would likely approach the question by first acknowledging the complexity and nuances of Mill's utilitarian philosophy. The principle of utility, as articulated by Mill, states that actions are morally right in proportion to their tendency to promote happiness and wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. \n\nTo address the question at hand, one must consider Mill's own writings on the subject. Mill posited that the principle of utility can be derived from first principles that are self-evident to rational beings. This suggests that option A, which states that the principle of utility can be proven from self-evident principles, aligns with Mill's own perspective.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Mill also recognized the need for empirical evidence and observation to assess the consequences of actions in order to determine their utility. This implies that while the principle of utility may be grounded in self-evident principles, it also requires empirical verification to be effectively applied in moral decision-making.\n\nFurthermore, Mill's acknowledgment of the fallibility and uncertainty inherent in all first principles suggests that option D, which states that the principle of utility cannot be proven but this is common to all first principles, is also a valid interpretation of his philosophical stance.\n\nIn conclusion, a nuanced understanding of Mill's philosophy reveals that the principle of utility can be both grounded in self-evident principles and supported by empirical evidence, while also recognizing the inherent limitations of all first principles in terms of irrefutable proof.",
