Mill claims that the principle of utility:\nA: can be proven from self-evident principles.\nB: can be proven from principles that are known empirically.\nC: cannot be proven, and this is a unique problem for the theory.\nD: cannot be proven, but this is common to all first principles.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing it from a logical and principled perspective. \n\nJohn Stuart Mill, a prominent philosopher in the field of Utilitarianism, claims that the principle of utility is the foundation of his ethical theory. The principle of utility states that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, and wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\n\nIn regards to the options provided:\nA: Mill does not argue that the principle of utility can be proven from self-evident principles. Instead, he argues that it can be derived from the fundamental tendency of actions to produce happiness or unhappiness.\n\nB: Mill also does not claim that the principle of utility can be proven from principles known empirically. While empirical evidence may support the application of the principle in specific circumstances, the principle itself is based on a fundamental understanding of the nature of happiness and morality.\n\nC: Mill does acknowledge that the principle of utility cannot be proven in a mathematical or deductive sense. However, he does not see this as a unique problem for his theory, but rather a limitation of ethical principles in general.\n\nD: Mill's position aligns most closely with option D, as he believes that the principle of utility, like other first principles in ethics, cannot be proven through deductive reasoning. Instead, it is accepted as a foundational belief that guides ethical decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, based on Mill's writings and the principles of Utilitarianism, option D is the most appropriate response to the question.",
