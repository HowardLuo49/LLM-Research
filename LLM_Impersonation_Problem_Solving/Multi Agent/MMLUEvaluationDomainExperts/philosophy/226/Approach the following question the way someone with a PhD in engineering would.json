    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering with a background in ethics and moral philosophy, I would approach this question by carefully considering each option in light of Singer's theory on global ethics and effective altruism. \n\nOption A suggests that one objection to Singer's theory is that it does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own. This objection may stem from critics who believe that Singer's focus on effective altruism and addressing global poverty may neglect important issues within our own borders. However, Singer's argument is not limited to geographical boundaries and emphasizes the moral imperative to alleviate suffering wherever it exists, regardless of location. \n\nOption B suggests that Singer's theory inappropriately makes proximity morally important. This objection may be based on the criticism that Singer's utilitarian approach to ethics may prioritize proximity over other morally relevant factors. However, Singer's argument is rooted in the principle of impartiality and the idea that distance should not be a deciding factor in determining the moral importance of helping others. \n\nOption C suggests that Singer's theory does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers. This objection highlights the tension between Singer's call for impartiality and the more commonly held moral intuition that we have special obligations to those closest to us. However, Singer acknowledges the complexity of human relationships and argues that we can still uphold these special obligations while also recognizing the moral importance of helping strangers in need. \n\nOption D suggests that Singer's theory requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme. This objection may stem from critics who believe that Singer's call for radical altruism and global ethics is too demanding or idealistic. However, Singer's argument is based on the simple idea that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought to do it. This principle of effective altruism does not necessarily require a complete overhaul of our moral framework, but rather a shift in perspective towards a more universal and impartial ethical approach. \n\nIn conclusion, as a PhD in engineering, I would argue that Singer's theory raises important questions about our ethical obligations to alleviate suffering, both locally and globally. While there may be valid objections to Singer's argument, such as those outlined in the options provided, it is crucial to engage with his ideas and consider the ethical implications of our actions in a global context.",
