One objection to Singer\u2019s theory that he considers is that it:\nA: does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own.\nB: inappropriately makes proximity morally important.\nC: does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers.\nD: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer science PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing Singer's theory from a logical and ethical standpoint. \n\nThe objection that Singer considers, which states that his theory does not do enough to address suffering in other countries besides our own, could be viewed as valid from a moral universalism perspective. Singer's argument for effective altruism and the eradication of poverty worldwide could be seen as an extension of moral responsibility beyond national borders. However, it could also be argued that focusing on alleviating suffering where it is most severe or where resources can have the greatest impact is a more pragmatic approach.\n\nIn terms of the objection that proximity is made morally important in Singer's theory, this could be viewed as a criticism from a deontological or virtue ethics perspective. Proximity should not necessarily dictate moral obligations, as all sentient beings should be considered equally deserving of moral consideration. However, pragmatically speaking, proximity can play a role in the effectiveness of aid and resources allocation.\n\nThe objection that Singer's theory does not account for stricter obligations to loved ones than to strangers could be seen as a criticism from a virtue ethics perspective, where personal relationships and duties hold greater moral weight. However, Singer's argument for impartiality and universal moral consideration could be seen as a more utilitarian or consequentialist approach, focusing on maximizing overall well-being rather than individual relationships.\n\nFinally, the objection that Singer's theory requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme could be viewed as a resistance to change or a conservatism in ethical beliefs. However, moral theories and ethical frameworks should evolve and adapt to new challenges and circumstances, and Singer's theory could be seen as a necessary shift towards a more globally inclusive and empathetic moral framework.\n\nIn conclusion, approaching Singer's theory from a PhD level in computer science would involve analyzing the logical consistency, ethical implications, and practical considerations of his arguments, as well as considering objections from various ethical perspectives.",
