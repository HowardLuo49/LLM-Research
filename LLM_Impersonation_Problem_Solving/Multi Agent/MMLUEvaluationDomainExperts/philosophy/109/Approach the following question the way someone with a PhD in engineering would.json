Stevenson's identification of the meaning of a term likely falls within this framework. \n\nOption A is not a comprehensive enough definition for the meaning of a term, as it only focuses on the empirical observations associated with it. Option B, which refers to psychological causes and effects, may be relevant but does not fully encapsulate the meaning of a term. Option D, which suggests that meaning is derived from synonyms, is also not sufficient on its own.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that option C is the most appropriate choice from a semiotic perspective. The meaning of a term is not just limited to its empirical observations or its synonyms, but is also related to the psychological causes and effects it is connected with. This option acknowledges that meaning is influenced by the context and associations of a word, which aligns with the principles of semiotics.",
