    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first defining the terms involved and then evaluating each option using rigorous logic and reasoning.\n\nConsequentialism is an ethical theory that states that the morality of an action is determined by its outcome or consequence. Hedonism, on the other hand, is the belief that pleasure or happiness is the ultimate goal of moral conduct. Universalizability refers to the idea that moral principles should be applicable to all individuals, while prescriptivity suggests that moral judgments should prescribe certain courses of action. \n\nContractualism is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of agreements and contracts in determining moral obligations, while rule-following involves adhering to a set of moral principles or rules. Consistency relates to the idea that moral judgments should be logically consistent and not contradictory, while coherence refers to the harmony and logical connection between different moral judgments.\n\nAfter considering the definitions of these terms, it is clear that option B: universalizability and prescriptivity, best captures the essential features of the logic of moral judgments. This is because universalizability emphasizes the need for moral principles to apply universally, while prescriptivity underscores the prescriptive nature of moral judgments in guiding ethical conduct. Options A, C, and D do not encapsulate the core logical aspects of moral judgment as effectively as option B does.",
