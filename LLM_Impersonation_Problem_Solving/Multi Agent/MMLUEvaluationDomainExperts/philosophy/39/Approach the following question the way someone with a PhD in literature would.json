    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by analyzing the different options presented in terms of their alignment with established theories and frameworks within the field of ethics and moral philosophy. \n\nHare's assertion about the two essential features of the logic of moral judgments can be understood within the context of his influential work on ethical theory, particularly his defense of universal prescriptivism. Universal prescriptivism posits that moral judgments are not just expressions of personal preference or feeling, but are instead universalizable imperatives that apply to all individuals in similar moral situations. \n\nOption A, consequentialism and hedonism, refers to ethical theories that focus on the outcomes or consequences of actions, as well as the pursuit of pleasure or avoidance of pain as the ultimate basis for moral decision-making. While consequentialism and hedonism are relevant to moral judgments, they do not capture the nuanced logic and universalizability inherent in Hare's theory of prescriptivism.\n\nOption B, universalizability and prescriptivity, align closely with Hare's framework of universal prescriptivism. Universalizability refers to the idea that moral principles should be applicable to all individuals in similar circumstances, while prescriptivity emphasizes the normative force of moral judgments as imperatives that prescribe action. These two features capture the essential logic of moral judgments according to Hare's theory.\n\nOption C, contractualism and rule-following, invokes other prominent ethical theories, such as social contract theory and deontological ethics, which emphasize the importance of social agreements or rules in determining moral obligations. While these concepts are relevant to moral philosophy, they do not directly correspond to the key features identified by Hare.\n\nOption D, consistency and coherence, are important qualities in ethical reasoning and moral judgments, but they do not encapsulate Hare's specific criteria for the logic of moral judgments. Consistency and coherence are important for evaluating the soundness of moral arguments, but they do not capture the prescriptive and universalizable nature of moral imperatives as outlined by Hare.\n\nIn conclusion, based on an analysis of the options presented and their alignment with Hare's theories, the most appropriate answer to the question would be B: universalizability and prescriptivity. These two features best capture the essential logic of moral judgments as outlined by Hare in his work on universal prescriptivism.",
