    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by considering the underlying principles of human behavior, compassion, and emotions. In this context, Butler's view suggests that the degree to which one acts compassionately depends on both the strength of his affection of compassion (option A) and the strength of his other affections besides compassion (option B). This aligns with the understanding that human behavior is complex and influenced by a variety of factors, including emotions, values, and personal experiences. Thus, the most appropriate answer based on Butler's perspective would be option C: both a and b.",
