According to Gauthier, the basis of morality is:\nA: maximizing the utility of all sentient beings.\nB: God\u2019s commands.\nC: the agreement of rational persons choosing the terms of their interaction.\nD: the purposive order of nature.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "According to Gauthier, the basis of morality is found in the principles of rationality governing the choices of individuals engaged in cooperative ventures. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual agency and rational deliberation in determining the terms of interaction between moral agents. By prioritizing rational agreement among persons engaged in cooperative endeavors, Gauthier's ethical framework places a strong emphasis on the voluntary nature of moral obligations and the mutually beneficial outcomes that can arise from principled cooperation. This contrasts with other moral theories, such as utilitarianism or divine command theory, which prioritize different factors in determining the basis of moral conduct. Ultimately, Gauthier's emphasis on rational agreement among autonomous agents highlights the importance of individual autonomy and agency in determining the principles that govern moral behavior.",
