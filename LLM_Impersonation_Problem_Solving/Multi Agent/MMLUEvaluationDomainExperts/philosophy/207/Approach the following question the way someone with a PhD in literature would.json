Baier's perspective on moral rules likely hinges on complex philosophical and ethical concepts that require a nuanced understanding.\n\nWhile specific details of Baier's argument may vary, it is likely that she does not take a simplistic or absolute stance on the application of moral rules. Instead, she may argue for a more contextual approach, taking into consideration factors such as differences in individual circumstances and morally relevant distinctions between individuals.\n\nGiven this interpretation, I would argue that the most likely answer is B: moral rules must be applied to everyone alike in the absence of morally relevant differences. This nuanced perspective allows for flexibility and acknowledges the complexity of moral decision-making, reflecting Baier's likely sophisticated understanding of moral philosophy.",
