    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. According to Socrates, just as there is a difference between what an ironic statement says and its true meaning, so also appearances differ from reality.  Even though societies or individuals appear to differ about what is required for the good life, that in no way contradicts the fact that:\nA: what is right or wrong, true or false varies from one culture to another.\nB: appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.\nC: the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth.\nD: there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The statement made by Socrates regarding the distinction between appearances and reality can be interpreted through a variety of philosophical lenses, particularly when considering the implications for ethics and the good life. It is important to note that Socrates believed in the existence of objective principles that govern thought and action, which are necessary for achieving the good life. These principles are not subject to cultural relativism or individual interpretation, as they are grounded in the pursuit of truth and the realization of the ideal form of the good.\n\nIn this context, the correct answer to the question posed would be:\n\nD: there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.\n\nSocrates would argue that despite the apparent differences in societal or individual perspectives on what constitutes the good life, there are universal truths that transcend cultural boundaries and personal beliefs. By engaging in dialectical inquiry and striving to distinguish appearances from reality, one can uncover these objective principles and align their thoughts and actions accordingly. This process of philosophical questioning and self-examination leads to the discovery of truth and the cultivation of virtuous qualities that are essential for living a truly fulfilling and flourishing life.",
