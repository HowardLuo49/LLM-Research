    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. According to Socrates, just as there is a difference between what an ironic statement says and its true meaning, so also appearances differ from reality.  Even though societies or individuals appear to differ about what is required for the good life, that in no way contradicts the fact that:\nA: what is right or wrong, true or false varies from one culture to another.\nB: appearances are the only real way we have for knowing reality.\nC: the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth.\nD: there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "C: the distinction of appearance and reality is the basis for the dialectical discovery of truth. \n\nAs a PhD in engineering, one would approach this question by understanding the importance of critical thinking and logical reasoning in the pursuit of truth and knowledge. Socrates' emphasis on the distinction between appearance and reality aligns with the scientific method, which requires researchers to differentiate between observable phenomena and underlying truths. In the context of engineering, this principle is essential for problem-solving and innovation.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of dialectical discovery of truth resonates with the process of hypothesis testing and experimentation in engineering research. By critically analyzing and questioning appearances, engineers can uncover deeper truths and develop new insights that drive technological advancements.\n\nTherefore, a PhD in engineering would likely choose option C, as it emphasizes the foundational role of distinguishing between appearance and reality in the pursuit of objective truth and principles for the good life.",
