In terms of this definition, we might be able to claim to know something as true which might actually be false, but it is impossible for us really to know something that is false.  Why?\nA: Because to know something that is false is to know no real thing, nothing (i.e., not to know at all).\nB: Because what we know as true is ultimately based on what we claim to know as true.\nC: Because we cannot give a justification or reason for believing in something that is false.\nD: Because in contrast to our knowledge of the unchanging Forms, beliefs about particular objects can change.",
