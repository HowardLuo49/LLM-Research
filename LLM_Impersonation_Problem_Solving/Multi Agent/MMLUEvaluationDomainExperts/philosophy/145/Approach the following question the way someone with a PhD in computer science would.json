    "gpt_response": "In considering Anscombe's assertion, it is important to review her philosophical perspective on moral obligations. Anscombe, a prominent philosopher in the field of ethics, argues that traditional notions of moral obligation have largely been derived from Christian theological frameworks, particularly in Western societies. From her viewpoint, the concept of moral obligations as rooted in divine command theory (option C) is a flawed and inadequate explanation for ethical behavior.\n\nInstead, Anscombe advocates for a return to virtue ethics and Aristotelian moral philosophy, which emphasizes the cultivation of virtuous character and practical wisdom in guiding moral decision-making. In this respect, moral obligations should be understood as arising from within the individual (option B) rather than being externally imposed by societal norms or divine commands. Anscombe's critique of traditional moral frameworks suggests that the concept of moral obligation is not a mere reflection of social norms (option A) but should be grounded in personal reflection, moral reasoning, and cultivation of virtues.\n\nTherefore, according to Anscombe, moral obligation does not have its basis in the commands of God, societal norms, or individual feelings; rather, it is a complex and nuanced concept that requires critical reflection and ethical discernment. In her view, the notion of moral obligation cannot be dismissed as a nonexistent concept (option D) but should be rigorously reexamined and reconstructed in light of contemporary ethical challenges and philosophical insights.",
