    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by considering Rawls' conception of justice through the lens of natural selection and the evolutionary basis of moral intuition. Rawls' notion of justice as fairness is a complex and multifaceted concept that cannot simply be deduced from self-evident premises or based solely on moral intuition. Instead, his theory suggests that a conception of justice should be justified through the mutual support of many considerations, which can fit into one coherent view.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, we can see how the idea of justice and fairness can be related to the evolutionary advantages of cooperation and reciprocity in social species. Rawls' emphasis on the principles of justice being mutually acceptable to all individuals in a society can be seen as aligning with the concept of inclusive fitness and the benefits of cooperation for the survival and reproduction of individuals within a population.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that Rawls' approach to justifying a conception of justice aligns more closely with option C: the mutual support of many considerations, which it fits into one coherent view. This approach is consistent with the interdisciplinary nature of biology and the understanding of complex systems and interactions that underlie the evolution of social behavior and moral values.",
