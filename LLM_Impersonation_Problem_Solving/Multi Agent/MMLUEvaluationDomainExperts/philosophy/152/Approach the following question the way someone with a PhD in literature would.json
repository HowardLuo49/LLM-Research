    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is imperative to approach Rawls' claims with a critical and analytical perspective. Rawls, a prominent figure in political philosophy, posited the concept of justice as fairness and argued that a conception of justice should be justified by the mutual support of many considerations, which fit into one coherent view. This aligns with his broader framework of justice as fairness, which seeks to establish principles of justice that are reflective of overlapping consensus in a pluralistic society.\n\nIn contrast to the other options presented, Rawls' argument does not support deducing justice from self-evident premises or relying on direct moral intuition. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of constructing a coherent and comprehensive framework of justice that draws upon a multitude of considerations and perspectives.\n\nUltimately, Rawls' approach to the justification of a conception of justice reflects a sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the complexity of moral and political philosophy. By engaging with a wide range of considerations and weaving them into a cohesive whole, Rawls highlights the importance of a rigorous and inclusive approach to the pursuit of justice in society.",
