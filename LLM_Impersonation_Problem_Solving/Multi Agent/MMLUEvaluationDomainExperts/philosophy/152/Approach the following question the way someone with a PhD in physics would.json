This approach aligns with the principles of coherence and consistency often valued in scientific reasoning.\n\nWhile A and B may have roles in the development of ethical theories, they may not provide a robust and comprehensive justification for a conception of justice. Deducting a conception of justice from self-evident premises may overlook the complexities and nuances of ethical dilemmas, while relying solely on moral intuition may be too subjective and open to bias.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that the most valid option is C: the mutual support of many considerations, which fit into one coherent view. This approach allows for a more holistic and nuanced understanding of justice, incorporating various perspectives and ethical principles to form a comprehensive and justifiable conception of justice.",
