    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with expertise in literature, I would approach this question by drawing on various philosophical and ethical theories that have been explored in literary texts. The concept of a morally impossible rule can be seen as a form of ethical dilemma, where conflicting moral principles are at play. \n\nIn this context, option A presents a situation where individuals are faced with the choice of lying in order to prevent a catastrophe, thus raising questions about the consequences of deception and the moral imperative to tell the truth. This dilemma is reminiscent of the ethical debates surrounding consequentialism and deontology, as explored in works such as Immanuel Kant's \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\" and John Stuart Mill's \"Utilitarianism.\"\n\nOption B, on the other hand, aligns with utilitarian ethics which prioritizes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. While this rule may seem ideal in theory, it can be problematic in practice as it may require individuals to make morally questionable decisions for the greater good, as depicted in literary works like George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" or Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World.\"\n\nLastly, option C raises concerns about truthfulness and authenticity, highlighting the conflict between sincerity and deceit. This scenario can be examined through the lens of virtue ethics, particularly the concept of honesty and integrity, as explored in classic texts such as Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\" and Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of a morally impossible rule presented in the question reflects the complex ethical dilemmas that individuals may face in literature and in real life. By considering the implications of each option in relation to various ethical frameworks, one can gain a deeper understanding of the nuanced moral issues at play.",
