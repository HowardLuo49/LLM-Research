    "gpt_response": "A Ph.D. in mathematics would approach this question by emphasizing the importance of rigorously analyzing the decision-making process using mathematical and probabilistic techniques. Option A aligns with this approach, as calculating the expected consequences of actions involves using mathematical models to determine the most beneficial course of action. Options B, C, and D do not involve the same level of mathematical analysis and would likely be viewed as less reliable methods for decision-making by a mathematician.",
