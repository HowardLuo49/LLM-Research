    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by drawing on my understanding of the philosophical and ethical theories surrounding the actions of individuals. In this context, John Stuart Mill's ethical theory of utilitarianism is particularly relevant.\n\nMill argues that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences, specifically the amount of happiness or pleasure it produces for the greatest number of individuals. Utilitarianism is centered around the principle of utility, which suggests that actions should be judged based on their ability to promote overall well-being.\n\nTherefore, Mill's perspective aligns most closely with option B: we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility. This implies that individuals should make decisions based on what will lead to the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people, rather than relying on tradition or scripture.\n\nIn conclusion, a scholar with a PhD in literature would likely select option B as the most appropriate answer in relation to Mill's ethical framework.",
