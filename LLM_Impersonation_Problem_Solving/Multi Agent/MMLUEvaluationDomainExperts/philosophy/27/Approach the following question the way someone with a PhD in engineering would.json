    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. According to Socrates, an unexamined life is not worth living; and it certainly could not be a virtuous life.  Why not?\nA: Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.\nB: Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.\nC: Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.\nD: Because a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own.",

    "gpt_response": "C: Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.\n\nAs an individual with a PhD in engineering, it is clear that Socrates believed in the importance of self-reflection and critical examination of one's own actions. In the context of engineering, this concept can be applied to problem-solving and decision-making processes. Without evaluating the rationale behind our actions, we may not fully understand the consequences or implications of our choices. In the engineering field, this could lead to failed projects, unsafe designs, or inefficient solutions.\n\nFurthermore, in engineering, we often rely on scientific principles and evidence-based reasoning to guide our decisions. Similarly, in living a virtuous life, it is essential to have a deep understanding of moral principles and ethical reasoning. Without this examination and understanding, one may inadvertently act in ways that are not morally justifiable or virtuous.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that an unexamined life is not worth living because without critical examination and understanding of the rationale behind our actions, we cannot truly live a virtuous life.",
