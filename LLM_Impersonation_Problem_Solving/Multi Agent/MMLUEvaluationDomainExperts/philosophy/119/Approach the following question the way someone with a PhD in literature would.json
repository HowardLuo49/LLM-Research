    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by considering Kant's philosophical beliefs and the context in which he formulated his ethical theories. Kant, a prominent Enlightenment philosopher, posited that the moral law is given to each person by their own rational will, independent of external influences such as society, God, or nature.\n\nIn his seminal work, \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals,\" Kant argues that moral truths are founded on reason and can be derived through the exercise of practical reason. He famously articulates the categorical imperative, which acts as a universal principle for moral decision-making. According to Kant, individuals possess inherent moral autonomy and are capable of determining their own moral duties through rational reflection.\n\nTherefore, in response to the question posed, the correct answer would be B: one's own will. This aligns with Kant's belief in the primacy of individual autonomy and rational agency in the formulation of moral principles. The other options (society, God, and Nature) are not seen by Kant as the ultimate sources of the moral law, but rather as external factors that may influence one's moral reasoning but do not dictate one's ethical obligations.",
