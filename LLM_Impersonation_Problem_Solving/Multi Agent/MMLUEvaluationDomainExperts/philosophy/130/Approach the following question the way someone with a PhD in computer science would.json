    "gpt_response": "Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, would argue that a virtuous man should aim to have a sense of inner tranquility and equanimity in the face of life's adversities. Therefore, the correct answer according to his teachings would be C: undisturbed. Stoicism emphasizes the importance of maintaining control over one's emotions and responses to external events, advocating for a mindset of acceptance and resilience in the face of inevitable hardships. This philosophical perspective encourages individuals to focus on what is within their control (i.e., their own thoughts and actions) rather than being consumed by external circumstances beyond their influence. Thus, in the event of the loss of loved ones, a virtuous man should strive to maintain a sense of composure and acceptance, rather than allowing himself to be overwhelmed by grief or envy.",
