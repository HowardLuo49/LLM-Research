    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. For Plato, ordinary sensible objects exist and are knowable as examples or instances of Ideas or \"Forms\" that do not exist in our ordinary sensible world.  Forms do not exist in the sensible world because:\nA: in the sensible world only mathematical objects (e.g., triangles) can be known using hypotheses which are recollected when we are asked the right kinds of questions.\nB: unlike everything in the sensible world, Forms are not individual things but rather the universal essences or natures by which individual things are what they are and are known.\nC: nothing in the sensible, experienced world could exist or be identified as one particular thing or another unless there were a \"Sensible World\" Form (like the Form of beauty or justice).\nD: the sensible world consists of changing Forms that exist and are known in terms of other changing Forms, which in turn exist and are known in terms of yet others in an endless regress.",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a logical and analytical standpoint. From the options given, the most suitable answer would be option B: unlike everything in the sensible world, Forms are not individual things but rather the universal essences or natures by which individual things are what they are and are known.\n\nThis answer aligns with Plato's theory of Forms, which posits that the material world we perceive is merely a reflection or imperfect representation of the true Forms or universal essences. These Forms are not physical entities existing in the sensible world but rather abstract, unchanging concepts that define the nature of reality.\n\nBy understanding and recognizing these Forms, we are able to comprehend the essence of individual things in the sensible world. This concept is essential in Plato's epistemology, as it asserts that true knowledge comes from grasping the Forms rather than just experiencing the physical world.\n\nTherefore, a PhD in engineering would likely choose option B as the explanation for why Forms do not exist in the sensible world, based on a deep understanding of Plato's philosophical principles and logical reasoning.",
