Deliberative justification refers to decisions being justified through the process of careful reflection, reasoning, and weighing of options. Epistemic justification is the justification of beliefs and decisions based on evidence, knowledge, and epistemic principles.\n\nThe assertion that practical rationality can only be one of these forms of justification suggests a position on the foundational principles that guide rational decision-making processes. It may reflect a particular philosophical stance on the relationship between morals, reasoning, knowledge, and rationality.\n\nAs a researcher with a PhD in computer science, I would approach Gauthier's claim by analyzing the underlying assumptions, arguments, and implications involved in each form of justification and evaluate how they contribute to our understanding of practical rationality. I would consider how these different forms of justification intersect and inform one another, and how they shape our reasoning and decision-making processes in practical contexts. Ultimately, I would engage in a critical examination of Gauthier's claim from a philosophical and computational perspective to further elucidate the nature of practical rationality and its relation to various forms of justification.",
