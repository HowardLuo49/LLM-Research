    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Philosophy is concerned primarily with identifying beliefs about human existence and evaluating arguments that support those beliefs.  These activities can be summarized in two questions that drive philosophical investigations:\nA: why should we bother? and what are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?\nB: what do you mean? and how do you know?\nC: who really believes X? and how can we explain differences in people's beliefs?\nD: how do philosophers argue? and are their differences important?",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a practitioner of mathematics, I would approach philosophical questions with a methodical and logical mindset. In addressing the questions posed, I would first consider the importance of engaging in philosophical inquiries by assessing the implications and significance of the beliefs under consideration. This would involve analyzing the potential consequences of holding a particular belief or argument over another and understanding the underlying motivations for engaging in philosophical discourse.\n\nFurthermore, I would seek clarity and precision in defining the terms and concepts being discussed by probing deeper into the meanings behind statements and propositions. This would involve asking for clarification on the intended meanings of assertions and questioning the validity of the reasoning behind them. By critically examining the language and logic used in philosophical arguments, I could better grasp the underlying premises and assumptions guiding the beliefs being evaluated.\n\nIn addition, I would explore the diversity of beliefs held by individuals and investigate the reasons behind these differences. This could involve examining the societal, cultural, and psychological factors that influence people's perspectives and convictions. By analyzing the various sources of disagreement and variation in beliefs, I could gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances involved in philosophical debates.\n\nLastly, I would investigate the methodologies and styles of argumentation employed by philosophers to evaluate their differences and assess their importance. This would involve analyzing the reasoning, evidence, and logic used in philosophical reasoning to determine the effectiveness and validity of various approaches. By examining the techniques and strategies employed by philosophers, I could better appreciate the diversity and richness of philosophical thought and its implications for human understanding and knowledge.",
