    "gpt_response": "To Kant, making a lying promise would be wrong because it violates the categorical imperative, specifically the principle of universalizability. Kant argues that one must act according to maxims that can be consistently willed as universal laws. In the case of making a lying promise, one cannot rationally will that everyone should make lying promises, as this would undermine the foundation of trust necessary for social cohesion. Additionally, Kant believed in the inherent worth of rational beings, and lying to someone would treat them as a means to an end rather than as an end in themselves. Ultimately, Kant's moral philosophy is grounded in the idea of treating others with respect and dignity, and making a lying promise would be a violation of this fundamental principle.",
