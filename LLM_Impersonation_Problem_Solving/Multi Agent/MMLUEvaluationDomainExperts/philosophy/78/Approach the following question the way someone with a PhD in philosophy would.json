According to Hume, justice:\nA: has no value.\nB: has value in part because it is useful to society.\nC: has value solely because it is useful to society.\nD: has value solely because it is useful to the agent.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In considering Hume's perspective on the concept of justice, it is crucial to delve into his empiricist philosophy and general understanding of human nature. Hume posits that our moral sentiments and judgements are ultimately rooted in our passions and emotions, rather than in reason or divine authority. As such, he rejects any innate or objective moral principles and instead emphasizes the importance of considering the utility and practical consequences of moral rules and principles.\n\nWithin this framework, Hume argues that justice does indeed hold value, but this value derives primarily from its utility to society as a whole. In other words, the principles of justice serve as a social contract that fosters cooperation, stability, and mutual benefit among individuals. By upholding rules of fairness, equality, and respect for property rights, society can function smoothly and harmoniously, leading to the overall well-being of its members.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that according to Hume, justice has value in part because it is useful to society. While individuals may also derive personal benefits from adhering to principles of justice, such as protecting their own interests and avoiding negative repercussions, the ultimate justification for these principles lies in their positive impact on the collective welfare of the community.",
