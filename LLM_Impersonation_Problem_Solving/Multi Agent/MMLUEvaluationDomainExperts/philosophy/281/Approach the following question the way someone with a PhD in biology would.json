    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, we can consider W.D. Ross's explanation of prima facie duties within the context of evolutionary biology. Ross's analogy with our emotions could be understood to reflect the idea that certain moral principles may have been shaped by our evolutionary history. Just as certain emotions, such as fear or love, have evolved because they helped our ancestors survive and reproduce, certain moral intuitions or obligations may be rooted in our evolutionary past.\n\nIn this analogy, our emotions serve as a guide or instinctual response to certain situations, much like how prima facie duties serve as moral guidelines that we are obligated to follow unless overridden by another duty. This perspective implies that our sense of moral obligation, like our emotions, may have been honed through natural selection to promote cooperation and social cohesion within human societies.\n\nTherefore, from a biological angle, Ross's analogy with our emotions can be seen as highlighting the deep evolutionary roots of our moral intuitions and suggesting that our sense of duty may be influenced by our biological heritage.",
