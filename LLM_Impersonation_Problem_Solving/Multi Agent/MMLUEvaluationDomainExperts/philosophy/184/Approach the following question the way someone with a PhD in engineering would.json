Schopenhauer's attitude toward life can be best captured by option C: He thought life was bereft of meaning. This perspective is drawn from his concept of the \"will to live\" as the driving force behind human actions, which he believed was fundamentally futile and unsatisfactory. Schopenhauer's pessimistic view of life as marked by suffering, desire, and ultimately devoid of inherent meaning distinguishes his philosophy from more optimistic perspectives.",
