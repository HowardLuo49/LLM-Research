    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by examining Schopenhauer's philosophical works, particularly his seminal work \"The World as Will and Representation.\" In this work, Schopenhauer espouses a pessimistic view of life, positing that the world is fundamentally governed by a blind, irrational force called the Will. This Will drives all human desires and actions, leading to suffering and ultimately futility.\n\nSchopenhauer believed that life was characterized by constant striving, pain, and dissatisfaction. He famously likened life to a continual cycle of desire, struggle, and suffering. He did not believe in an afterlife or in any inherent meaning to life. Instead, he believed that the only escape from the suffering of existence was through aesthetic contemplation, detachment from worldly desires, and a renunciation of the Will.\n\nBased on these philosophical ideas, it is clear that Schopenhauer's attitude toward life was best characterized by option C: He thought life was bereft of meaning. This perspective aligns with his deterministic worldview and his belief in the inherent futility and suffering of human existence.",
