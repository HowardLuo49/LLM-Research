According to Ross, we should construct a moral theory by:\nA: constructing logical proofs for moral principles.\nB: consulting social conventions.\nC: reflecting on what we really think.\nD: consulting scripture.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "According to Ross, constructing a moral theory should involve a combination of all of the options listed. However, as a computer scientist, it is important to prioritize constructing logical proofs for moral principles. This involves using deductive reasoning and rigorous analysis to establish the soundness of moral principles. Consulting social conventions can also provide valuable insights into societal norms and expectations, which can inform the development of a moral theory. Reflecting on what we really think allows for introspection and critical self-analysis, which is crucial for aligning personal beliefs with moral principles. While consulting scripture may be important for individuals who follow religious beliefs, it may not be universally applicable in constructing a moral theory. In summary, constructing a moral theory should involve a systematic and logical approach, taking into account multiple sources of input including social conventions, personal reflections, and potentially scripture.",
