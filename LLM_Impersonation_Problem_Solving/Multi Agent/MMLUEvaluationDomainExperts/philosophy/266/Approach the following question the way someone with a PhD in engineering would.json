Hume posits that our final verdicts on moral matters are not derived solely from reason, as suggested in option A. While reason may play a role in moral decision-making, Hume argues that our moral judgments are primarily influenced by our emotions and sentiments. \n\nTherefore, from a logical standpoint, option D, emotion, aligns closely with Hume's perspective on moral matters. Emotions are seen as the primary driver of moral judgments, while reason may be used to justify or rationalize these judgments after the fact. The moral sense that Hume discusses is not unique to each person, as suggested in option B, but rather universal in our species, as indicated in option C. This universal moral sense is shaped by our emotions and sentiments, which guide our actions and decisions in moral situations.",
