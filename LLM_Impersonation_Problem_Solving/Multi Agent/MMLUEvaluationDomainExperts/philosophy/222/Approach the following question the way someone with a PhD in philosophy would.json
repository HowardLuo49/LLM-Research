    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by first examining the concept of prima facie duties as outlined by W.D. Ross. Prima facie duties are moral obligations that we have a duty to fulfill in a given situation, but they can be overridden by other more pressing duties in certain circumstances.\n\nNext, I would analyze each of the options presented - fidelity, beneficence, non-maleficence, and legality - in relation to Ross's list of prima facie duties. Fidelity is the duty to keep promises and honor commitments, beneficence is the duty to do good and promote the well-being of others, non-maleficence is the duty to avoid causing harm to others, and legality is the duty to follow the law.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would determine that the option \"legality\" is not one of Ross's prima facie duties. While legality is an important consideration in ethical decision-making, it is not specifically listed as one of Ross's prima facie duties, which focus more on moral principles such as fidelity, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Therefore, I would confidently choose option D as the correct answer.",
