    "gpt_response": "A PhD in computer science might approach this question by analyzing it from a logical and analytical perspective. They would likely note that Socrates was a philosopher and his thoughts on justice were deeply rooted in his philosophy and worldview. In this context, the correct answer would be B: rational part. Socrates believed that justice was achieved when each part of the soul performed its function in harmony with the others, with the rational part of the soul ruling over the appetitive and spirited parts. This aligns with the concept of reason and logic which is typically associated with the rational part of the soul. Therefore, a computer scientist with a PhD would likely select answer B as the most accurate representation of Socrates' views on justice.",
