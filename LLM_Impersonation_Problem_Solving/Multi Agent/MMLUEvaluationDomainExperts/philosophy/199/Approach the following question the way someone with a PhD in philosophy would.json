    "gpt_response": "In considering the question of justice as posited by Socrates, it is essential to dive into the deep philosophical underpinnings of his theory. Socrates believed that justice is intimately tied to the harmony and order within the soul of an individual. In this framework, justice is when a soul is ruled by its rational part, as opposed to being swayed by base desires or external pressures.\n\nSocrates argued that the rational part of the soul is the highest element, capable of understanding universal truths and guiding the individual towards wisdom and virtue. When the rational part governs the soul, it ensures that all other aspects, such as emotions and desires, are in alignment with the principles of reason and virtue. This leads to a state of inner harmony and balance, which Socrates deemed to be the essence of justice.\n\nTherefore, according to Socrates, the correct answer to the question is B: rational part. Justice is achieved when the rational part of the soul exercises control and guides the individual towards living a virtuous and harmonious life.",
