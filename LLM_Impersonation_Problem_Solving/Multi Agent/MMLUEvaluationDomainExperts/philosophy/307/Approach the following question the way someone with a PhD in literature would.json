    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would.  For Socrates, the belief that \"virtue is knowledge\" is related to his claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living,\" because he believes that:\nA: the unexamined life is one in which we live day to day without asking questions about who we are and why we are here in the first place.\nB: the Delphic oracle identified Socrates as the wisest person on earth because he claimed to know nothing.\nC: by questioning traditional beliefs, we learn to recognize how some answers seem to be more satisfactory than others.\nD: the only way to be a good or worthwhile person is to know how human beings should behave based on universal norms or values.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Socrates' belief that \"virtue is knowledge\" is intricately tied to his assertion that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" due to his conviction that true virtue and goodness can only be achieved through self-examination and introspection. This is because, according to Socrates, genuine virtue is not simply a matter of following societal norms or adhering to external values, but rather it involves a deep understanding and awareness of oneself and the world.\n\nSocrates posits that by engaging in critical self-reflection and questioning our beliefs and assumptions, we are able to uncover the true nature of virtue and morality. Through this process of examination, we are able to discern between superficial or socially constructed values and those that are rooted in genuine knowledge and understanding. In essence, Socrates suggests that it is only through seeking and acquiring knowledge that we can truly lead a virtuous and fulfilling life.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer choice would be:\nC: by questioning traditional beliefs, we learn to recognize how some answers seem to be more satisfactory than others.",
