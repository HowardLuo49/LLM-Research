    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would.  For Socrates, the belief that \"virtue is knowledge\" is related to his claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living,\" because he believes that:\nA: the unexamined life is one in which we live day to day without asking questions about who we are and why we are here in the first place.\nB: the Delphic oracle identified Socrates as the wisest person on earth because he claimed to know nothing.\nC: by questioning traditional beliefs, we learn to recognize how some answers seem to be more satisfactory than others.\nD: the only way to be a good or worthwhile person is to know how human beings should behave based on universal norms or values.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Socrates' belief that \"virtue is knowledge\" is closely tied to his assertion that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" due to his conviction that by critically examining one's values, beliefs, and actions, one can attain a deeper understanding of the nature of virtue and lead a more fulfilling and morally upright existence. This process of self-examination involves questioning traditional beliefs and critically evaluating one's own assumptions, leading to the recognition that some answers may be more intellectually satisfying or morally compelling than others. Therefore, Socrates would likely argue that option C, by questioning traditional beliefs, we learn to recognize how some answers seem to be more satisfactory than others, aligns most closely with his philosophical perspective on the relationship between virtue, knowledge, and the examined life.",
