    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by critically analyzing the works and theories of Thomas Hobbes, a key figure in political philosophy. Hobbes believed in the concept of a social contract, whereby individuals in a society willingly give up certain freedoms and submit to the authority of a sovereign in exchange for protection and security. Therefore, according to Hobbes, the definition of injustice would likely be closely related to the violation of this social contract and disobedience to a sovereign, such as option A: disobedience to a sovereign. Hobbes believed that without a strong central authority to enforce order, individuals would be in a state of nature characterized by chaos and conflict, highlighting the importance of obeying the laws and authority of the sovereign.",
