    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach Augustine's claim regarding Academic skepticism through the lens of scientific inquiry and critical thinking. Academic skepticism is a philosophical position that doubts the possibility of attaining true knowledge, asserting that all beliefs are uncertain and potentially false. \n\nIn the context of biology, Academic skepticism can be seen as a challenge to the validity and certainty of scientific knowledge. While scientific theories and hypotheses are supported by empirical evidence and undergo rigorous testing, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of our understanding and the potential for new evidence to challenge existing beliefs.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of academic skepticism, it is reasonable to argue that while scientific knowledge is valuable and provides us with a framework for understanding the natural world, it is not free from doubt and should be subject to constant scrutiny and revision. In this sense, Academic skepticism can be seen as both true in its recognition of the limitations of human knowledge, and unprovable in the sense that certainty is always elusive in science. \n\nTherefore, I would argue that Augustine's claim that Academic skepticism is true, but cannot be proven, is the most accurate interpretation from a biological perspective.",
