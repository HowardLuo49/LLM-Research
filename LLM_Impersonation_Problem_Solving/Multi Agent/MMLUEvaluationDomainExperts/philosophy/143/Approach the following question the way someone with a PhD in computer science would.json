A PhD in computer science would likely approach this question by analyzing the concept of comparing the magnitude of pains in a logical and systematic manner.\n\nIn this context, Parfit's claim can be interpreted as questioning the feasibility and accuracy of comparing the intensity or severity of different pains. From a computational perspective, the ability to precisely compare the magnitude of pains would require a standardized and quantifiable measure of pain, which may not exist in practice. Additionally, individual subjective experiences of pain can vary greatly, making it difficult to establish a universal scale for comparison.\n\nBased on this line of reasoning, a PhD in computer science may argue that while it may be possible to make rough comparisons of the magnitude of pains based on observable factors such as physiological responses or behavioral indicators, there are inherent limitations to the precision and validity of such comparisons. Furthermore, the complexities of individual perceptions and experiences of pain may render comparisons within or between individuals inherently subjective and context-dependent.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible interpretation of Parfit's claim, based on a rigorous computational analysis, would be that the magnitude of pains can be compared, but only roughly (option B).
