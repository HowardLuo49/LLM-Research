    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In his seminal work \"Reasons and Persons,\" Derek Parfit argues that the magnitude of pains can be effectively compared, but only approximately. Parfit asserts that while it may be challenging to make precise comparisons of pain intensity between individuals due to variations in personal experiences and subjective perceptions, it is still possible to make useful and meaningful comparative assessments within the context of an individual's own lived experiences. This nuanced understanding highlights the complex nature of pain and the difficulties inherent in trying to measure and compare such subjective experiences across different individuals. Thus, Parfit's position aligns most closely with option B: the magnitude of pains can be compared, but only roughly.",
