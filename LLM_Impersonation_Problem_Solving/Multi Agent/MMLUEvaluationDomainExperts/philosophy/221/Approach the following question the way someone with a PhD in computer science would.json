    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question from a historical and philosophical perspective rather than a purely literary one. Tolstoy's crisis of meaning, also known as his spiritual crisis, occurred in the 1870s and 1880s. This crisis led him to question the purpose and meaning of life, as well as his own existence.\n\nAfter undergoing this crisis, Tolstoy experienced a profound transformation in his beliefs and lifestyle. He became increasingly drawn to the teachings of Christianity, particularly the moral and ethical principles of Jesus Christ. This newfound religious fervor culminated in Tolstoy renouncing his wealth, status, and worldly possessions in search of a more spiritual and simplistic way of living.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome of Tolstoy's crisis of meaning, based on historical accounts and biographical information, is that he became religious (option C). While it is true that Tolstoy's income did increase after the success of his literary works, this financial prosperity did not have as significant of an impact on his life as his newfound religious beliefs. Additionally, Tolstoy did not become an agnostic as he continued to embrace a belief in a higher power and the teachings of Christianity.",
