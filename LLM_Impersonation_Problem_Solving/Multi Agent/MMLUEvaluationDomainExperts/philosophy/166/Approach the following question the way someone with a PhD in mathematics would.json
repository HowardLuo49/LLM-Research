    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first acknowledging the foundational role of utilitarian calculations in ethical decision-making, as proposed by philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Utilitarian calculations involve evaluating the potential outcomes of different actions based on the overall utility or happiness they will produce for individuals affected by those actions.\n\nGiven this understanding, I would argue that Bentham's claim that utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action (Option A) is too restrictive. While it is important to consider utilitarian principles in decision-making, it may not always be practical or feasible to perform detailed calculations before every action. In some situations, quick decisions may need to be made based on intuition, experience, or other factors.\n\nIn light of this, I would lean towards Option B \u2013 that utilitarian calculations need not be performed before each action, but should always be kept in mind. By maintaining awareness of utilitarian principles and considering them in a more general sense, individuals can still strive to make ethical decisions that promote the greatest overall happiness.\n\nI would also refute Option C, which claims that utilitarian calculations are merely a formal device with no practical application. Utilitarianism has been a prominent ethical theory for centuries and is widely used in various fields, including philosophy, economics, and public policy, to guide decision-making and promote social welfare.\n\nFinally, I would be cautious in accepting Option D, which suggests that utilitarian calculations are fundamentally flawed. While utilitarianism has its critics and limitations, such as challenges in measuring and comparing the utility of different actions, it remains a valuable tool for promoting ethical decision-making and societal well-being. As a mathematician, I would be inclined to engage in further analysis and debate to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of utilitarianism in different contexts.",
