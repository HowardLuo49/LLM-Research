In computer science, concepts such as \"good\" can be defined through the development of algorithms and computational models that allow for precise and consistent definitions. While concepts like \"yellow\" and \"horse\" may also be defined in certain contexts, the ability to define a concept ultimately depends on the underlying framework and methodology being used. Therefore, from a computer science perspective, the concept of \"good\" can be defined according to Moore.",
