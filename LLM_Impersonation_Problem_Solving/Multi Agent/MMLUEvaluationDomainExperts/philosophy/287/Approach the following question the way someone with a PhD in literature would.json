    "gpt_response": "In considering the question of which ethical framework most closely aligns with John Stuart Mill's views, it is necessary to delve into the complexities and nuances of his moral philosophy. Mill is best known for his utilitarian perspective, which asserts that actions are morally right to the extent that they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Within the realm of utilitarianism, there are different interpretations and variations, including act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism.\n\nAct-utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of individual actions, where the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by its ability to produce the greatest overall happiness. In contrast, rule-utilitarianism emphasizes the importance of following moral rules or principles that have been shown to lead to the greatest happiness when consistently applied. \n\nBrandt, a renowned scholar in the field of ethics, has argued that John Stuart Mill's ethical views align more closely with rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules rather than act-utilitarianism. This interpretation suggests that Mill believed in the importance of adhering to general moral rules that, when followed, lead to the greatest overall well-being for society as a whole.\n\nIn comparing Mill's position to other ethical frameworks, such as Kant's deontological ethics, it becomes evident that there are key differences in their underlying principles and justifications for moral behavior. Kantian ethics, based on the categorical imperative, holds that actions are morally right if they can be universally applied and do not treat individuals as mere means to an end.\n\nTherefore, in light of Brandt's analysis and the inherent principles of Mill's utilitarian perspective, it can be concluded that Mill's view most closely resembles a form of rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules.",
