    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by analyzing the specific aspects of John Stuart Mill's utilitarian philosophy and comparing them to the options presented. \n\nJohn Stuart Mill is known for his theory of act-utilitarianism, which advocates for individuals to make decisions based on the greatest amount of overall happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. This aligns with option A, act-utilitarianism.\n\nWhile Mill's approach emphasizes the importance of following rules that promote overall happiness, it is not entirely focused on following existing societal rules as in option B. Instead, Mill's form of utilitarianism is more concerned with maximizing utility and happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\nOption C, a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules, may also be considered as Mill often discussed the importance of following rules that lead to the greatest overall happiness. However, Mill's perspective is more focused on the consequences of actions rather than following strict moral rules.\n\nLastly, option D, Kant's ethics, is a deontological ethical theory that emphasizes the importance of following moral duties and principles regardless of the consequences. This contrasts with Mill's utilitarianism, which prioritizes the consequences of actions in determining their morality.\n\nUltimately, based on the comparison of Mill's utilitarian philosophy with the options presented, it can be concluded that John Stuart Mill's view most closely resembles act-utilitarianism, option A.",
