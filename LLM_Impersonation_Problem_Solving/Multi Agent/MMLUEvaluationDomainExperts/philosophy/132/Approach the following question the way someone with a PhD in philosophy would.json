When considering the broader implications of Hobbes' philosophical framework, it becomes apparent that he is referring to a range of animal behaviors, including both involuntary and voluntary actions.\n\nHobbes' understanding of animal motion encompasses a comprehensive view of the various behaviors exhibited by animals. This includes not only involuntary operations like heartbeat and breathing, which are essential for sustaining life, but also instinctive behaviors such as nursing young, which are driven by biological imperatives. Additionally, Hobbes recognizes the presence of irrational behaviors in animals, which may not be guided by conscious rational thought but are nevertheless critical for survival.\n\nTherefore, it would be erroneous to limit Hobbes' concept of animal motion to only voluntary behaviors.
