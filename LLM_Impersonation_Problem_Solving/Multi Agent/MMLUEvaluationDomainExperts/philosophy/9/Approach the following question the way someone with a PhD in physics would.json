According to Kant, morality requires us to:\nA: perform the action that leads to the greatest total happiness.\nB: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.\nC: behave only in such a way as a perfectly virtuous person would behave.\nD: place the interests of others above the interests of ourselves.",

    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first understanding Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, which is grounded in the concept of the categorical imperative. Kant argues that morality requires us to act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws, which aligns with option B. This means that moral actions are those that can be universally applied without contradiction. Kant's approach emphasizes the importance of rationality and consistency in moral decision-making, rather than basing morality on subjective desires or outcomes such as total happiness (option A) or personal virtues (option C). Additionally, while Kant does emphasize the importance of treating others as ends in themselves rather than merely as means to an end, this does not necessarily mean placing the interests of others above ourselves in all situations (option D). In summary, the correct answer according to Kant's moral philosophy is B: act only on maxims that we can will to become universal laws.",
