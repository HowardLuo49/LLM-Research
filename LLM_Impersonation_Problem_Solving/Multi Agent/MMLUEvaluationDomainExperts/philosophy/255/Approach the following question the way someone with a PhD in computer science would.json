In Brandt\u2019s terminology, a moral code has currency in a society only if:\nA: a high proportion of the adults in the society subscribe to its principles.\nB: it is recognized as the moral code of the society.\nC: both a and b.\nD: neither a nor b.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "From a theoretical perspective, Brandt's framework for evaluating the currency of a moral code hinges on two key factors: the level of adherence to its principles within a society and the societal recognition of it as the prevailing moral code. \n\nIn order for a moral code to have currency in a society, it is crucial that a high proportion of the adults in that society subscribe to its principles. This is because the widespread acceptance and internalization of a moral code by individuals within a society is indicative of its perceived legitimacy and authority. Without a significant number of individuals adhering to the moral code, its influence and relevance within the societal context would be limited.\n\nFurthermore, for a moral code to truly have currency in a society, it must be recognized as the prevailing moral code by the larger societal framework. This recognition serves to validate the moral code and solidify its status as the normative standard for ethical behavior within the society. \n\nTherefore, in accordance with Brandt's framework, a moral code has currency in a society only if both a high proportion of the adults in the society subscribe to its principles (Option A) and it is recognized as the moral code of the society (Option B). Thus, the correct answer would be Option C: both a and b.",
