    "gpt_response": "From a biological perspective, the propagation and adherence to a moral code within a society can be understood as a form of social behavior and cultural evolution. In Brandt's terminology, the currency of a moral code in a society would likely depend on both the proportion of individuals subscribing to its principles (option a) and its recognition as the prevailing moral code of that society (option b).\n\nThe high proportion of adults subscribing to the principles of a moral code is indicative of the level of social conformity and adherence to shared values within the population. This adherence is crucial for the maintenance and enforcement of the moral code within the society, as it reflects the degree to which individuals are willing to adopt and uphold these principles in their behavior and interactions.\n\nAt the same time, the recognition of the moral code as the prevailing one in the society is essential for its acceptance and legitimacy among the population. This recognition signifies the collective acknowledgment and endorsement of the moral code as a guiding set of principles for social interactions and decision-making.\n\nTherefore, from a biological standpoint, both the high proportion of individuals subscribing to the principles of a moral code and its recognition as the prevailing moral code of the society are likely to be important factors influencing the currency of the moral code in that society.
