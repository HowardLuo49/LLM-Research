    "gpt_response": "In addressing this question, we must consider the foundational framework of John Rawls' theory of justice as outlined in his seminal work \"A Theory of Justice.\" Rawls posits a two-part theory that includes the principles of justice as fairness and the original position. According to Rawls, these two parts are interdependent in that they mutually support and inform one another.\n\nThe principle of justice as fairness entails a conception of justice that is rooted in the idea of fairness and the social contract. This principle is articulated through Rawls' famous thought experiment, the original position. In this hypothetical scenario, individuals are behind a veil of ignorance, unaware of their own circumstances, and make decisions about justice from a position of equality and impartiality.\n\nThe original position serves as a coherent foundation for the principles of justice as fairness, providing a rational basis for determining principles of justice that are fair and equitable. It is through this interplay between the two parts of Rawls' theory that a comprehensive and internally consistent theory of justice is constructed.\n\nTherefore, it can be argued that Rawls' two-part theory is indeed interdependent, as each part relies on the other for coherence and justification. To accept one part without the other would disrupt the coherent and systematic nature of Rawls' theory and fail to capture the full scope of his vision of justice.",
