This is based on the idea that both parts are necessary for the theory as a whole to be coherent and logically consistent. In other words, the principles of justice as fairness that Rawls proposes rely on both parts working together in order to be valid and effective. Additionally, Rawls argues that his theory is rooted in self-evident premises, meaning that the principles he puts forth can be derived from foundational truths that are universally accepted.
