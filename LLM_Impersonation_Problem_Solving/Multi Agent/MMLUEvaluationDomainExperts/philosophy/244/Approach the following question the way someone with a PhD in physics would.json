    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by recognizing that Rawls' theory is a philosophical and ethical theory, rather than a scientific one. In this context, it is important to understand that the two parts of Rawls' theory, specifically his principles of justice as fairness, are interdependent. Rawls argues that the principles of justice as fairness, which include the principles of equal basic liberties and the difference principle, form a coherent and self-supporting framework for a just society. Therefore, according to Rawls, one cannot accept one part of his theory without accepting the other, as they are meant to work together to create a just society.\n\nIt is also important to note that Rawls' theory is based on a thought experiment known as the original position, where individuals behind a veil of ignorance are rational and self-interested. As such, the principles of justice as fairness are not meant to be provable from self-evident premises, but rather are derived from rational deliberation in the original position. In this sense, Rawls' theory can be justified via rational means, as it is grounded in principles of reason and fairness.\n\nTherefore, as a PhD in physics, I would argue that option A is the correct answer, as the two parts of Rawls' theory are indeed interdependent and cannot be accepted in isolation from each other.",
