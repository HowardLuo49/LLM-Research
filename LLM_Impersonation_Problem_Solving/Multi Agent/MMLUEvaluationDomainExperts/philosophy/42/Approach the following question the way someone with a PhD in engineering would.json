How does Stevenson respond to the objection that his theory does not account for the kind of goodness that is objective and is known a priori?\nA: He claims to have proven that such a property does not exist.\nB: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\nC: He claims he does not understand such a property.\nD: None of the above.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "B: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nStevenson responds to the objection by arguing that his theory, which distinguishes between descriptive and evaluative statements, can account for objective goodness that is known a priori. He contends that moral judgments involve both aspects of descriptive facts about the world and evaluative attitudes, and that his theory provides a coherent framework for understanding how these two elements interact to give rise to moral properties. Stevenson believes that his theory offers a way to reconcile the seemingly contradictory notions of objective moral goodness and the subjectivity of ethical judgments.",
