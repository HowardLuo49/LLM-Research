He asserts that moral judgments are expressions of our emotional attitudes towards actions, and that these emotional attitudes can be seen as objective in the sense that they are based on shared social norms and values. Stevenson further argues that these emotional attitudes can be known a priori through reflection and introspection. Therefore, Stevenson contends that his theory does provide a framework for understanding objective moral goodness that can be known a priori.",
