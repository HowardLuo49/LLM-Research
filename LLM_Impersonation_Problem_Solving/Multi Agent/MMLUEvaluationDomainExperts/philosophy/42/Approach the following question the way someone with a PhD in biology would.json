    "gpt_response": "B: He claims to have offered an account of just such a property.\n\nAs someone with a PhD in biology, Stevenson would likely respond to the objection by explaining his theory of emotivism, which posits that moral statements are expressions of personal preference or emotional responses rather than objective facts. Stevenson might argue that his theory does indeed account for the kind of goodness that is objective and known a priori by suggesting that moral judgments are ultimately rooted in individual emotions and attitudes. By acknowledging the subjective nature of moral statements, Stevenson's theory allows for differing perspectives on what constitutes goodness while still recognizing the possibility of objective moral truths.",
