D'Holbach was a materialist philosopher who believed that all phenomena in the universe, including the mind and consciousness, could be explained through physical and natural processes. Therefore, according to d'Holbach, all the mental and moral attributes that people think are evidence for an immaterial soul are in fact purely physical and natural in origin. This perspective aligns with the scientific and empirical approach that is foundational to engineering disciplines.",
