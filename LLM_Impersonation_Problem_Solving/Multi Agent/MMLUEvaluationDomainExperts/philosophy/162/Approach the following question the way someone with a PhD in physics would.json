Rawls' theory of justice emphasizes the importance of ensuring that individuals have equal opportunities to develop and exercise their abilities, regardless of their initial endowments.\n\nIn the context of education, this would suggest that students with fewer native assets, such as intelligence, should be given more attention and resources in order to level the playing field and provide them with the support they need to succeed. This aligns with the concept of distributive justice, which advocates for the redistribution of resources to address inequalities and promote equal opportunities for all individuals.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question would be:\nA: more attention and resources than those with more native assets.",
