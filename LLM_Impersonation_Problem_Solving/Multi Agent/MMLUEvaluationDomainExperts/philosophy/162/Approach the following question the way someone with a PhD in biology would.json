In the field of biology, we understand that genetic diversity is crucial for the long-term survival and adaptability of a population.\n\nTherefore, students with fewer native assets, such as intelligence, could be seen as individuals with a lower level of genetic diversity in terms of their cognitive abilities. In order to promote overall population health and resilience, it may be beneficial to provide these students with more attention and resources to compensate for their inherent limitations.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint, providing equal resources to all students regardless of their native assets could be akin to neglecting the importance of genetic diversity in a population. Similarly, providing less attention and fewer resources to students with fewer native assets could potentially hinder the overall adaptability and success of the population as a whole.\n\nTherefore, in alignment with principles of biodiversity and genetic diversity, the most scientifically sound approach would be to provide students with fewer native assets with more attention and resources than those with more native assets, as suggested by option A.",
