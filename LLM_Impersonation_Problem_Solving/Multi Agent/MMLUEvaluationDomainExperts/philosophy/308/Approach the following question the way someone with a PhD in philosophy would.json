On the other hand, opponents may assert that the notion of an actually infinite number of things is ultimately meaningless or paradoxical, undermining the logical coherence of our understanding of reality. In this context, Craig's assertion that an actually infinite number of things cannot exist echoes the sentiments of philosophical thinkers who have grappled with these profound questions throughout the ages.",
