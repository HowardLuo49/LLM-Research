    "gpt_response": "To approach this question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would, we must first understand the concepts at play. Soft determinism, also known as compatibilism, is a philosophical position that aims to reconcile the seemingly conflicting ideas of determinism and free will. Determinism posits that every event, including human actions, is determined by past events and natural laws. Free will, on the other hand, argues that individuals have the ability to make choices that are not causally determined.\n\nGiven this understanding, soft determinism entails that the thesis of determinism is true. This position suggests that while our actions may be determined by external factors, such as past events and natural laws, we still possess some level of free will in that we can make choices based on our desires and motivations within those determined parameters. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: the thesis of determinism is true",
