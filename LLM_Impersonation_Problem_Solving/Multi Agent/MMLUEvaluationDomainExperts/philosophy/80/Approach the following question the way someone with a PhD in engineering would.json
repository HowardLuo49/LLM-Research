    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by emphasizing the scientific understanding of heat and cold. From a thermodynamic perspective, heat and cold are not physical objects themselves, but rather descriptions of the transfer of thermal energy between systems. Heat is a form of energy, while cold is simply the absence of heat. Therefore, I would argue that option B (physical objects) is not the correct answer, but rather option D (only sensations existing in our minds) aligns more closely with the scientific understanding of heat and cold. Heat and cold are subjective sensations that we perceive based on the thermal energy transfer between our bodies and our environment, rather than tangible physical entities.",
