    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. Plato distinguishes knowledge from mere belief or opinion by saying that knowledge must be a true belief for which one can give a justification, a rationale, or \"logos.\"  In terms of his image of the Divided Line, for Plato, knowledge is attained only when our sensible experience is:\nA: grounded ultimately in what our senses reveal to us about the world of becoming.\nB: based on images of the good, beauty, and truth obtained from particular objects and on which the concepts and Forms depend.\nC: replaced by what we sincerely believe is true or have come to believe based on our upbringing.\nD: understood in terms of concepts or innate ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "A PhD in engineering would likely approach this question by analyzing Plato's concept of knowledge and its relation to the Divided Line from a logical and rational perspective. They may highlight the importance of the justification and rationale required for knowledge to be considered true belief, as per Plato's definition. They may also emphasize the need for grounding in sensory experience and rational understanding in order to attain true knowledge, as suggested by option D. Additionally, they may discuss how Plato's image of the Divided Line relates to the acquisition of knowledge through the progression from sensory experience to rational understanding of concepts and Forms. Ultimately, a PhD in engineering may prioritize the logical and systematic aspects of Plato's philosophy in their approach to this question.",
