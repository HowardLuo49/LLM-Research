    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the different interpretations of the Ideal Moral Code theory presented in the options.\n\nIn option A, the theory suggests that one is obligated to follow the ideal moral rules in their actual institutional setting. This implies that the moral rules are context-dependent and may vary based on the specific institutions in which one operates. In mathematical terms, this could be seen as a function mapping the ideal moral rules to different institutional settings.\n\nOption B introduces the concept of an ideal institutional setting, where one is obligated to follow the ideal moral rules. This suggests a more absolute and universal interpretation of the theory, regardless of the specific institutional context. Mathematically, this could correspond to a more general function that is not dependent on the specific institutional setting.\n\nOption C presents the idea of following the ideal moral rules in a setting devoid of institutions. This raises the question of whether moral obligations exist independently of institutional frameworks. In a mathematical sense, this could be seen as a theoretical scenario where the rules are applied in a vacuum, without any external constraints.\n\nLastly, option D proposes following the ideal moral rules in a world where everyone complies perfectly. This implies a harmonious and idealized societal state where moral rules are universally upheld. Mathematically, this could be modeled as a perfect equilibrium where all agents act in accordance with the ideal moral code.\n\nOverall, as a mathematician, I would approach this question by dissecting the implications of each option within the framework of the Ideal Moral Code theory and considering how these different interpretations could be mathematically formalized and analyzed.",
