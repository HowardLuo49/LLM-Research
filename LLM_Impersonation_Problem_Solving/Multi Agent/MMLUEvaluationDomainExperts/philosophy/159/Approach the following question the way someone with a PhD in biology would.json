    "gpt_response": "As a PhD biologist, I would approach this question by analyzing the ethical implications of the Ideal Moral Code theory within the context of societal institutions and human behavior. The theory suggests that individuals have a moral obligation to act in accordance with the ideal moral rules, regardless of their specific institutional setting.\n\nIn considering the options presented, it is important to note that the theory does not necessarily require individuals to only follow ideal moral rules in a perfect institutional setting or in a world devoid of institutions. The emphasis is on aligning one's actions with what the ideal moral rules would dictate in any given setting.\n\nOption A suggests that individuals should adhere to the ideal moral rules in their actual institutional setting, which may be subject to various constraints and limitations. Option B posits that adherence to the ideal moral rules should be based on an ideal institutional setting, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world scenarios.\n\nOption C proposes that individuals should follow the ideal moral rules in a setting devoid of institutions, which raises questions about the practicality and relevance of such actions in the absence of societal structures. Lastly, option D suggests that individuals should adhere to the ideal moral rules in a world where everyone complies perfectly, highlighting the challenges associated with achieving universal moral compliance.\n\nIn conclusion, as a biologist, I would argue that the Ideal Moral Code theory calls for individuals to strive towards ethical behavior guided by ideal moral rules, regardless of the specific institutional setting or societal context. It is essential to consider the practical implications and complexities of applying these moral principles in real-world situations while acknowledging the importance of promoting ethical conduct in society.",
