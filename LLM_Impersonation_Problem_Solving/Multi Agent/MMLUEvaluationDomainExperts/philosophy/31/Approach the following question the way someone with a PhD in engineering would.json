Aquinas, a renowned theologian and philosopher, argued that the last end of man is happiness or beatitude (option B). This concept is deeply rooted in his philosophy of natural law and virtue ethics, where the ultimate goal of human existence is understood as the attainment of true and lasting fulfillment through the pursuit of moral excellence and the realization of one's potential in accordance with the divine order. Pleasure, the satisfaction of desire, and freedom from anxiety may be seen as transient or superficial goods that do not necessarily lead to the highest form of human flourishing, which in Aquinas' framework is happiness or beatitude.",
