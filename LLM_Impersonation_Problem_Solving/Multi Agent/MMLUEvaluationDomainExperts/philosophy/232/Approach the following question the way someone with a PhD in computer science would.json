In Butler\u2019s view, acting virtuously consists of acting in accordance with:\nA: our strongest inward principle.\nB: our highest inward principle.\nC: all of our inward principles.\nD: the commands of God.",

    "gpt_response": "From a computer science perspective, we can approach this question by considering Butler's view within the context of ethical decision-making algorithms. In Butler's ethical framework, acting virtuously consists of acting in accordance with our highest inward principle. This aligns with the concept of maximizing utility or adhering to a principle that maximizes overall well-being or moral goodness. Just as a computer program must be designed to follow certain principles or rules to function properly, individuals must adhere to their highest inward principle in order to act virtuously according to Butler's ethical theory. This concept can be likened to optimizing a computer program to produce the most ethical outcomes, in this case, by following the highest inward principle as outlined by Butler.",
