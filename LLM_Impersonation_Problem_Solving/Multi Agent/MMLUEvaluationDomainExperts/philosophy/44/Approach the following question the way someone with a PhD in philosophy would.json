    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The statement \"An unexamined life is not worth living\" is famously attributed to the Greek philosopher Socrates. It is a key tenet of his philosophy, as expressed in Plato's dialogues, particularly in the \"Apology.\" Socrates believed that self-examination and reflection on one's beliefs and actions were essential for living a meaningful and fulfilling life. This sentiment reflects his commitment to intellectual inquiry, critical thinking, and ethical reflection, all of which were central to his philosophical teachings. Through questioning and dialogue, Socrates sought to encourage others to think deeply about their lives and values, ultimately leading to personal growth and self-awareness. Thus, the notion that an unexamined life is not worth living is a cornerstone of Socratic philosophy and continues to be a source of inspiration for contemporary thinkers in the field of philosophy.",
