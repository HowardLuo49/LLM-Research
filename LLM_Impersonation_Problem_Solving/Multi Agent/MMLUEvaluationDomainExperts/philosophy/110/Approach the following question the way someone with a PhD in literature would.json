Hume is known for his empiricist views and his skepticism towards objective beauty. In his treatise \"Of the Standard of Taste,\" Hume argues that beauty is subjective and depends on individual perception and sentiment. He believes that each mind perceives a different beauty based on personal preferences, experiences, and cultural background.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B: a different beauty.
