In this theoretical thought experiment, individuals are meant to make decisions about principles of justice behind a \"veil of ignorance\" where they are unaware of their own personal characteristics and circumstances.\n\nFrom a physics perspective, we can approach this question by analyzing the nature of the original position and how it can be entered. Rawls argues that individuals can enter the original position by following a certain procedure, which involves imagining themselves in a hypothetical state of ignorance about their own attributes. This suggests that option B is the most likely correct answer, as individuals can theoretically enter the original position at any time by engaging in this thought experiment.\n\nTherefore, as a physicist with a PhD, I would argue that option B: \"at any time, by simply following a certain procedure\" is the most accurate answer based on the concept of the original position as proposed by Rawls.",
