    "gpt_response": "As a physicist with a PhD, it is important to approach this question from a theoretical and analytical perspective. In this context, Rawls' original contract can be understood as a thought experiment to determine the principles of justice that should govern the basic structure of society. Rawls argues that individuals, stripped of their biases and knowledge of their own position in society, would agree to a set of principles that ensure fairness and equality for all members of society. Therefore, the correct answer is C: establish the principles of justice for the basic structure of society.",
