    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Kant, a prominent philosopher in ethics, posits that the moral worth of an action is determined by the intention behind the action, rather than the consequences or the moral character of the agent. This concept is encapsulated in his idea of the \"categorical imperative,\" which emphasizes acting only on maxims that can be universalized without contradiction. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is C: the maxim that is acted on. Kant believed that a moral action is one that is based on a universal principle that is morally justifiable in all situations.",
