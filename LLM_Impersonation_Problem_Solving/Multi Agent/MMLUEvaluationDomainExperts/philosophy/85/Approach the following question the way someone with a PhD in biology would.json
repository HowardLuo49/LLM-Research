    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I must first clarify that Kant's philosophy on ethics is often discussed in the field of philosophy rather than biology. However, in examining Kant's beliefs on moral worth, it is important to consider his emphasis on the intention behind an action rather than its consequences. Kant argued that moral worth is dependent on the maxim or principle that guides an individual's actions, rather than the outcome of those actions. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is C: the maxim that is acted on.",
