    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "A PhD in mathematics would likely approach this question by analyzing Kant's moral philosophy and the principles he established. Kant argued that the moral worth of an action depends on the maxim that is acted upon, not the consequences or the moral character of the agent. Kant believed that acting in accordance with the categorical imperative, a universal moral law derived from reason, is what gives an action moral worth.
