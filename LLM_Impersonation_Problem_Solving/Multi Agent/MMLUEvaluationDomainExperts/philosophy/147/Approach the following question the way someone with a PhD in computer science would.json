    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. According to Plato, we can attain knowledge only by seeing beyond this world of particular, changing objects to the true essences or Forms in terms of which things in this world are intelligible.  For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\nA: from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB: since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC: our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "D: since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n\nA PhD in computer science would approach this question by analyzing Plato's philosophical ideas and relating them to the concept of knowledge representation in computer science. Plato's belief that true knowledge comes from the understanding of abstract forms or ideas beyond the physical world can be compared to the concept of abstract data types in computer science, where data structures are defined independently of their implementation details.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that knowledge is innate because it cannot be based solely on sensory experience can be related to the concept of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. In AI, knowledge representation involves encoding information in a formal system that can be manipulated by algorithms to perform reasoning tasks. This abstraction of knowledge from sensory experience aligns with Plato's notion that true knowledge transcends the sensory world.\n\nTherefore, a PhD in computer science would likely choose option D as the correct answer, as it captures the essence of Plato's argument regarding the nature of knowledge and its relationship to sensory experience.",
