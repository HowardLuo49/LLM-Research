    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by analyzing Nussbaum's argument in depth. Nussbaum, a prominent philosopher and ethicist, is known for her work on virtue ethics and the importance of emotions in ethical decision-making.\n\nIn her writings, Nussbaum emphasizes the need for a nuanced and detailed understanding of virtues, arguing that they should be described as fully and accurately as possible. This aligns with option A, which suggests that terms for the virtues should be as descriptive as possible.\n\nNussbaum also highlights the importance of considering different perspectives and interpretations of virtues, rather than simply relying on convention or tradition. This implies that terms for virtues should be neutral between competing specifications, as suggested in option C.\n\nOverall, based on Nussbaum's philosophy and approach to ethical inquiry, the most fitting answer to the question would likely be a combination of options A and C, highlighting the importance of descriptive terms for virtues that are neutral between competing specifications.",
