    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by first acknowledging that the criticism of utilitarianism as a doctrine fit only for swine stems from the idea that the philosophy reduces all human actions to the pursuit of pleasure, without recognizing higher faculties and moral reasoning.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, in his defense of utilitarianism, argued that pleasures differ in quality, not just quantity. He contended that some pleasures are more valuable and desirable than others, based on their inherent nature and the faculties they engage. For example, intellectual and moral pleasures were considered superior to physical pleasures.\n\nTherefore, the response to the complaint would be that pleasures differ in quality, as Mill believed that higher pleasures, involving intellectual and moral faculties, were more valuable and worthy of pursuit than lower pleasures related to mere physical sensations. Hence, the correct answer is:\n\nB: quality.",
