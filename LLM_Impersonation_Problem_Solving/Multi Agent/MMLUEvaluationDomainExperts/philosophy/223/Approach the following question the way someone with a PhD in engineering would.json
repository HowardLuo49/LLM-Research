    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by analyzing it from a logical and ethical standpoint. Cicero's claims must be examined in the context of his historical and philosophical perspectives. The pursuit of knowledge and understanding should guide us in determining the validity of his statements.\n\nIn terms of committing acts of injustice, an engineer would likely argue that ethics and moral principles must always be upheld in order to promote fairness, equality, and respect for others. Acting unjustly can have negative consequences for society as a whole and can undermine the foundations of a functioning community.\n\nBreaking one's promises is also seen as ethically questionable by engineers, as trust and integrity are essential in maintaining relationships and ensuring successful collaborations. Keeping promises is a sign of reliability and accountability, qualities that are integral to the engineering profession.\n\nRegarding the issue of stealing, an engineer would likely assert that theft is inherently unethical and harmful to both individuals and society. Respecting others' property rights and upholding the rule of law are fundamental principles that engineers are expected to uphold in their professional and personal lives.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the ethical principles that guide the engineering profession, it is unlikely that a PhD engineer would agree with Cicero's claims that it is sometimes permissible to commit acts of injustice, break one's promises, or steal. Instead, engineers are trained to prioritize honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior in all aspects of their work and interactions with others. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question would be D: none of the above.",
