In terms of evolutionary fitness, cooperation and social cohesion have been shown to be beneficial for the survival and reproduction of individuals. Honesty and trustworthiness are important factors in maintaining social relationships and networks, which ultimately contribute to the success of a species.\n\nTherefore, the idea that it is sometimes permissible to lie (option D) could be considered particularly pernicious from a biological perspective. Lying undermines trust and cooperation within social groups, potentially leading to negative consequences for individuals and the group as a whole. In the long run, a society that allows and promotes deception may be less stable and less successful in terms of evolutionary fitness.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of moral relativism (option C) could also be seen as problematic in terms of promoting social cohesion and cooperation. If moral rightness is considered relative to one's culture, it could lead to conflicting values and ethical norms within a society, which might undermine the overall functioning of social groups and the species as a whole.\n\nOverall, from a biological perspective, the belief that it is sometimes permissible to lie or that moral rightness is relative to culture could indeed be considered as potentially harmful or pernicious doctrines, as they may have negative implications for social cohesion, cooperation, and ultimately the evolutionary success of a species.",
