Epicurus was a Greek philosopher who believed in the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain as the ultimate goals of life. He argued that death should not be feared, as it is simply the cessation of consciousness and sensation, which are not inherently bad.\n\nTaking this into consideration, the wise man according to Epicurus would likely choose option C: is unconcerned with death. This is because the wise man would understand that death is a natural and inevitable part of life, and therefore sees no reason to fear or yearn for it. Instead, the focus would be on living a life of virtue and pursuing pleasure in a rational and ethical manner.",
