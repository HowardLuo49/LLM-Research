    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "According to Epicurus, the wise man is characterized by a state of being unconcerned with death. This is because Epicurus believed that death is simply the cessation of sensation and thus holds no implications for the individual who has died. The wise man, therefore, does not fear death or yearn for the end of life, as they understand death to be a natural part of the human experience that holds no intrinsic value or harm. Epicurus argues that the wise man lives in a state of tranquility and contentment, unburdened by the fears and anxieties that plague those who are preoccupied with thoughts of death. In this way, Epicurus presents a philosophical perspective that encourages individuals to cultivate a sense of equanimity in the face of mortality.",
