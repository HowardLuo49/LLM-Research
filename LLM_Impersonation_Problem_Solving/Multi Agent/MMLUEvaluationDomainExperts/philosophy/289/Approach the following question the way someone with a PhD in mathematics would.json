Dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure.\"  Here Plato indicates how hypothetical knowledge cannot provide the foundation of dialectical knowledge, insofar as hypotheses simply:\nA: explain sense experiences in terms of general concepts which themselves are not explained.\nB: show how particular objects of experience cause us to recall innate ideas.\nC: describe sense experience without providing an explanation for dialectical methods.\nD: reject the use of reason, preferring instead dialectic, to achieve knowledge.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a mathematics scholar, I would interpret Plato's statement as emphasizing the importance of dialectical reasoning in reaching the absolute good, which is the ultimate goal of intellectual pursuit. Dialectic, as the highest form of reasoning, allows us to directly access first principles without relying on sensory experiences or hypothetical constructs. By engaging in dialectical inquiry, one can transcend the limitations of empirical knowledge and access a deeper understanding of reality that goes beyond surface appearances. The rejection of hypotheses in dialectical reasoning serves to establish a more secure foundation for knowledge, as it allows us to directly engage with the essence of things rather than being confined to superficial explanations.",
