    "gpt_response": "Mill defines \"utility\" as C: pleasure and the absence of pain. This concept is central to his utilitarian philosophy, which aims to maximize overall happiness and minimize suffering in society. Mill argues that actions are morally right in proportion to their tendency to promote happiness, and wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. He emphasizes the importance of considering the consequences of our actions on the well-being of all individuals affected, not just the individual performing the action. Therefore, utility, for Mill, is not only about the usefulness to society or promoting the interests of all, but about maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain for the greatest number of people.",
