    "gpt_response": "The concept that we consist of two distinct substances, the body and mind, and that these two interact is known as substance dualism. This philosophical perspective posits that the mind and body are separate entities, with the mind being immaterial and the body being material. Substance dualism has been a topic of debate among philosophers for centuries, with proponents such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes arguing for the existence of both mental and physical substances. Critics of substance dualism point to challenges in explaining how the immaterial mind can interact with the material body. Despite these criticisms, substance dualism remains a significant concept within the realm of philosophical inquiry into the nature of the self and consciousness.",
