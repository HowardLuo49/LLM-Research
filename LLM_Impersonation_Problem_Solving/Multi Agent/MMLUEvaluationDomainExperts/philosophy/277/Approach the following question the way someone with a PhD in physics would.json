Substance dualism is the philosophical view that humans consist of two distinct substances - the body and the mind - and that these substances interact in some way. This idea goes back to the works of philosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who proposed that the mind and body are separate entities that interact through the pineal gland in the brain.\n\nWhile the concept of substance dualism may seem at odds with the principles of physics, which often focus on the material world and measurable quantities, it is still a valid philosophical stance that has been debated and discussed for centuries. It is important for a physicist to be aware of such philosophical concepts, as they can inform discussions about the nature of consciousness, the mind-body problem, and the limits of scientific knowledge.",
