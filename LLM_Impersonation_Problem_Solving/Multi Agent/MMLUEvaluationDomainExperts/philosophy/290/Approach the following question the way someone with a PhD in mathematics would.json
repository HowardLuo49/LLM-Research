    "gpt_response": "Answer: D: All of the above.\n\nAs researchers in the field of mathematics, we encounter various frustrations when it comes to writing or reading about research ethics. One common frustration is the differing opinions on what constitutes ethically acceptable behavior. This can lead to debates and disagreements within the field.\n\nAdditionally, the same ethical debates are often revisited and rehearsed over decades, leading to a sense of stagnation or lack of progress in the field of research ethics. This can be frustrating for researchers who are trying to navigate complex ethical dilemmas in their own work.\n\nFurthermore, cases of ethical violations in research often seem to be linked with certain research methods or practices. This can make it challenging for researchers to know how to navigate ethical issues in their own work and can lead to a sense of unease or uncertainty.\n\nIn conclusion, the frustrations in writing or reading about research ethics are multifaceted and can stem from differing opinions on ethical standards, ongoing debates, and the association of ethical violations with specific research methods. It is important for researchers to engage with these challenges and strive to uphold the highest ethical standards in their work.",
