    "gpt_response": "In order to analyze the veracity of the given statements, a deep understanding of abstract algebra and group theory is necessary. Let us begin by dissecting the first statement, which asserts that every free abelian group is torsion free. A free abelian group is one that can be generated by a set of elements with no relations except the group's algebraic structure. Torsion free groups are those in which no non-zero element has finite order. It can be shown that every free abelian group is indeed torsion free, as the lack of relations in the generating set prevents elements from having finite order.\n\nMoving on to the second statement, which states that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group. This assertion is false. While it is true that every free abelian group is torsion free, not every torsion-free abelian group is necessarily free. An example of a torsion-free abelian group that is not free is the group of rational numbers under addition. This group is torsion-free, as there are no elements other than the identity with finite order, but it is not free since it is not generated by a single element.\n\nIn conclusion, Statement 1 is true as every free abelian group is indeed torsion free. However, Statement 2 is false as not every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: True, False.",
