    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question with a PhD level of understanding in mathematics, we need to analyze the properties of groups and orders of elements within groups.\n\nRegarding Statement 1, if a group contains an element of order 10, this means that there exists an element in the group such that when it is raised to the 10th power, it equals the identity element of the group. From this definition, it follows that the group must also contain elements of orders 1, 2, and 5 since those are factors of 10. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nTurning to Statement 2, if a group contains an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, it is stating that there exist elements in the group such that when raised to the 2nd and 3rd powers respectively, equal the identity element. From the properties of group theory, we know that the order of the product of two elements in a group is equal to the least common multiple of their individual orders. In this case, the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6, so if the group contains elements of order 2 and 3, it must also contain an element of order 6. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: A) True, True.",
