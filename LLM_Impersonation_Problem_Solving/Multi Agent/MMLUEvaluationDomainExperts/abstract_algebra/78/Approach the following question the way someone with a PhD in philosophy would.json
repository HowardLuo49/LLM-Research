    "gpt_response": "To address the first statement, we must consider the conditions necessary for a set to form a group under a specified operation. In this case, the set {1,2,...,n-1} is being considered as a group under multiplication modulo n. For a set to form a group, it must satisfy the following group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and invertibility.\n\nThe set {1,2,...,n-1} under multiplication modulo n meets the closure property since the product of two numbers in the set will always result in a number within the set. Associativity is a property that multiplication always satisfies. The identity element for this group would be 1, as multiplying any element in the set by 1 results in the original number. Invertibility is also satisfied as for any element a in the set, there exists an element b such that a*b is congruent to 1 modulo n.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it asserts that there exists an integer x such that 63x is congruent to 1 modulo 100. This statement is a specific instance of the more general concept of modular inverse. In modular arithmetic, for a number a to have an inverse modulo n, it must be coprime to n (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nIn this case, we are looking for an integer x such that 63x is congruent to 1 modulo 100. This implies that 63 and 100 must be coprime. By verifying that gcd(63,100) = 1, we can ascertain the existence of such an x.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
