    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in physics would, we would first identify the key theorems and definitions involved.\n\nStatement 1 is about abelian groups, which are groups where the group operation is commutative. The statement says that some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10. In group theory, we know that for any abelian group, all subgroups are normal. Therefore, if an abelian group has a subgroup of order 10, that subgroup is also normal. From this logic, Statement 1 is likely to be true.\n\nStatement 2 is about normal subgroups and cosets. A subgroup H of a group G is considered a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H. This is a fundamental property of normal subgroups. Since this statement directly corresponds to a well-known property in group theory, Statement 2 is also likely to be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: True, True.",
