    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the definitions and properties of abelian groups, subgroups, and normal subgroups within group theory. \n\nIn order to determine the validity of each statement, I would first consider statement 1. An abelian group is a group in which the group operation is commutative. The group of order 45 can be broken down into subgroups of order 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, or 45 due to Lagrange's theorem. Therefore, a subgroup of order 10 is indeed possible in an abelian group of order 45. Thus, statement 1 is true.\n\nNext, I would assess statement 2, which discusses the concept of normal subgroups. A subgroup of a group is considered normal if all left cosets are equal to the corresponding right cosets. This property is equivalent to the number of left cosets being equal to the number of right cosets. Therefore, statement 2 is also true.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my analysis as a philosopher with a PhD in philosophy, I would assert that statement 1 is true and statement 2 is also true.
