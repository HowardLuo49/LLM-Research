    "gpt_response": "As a computer science PhD, I would approach this question by considering the properties of finitely generated free abelian groups and their subgroups.\n\nStatement 1 states that if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian. This statement is true. In a finitely generated free abelian group, all subgroups of finite index are free abelian. Since K is a subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, it follows that K is also free abelian.\n\nStatement 2 states that if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian. This statement is false. The quotient group G / K may not necessarily be free abelian. For example, if G is the free abelian group Z^2 and K is the subgroup generated by (2,2), then the quotient group Z^2 / K is isomorphic to Z, which is not a free abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
