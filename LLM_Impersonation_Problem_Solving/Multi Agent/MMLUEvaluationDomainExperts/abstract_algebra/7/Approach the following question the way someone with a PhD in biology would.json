However, based on my knowledge and understanding of the concepts presented in the statements, I would approach the question as follows:\n\nStatement 1: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}.\n- In mathematics, a ring homomorphism is a function between two rings that preserves addition, multiplication, and the identity elements. \n- The kernel of a ring homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that are sent to the identity element in the codomain.\n- A one-to-one function is a function where each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain.\n- In this context, if the kernel of a ring homomorphism is {0}, then the function is injective (one-to-one) because only the identity element in the domain maps to the identity element in the codomain.\n- Therefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: Q is an ideal in R.\n- In mathematics, an ideal is a special subset of a ring that is closed under addition and absorbs elements from the ring.\n- In this context, Q represents the set of rational numbers and R represents a ring.\n- The set of rational numbers is not an ideal in a general ring R because not all elements in R can be absorbed by Q under addition or multiplication.\n- Therefore, Statement 2 is False.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would select option C: True, False as the answer.",
