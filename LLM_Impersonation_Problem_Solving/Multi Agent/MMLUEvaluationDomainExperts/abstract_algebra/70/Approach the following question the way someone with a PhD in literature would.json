    "gpt_response": "In the group (Z,*), where * is defined as a*b = a+b+1 for all integers a, b in Z, one must first determine the identity element before finding the inverse of a given element. The identity element, denoted as e, satisfies the property a*e = a for all a in Z.\n\nSubstituting the definition of * into the equation a*e = a, we have a + e + 1 = a. Solving for e, we find that e = -1.\n\nNow, to find the inverse of a given element a in Z, denoted as a^(-1), we seek an element x such that a*x = e. Substituting the definition of the identity element e into the equation a*x = -1, we obtain a*x + 1 = -1. Rearranging the terms results in x = -1 - a.\n\nTherefore, the inverse of a in the group (Z, *) is given by the expression x = -1 - a, which corresponds to option C: a-2.",
