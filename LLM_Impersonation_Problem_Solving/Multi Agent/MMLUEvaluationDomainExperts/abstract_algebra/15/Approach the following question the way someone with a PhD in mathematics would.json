    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to consider the definitions and properties of splitting fields and fields with a certain number of elements.\n\nStatement 1: R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.\nA splitting field of a polynomial over a field K is an extension field of K where the polynomial factors completely into linear factors. In this case, R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q means that R is an extension field of Q such that there exists a polynomial f(x) in Q[x] which has R as its splitting field.\n\nStatement 2: There is a field with 60 elements.\nThe number of elements in a finite field is always a power of a prime. Specifically, for any prime number p and any positive integer n, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) finite field with p^n elements. In this case, 60 is not a power of a prime, so there is no finite field with 60 elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: False, True.",
