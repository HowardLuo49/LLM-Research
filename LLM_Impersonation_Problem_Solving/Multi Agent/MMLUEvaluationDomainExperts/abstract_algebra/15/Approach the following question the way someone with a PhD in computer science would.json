    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is C: True, False.\n\nStatement 1 is true because if R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q, then R is a field extension of Q where all roots of the polynomial are contained in R. This implies that R is a field extension of Q, and hence it is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.\n\nStatement 2 is false because there is no field with 60 elements. The number of elements in a finite field is always a prime power, i.e., p^n where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. Since 60 cannot be expressed in this form, there is no field with 60 elements.",
