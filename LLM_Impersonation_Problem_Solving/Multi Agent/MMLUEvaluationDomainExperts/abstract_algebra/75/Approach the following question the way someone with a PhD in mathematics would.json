A group is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element.\n\nStatement 1 is not generally true in a group because the order of multiplication matters. In a group, the product of elements in different orders may not be the same. So, (ab)^{-2} is not necessarily equal to b^{-2}a^{-2} in a group.\n\nStatement 2 is generally true in a group if n is a positive integer. This is a consequence of the associative property of groups. The product of (ab) multiplied n times is equal to a multiplied n times followed by b multiplied n times.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: False, True.",
