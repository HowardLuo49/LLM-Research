    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in engineering, we first need to understand the properties of groups and the given property of the group (G, .).\n\nIn group theory, a group is a set G equipped with a binary operation (denoted by .) that satisfies the following properties:\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, the product a.b is also in G.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a.b).c = a.(b.c).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that for all a in G, a.e = e.a = a.\n4. Inverse element: For each element a in G, there exists an element a^-1 in G such that a.a^-1 = a^-1.a = e.\n\nNow, the given property states that (ab)^-1 = a^-1b^-1 for all a, b in G. This is equivalent to saying that the inverse of a product is equal to the product of the inverses.\n\nBased on this property, we can deduce that G is an abelian group.
