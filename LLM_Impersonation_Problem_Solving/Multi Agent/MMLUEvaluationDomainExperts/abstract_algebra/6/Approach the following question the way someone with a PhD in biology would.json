A homomorphic image of a group G is a group H such that there exists a homomorphism from G to H. Every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G, as factor groups are constructed by taking the quotient of G by a normal subgroup, which corresponds to the kernel of the homomorphism.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. The homomorphic images of a group G are indeed the same, up to isomorphism, as the factor groups of G. This is because the homomorphisms determine the structure of the factor groups, and any two factor groups that arise from the same homomorphic image will be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
