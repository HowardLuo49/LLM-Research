In group theory, a subgroup H of a group G is a subset of G that is also a group under the same operation.\n\nStatement 1 is true because the left coset of H containing element a, denoted aH, has the same number of elements as the right coset of H containing element a, denoted Ha.

This is known as the coset partition theorem and is a fundamental result in group theory.
