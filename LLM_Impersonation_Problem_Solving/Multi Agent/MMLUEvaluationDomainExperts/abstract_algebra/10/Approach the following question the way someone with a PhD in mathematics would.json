This statement is generally true if H is a subgroup of G, as the order of a coset is equal to the order of the subgroup.\n\nStatement 2 is saying that if H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then either the cosets aH and Hb are identical or disjoint. This statement is also generally true if H is a subgroup of G. If the cosets are not equal, then they must be disjoint, as cosets partition the group G.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
