    "gpt_response": "As a literature PhD, I must clarify that the question pertains to set theory and relations, not literary theory or analysis. Given my expertise in literature, I may not be the most qualified to provide a detailed response to this question. However, I can attempt to address it based on my general knowledge in the field of mathematics.\n\nStatement A is false. While every partial-ordering relation is an equivalence relation, the inverse is not necessarily true. An equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, while a partial-ordering relation must also satisfy the antisymmetry property.\n\nStatement B is false. The number of relations from set A to set B is equal to 2^(|A|*|B|), so for sets A = {x, y, z} and B = {1, 2}, there would be 2^(3*2) = 64 possible relations.\n\nStatement C is false. An empty relation (a relation with no elements) cannot be reflexive because reflexivity requires every element in the set to be related to itself.\n\nStatement D is false. The properties of a relation being symmetric and antisymmetric are not exact opposites. A relation can be symmetric, meaning (a, b) is in the relation if and only if (b, a) is in the relation, while being antisymmetric means that if (a, b) is in the relation and (b, a) is in the relation, then a = b. These properties are not inverses of each other; a relation can be neither symmetric nor antisymmetric.",
