    "gpt_response": "To analyze these statements from the perspective of someone with a PhD in engineering, we need to consider the definitions of permutations and cycles within the context of mathematical theory.\n\nA permutation is a way to arrange objects in a specific order. In mathematics, a permutation of a set is defined as a bijection from the set to itself. This means that each element in the set appears exactly once in the permutation.\n\nOn the other hand, a cycle is a specific type of permutation in which the elements form a circular sequence. In a cycle, each element is mapped to the next element in the cycle, and the last element is mapped back to the first element.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can see that statement 1 is false. Not every permutation is a cycle because a general permutation can map elements to any other element in the set without the constraint of forming a cycle.\n\nHowever, statement 2 is true. Every cycle is a permutation since it is a specific type of permutation that follows the rules of a bijection from a set to itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: D) False, True.",
