    "gpt_response": "To determine whether the polynomial x^2 - 12 satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q, we must consider whether there exists a prime number p such that all coefficients of the polynomial except the leading coefficient are divisible by p, the constant term is not divisible by p squared, and the leading coefficient is not divisible by p squared.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial x^2 - 12 has coefficients of 1, 0, and -12. We can see that p=3 satisfies the conditions for Eisenstein's criterion. The constant term, -12, is not divisible by 3 squared, the coefficient of x, 0, is divisible by 3, and the leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 3 squared.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial x^2 - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q with p=3.
