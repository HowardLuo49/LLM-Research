Statement 1 asserts that if G, H, and K are groups of order 4, then at least two of them are isomorphic. This statement is true because every group of order 4 is isomorphic to either the cyclic group Z_4 or the Klein four-group V. Therefore, if all three groups have order 4, at least two of them must be isomorphic.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it states that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n. This statement is also true, as the direct sum of two cyclic groups Z_r and Z_s is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s, and similarly for Z_m + Z_n. If these two direct sum groups are isomorphic, it implies that the orders of the cyclic groups r and s must divide the orders of the cyclic groups m and n, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
