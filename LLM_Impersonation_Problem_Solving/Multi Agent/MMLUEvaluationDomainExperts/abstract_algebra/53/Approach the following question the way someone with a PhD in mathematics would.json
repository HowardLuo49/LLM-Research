    "gpt_response": "To analyze the given statements from a mathematical perspective, we can consider the various properties of groups and isomorphisms.\n\nStatement 1 states that if G, H, and K are groups of order 4, then at least two of them are isomorphic. This statement is true because any two groups of order 4 are isomorphic to each other, as there is only one group (up to isomorphism) of order 4, namely the cyclic group Z_4. Therefore, given any two groups of order 4, they will be isomorphic to each other.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r must divide m and s must divide n. This statement is also true, as it follows from the structure of direct products of cyclic groups and the properties of isomorphisms. If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then the orders of the cyclic groups in the direct product must divide the orders of the cyclic groups in the subgroup. This implies that r divides m and s divides n.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
