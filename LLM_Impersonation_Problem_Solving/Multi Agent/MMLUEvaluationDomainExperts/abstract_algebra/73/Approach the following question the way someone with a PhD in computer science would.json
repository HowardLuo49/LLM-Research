The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n * 1 = 0, where 1 is the multiplicative identity in the ring.\n\nIn the ring Z_3 x Z_3, the multiplicative identity is (1, 1). Therefore, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that n * (1, 1) = (0, 0).\n\nSince the order of the element (1, 1) is 3, we can see that n = 3 satisfies the condition n * (1, 1) = (0, 0). Therefore, the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x Z_3 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 3.",
