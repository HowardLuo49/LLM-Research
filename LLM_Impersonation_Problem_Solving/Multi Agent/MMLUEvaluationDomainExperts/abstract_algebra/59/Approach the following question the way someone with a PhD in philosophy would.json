    "gpt_response": "A philosopher with a PhD in philosophy would approach this question by analyzing the logical implications and connections between the two statements presented. \n\nIn Statement 1, we are given conditions relating to subgroups H and K of group G. The statement asserts that if one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then their product HK will also be a subgroup of G. This follows from the fact that if one of the subgroups is normal, then the product HK will also be a subgroup, as the product of two normal subgroups is itself normal.\n\nIn Statement 2, we are told that all groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian. This statement is known to be false, as there exist non-Abelian groups of order p^2 (such as the dihedral group of order 8).\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the logical implications and the knowledge of group theory, the correct answer to the question \"If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.
