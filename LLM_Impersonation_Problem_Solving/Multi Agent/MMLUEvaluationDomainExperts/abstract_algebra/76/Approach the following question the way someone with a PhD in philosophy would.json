    "gpt_response": "To answer this question from a perspective informed by a PhD in philosophy, we must first recognize that the statements involve concepts from group theory, particularly related to permutations and cyclic groups. The first statement asserts that the symmetric group S_n is non-Abelian for all n greater than or equal to 3. This signifies that the group's binary operation (often composition of permutations) does not satisfy the commutative property. This could be proven by providing counterexamples of permutations that do not commute under composition.\n\nThe second statement involves the composition of permutations that are m-cycles and n-cycles, resulting in a permutation with order equal to the least common multiple (lcm) of m and n. This can be linked to the fact that the order of a permutation is equal to the least common multiple of the cycle lengths of its disjoint cycle decomposition. Therefore, if a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, the order of their composition ab should indeed be equal to lcm(m,n).\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is option A: True, True. The first statement aligns with knowledge in group theory about symmetric groups, while the second statement aligns with the understanding of permutation cycles and composition in group theory.",
