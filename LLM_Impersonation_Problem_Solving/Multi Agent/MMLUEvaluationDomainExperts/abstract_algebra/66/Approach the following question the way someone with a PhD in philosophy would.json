Statement 1 | If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)+g(x)) = maximum (deg f(x), deg g(x)). Statement 2 | If F is a field then every ideal of F[x] is principal.\nA: True, True\nB: False, False\nC: True, False\nD: False, True",

    "gpt_response": "In response to statement 1, I analyze the concept of the degree of a polynomial in a ring. When f(x) and g(x) are elements of the ring R[x], the degree of their sum, f(x)+g(x), is indeed equal to the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials, deg(f(x)) and deg(g(x)). This can be proven by considering the leading terms of f(x) and g(x) and observing that they contribute to the degree of the sum. Therefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nTurning to statement 2, I consider the structure of ideals in the polynomial ring F[x] over a field F. It is not universally true that every ideal in F[x] is principal, as there exist examples of non-principal ideals in this context. Non-principal ideals such as those generated by more than one element exist within the ring F[x], illustrating that not all ideals in F[x] are principal. Consequently, statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, my evaluation is True for statement 1 and False for statement 2, leading to the final selection of answer choice C: True, False.",
