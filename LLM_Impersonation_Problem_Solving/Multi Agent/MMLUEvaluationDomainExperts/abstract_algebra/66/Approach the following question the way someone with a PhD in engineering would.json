    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we will need to use our knowledge of abstract algebra, specifically in the areas of ring theory and field theory.\n\nFor Statement 1, we will apply the concept of degrees of polynomials in a ring. If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then the degree of the sum of f(x) and g(x) is equal to the maximum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x). This statement is true and is commonly known as the degree formula for the sum of polynomials.\n\nFor Statement 2, we need to understand the concept of ideals in a polynomial ring over a field. It is known that in a polynomial ring over a field, every ideal is principal. This means that any ideal in F[x] can be generated by a single polynomial. This statement is also true in the context of field theory and polynomial rings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True.",
