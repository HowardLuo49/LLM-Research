    "gpt_response": "In considering the irreducibility of the polynomial 4x - 2 over the integers Z and the rationals Q, we must first define what it means for a polynomial to be irreducible. A polynomial is said to be irreducible over a given field if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials in that field.\n\nIn the case of statement 1, where 4x - 2 is considered over Z, it is indeed irreducible because it cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. This is because the only non-constant divisors of 4x - 2 would involve fractions, which are not in Z.\n\nMoving onto statement 2, where 4x - 2 is considered over Q, it is also irreducible. This is because any factorization of 4x - 2 in Q would necessarily involve rational numbers, and the only possible factors of 4x - 2 with rational coefficients would be of the form (ax + b) where a and b are rational numbers. However, it is easy to see that no such factorization is possible for 4x - 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
