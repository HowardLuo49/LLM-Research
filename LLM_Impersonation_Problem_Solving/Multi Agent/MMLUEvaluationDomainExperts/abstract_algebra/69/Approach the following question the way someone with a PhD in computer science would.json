    "gpt_response": "This question is related to the concept of free abelian groups and their properties. \n\nStatement 1 is true as it is a well-known fact that there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank. This can be proven using basic group theory and linear algebra.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. An abelian group is said to be free if it can be generated by a set of elements with no relations among them. The Betti number of a finitely generated abelian group is a measure of its complexity and can be defined as the number of copies of Z in its decomposition. If the Betti number of the group equals the number of elements in some generating set, then the group is free abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True.",
