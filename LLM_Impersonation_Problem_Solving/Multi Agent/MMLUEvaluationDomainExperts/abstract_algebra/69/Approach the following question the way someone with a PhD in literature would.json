A free abelian group is an abelian group that can be generated by a set of elements without any relations among them, meaning each element can be expressed as a unique linear combination of the generating set.\n\nThe rank of a free abelian group is defined as the number of elements in a basis for the group.

In the context of a finitely generated abelian group, the Betti number refers to the rank of the group.\n\nA generating set for a group is a subset of elements that can be combined in various ways to produce all other elements in the group.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.\nThis statement is true based on the definition of a free abelian group. Any positive integer rank corresponds to a free abelian group that can be generated by that number of elements.\n\nStatement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\nThis statement is also true. If the Betti number (rank) of a finitely generated abelian group equals the number of elements in a generating set, it implies that the group is free abelian, as every element in the group can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the generating set. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True",
