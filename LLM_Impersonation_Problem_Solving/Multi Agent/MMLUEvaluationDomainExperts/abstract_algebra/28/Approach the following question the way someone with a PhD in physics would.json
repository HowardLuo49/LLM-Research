This statement is true because the image of a homomorphism is a subgroup of the co-domain group, and it must have the same number of elements as the order of the group it maps from.\n\nStatement 2 states that there is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. This statement is also true because group theory allows for homomorphisms between groups of different orders, as long as the structure is preserved.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
