    "gpt_response": "First, let's define some terms. In group theory, a homomorphism is a function between two groups that respects the group operation. This means that if we have two groups, G and H, and a homomorphism f from G to H, then for any elements a and b in G, f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b) in H, where * represents the group operation.\n\nWith that in mind, let's analyze the statements. \n\nStatement 1 says that the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements. This statement is true. The image of a group under a homomorphism is the set of elements in the codomain of the homomorphism that are the result of applying the homomorphism to elements in the domain. It is possible for a homomorphism to map elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain, resulting in potentially more elements in the image set than the original group size.\n\nStatement 2 says that there is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. This statement is also true. Given that groups of different sizes can be related by homomorphisms, it is indeed possible to have a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements to a group of 12 elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True",
