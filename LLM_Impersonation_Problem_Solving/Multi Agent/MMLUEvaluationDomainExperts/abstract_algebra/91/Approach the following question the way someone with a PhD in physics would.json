    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find all the cosets of 4Z in 2Z, we need to start by defining what the subgroups 4Z and 2Z represent. \n\nIn group theory, 2Z represents the subgroup of integers that are multiples of 2, i.e., {0, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b16, ...}. Similarly, 4Z represents the subgroup of integers that are multiples of 4, i.e., {0, \u00b14, \u00b18, \u00b112, ...}.\n\nThe cosets of 4Z in 2Z are equivalence classes that partition 2Z into subsets of elements that are congruent modulo 4. In other words, given an element a in 2Z, the coset of 4Z containing a is defined as a + 4Z = {a + 4n | n in Z}.\n\nLet's consider elements from 2Z:\n0 = 0 mod 4, \n2 = 2 mod 4, \n4 = 0 mod 4, \n6 = 2 mod 4, \n8 = 0 mod 4, \n10 = 2 mod 4, \n12 = 0 mod 4, ...\n\nCombing the results, the cosets of 4Z in 2Z are:\n4Z = {0, 4, 8, 12, ...} = {4n | n in Z}\n2 + 4Z = {2, 6, 10, ...} = {2 + 4n | n in Z}\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 4Z, 2 + 4Z.",
