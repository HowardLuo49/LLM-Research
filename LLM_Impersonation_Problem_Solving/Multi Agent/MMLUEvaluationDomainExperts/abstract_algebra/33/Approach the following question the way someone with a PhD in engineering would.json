An abelian group, also known as a commutative group, is a group in which the order of the elements does not affect the outcome of the group operation.\n\nGiven that the group (G, 0) is known to be abelian, this means that the operation in the group is commutative, i.e., for all g, h in G, gh = hg.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA: g = g^-1 for every g in G\nThis statement is not necessarily true for an abelian group. In an abelian group, g*g^-1 = g^-1*g = e where e is the identity element. However, it does not imply that g = g^-1.\n\nB: g = g^2 for every g in G\nThis statement is not true for all elements in an abelian group. In an abelian group, g^2 = gg = g*g = g is not always satisfied.\n\nC: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\nThis statement is true for an abelian group. Since the group is abelian, (g o h)^2 = (g o h)(g o h) = gg o hh = g^2 o h^2.\n\nD: G is of finite order\nThis statement does not necessarily hold true for an abelian group. An abelian group can be of finite or infinite order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G.",
