The maximum possible order of an element in S_n is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n\nFor n = 6, the possible cycle lengths can range from 1 to 6. The maximum order will occur when the permutation is a single 6-cycle, for which the order is 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 6.",
