This statement is actually false. In reality, aH is a left coset of H with respect to a in G. It may or may not form a subgroup of G, depending on whether a is in H.\n\nStatement 2 states that if H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H. This statement is also false. If aH = bH, it means that a and b are in the same left coset of H. This happens if and only if ab^(-1) is in H, not just ab.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: False, False.",
