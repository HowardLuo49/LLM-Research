    "gpt_response": "To compute the product (20)(-8) in the ring Z_26, one must first reduce both numbers modulo 26. In this case, because Z_26 is a modulo 26 ring, this operation simply means taking the remainder after dividing by 26.\n\nFor 20 mod 26, we have 20 = 20 mod 26.\n\nFor -8 mod 26, we first find the equivalent positive integer by repeatedly adding 26 until we get a positive number less than 26. This gives us -8 + 26 = 18. Therefore, -8 = 18 mod 26.\n\nNow, in the given ring Z_26, we compute the product as (20)(-8) = (20)(18) mod 26. Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we have (20)(18) mod 26 = 360 mod 26 = 22 mod 26.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 22.",
