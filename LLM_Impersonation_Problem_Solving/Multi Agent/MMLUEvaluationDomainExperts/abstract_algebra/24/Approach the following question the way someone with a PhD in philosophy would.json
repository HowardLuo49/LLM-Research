    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first analyze the definitions of maximal and prime ideals in the context of commutative rings. A maximal ideal is an ideal that is maximal with respect to inclusion, meaning that there are no proper ideals containing it. A prime ideal, on the other hand, is an ideal that is prime with respect to the ring, meaning that if the product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of the elements must be in the ideal.\n\nNow, in the context of commutative rings, it is true that every maximal ideal is also a prime ideal. This is a fundamental result in ring theory, and can be proven by considering the contrapositive: if an ideal is not prime, then it cannot be maximal.\n\nMoving on to the second statement, if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field. This statement is also true, and can be proven using the fact that the quotient ring R/I inherits certain properties from R. In particular, because I is a maximal ideal, R/I will be a field, as the only ideals in a field are the zero ideal and the entire field itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True.",
