    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by relying on my understanding of group theory and the properties of normal subgroups. \n\nStatement 1 asserts that every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. This statement is true due to the fact that if a group has an order of 42, it must have a subgroup of order 7 by Sylow's theorems. Since this subgroup must be a Sylow 7-subgroup, it is also normal in the group.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8. This statement is false. In a group of order 42, the possible orders for normal subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. There is no guarantee that a group of order 42 will have a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nTherefore, based on my knowledge of group theory and normal subgroups, I would conclude that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: True, False.",
