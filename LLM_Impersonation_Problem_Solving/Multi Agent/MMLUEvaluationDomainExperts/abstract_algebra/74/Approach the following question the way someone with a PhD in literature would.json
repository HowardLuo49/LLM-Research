Statement 1 | If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2.

    "gpt_response": "To properly address these statements, one must consider the properties of groups in abstract algebra and understand the implications of these properties. In Statement 1, it is important to note that if a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2. This is because groups have the closure property, meaning that the result of multiplying two elements in the group will also be an element in the group. Therefore, if a^2 = b^2, then a^-1*b*b = a^-1*a, which implies that b = a. As the statement specifies that a is not equal to b, it follows that a^2 is not equal to b^2. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\nIn Statement 2, it is stated that the set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup. In group theory, a cyclic subgroup is a subgroup that is generated by a single element, and it exhibits cyclic behavior. In a dihedral group, the rotations can indeed form a cyclic subgroup, as they can be generated by a single rotation. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
