    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, I would analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 in terms of group theory and the properties of groups.\n\nStatement 1: If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2.\nThis statement can be analyzed by considering the group operation and the properties of group elements. In a group, each element has an inverse, and the group operation is associative. Since a and b are elements of a group, and a is not equal to b, we know that a^2 and b^2 are distinct elements in the group. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\nA dihedral group consists of rotations and reflections of a regular polygon. The rotations in a dihedral group can form a cyclic subgroup, as rotations around a regular polygon follow a cyclic pattern. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option A: True, True.",
