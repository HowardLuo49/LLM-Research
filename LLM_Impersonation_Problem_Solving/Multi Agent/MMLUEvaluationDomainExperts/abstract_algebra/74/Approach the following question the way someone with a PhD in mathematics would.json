Statement 1 | If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2. Statement 2 | The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\nA: True, True\nB: False, False\nC: True, False\nD: False, True",

    "gpt_response": "The first statement can be proven using the properties of groups. Since a and b are elements of a group, a^2 and b^2 must also be elements of the group because groups are closed under multiplication. If a is not equal to b, then it follows that a^2 is not equal to b^2 because if they were equal, then a = b which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nThe second statement can be proven by recognizing that the set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup generated by a single element. Each rotation can be represented as a power of a single rotation, therefore forming a cyclic subgroup. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
