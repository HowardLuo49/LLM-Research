    "gpt_response": "First, note that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is a degree 4 extension since it is a splitting field for the polynomial (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) over Q. This polynomial is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion and has roots sqrt(2), -sqrt(2), sqrt(3), -sqrt(3). Therefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 4. Hence, the correct answer is B: 4.",
