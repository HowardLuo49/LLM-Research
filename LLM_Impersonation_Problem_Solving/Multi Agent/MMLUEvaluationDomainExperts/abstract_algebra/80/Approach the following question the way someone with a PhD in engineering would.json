    "gpt_response": "To address these statements, we must first understand the concept of external direct product of groups and their properties.

This statement is true and can be proven by considering the external direct product of two cyclic groups Z_m and Z_n, which results in a cyclic group Z_{mn}.\n\nStatement 2 states that the external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12. This statement is false. The D_3 group is the dihedral group of order 6 and D_4 is the dihedral group of order 8. The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 would result in a group of order 48, not isomorphic to D_12 which has order 12.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
