In this case, the relation S is symmetric since for every (a, b) in S, (b, a) is also in S. \n\nAntisymmetry in a relation refers to the absence of symmetric pairs, meaning that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) cannot be in the relation unless a = b. In the relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}, there are no symmetric pairs, so the relation is also antisymmetric. \n\nTherefore, the relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} is both symmetric and antisymmetric.
