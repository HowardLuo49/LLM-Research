    "gpt_response": "To analyze these statements, we must first understand the concepts of linear transformations, injective functions, dimensionality, and bijections in the context of vector spaces.\n\nStatement 1: If T: V -> W is a linear transformation and dim(V) < dim(W), then T must be injective.\nExplanation: In a linear transformation, if dim(V) < dim(W), then there exist vectors in W that cannot be reached by T(V) because the dimension of V is less than the dimension of W. This implies that T cannot map distinct vectors in V to the same vector in W, making T necessarily injective.\n\nStatement 2: Let dim(V) = n and suppose that T: V -> V is linear. If T is injective, then it is a bijection.\nExplanation: An injective linear transformation preserves linear independence, meaning there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the input vector space V and the output vector space V. A linear transformation that is injective and surjective (i.e., bijective) is called a bijection.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False. The correct answer is C: True, False.",
