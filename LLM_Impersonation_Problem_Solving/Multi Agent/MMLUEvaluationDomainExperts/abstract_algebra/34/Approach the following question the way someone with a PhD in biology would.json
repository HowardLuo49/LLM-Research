    "gpt_response": "To analyze these statements, we must consider the properties of linear transformations and dimensionality in vector spaces. \n\nIn Statement 1, it is given that T is a linear transformation from V to W where the dimension of V is less than the dimension of W which is less than 1. In this case, since the dimension of V is less than the dimension of W, it implies that there exists a nontrivial kernel for T since the nullity of T is at least 1. Therefore, T cannot be injective. Hence, Statement 1 is false.\n\nIn Statement 2, it is given that T is a linear transformation from V to V where the dimension of V is n. If T is injective, it means that the nullity of T is 0 (i.e., the kernel of T is trivial). Since T is linear and injective, it implies that T is also surjective, and hence bijective. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: False, True.",
