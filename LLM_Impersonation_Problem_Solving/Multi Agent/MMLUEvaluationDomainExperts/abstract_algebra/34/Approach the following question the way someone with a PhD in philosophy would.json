    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the logical implications and relationships between the statements provided. \n\nIn Statement 1, it is stated that if a linear transformation T from vector space V to vector space W has a lower dimension than W, then T must be injective. This implies that the transformation is one-to-one, meaning that each element in V uniquely corresponds to an element in W. This assertion is true due to the nature of linear transformations.\n\nIn Statement 2, it is mentioned that for a linear transformation T from vector space V to itself, if T is injective (meaning one-to-one), then it is a bijection. A bijection is a function that is both injective and surjective (onto), meaning every element in the domain V has a unique corresponding element in the codomain V. This statement is also true based on the properties of injective linear transformations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True. Both statements hold true based on the properties of linear transformations in vector spaces.",
