The internal direct product of two groups G and H is denoted as G + H, and its order is equal to the product of the orders of G and H when G and H are finite groups.\n\nGiven Statement 1, it states that for finite groups G and H, the order of their internal direct product G + H is equal to the product of the orders of G and H. This is a known property of direct products and holds true for finite groups.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, it discusses the direct sum of cyclic groups Z_m and Z_n, and states that if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup that is isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. This statement is also true and can be proven using the properties of direct sums and cyclic groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True",
