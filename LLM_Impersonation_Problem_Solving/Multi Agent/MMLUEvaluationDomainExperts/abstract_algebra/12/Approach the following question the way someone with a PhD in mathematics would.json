    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the order of the factor group, we first need to determine the elements in the factor group. The factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) consists of all cosets of the form (a, b) + (<1, 1>), where a and b are elements of Z_11 and Z_15 respectively.\n\nLet's consider the elements of Z_11 x Z_15 modulo the subgroup <1, 1>:\n\n(0, 0) + <1, 1> = (<1, 1>)\n(1, 0) + <1, 1> = (<2, 0>)\n(2, 0) + <1, 1> = (<3, 0>)\n...\n(10, 0) + <1, 1> = (<0, 0>)\n\nSimilarly, we can find the remaining cosets. It can be observed that the cosets generated by (1, 0) and (0, 1) exhaust the entire factor group, and both generate the same set of elements.\n\nTherefore, the order of the factor group is equal to the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 0) which is the smallest positive integer k such that k*(1, 0) is an element of <1, 1>. In this case, we see that 11*(1, 0) = (0, 0) is the identity element, therefore the order of the factor group is 11.\n\nSo the answer is D: 11.",
