    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>), we first need to determine the order of the subgroup generated by the element (1, 1) in the direct product Z_11 x Z_15.\n\nThe order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1) is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the elements 1 in Z_11 and Z_15. Since the order of 1 in Z_11 is 11 and the order of 1 in Z_15 is 15, the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1) is LCM(11, 15) = 165.\n\nTherefore, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) is equal to the order of the direct product Z_11 x Z_15 divided by the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1). The order of Z_11 x Z_15 is 11 * 15 = 165.\n\nSo, the order of the factor group is 165 / 165 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1.",
