    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>), we first need to understand the structure of the group and the subgroup involved.\n\nThe direct product Z_11 x Z_15 is the set of all pairs (a, b) where a is an element of Z_11 and b is an element of Z_15. The operation on this group is defined component-wise, meaning (a, b) * (c, d) = (a+c, b+d) where the addition is done modulo 11 for a and modulo 15 for b.\n\nThe subgroup <1,1> is the subgroup of Z_11 x Z_15 generated by the element (1, 1). This subgroup is the set of all elements of the form (k, k) where k is an integer.\n\nTo find the factor group, we need to consider the cosets of this subgroup. The coset of an element (a, b) is the set {(a, b) + (k, k) : k is an integer}. We can easily see that the coset of (a, b) does not change if we add or subtract multiples of (1, 1).\n\nSince the order of the factor group is the number of distinct cosets, we need to determine how many distinct cosets there are in the factor group. This simply requires counting the number of distinct values of a and b modulo 11 and 15, respectively.\n\nThe order of the factor group will then be the product of these two counts. In this case, the order of Z_11 x Z_15 is 11*15 = 165. However, since the subgroup <1, 1> is the trivial subgroup in this case, all the cosets are the same, so the factor group is isomorphic to the trivial group consisting only of the identity element.\n\nTherefore, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) is 1. So the correct answer is (A) 1.",
