    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q, we first note that Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is contained in the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), since both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are contained in the field generated by Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)). \n\nNow, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is equal to the product of the degrees of the two field extensions Q(sqrt(2)) over Q and Q(sqrt(3)) over Q, because Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is generated by both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3).\n\nSince sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both algebraic over Q (satisfying polynomial equations with rational coefficients), the degrees of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q and Q(sqrt(3)) over Q are both 2. Therefore, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nB: 4",
