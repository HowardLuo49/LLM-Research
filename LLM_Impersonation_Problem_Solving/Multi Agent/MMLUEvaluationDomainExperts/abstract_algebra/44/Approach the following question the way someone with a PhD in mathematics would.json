Let's consider the element g(f(a1)). Since g is a function from B to A, g(f(a1)) is an element of A. However, according to the given condition g(f(a1)) = a1. Similarly, g(f(a2)) = a2. If f is not injective, then f(a1) = f(a2) implies a1 = a2, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, f must necessarily be injective.\n\nStatement 2 | The function f must necessarily be surjective:\nTo prove this statement, we will assume that f is not surjective, i.e., there exists an element b \u2208 B such that for all a \u2208 A, f(a) \u2260 b. Since g is a function from B to A, g(b) \u2208 A. However, there is no element a in A such that f(a) = b, which means g(f(a)) \u2260 a, contradicting the given condition. Therefore, f must necessarily be surjective.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is: A: True, True",
