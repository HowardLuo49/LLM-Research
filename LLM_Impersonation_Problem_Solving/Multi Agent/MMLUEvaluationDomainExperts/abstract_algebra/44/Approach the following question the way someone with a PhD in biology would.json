    "gpt_response": "Given the information provided, we know that g is a right inverse of f. In other words, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. \n\nStatement 1: The function f must necessarily be injective.\nProof: To show this, we assume that f is not injective, meaning there exist two distinct elements a, a' in A such that f(a) = f(a'). Since g is a right inverse of f, g(f(a)) = g(f(a')). However, this implies a = a', contradicting our assumption. Therefore, f must be injective.\n\nStatement 2: The function f must necessarily be surjective.\nProof: To show this, we assume that f is not surjective, meaning there exists an element b in B such that for all a in A, f(a) \u2260 b. Since g is a right inverse of f, g(b) = a for some a in A. This implies that b = f(a), contradicting our assumption. Therefore, f must be surjective.\n\nTherefore, both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. The correct answer is A: True, True.",
