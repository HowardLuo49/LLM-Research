An injective function is one where each element of the domain maps to a distinct element of the codomain. In this case, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A implies that for each a in A, there exists a unique element in B that maps to a through function f. Therefore, the function f is injective.\n\nNext, to determine if the function f must necessarily be surjective, we look at the definition of surjective functions. A surjective function is one where every element of the codomain is mapped to by at least one element of the domain. In this case, since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it implies that for each element in B, there exists an element in A that maps to it through function f.
