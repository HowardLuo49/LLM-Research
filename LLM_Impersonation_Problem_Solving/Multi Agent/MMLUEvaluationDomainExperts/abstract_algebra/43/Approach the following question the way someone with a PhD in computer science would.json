In this case, the integral domain must be infinite because there are infinitely many integers.\n\nOn the other hand, an integral domain with prime characteristic means that the characteristic of the ring is a prime number. In this case, the ring could potentially be finite, such as the ring Z/pZ, where p is a prime number.",
