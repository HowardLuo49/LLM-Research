    "gpt_response": "In the realm of algebraic structures, specifically in the study of vector spaces, the two statements presented encapsulate fundamental properties that are crucial to understanding the structure and behavior of vectors within a linear framework. \n\nThe first statement asserts that in a finite dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis. This is indeed true by the definition of a basis - a basis is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire vector space. Thus, any linearly independent set of vectors in a finite dimensional vector space can be extended to form a basis.\n\nThe second statement posits that if B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then the cardinality of B_1 is equal to the cardinality of B_2. This statement is also true due to the defining properties of a basis - any two bases for the same vector space will have the same number of vectors, known as the dimension of the vector space. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
