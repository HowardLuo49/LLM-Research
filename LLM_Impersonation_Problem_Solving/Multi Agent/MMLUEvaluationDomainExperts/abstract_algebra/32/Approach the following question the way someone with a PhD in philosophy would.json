This statement is inherently true as it aligns with the foundational principles of linear algebra. A basis is defined as a set of vectors that is linearly independent and spans the vector space. Therefore, any linearly independent set of vectors must be contained within a basis by definition.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that if B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then the cardinality of B_1 is equal to the cardinality of B_2. This statement is also true, as bases for the same vector space must have the same number of vectors. This is due to the fact that any basis for a vector space must have the same dimension, which in turn dictates the cardinality of the basis.\n\nIn conclusion, both statements are true and the correct answer is A: True, True.",
