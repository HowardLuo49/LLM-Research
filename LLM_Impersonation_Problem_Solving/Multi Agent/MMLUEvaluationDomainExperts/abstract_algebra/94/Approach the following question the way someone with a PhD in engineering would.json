    "gpt_response": "To analyze these statements as someone with a PhD in engineering, we must first define some terms. \n\nStatement 1 states that Q is an extension field of Z_2. An extension field E of a field F is a field containing F as a subfield. In this case, Q is the field of rational numbers and Z_2 is the field of integers modulo 2. Observation shows that Q is an extension field of Z_2 since Z_2 contains the field of integers, which in turn contains the field of rational numbers.\n\nStatement 2 states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement can be proven using the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Since the complex numbers form an extension field of the real numbers, this statement holds true.\n\nTherefore, based on the definitions and reasoning outlined above, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True.",
