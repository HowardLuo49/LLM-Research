In a subring, the unity element must be the same as the unity element in the original ring.\n\nStatement 2: Every field is an integral domain. This statement is also true. A field is a commutative ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. Therefore, every field is an integral domain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
