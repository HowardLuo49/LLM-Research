    "gpt_response": "In response to Statement 1, the unity of a subring does not necessarily have to be the same as the unity of the ring. A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring with the same operations as the original ring. Therefore, the unity of a subring must fulfill the properties of a unity element in a ring, but it may not be the same element as the unity of the original ring. \n\nRegarding Statement 2, every field is indeed an integral domain. A field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, where both operations are commutative and associative, and multiplication is distributive over addition. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is also non-zero. Since a field satisfies all the properties of an integral domain by definition, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
