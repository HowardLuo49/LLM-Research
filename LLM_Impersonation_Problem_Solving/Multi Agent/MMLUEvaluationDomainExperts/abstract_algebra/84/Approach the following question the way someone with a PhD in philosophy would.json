This means that every element in set A maps to a unique element in set B under the function g. Given the initial condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in set A, it follows that g is indeed injective. If g were not injective, then multiple elements in A would map to the same element in B, which would violate the original equation. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 posits that the function g must necessarily be surjective. This would mean that every element in set B has a pre-image in set A under the function g. However, the initial condition g(f(a)) = a does not require that every element in B has a pre-image in A. It only mandates that for each element a in A, there exists a pre-image in B. Thus, there is no necessity for g to be surjective based on the given information. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is C: True, False.
