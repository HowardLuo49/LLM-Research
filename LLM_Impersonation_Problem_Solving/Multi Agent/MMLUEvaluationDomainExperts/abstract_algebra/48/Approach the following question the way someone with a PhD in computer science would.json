    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the definitions and properties of integral domains and polynomial rings.\n\nFor Statement 1, we know that an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where the product of any two non-zero elements is also non-zero. In this case, if R is an integral domain, then R[x], the polynomial ring over R, is also an integral domain. This is because the properties of integral domains are inherited by polynomial rings formed over them. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nFor Statement 2, the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. The degree of the product of two polynomials is not necessarily equal to the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. In general, the degree of the product is at most the sum of the degrees. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
