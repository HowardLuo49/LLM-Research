    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in biology, my understanding of the question is limited. However, I can try to provide an attempt at answering it by dissecting the statements based on my knowledge of logical reasoning and scientific principles.\n\nStatement 1 states that if R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain. An integral domain is a type of commutative ring with unity, where the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. R[x] is the set of all polynomials with coefficients in R. In this context, it is well-known in algebraic structures that the polynomial ring R[x] formed by adding a variable x to an integral domain R is itself an integral domain. This is because the properties that define an integral domain carry over to polynomial rings.\n\nStatement 2 states that if R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x). Here, deg stands for the degree of a polynomial, which is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. The statement claims that the degree of the product of two polynomials is equal to the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. However, this statement is false. In fact, the degree of the product of two polynomials is not necessarily equal to the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. The degree of the product can be less than or equal to the sum of the degrees, depending on the specific polynomials involved.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer would be C: True, False.",
