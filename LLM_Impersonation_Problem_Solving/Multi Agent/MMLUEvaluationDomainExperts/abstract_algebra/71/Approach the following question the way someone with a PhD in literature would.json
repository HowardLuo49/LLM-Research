    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q, first note that we can express sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) as sqrt(6). Therefore, the field extension is Q(sqrt(6)) over Q.\n\nThe degree of the extension Q(sqrt(6)) over Q is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q. Since the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) is x^2 - 6, we see that the degree of the field extension is 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 2",
