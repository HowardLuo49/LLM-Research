    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a mathematical standpoint. \n\nIn group theory, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where g is the element and e is the identity element. \n\nGiven Statement 1, if a group has an element of order 15, it means that there is at least one element in the group that satisfies g^15 = e. Since the order of an element divides the order of the group, the group must have at least 15 elements. However, it is not necessarily true that there must be at least 8 elements of order 15. For example, if the group is cyclic of order 15, then every element other than the identity will have order 15. Therefore, Statement 1 is false. \n\nGiven Statement 2, if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it implies that there are at least 9 elements of order 15. Following the same logic as above, the group must have at least 15 elements. If there are more than 8 elements of order 15, and every element of order 15 must have an order that divides 15, it follows that the group must have at least 16 elements of order 15. Therefore, Statement 2 is true. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is False, True (Option D).",
