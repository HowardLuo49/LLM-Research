This statement is false because a group could have multiple elements of order 15 without necessarily having at least 8 elements of order 15. \n\nStatement 2 states that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This statement is true because if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then it must have at least 16 elements of order 15 to ensure that each element has a distinct order. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: False, True.",
