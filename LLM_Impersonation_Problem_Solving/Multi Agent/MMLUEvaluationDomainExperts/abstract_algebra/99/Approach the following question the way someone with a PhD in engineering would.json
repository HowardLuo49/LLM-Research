    "gpt_response": "An ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of the ring. Statement 1 is true because by definition, every ideal is required to be a subring of the ring.\n\nOn the other hand, every subring of a ring is not necessarily an ideal of the ring. For example, consider the ring of integers Z. The subset 2Z (the set of all multiples of 2) is a subring of Z since it is closed under addition and multiplication. However, it is not an ideal of Z because it is not closed under multiplication by arbitrary elements of Z. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
