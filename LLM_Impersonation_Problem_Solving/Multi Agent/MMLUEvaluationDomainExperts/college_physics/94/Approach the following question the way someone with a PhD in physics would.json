    "gpt_response": "To calculate the angular momentum of a satellite in a circular orbit, we use the formula L = mvr, where m is the mass of the satellite, v is the orbital velocity, and r is the orbital radius. Since the satellites are identical, their masses are the same.\n\nLet's denote the orbital radius of satellite A as 2R and the orbital radius of satellite B as R. According to Kepler's third law, the square of the orbital period T is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius:\n\n(T_A)^2 / R_A^3 = (T_B)^2 / R_B^3\n\nSince the satellites are in circular orbits, their orbital velocities are given by:\n\nv_A = 2\u03c0(2R) / T_A\nv_B = 2\u03c0(R) / T_B\n\nNow, let's calculate the angular momentum of each satellite:\n\nL_A = m v_A (2R)\nL_B = m v_B R\n\nSubstitute the expressions for v_A and v_B into the angular momentum equations, and we get:\n\nL_A = 4\u03c0mR^2\nL_B = 2\u03c0mR^2\n\nFinally, the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is:\n\nL_A / L_B = (4\u03c0mR^2) / (2\u03c0mR^2) = 2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2.",
