    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the ratio of the angular momentum of satellite A to satellite B, we can start by using the formula for angular momentum in circular orbits. Angular momentum is given by the product of the mass, velocity, and orbital radius of the satellite.\n\nLet the orbital radius of satellite B be r, so the orbital radius of satellite A is 2r. Since the satellites are identical, they have the same mass and move at the same velocity.\n\nThe angular momentum of a satellite in a circular orbit is given by L = mvr, where L is the angular momentum, m is the mass of the satellite, v is the velocity of the satellite, and r is the orbital radius.\n\nFor satellite A:\nL_A = m*v*(2r) = 2mvr\n\nFor satellite B:\nL_B = m*v*r\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the angular momentum of A to B is:\nL_A / L_B = (2mvr) / (mvr) = 2\n\nThus, the correct answer is B: 2.",
