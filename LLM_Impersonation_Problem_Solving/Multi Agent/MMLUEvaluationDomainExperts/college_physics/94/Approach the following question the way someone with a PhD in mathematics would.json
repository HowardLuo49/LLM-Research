The orbital radius of A is twice that of B. Which of the following gives the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B?\nA: 4\nB: 2\nC: sqrt(2)\nD: 1/sqrt(2)",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of angular momentum in a circular orbit. The angular momentum of an object in a circular orbit is given by L = mvr, where m is the mass of the object, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the orbit.\n\nIn this case, both satellites A and B are identical, so they have the same mass. Let's denote the radius of satellite B's orbit as r, and the radius of satellite A's orbit as 2r (since the radius of A is twice that of B). \n\nThe velocities of the satellites are different because they are in circular orbits, and the velocity of an object in a circular orbit is given by v = sqrt(GM/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the radius of the orbit.\n\nNow, let's calculate the angular momentum of satellite A (LA) and satellite B (LB):\n\nLA = m * vA * 2r = 2m * sqrt(GM/(2r)) * 2r = 4m * sqrt(GM * r) = 4 * sqrt(m^2 * GM * r)\n\nLB = m * vB * r = m * sqrt(GM/r) * r = sqrt(m^2 * GM * r)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is:\n\nLA/LB = (4 * sqrt(m^2 * GM * r))/(sqrt(m^2 * GM * r)) = 4\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 4.",
