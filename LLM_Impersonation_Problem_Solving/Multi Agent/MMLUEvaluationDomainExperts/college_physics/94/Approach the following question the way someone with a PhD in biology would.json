The orbital radius of A is twice that of B. Which of the following gives the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B?\nA: 4\nB: 2\nC: sqrt(2)\nD: 1/sqrt(2)",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the ratio of the angular momentum of satellite A to satellite B, we first need to understand the relationship between angular momentum and orbital radius in a circular orbit. Angular momentum in a circular orbit is given by the equation L = mvr, where L is the angular momentum, m is the mass of the satellite, v is the orbital velocity, and r is the orbital radius.\n\nSince the satellites are identical, their masses are the same. The orbital radius of satellite A is twice that of satellite B, so we can denote the orbital radius of satellite A as 2r and the orbital radius of satellite B as r.\n\nThe orbital velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit is given by the equation v = \u221a(GM/r), where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of Earth.\n\nSubstituting the values of v for each satellite, we get vA = \u221a(GM/(2r)) and vB = \u221a(GM/r).\n\nNow, if we substitute these values into the equation for angular momentum, we get:\n\nLA = m(vA)(2r) = 2m\u221a(GM/(2r)) * 2r = 4m\u221a(GMr)\n\nLB = m(vB)r = m\u221a(GM/r) * r = m\u221a(GMr)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the angular momentum of satellite A to the angular momentum of satellite B is:\n\nLA/LB = 4m\u221a(GMr) / m\u221a(GMr) = 4\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 4.",
