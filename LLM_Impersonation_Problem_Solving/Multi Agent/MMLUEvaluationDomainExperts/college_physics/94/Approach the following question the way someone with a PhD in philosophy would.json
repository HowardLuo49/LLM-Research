The orbital radius of A is twice that of B. Which of the following gives the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B?\nA: 4\nB: 2\nC: sqrt(2)\nD: 1/sqrt(2)",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Firstly, let us define the angular momentum of a satellite in a circular orbit as L= mvr, where m is the mass of the satellite, v is its velocity, and r is the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nGiven that satellites A and B are identical, we can assume they have the same mass, m. Since A has an orbital radius twice that of B, we can express the ratio of their angular momenta as follows:\n\nLet the orbital radius of satellite A be 2r and that of satellite B be r. Thus, the velocity of satellite A, Va = \u03c9A * 2r = 2 \u03c9A r, and the velocity of satellite B, Vb = \u03c9B * r, where \u03c9A and \u03c9B are the angular velocities of satellites A and B respectively.\n\nSince both satellites are in circular orbits, the same gravitational force is acting on them, and hence the centripetal force required for circular motion must be the same for both satellites. Therefore, we can set the gravitational force, F, equal to the centripetal force for both satellites:\n\nG * M * m / r^2 = m * Vb^2 / r = m * Va^2 / 2r,\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth.\n\nRearranging the above equation yields:\n\nVb^2 = 2 \u03c9A^2 r,\n\nwhich means that the velocity of satellite B (Vb) is related to the velocity of satellite A (Va) by a factor of \u221a2.\nTherefore, the ratio of angular momentum of satellite A to angular momentum of satellite B is:\n\nL(A) / L(B) = m * 2 \u03c9A r * 2r / m * \u03c9B r * r\n= 4 * m * \u03c9A r^2 / m * \u03c9B r^2\n= 4 * (r / \u03c9B) / (r / \u03c9A)\n= 4 * (Vb) / (Va)\n= 4 / \u221a2\n= 2\u221a2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C: \u221a2.",
