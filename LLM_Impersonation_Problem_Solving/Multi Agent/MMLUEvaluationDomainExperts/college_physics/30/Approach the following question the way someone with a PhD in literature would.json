Einstein\u2019s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the\nA: work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency\nB: work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength\nC: current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength\nD: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency",

    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, my expertise lies in analyzing and interpreting texts and cultural artifacts rather than scientific theories. However, I can attempt to provide an academic perspective on this question.\n\nIn the context of Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect, it is important to understand the implications of his groundbreaking work in the field of physics. The photoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon where light incident on a material surface causes the ejection of electrons, leading to the generation of an electric current. This effect was a crucial development in the understanding of the particle nature of light and the quantization of energy in electromagnetic radiation.\n\nBased on my understanding of the photoelectric effect, the correct answer to the question is likely option D: the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. This statement aligns with Einstein's theory, which posits that the energy of the emitted electrons is determined by the frequency of the incident light. Above the threshold frequency, increasing the frequency of the light will result in higher energy electrons being emitted, requiring a greater potential difference to stop their motion.\n\nIn conclusion, the question at hand delves into the intricacies of Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect and its implications for the behavior of electrons emitted from a metal surface under the influence of light. A thorough understanding of this theory is essential for grasping the fundamental principles underlying the interaction between light and matter on a quantum level.",
