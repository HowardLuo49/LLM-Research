    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first understand the concept of quantum efficiency in photon detectors. Quantum efficiency is a measure of the effectiveness of a detector in converting incident photons into electronic signals. In this case, the quantum efficiency of the detector is 0.1, meaning that it detects 10% of the incident photons.\n\nWhen 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, we can expect that on average, the detector will detect 10 photons (100 * 0.1 = 10). However, due to the probabilistic nature of photon detection, there will be variations in the actual number of photons detected each time the experiment is repeated.\n\nThe root mean square (rms) deviation is a measure of the spread of values around the average. In this case, the rms deviation can be calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the actual number of photons detected and the average number of photons detected, divided by the total number of measurements.\n\nGiven that the quantum efficiency is 0.1 and 100 photons are sent into the detector, the expected average number of photons detected is 10. The rms deviation can be estimated to be around 3, as the spread of values around the average of 10 will typically be within 3 photons. Therefore, the correct answer is B: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
