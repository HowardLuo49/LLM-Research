The gravitational influence exerted by a black hole differs significantly from that of a star, leading to altered trajectories and behaviors of celestial bodies subject to its gravitational pull.\n\nIn this scenario, it is unlikely that the orbits of the planets would remain unchanged. The presence of a black hole as the central body would introduce new gravitational forces and perturbations that would likely disrupt the stable elliptical orbits previously maintained by the planets. The orbits would likely undergo significant alterations, potentially resulting in oscillations or spiral trajectories as the planets adjust to the unique gravitational environment introduced by the black hole.\n\nTherefore, option C, \"The planets would oscillate about their former elliptical orbits,\" appears to be the most plausible outcome in response to the hypothetical scenario presented.
