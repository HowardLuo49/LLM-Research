If the Sun were suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass, it would have a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m.

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, my expertise lies in the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. However, I can provide an answer to this question based on my understanding of basic astrophysics principles.\n\nGiven that the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with the same mass as the Sun is 3,000 m, it is important to note that the Schwarzschild radius is the radius at which the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. This means that anything, including light, that crosses this radius cannot escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\nIn the scenario where the Sun is suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the planets in the solar system would continue to move in their elliptical orbits around the black hole, as dictated by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The gravitational force experienced by the planets would change, as it would be determined by the mass of the black hole at the center rather than the mass of the Sun. However, since the mass remains the same, the orbits of the planets would not change significantly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The orbits would remain unchanged.",
