Two students perform an experiment in which they drop a ball from rest from a known height above the ground and measure the speed of the ball just before it strikes the ground. From repeated measurement, the students estimate the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball to be 10 percent. Which of the following gives the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball? (Assume the uncertainty in the ball\u2019s mass is negligibly small.)\nA: 5%\nB: 10%\nC: 15%\nD: 20%",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball, we first need to understand the relationship between the speed of the ball and its kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.\n\nSince the uncertainty in the speed of the ball is 10%, we can calculate the uncertainty in the kinetic energy using the formula for calculating the uncertainty in a quantity calculated from other measured quantities. In this case, the formula is \u03b4KE/KE = 2 * \u03b4v/v, where \u03b4KE is the uncertainty in the kinetic energy, \u03b4v is the uncertainty in the speed, and v is the speed of the ball.\n\nPlugging in the given values, \u03b4KE/KE = 2 * 0.1 = 0.2, or 20%. Therefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is 20%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 20%.",
