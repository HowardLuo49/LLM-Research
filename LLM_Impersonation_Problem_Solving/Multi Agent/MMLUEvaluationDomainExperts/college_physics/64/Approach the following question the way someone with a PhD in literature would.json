    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I will approach this question with a focus on critical analysis and interpretation. It is clear that the relationship between the periods of the two pendulums indicates a specific mathematical connection between their respective lengths. In order to determine which of the given options is true, it is crucial to apply principles of physics and mathematical reasoning.\n\nFirstly, let us consider the formula for the period of a simple pendulum: T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g), where T is the period, L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Given that the two pendulums A and B are subject to equal gravitational fields, the only varying factor affecting their periods is the length of the strings.\n\nAccording to the question, the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A. Mathematically, this can be expressed as T_B = 2T_A. Substituting the period formula into this equation gives 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2(2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)). Simplifying this equation, we find \u221a(L_B) = 2\u221a(L_A), which further simplifies to L_B = 4L_A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: L_B = 4L_A. This conclusion is in alignment with the mathematical relationship between the periods of the two pendulums, as dictated by their respective lengths.",
