An organ pipe, closed at one end and open at the other, is designed to have a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). What is the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe?\nA: 44 Hz\nB: 196 Hz\nC: 262 Hz\nD: 393 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the frequency of the next higher harmonic for the organ pipe, we must first understand the harmonics of a closed-open pipe. \n\nFor a closed-open pipe, the fundamental frequency (first harmonic) occurs when the length of the pipe is equal to one-fourth of the wavelength of the sound wave. The next higher harmonic (second harmonic) occurs when the length of the pipe is equal to three-fourths of the wavelength of the sound wave.\n\nGiven that the fundamental frequency of the organ pipe is 131 Hz (C), we can calculate the next higher harmonic frequency by using the formula:\n\nf\u2082 = 3f\u2081\n\nf\u2082 = 3 * 131 Hz\n\nf\u2082 = 393 Hz\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 393 Hz",
