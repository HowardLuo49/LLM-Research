An organ pipe, closed at one end and open at the other, is designed to have a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). What is the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe?\nA: 44 Hz\nB: 196 Hz\nC: 262 Hz\nD: 393 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe, we need to consider the fundamental frequency and the harmonic series. In a closed-open pipe, the fundamental frequency for the pipe is given by f = v / (4L), where v is the speed of sound in air and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nGiven that the fundamental frequency is 131 Hz, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the speed of sound in air: v = 4L * 131 Hz.\n\nNext, we know that the frequency of the next higher harmonic is three times the fundamental frequency for a closed-open pipe. This means that the next higher harmonic frequency is 3 * 131 Hz = 393 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 393 Hz.",
