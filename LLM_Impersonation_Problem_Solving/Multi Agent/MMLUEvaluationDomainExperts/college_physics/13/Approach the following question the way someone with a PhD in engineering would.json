    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by applying knowledge of nuclear reactions and mass-energy equivalence. The primary source of the Sun's energy is nuclear fusion, specifically the fusion of hydrogen atoms to form helium. \n\nThe correct answer is B: four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom. This is because in the process of nuclear fusion, four hydrogen atoms combine to form one helium atom, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This energy is derived from the mass difference between the initial hydrogen atoms and the final helium atom, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.\n\nTherefore, the energy produced in the Sun's thermonuclear reactions is equal to the mass difference between four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom, which results in a significant amount of energy being released to sustain the Sun's radiative output.",
