    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in engineering, we need to analyze the fundamentals of the photoelectric effect and how it relates to the light frequency and metal properties.\n\nAccording to Einstein's photoelectric effect theory, the energy of a photon incident on a metal surface must be greater than the work function of the metal in order to eject an electron. This relationship can be described by the equation:\n\nE = hf - \u03a6\n\nwhere E is the energy of the ejected electron, h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the incident light, and \u03a6 is the work function of the metal.\n\nFrom this equation, it is evident that the work function of the metal is directly related to the frequency of the incident light, as the energy required to eject an electron is dependent on the frequency of the incident light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\nA: work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency\n\nThis understanding is crucial in engineering applications involving photoelectric devices, as it allows engineers to manipulate the properties of materials and incident light to optimize the efficiency and performance of such devices.",
