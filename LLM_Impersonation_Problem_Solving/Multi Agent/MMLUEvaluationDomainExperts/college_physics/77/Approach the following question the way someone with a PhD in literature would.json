    "gpt_response": "As an individual with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question by acknowledging that my expertise lies outside of the field of physics. I would rely on my understanding of academic research and critical thinking skills to analyze the question in a logical manner.\n\nGiven the context of the question and my limited knowledge of physics, I would first consider the principles of Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect. I would recall that this theory explains how electrons are emitted from a metal surface when it is exposed to light of sufficient frequency.\n\nBased on this understanding, I would likely deduce that the correct answer is option D: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. This is because the frequency of light is directly related to the energy of the photons, which in turn determines the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons.\n\nIn summary, while I may not possess deep expertise in physics, I can utilize my analytical skills to interpret the question and arrive at a logical conclusion based on the information provided.",
