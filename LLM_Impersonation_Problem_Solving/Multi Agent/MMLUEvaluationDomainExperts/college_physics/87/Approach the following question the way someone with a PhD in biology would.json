    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by applying principles of light polarization. When unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers with their transmission axes oriented at a 45-degree angle to each other, the transmitted intensity through both polarizers is equal to the cosine squared of the angle between their transmission axes.\n\nMathematically, the transmitted intensity (I_transmitted) can be calculated using the equation:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(\u03b8)\n\nWhere I_incident is the incident intensity of unpolarized light and \u03b8 is the angle between the transmission axes of the polarizers (45 degrees in this case).\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nI_transmitted = I_incident * cos^2(45 degrees)\nI_transmitted = I_incident * (cos(45 degrees))^2\nI_transmitted = I_incident * (sqrt(2)/2)^2\nI_transmitted = I_incident * 1/2\nI_transmitted = 0.5 * I_incident\n\nTherefore, the transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is 50% of the incident intensity.
