Unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers whose transmission axes make an angle of 45q with each other. The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\nA: 100%\nB: 75%\nC: 50%\nD: 25%",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In examining the scenario described involving unpolarized light incident on a pair of linear polarizers with transmission axes oriented at a 45 degree angle relative to each other, we must consider the fundamental principles of polarization and optical transmission. \n\nLinear polarizers are devices that selectively transmit light waves oscillating in a particular plane, effectively filtering out light waves vibrating perpendicular to their transmission axis. When unpolarized light is incident on a linear polarizer, only half of the light's intensity aligned with the polarizer's transmission axis will be transmitted. \n\nWhen unpolarized light is subsequently passed through a second linear polarizer oriented at a 45 degree angle to the first, the intensity of light transmitted through both polarizers is dependent on the relative alignment of the light waves to the transmission axes of the polarizers. \n\nDue to the nature of the setup described, where the transmission axes of the two polarizers are oriented at a 45 degree angle relative to each other, the intensity of light transmitted through both polarizers will be maximized. This is because the orientation of the polarizers allows for light waves to be efficiently transmitted through the second polarizer after being filtered by the first, resulting in an intensity equivalent to 100% of the incident light.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA: 100%",
