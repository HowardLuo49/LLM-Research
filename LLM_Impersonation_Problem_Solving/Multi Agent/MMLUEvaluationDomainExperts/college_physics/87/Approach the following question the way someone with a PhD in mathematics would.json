Unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers whose transmission axes make an angle of 45q with each other. The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\nA: 100%\nB: 75%\nC: 50%\nD: 25%",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first considering the properties of ideal linear polarizers. Ideal linear polarizers transmit light that oscillates only in a specific direction aligned with their transmission axis. When unpolarized light is incident on a linear polarizer, only half of the light is transmitted because the other half is blocked.\n\nIn this case, the two linear polarizers have transmission axes that are at an angle of 45 degrees with each other. When unpolarized light passes through the first polarizer, only half of the intensity is transmitted. However, when this partially polarized light then passes through the second polarizer with a transmission axis at a 45-degree angle, it is fully transmitted because the orientation of the light aligns with the transmission axis of the second polarizer.\n\nTherefore, the transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is 100% of the incident intensity. The correct answer is A: 100%.",
