Unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers whose transmission axes make an angle of 45q with each other. The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\nA: 100%\nB: 75%\nC: 50%\nD: 25%",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, it is important to first understand the concept of polarization in the context of ideal linear polarizers. When unpolarized light passes through a linear polarizer, the intensity of the light is reduced by half, assuming the transmission axis of the polarizer is perpendicular to the initial polarization of the light. \n\nIn the scenario described, the transmission axes of the two ideal linear polarizers are at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to each other. When unpolarized light passes through the first polarizer, half of its intensity is transmitted. Subsequently, when this partially polarized light encounters the second polarizer with its transmission axis at a 45-degree angle from the first polarizer, the intensity of the light passing through it is further reduced by half. \n\nMathematically, the overall amount of light transmitted through both polarizers can be calculated using Malus's Law, which states that the intensity of light passing through a polarizer is proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizer and the initial polarization of the light. \n\nIn this case, when the angle between the transmission axes of the two polarizers is 45 degrees, the intensity transmitted through both polarizers would be:\n\n(0.5)^2 * (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nThis means that 25% of the incident intensity of unpolarized light will be transmitted through both polarizers in this configuration.
