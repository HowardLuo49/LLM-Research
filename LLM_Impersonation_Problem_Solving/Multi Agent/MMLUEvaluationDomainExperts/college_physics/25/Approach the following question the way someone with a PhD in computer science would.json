To create an n-type semiconductor, we need to introduce donor ions that have extra electrons to contribute to the conduction band of the material. This typically involves using group V elements such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), which have 5 valence electrons and can easily donate an electron to the germanium lattice.\n\nBoron (B), on the other hand, is a group III element with only 3 valence electrons. When doped into germanium, boron acts as an acceptor impurity, creating holes in the valence band rather than contributing extra electrons to the conduction band. This results in a p-type semiconductor rather than an n-type semiconductor.\n\nTherefore, the ion that CANNOT be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor is D: B (Boron).",
