    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which ion cannot be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor, we must consider the electronic configuration of germanium and the potential dopant ions.\n\nGermanium has an atomic number of 32, with an electronic configuration of 1s\u00b22s\u00b22p\u20763s\u00b23p\u20763d\u00b9\u20704s\u00b24p\u00b2. In order to create an n-type semiconductor, we need to introduce an electron donor impurity that can contribute free electrons to the semiconductor.\n\nThe ions As, P, Sb, and B all have the potential to donate electrons and create an n-type semiconductor. However, the ion B (boron) has an electronic configuration of 1s\u00b22s\u00b22p\u00b9, which means it can only donate 1 electron. This would not be sufficient to create an n-type semiconductor in germanium, as we need a dopant that can donate more than 1 electron.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: B.",
