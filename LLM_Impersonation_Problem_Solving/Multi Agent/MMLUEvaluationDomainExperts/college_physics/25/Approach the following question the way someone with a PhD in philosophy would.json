This extra electron is able to occupy the conduction band, increasing the number of charge carriers and hence conductivity. Therefore, suitable dopants for creating n-type germanium include group V elements such as phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), which have five valence electrons.\n\nOn the other hand, boron (B) is a group III element with three valence electrons. When introduced as a dopant in germanium, it would create holes in the valence band instead of additional free electrons in the conduction band. This would lead to the formation of p-type germanium, where the majority charge carriers are positively charged holes rather than negatively charged electrons.\n\nTherefore, of the ions listed, boron (B) would be the ion that CANNOT be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor.",
