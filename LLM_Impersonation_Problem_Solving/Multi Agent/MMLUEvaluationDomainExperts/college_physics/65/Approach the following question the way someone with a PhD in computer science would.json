    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is D: interactions with the ionic lattice. \n\nThe BCS theory, proposed by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer in 1957, explains the phenomenon of superconductivity by considering the formation of Cooper pairs of electrons. These pairs form due to electron-phonon interactions with the ionic lattice, leading to a net attraction between the electrons that allows them to move through the material without resistance. The weak and strong nuclear forces are not directly involved in this process, and vacuum polarization is not a relevant mechanism in the BCS theory of superconductivity.",
