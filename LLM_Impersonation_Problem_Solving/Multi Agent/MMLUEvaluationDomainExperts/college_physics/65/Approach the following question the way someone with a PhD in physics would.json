According to the BCS theory, the attraction between Cooper pairs in a superconductor is due to\nA: the weak nuclear force\nB: the strong nuclear force\nC: vacuum polarization\nD: interactions with the ionic lattice",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is D: interactions with the ionic lattice. In the BCS theory of superconductivity, Cooper pairs are formed due to the electron-phonon interaction with the crystal lattice. This interaction results in an effective attractive force between electrons, leading to the formation of Cooper pairs and the phenomenon of superconductivity. The weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force, and vacuum polarization are not directly involved in the BCS theory of superconductivity.",
