    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

    "gpt_response": "As a literary scholar with a PhD, I must say that the question you have posed seems to be outside my realm of expertise. However, I can attempt to analyze it from a different perspective.\n\nIn this scenario, we can apply principles of classical mechanics to determine the magnitude of the applied force. The initial kinetic energy of the box is given by KE1 = 0.5 * m * v1^2 = 0.5 * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 5 J.\n\nWhen the force is applied and the box travels 5 m, work is done on the box, increasing its kinetic energy. The work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box: work = KE2 - KE1 = 0.5 * m * v2^2 - 0.5 * m * v1^2 = 0.5 * 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2 - 0.5 * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 15 J.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force can be calculated using the work-energy principle: work = force * distance, so force = work / distance = 15 J / 5 m = 3 N.\n\nThus, based on the principles of classical mechanics, the correct answer is C: 3 N.",
