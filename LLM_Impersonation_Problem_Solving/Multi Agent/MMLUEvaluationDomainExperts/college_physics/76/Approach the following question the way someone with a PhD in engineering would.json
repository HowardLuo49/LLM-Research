    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of work and energy. The work-energy principle states that the net work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. \n\nInitially, the kinetic energy of the box is given by KE1 = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s)^2 = 5 J.\n\nWhen the constant force is applied and the box travels 5 m, the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the box. The final kinetic energy of the box is given by KE2 = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(10 kg)(2 m/s)^2 = 20 J.\n\nTherefore, the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy, which is 20 J - 5 J = 15 J.\n\nThe work done by the force is given by the equation W = F\u0394x, where F is the magnitude of the force and \u0394x is the distance traveled with the force applied. Therefore, F(5m) = 15 J.\n\nSolving for F, we get F = 15 J / 5m = 3 N.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N. The correct answer is C.",
