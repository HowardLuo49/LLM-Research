At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnitude of the applied force, we can use the work-energy principle. The work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. \n\nInitially, the box has a kinetic energy of (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2) * 10 * (1)^2 = 5 J.\n\nAfter the constant force is applied and the box travels 5 m, the work done on the box is equal to the force multiplied by the distance traveled, which is F * d = 5F J. This work will result in a change in kinetic energy of the box.\n\nFinally, when the force is removed after traveling 5 m, the box has a kinetic energy of (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2) * 10 * (2)^2 = 20 J.\n\nUsing the work-energy principle, we can set up the equation:\n\n5F = 20 - 5\n\n5F = 15\n\nF = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C.",
