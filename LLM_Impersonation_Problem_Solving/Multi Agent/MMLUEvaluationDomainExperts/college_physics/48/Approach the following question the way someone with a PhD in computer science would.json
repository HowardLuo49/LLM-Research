A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of special relativity and the concept of the index of refraction. The formula to calculate the speed of light in a medium with index of refraction n is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nGiven that the speed of the water is 1/2 c relative to the lab frame, we can use the relativistic addition of velocities formula to find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame.\n\nw = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c^2)\nwhere w is the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame, u is the speed of light in vacuum, v is the speed of the water, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nPlugging in the values:\nw = (c + (1/2 c)) / (1 + (1/2)c^2/c^2)\n   = (3/2 c) / (3/2)\n   = c\nTherefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is equal to c, or 1/1 c.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 1/1 c.",
