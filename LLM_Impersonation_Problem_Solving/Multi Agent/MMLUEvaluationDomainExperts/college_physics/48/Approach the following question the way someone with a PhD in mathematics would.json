A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the principles of special relativity and how light behaves when moving through different mediums. \n\nThe speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where v is the speed of light in the medium, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nIn this case, the water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame, which means the velocity of light in the tube is also 1/2 c. The index of refraction of water is 4/3, so the speed of light in water relative to the water is c / (4/3) = 3/4 c.\n\nTo find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame, we use the relativistic addition of velocities formula:\n\nV_ab = (V_a + V_b) / (1 + V_a*V_b/c^2)\n\nwhere V_ab is the relative velocity of the light in water relative to the lab frame, V_a is the velocity of water relative to the lab frame (1/2 c), and V_b is the velocity of light in water relative to the water frame (3/4 c).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nV_ab = (1/2 c + 3/4 c) / (1 + (1/2 c) * (3/4 c) / c^2) = (5/4 c) / (1 + 3/8) = (5/4 c) / (11/8) = 10/11 c\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10/11 c.",
