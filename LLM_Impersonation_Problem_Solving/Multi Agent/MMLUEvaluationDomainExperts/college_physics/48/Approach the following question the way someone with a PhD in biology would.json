A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to apply the principle of relativity from special relativity theory, along with the formula for the speed of light in a medium.\n\nIn the lab frame, the tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c. Let's denote this speed as v_tube.\n\nThe speed of light in a medium is given by the formula:\nv_medium = c / n\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nIn this case, the refractive index of water (n) is 4/3. Therefore, the speed of light in water (v_water) relative to the tube is:\nv_water = c / (4/3) = 3c / 4\n\nSince the tube and the light are moving in the same direction, we can use the principle of relativity to find the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame. According to the principle of relativity, velocities add up according to the formula:\nv_lab = (v_water + v_tube) / (1 + v_water * v_tube / c^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nv_lab = ((3c / 4) + (1/2)c) / (1 + (3c/4)*(1/2)c/c^2)\nv_lab = (11/8) * c / (1 + (3/8))\nv_lab = (11/8) * c / (8/8 + 3/8)\nv_lab = (11/8) * c / (11/8)\nv_lab = c\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame is equal to the speed of light in vacuum, which is c. The correct answer is A: 1/2 c.",
