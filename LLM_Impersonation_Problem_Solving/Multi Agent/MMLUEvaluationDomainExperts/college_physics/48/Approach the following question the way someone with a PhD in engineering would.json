A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of the speed of light in a medium and the index of refraction. The speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the index of refraction of the medium.\n\nIn this scenario, the tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame. When the beam of light enters the water, it will also be traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame. However, the speed of light in the water will be different due to the index of refraction of water.\n\nThe index of refraction of water is 4/3, which means that the speed of light in water is c/n = c/(4/3) = 3c/4.\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is still 3c/4. However, since the water is moving at 1/2 c, we need to apply the velocity addition formula to find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame:\n\nv_lab = (v_water + v_light)/(1 + v_water*v_light/c^2)\nv_lab = (1/2 c + 3/4 c)/(1 + 1/2 * 3/4)\nv_lab = (5/4 c)/(1 + 3/8)\nv_lab = (5/4 c)/(8/8 + 3/8)\nv_lab = (5/4 c)/(11/8)\nv_lab = 5/4 * 8/11 c\nv_lab = 10/11 c\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is 10/11 c. Thus, the correct answer is D: 10/11 c.",
