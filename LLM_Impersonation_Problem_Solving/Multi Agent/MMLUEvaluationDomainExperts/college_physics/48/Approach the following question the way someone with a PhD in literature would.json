A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "As an individual with a PhD in literature, my expertise lies in the analysis and interpretation of literary texts rather than in physics. However, I can attempt to approach this question from a theoretical and analytical perspective.\n\nAccording to the principles of special relativity, the speed of light in a medium is given by the formula v = c/n, where v is the speed of light in the medium, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and n is the refractive index of the medium. In this case, the refractive index of water is 4/3.\n\nGiven that the tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame, we can calculate the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame using the formula v = c/n. Therefore, the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame is:\n\nv = c / (4/3) = 3c/4\n\nThus, the correct answer is D: 10/11 c.",
