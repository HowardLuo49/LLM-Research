This tunability is crucial for spectroscopy applications where different wavelengths may be required to study different chemical species or processes. Additionally, dye lasers typically have high power output and good spectral purity, making them ideal for spectroscopic experiments.\n\nIn contrast, helium-neon, excimer, and ruby lasers have limited tunability in the visible spectrum and may not offer the flexibility needed for a wide range of spectroscopic studies. While helium-neon lasers are commonly used for alignment and calibration purposes in spectroscopy, they are not well-suited for the detailed analysis of spectral features across a broad range of wavelengths.
