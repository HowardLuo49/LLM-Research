    "gpt_response": "As an individual with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by using the fundamental formula for power dissipation in a resistor:\n\nP = V^2 / R\n\nwhere P is the power dissipation, V is the voltage across the resistor, and R is the resistance of the resistor.\n\nGiven that the initial power dissipation is 1W, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the resistance R:\n\nR = V^2 / P\nR = (V1)^2 / P\n\nwhere V1 is the initial voltage across the resistor. Since the power dissipation is a constant value, the resistance of the resistor does not change.\n\nWhen the voltage is doubled, the new voltage V2 will be 2V1. Plugging this new voltage into the formula for power dissipation, we get:\n\nP_new = (2V1)^2 / R\nP_new = 4V1^2 / R\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the new power dissipation will be 4 times the initial power dissipation:\n\nP_new = 4W\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 4W",
