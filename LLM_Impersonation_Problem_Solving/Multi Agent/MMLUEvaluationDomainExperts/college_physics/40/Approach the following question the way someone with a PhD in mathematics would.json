    "gpt_response": "The power dissipated by a resistor in a circuit can be calculated using the formula P = V^2 / R, where P is the power, V is the voltage across the resistor, and R is the resistance of the resistor.\n\nIf the power dissipated by the resistor is initially 1W, then we have P = 1, and if the voltage across the resistor is doubled, then the new voltage V' = 2V.\n\nSubstitute V' = 2V into the power formula:\n\nP' = (2V)^2 / R = 4V^2 / R\n\nSince P = 1 = V^2 / R, we can rearrange this to find R = V^2. Substituting R = V^2 into the expression for P', we get:\n\nP' = 4V^2 / (V^2) = 4\n\nTherefore, the new rate of energy dissipation will be 4W, so the correct answer is D: 4W.",
