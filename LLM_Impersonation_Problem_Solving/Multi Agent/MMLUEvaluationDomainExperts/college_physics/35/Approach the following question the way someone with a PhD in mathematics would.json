A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\nA: 80 s\nB: 160 s\nC: 2,000 s\nD: 5,000 s",

    "gpt_response": "To establish the rate with an uncertainty of 1 percent, we can use the formula for the standard deviation of a sample:\n\ns = sqrt((\u2211(x_i - x\u0304)^2) / (n-1))\n\nwhere x_i is each measurement, x\u0304 is the average of the measurements, and n is the number of measurements.\n\nFirst, calculate the average of the measurements:\n\nx\u0304 = (3+0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5) / 10 = 2\n\nNext, calculate the standard deviation of the measurements:\n\ns = sqrt(( (3-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (4-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 + (1-2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (5-2)^2 ) / 9) \u2248 1.5\n\nThe uncertainty is given as 1 percent of the rate. If we want the uncertainty to be within 1 percent of the rate, the count time should be at least 100 times the standard deviation. In this case, 100 * 1.5 = 150 s.\n\nTherefore, the student should count for at least 150 seconds to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent.
