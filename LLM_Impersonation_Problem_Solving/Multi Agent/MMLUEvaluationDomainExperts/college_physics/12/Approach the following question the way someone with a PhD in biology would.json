    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be determined by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a measure of the ratio of induced electric field to the product of the applied magnetic field and the current density in a semiconductor material. By measuring the Hall coefficient, one can determine whether the predominant charge carriers in the material are positively charged (holes) or negatively charged (electrons). This information is crucial for understanding the behavior of the semiconductor and for designing electronic devices based on it.",
