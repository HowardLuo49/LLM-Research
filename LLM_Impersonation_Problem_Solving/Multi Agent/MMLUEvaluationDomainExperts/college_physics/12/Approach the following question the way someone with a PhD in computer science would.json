    "gpt_response": "To determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor, one can measure the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient, which is a measure of the ratio of the induced electric field to the applied magnetic field, can provide information about whether the majority charge carriers in the material are electrons or holes. By analyzing the sign of the Hall coefficient, one can deduce whether the semiconductor is n-type (electron majority carriers) or p-type (hole majority carriers). This measurement is a fundamental technique in semiconductor physics and is commonly used in characterizing the electrical properties of doped semiconductors.",
