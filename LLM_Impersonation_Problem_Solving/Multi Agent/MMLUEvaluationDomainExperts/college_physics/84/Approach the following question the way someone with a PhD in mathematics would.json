    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Firstly, we need to understand the concept of emission spectra for hydrogen and Li++. The emission spectrum of hydrogen is given by the Balmer series:\n\n1/\u03bb = R(1/2^2 - 1/n^2)\n\nwhere R is the Rydberg constant, equal to 1.097x10^7 m^-1, and n is the principal quantum number. For Li++, which is a doubly ionized lithium atom (Z = 3, A = 7), the emission spectrum is identical to that of a hydrogen atom with Z = 1 (Li++ has lost two electrons, so its effective charge is +2).\n\nTo find the relationship between the wavelengths of the hydrogen atom and Li++, we can use the formula for the wavelengths of the Balmer series lines and substitute Z = 3 for Li++ and Z = 1 for hydrogen:\n\nFor Li++:\n1/\u03bb(Li++) = R(1/2^2 - 1/n^2)\n\nFor hydrogen:\n1/\u03bb(H) = R(1/1^2 - 1/n^2)\n\nSince the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of hydrogen, the wavelengths must be related by a factor of Z^2. Therefore, we have:\n\n1/\u03bb(Li++) = Z^2 * 1/\u03bb(H)\n\nSubstitute Z = 3 and Z = 1 into the above equation:\n\n1/\u03bb(Li++) = 3^2 * 1/\u03bb(H)\n\n1/\u03bb(Li++) = 9 * 1/\u03bb(H)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: The wavelengths of Li++ are decreased by a factor of 9 compared to hydrogen.",
