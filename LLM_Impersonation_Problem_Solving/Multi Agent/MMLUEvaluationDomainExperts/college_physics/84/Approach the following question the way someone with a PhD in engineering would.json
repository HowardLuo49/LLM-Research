    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question from a fundamental understanding of atomic emission spectra and the differences between hydrogen and lithium atoms.\n\nThe hydrogen atom has only one electron, while the lithium atom has three electrons. The emission spectrum of an atom is determined by the energy level transitions of the electrons within the atom. In the case of hydrogen, the electron transitions are governed by the Bohr model and the quantization of angular momentum.\n\nWhen comparing the emission spectrum of doubly ionized lithium (Li++) to that of hydrogen, we need to consider the differences in energy levels and transitions. Because the lithium atom has a higher nuclear charge (Z=3) compared to hydrogen (Z=1), the energy levels and transitions in the lithium atom will have different spacings and wavelengths compared to hydrogen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: increased by a factor of 9, as the emission spectrum of doubly ionized lithium will have wavelengths that are larger than those of hydrogen by a factor of 9 due to the differences in energy levels and transitions.",
