A nonrelativistic particle with a charge twice that of an electron moves through a uniform magnetic field. The field has a strength of \u03c0/4 tesla and is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. What is the particle\u2019s mass if it has a cyclotron frequency of 1,600 hertz?\nA: 2.5 * 10^-23 kg\nB: 1.2 * 10^-22 kg\nC: 3.3 * 10^-22 kg\nD: 5.0 * 10^-21 kg",
