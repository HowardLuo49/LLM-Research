    "gpt_response": "De Broglie's hypothesis posits that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are intricately linked through a fundamental physical constant. Planck's constant (option A) emerges as the correct choice in this scenario. Planck's constant, denoted by h, plays a critical role in quantum mechanics and serves as the proportionality constant in the relationship between a particle's momentum and its corresponding wavelength, as theorized by de Broglie. This fundamental constant provides a fundamental bridge between the classical understanding of particles as point-like objects possessing momentum and the quantum mechanical understanding of particles exhibiting wave-like properties. Therefore, among the options presented, Planck's constant stands out as the correct constant associated with de Broglie's hypothesis.",
