    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the work done on a particle to accelerate it to a speed of 0.6c from rest, we can use the relativistic kinetic energy equation:\n\nK = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere K is the relativistic kinetic energy, \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSubstitute the velocity v = 0.6c into the Lorentz factor equation:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nNow substitute the Lorentz factor into the kinetic energy equation:\n\nK = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.25mc^2.",
