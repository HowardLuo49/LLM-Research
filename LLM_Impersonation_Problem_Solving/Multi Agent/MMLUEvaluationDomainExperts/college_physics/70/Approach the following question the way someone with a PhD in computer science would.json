The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the heat dissipated by the brakes, we need to first determine the potential energy (PE) of the elevator at the top of the shaft, which is converted to heat by the brakes when bringing the elevator to a stop. \n\nPE = mgh\n\nWhere:\nm = mass of the elevator = 1,000 kg\ng = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m/s^2\nh = height fallen = 100 m\n\nPE = 1,000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m\nPE = 980,000 J\n\nTherefore, the brakes must dissipate 980,000 J of heat to bring the elevator safely to rest.
