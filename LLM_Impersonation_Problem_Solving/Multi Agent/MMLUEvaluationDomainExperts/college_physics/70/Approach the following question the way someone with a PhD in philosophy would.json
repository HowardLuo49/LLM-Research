The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "To address this scenario with rigor befitting someone with a Ph.D. in philosophy, we must first consider the kinetic energy of the falling elevator. The elevator's potential energy at the top of the shaft, where it is at rest, is given by the formula PE = mgh, where m is the mass (1,000 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height it fell (100 m). \n\nPE = (1,000 kg)(9.81 m/s^2)(100 m) = 981,000 J\n\nAs the elevator falls, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the bottom of the shaft, just before the emergency brakes act to stop the elevator, the kinetic energy of the elevator can be calculated using the formula KE = 0.5mv^2, where v is the velocity of the elevator just before stopping (which we can assume is zero, given it comes to a stop).\n\nKE = 0.5(1,000 kg)(0)^2 = 0 J\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy the elevator had before stopping was 0 J, thus the total energy that must be dissipated by the brakes to stop the elevator is equal to the initial potential energy of the elevator, which is 981,000 J. \n\nHence, the correct answer is not listed among the provided options.",
