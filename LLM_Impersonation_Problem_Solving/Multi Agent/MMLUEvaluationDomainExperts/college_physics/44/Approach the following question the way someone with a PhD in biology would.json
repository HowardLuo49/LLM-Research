Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, one would first need to understand the concept of thin film interference. When light strikes a thin film of a medium with a different refractive index than the surrounding medium, some of the light is reflected off the air-film interface and some is reflected off the film-glass interface. The interference of these two reflected waves can result in constructive or destructive interference, leading to certain wavelengths being enhanced or suppressed.\n\nIn this case, the blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off the thin film of oil on the glass slide. This indicates that the thickness of the oil film is such that constructive interference occurs for light of this particular wavelength. \n\nTo determine the minimum thickness of the oil film required for constructive interference, we can use the equation for the path length difference:\n\n2nt = m\u03bb  \n\nwhere t is the thickness of the oil film, n is the refractive index of the oil, m is the order of interference, and \u03bb is the wavelength of light.\n\nSince we are looking for the minimum thickness other than zero, we can consider the case of m=0, where no path length difference is added, resulting in destructive interference. In this case, the minimum thickness can be determined as follows:\n\n2n\u2081t = \u03bb  \n\nSince the blue light with a wavelength of 480 nm is most strongly reflected, we can substitute the values n\u2081=1.2 and \u03bb=480 nm into the equation to calculate the minimum thickness of the oil film:\n\n2(1.2)t = 480 nm \n2.4t = 480 nm\nt = 200 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) required for constructive interference with blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is 200 nm. \n\nThe correct answer is B: 200 nm.",
