Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we can apply the concept of thin film interference to determine the minimum thickness of the oil film required for maximum reflection of blue light at a wavelength of 480 nanometers. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the phase shift that occurs when light passes through the oil film. The phase shift can be determined using the equation \n\n\u0394\u03c6 = (2\u03c0d)/\u03bb * n\n\nwhere \u0394\u03c6 is the phase shift, d is the thickness of the oil film, \u03bb is the wavelength of the light (480 nm), and n is the refractive index of the oil (1.2).\n\nNext, we need to consider the phase shift that occurs when light reflects off the top and bottom surfaces of the oil film. The total phase shift for reflection can be calculated using the equation \n\n\u0394\u03c6 = 2n * 2\u03c0 * t/\u03bb\n\nwhere t is the total optical path length through the oil film, given by \n\nt = d * n\n\nNow, to achieve constructive interference for maximum reflection of the blue light, the total phase shift due to reflection must be equal to the phase shift due to transmission. Therefore, we have \n\n2n * 2\u03c0 * t/\u03bb = (2\u03c0d)/\u03bb * n\n\nSolving for d gives us the minimum thickness of the oil film. Plugging in the values given (n = 1.2, \u03bb = 480 nm), we can calculate the minimum thickness of the oil film to be 200 nm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 200 nm.",
