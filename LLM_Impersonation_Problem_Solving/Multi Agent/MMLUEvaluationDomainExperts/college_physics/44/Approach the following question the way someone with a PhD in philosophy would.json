Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the minimum thickness of the oil film that results in the most strongly reflected blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers, we must first understand the principles of interference and reflection in thin films. \n\nWhen light strikes a thin film of a material with a different index of refraction than the medium it is in (in this case oil on glass), some of the light is reflected from the top surface of the film and some is transmitted through the film and reflected from the bottom surface. These two reflected waves interfere with each other, and depending on the thickness of the film, certain wavelengths of light will be strongly reflected while others are not. \n\nThe condition for constructive interference in thin films is given by the formula 2nt = m\u03bb, where n is the index of refraction of the film, t is the thickness of the film, m is an integer, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the light. In this case, we are looking for the minimum thickness of the oil film that results in a strong reflection of light with a wavelength of 480 nanometers (blue light). \n\nGiven that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, we can calculate the minimum thickness of the oil film using the formula above. Plugging in the values n = 1.2, \u03bb = 480 nm = 0.48 \u00b5m, and m = 1 (for the first-order maximum), we get:\n\n2(1.2)t = 1(0.48)\n2.4t = 0.48\nt = 0.48/2.4\nt = 0.2 \u00b5m = 200 nm\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) that results in the most strongly reflected blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is 200 nm. \n\nAccordingly, the correct answer is B: 200 nm.",
