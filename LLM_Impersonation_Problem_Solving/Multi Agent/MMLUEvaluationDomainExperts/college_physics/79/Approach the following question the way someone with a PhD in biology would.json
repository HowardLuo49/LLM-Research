An observer O at rest midway between two sources of light at x = 0 and x = 10 m observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. According to a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\nA: 0.13c\nB: 0.15c\nC: 0.36c\nD: 0.53c",

    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by first recognizing that it involves the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation occurs when two observers are in relative motion with respect to each other and experience a difference in the timing of events.\n\nIn this scenario, observer O is at rest between two sources of light, while observer O' is moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis. When O' observes the two sources of light, one source flashes 13 ns before the other relative to observer O.\n\nTo calculate the speed of observer O' relative to observer O, we can use the time dilation equation:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3(\u0394t - (v/c^2)\u0394x)\n\nWhere:\n- \u0394t' is the time difference observed by O' (13 ns)\n- \u0394t is the time difference observed by O (0 ns)\n- v is the speed of O' relative to O\n- c is the speed of light in a vacuum (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)\n- \u0394x is the distance between the two sources of light (10 m)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n13 x 10^-9 = \u03b3(0 - (v/(3.00 x 10^8))^10\n\nSolving for \u03b3, we get:\n\n\u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - (v^2/c^2))\n\nSubstitute in the above equation and solve for v:\n\n13 x 10^-9 = (1/\u221a(1 - v^2/(3.00 x 10^8)^2))*(0 - (v/(3.00 x 10^8))^10\n\nThis equation can be further simplified to:\n\n13 x 10^-9 = -10v/(3.00 x 10^8)\n\nv = -0.39 x 10^9\n\nv = -0.39 x 10^9 m/s\n\nHowever, the speed of an object cannot be negative, so the speed of O' relative to O is approximately 0.39 x 10^9 m/s. This is equivalent to 0.13c in terms of the speed of light in a vacuum (c). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 0.13c",
