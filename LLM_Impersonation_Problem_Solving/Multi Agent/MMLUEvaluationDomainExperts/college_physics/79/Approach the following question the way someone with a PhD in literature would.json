An observer O at rest midway between two sources of light at x = 0 and x = 10 m observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. According to a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\nA: 0.13c\nB: 0.15c\nC: 0.36c\nD: 0.53c",

    "gpt_response": "As a literature PhD, I must first acknowledge that this question pertains to physics and the concept of relativity. In this scenario, we are dealing with the effects of time dilation and length contraction due to the relative motion between the two observers.\n\nThe observer O at rest observes the two sources of light to flash simultaneously due to their equidistant position. However, the observer O' moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis will experience a different perception of time due to their motion.\n\nThe fact that one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other for observer O' indicates a time difference caused by the relative motion between the two observers. This difference in time can be calculated using the Lorentz transformations. \n\nThe speed of observer O' relative to O can be determined as follows:\nv = (13 ns) / (10 m) = 1.3 ns/m = 1.3 * 10^-9 s / 10 m = 1.3 * 10^-10 s/m = 1.3 * 10^-10 m/s\n\nTo express this speed in terms of the speed of light (c), we have:\nv = 1.3 * 10^-10 m/s / c = 1.3 * 10^-10 / 3 * 10^8 m/s = 1.3 * 10^-18\n\nTherefore, the speed of O' relative to O is approximately 0.13c. Hence, the correct answer is option A.",
