    "gpt_response": "To analyze the time required for one revolution of the satellite orbiting a planet, we must first consider the gravitational force between the two bodies, governed by Newton's law of universal gravitation. The centripetal force required to keep the satellite in a circular orbit is provided by this gravitational force.\n\nThe centripetal force required for circular motion is given by F = mv^2/R, where m is the mass of the satellite, v is its velocity, and R is the radius of the orbit. The gravitational force between the satellite and the planet is given by F = GMm/R^2, where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the planet.\n\nBy equating these two forces, we can solve for the velocity v of the satellite in its circular orbit. This velocity is given by v = (GM/R)^(1/2), which shows that the velocity is independent of the mass of the satellite m.\n\nThe time required for one revolution of the satellite is equal to the circumference of the circular orbit divided by its velocity. Since the circumference is proportional to R, and the velocity is proportional to R^(1/2), we find that the time required for one revolution is proportional to R^(3/2).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: proportional to R^(3/2).",
