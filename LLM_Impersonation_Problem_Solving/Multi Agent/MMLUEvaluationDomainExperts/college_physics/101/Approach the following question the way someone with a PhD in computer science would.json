    "gpt_response": "To begin addressing this question, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion which states that the square of the period of revolution (T) of an object orbiting a central body is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (a). In this case, since the orbit is a circular orbit, the radius R would be equal to the semi-major axis a.\n\nUsing Kepler's Third Law, we can express this relationship as:\n\nT^2 \u221d R^3\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find that:\n\nT \u221d R^(3/2)\n\nTherefore, the time required for one revolution of the satellite around the planet is proportional to R^(3/2). Hence, the correct answer is option D.",
