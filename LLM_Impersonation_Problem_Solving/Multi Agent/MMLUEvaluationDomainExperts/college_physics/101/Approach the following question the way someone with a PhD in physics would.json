    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze the problem using Newton's law of gravitation and the laws of motion. The gravitational force between the satellite and the planet is given by:\n\nF = G*m*M / R^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant. Since the satellite moves in a circular orbit, the centripetal force required to keep it in this orbit is given by:\n\nF = m*v^2 / R\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the satellite. Equating these two forces gives:\n\nG*m*M / R^2 = m*v^2 / R\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for the velocity of the satellite in terms of the masses and the radius of the orbit:\n\nv = sqrt(G*M / R)\n\nThe time required for one revolution is simply the circumference of the orbit divided by the speed of the satellite:\n\nT = 2*pi*R / v = 2*pi*R / sqrt(G*M / R)\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\nA: The time required for one revolution is not independent of M, as we can see from the equation above.\n\nB: The time required for one revolution is not proportional to m^(1/2), since the mass of the satellite does not appear in the equation for T.\n\nC: The time required for one revolution is not linear in R, as we can see from the equation above.\n\nD: The time required for one revolution is proportional to R^(3/2), as we can see from the equation above.
