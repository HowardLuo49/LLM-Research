    "gpt_response": "To address this question as someone with a PhD in engineering, we need to analyze the relationship between the energy from electromagnetic waves, temperature, and the melting of ice in the given cavity.\n\nThe energy from electromagnetic waves in equilibrium in a cavity can be described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of the body's Kelvin temperature. Therefore, if the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the energy from electromagnetic waves will increase by a factor of 2^4 = 16.\n\nThe melting of ice is influenced by the amount of energy available to raise its temperature to the melting point and then to actually melt it. If the energy in the cavity is increased by a factor of 16, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time will also increase by the same factor. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 16.",
