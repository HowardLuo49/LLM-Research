    "gpt_response": "This question requires an understanding of thermal radiation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which governs the energy emitted by a black body. In this case, the cavity can be considered as a black body that absorbs and emits electromagnetic waves in equilibrium. \n\nThe energy emitted by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature in Kelvin, as per the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Therefore, if the temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the energy emitted by the cavity will increase by a factor of 2^4 = 16.\n\nSince the energy emitted by the cavity is used to melt ice, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time will also increase by a factor of 16. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 16.",
