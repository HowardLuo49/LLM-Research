    "gpt_response": "In considering this question, one must first understand the underlying principles of thermodynamics and the transfer of energy in a closed system. The concept of equilibrium within a cavity containing electromagnetic waves dictates that the energy within the system is evenly distributed and stable.\n\nWhen this equilibrium energy is utilized to melt ice within the cavity, the temperature increase of the cavity directly impacts the rate at which the ice melts. By doubling the Kelvin temperature of the cavity, the energy available for melting the ice also increases.\n\nIn thermodynamic processes, the rate of heat transfer is directly proportional to the temperature gradient. As such, a doubling of the Kelvin temperature will result in a significantly higher rate of heat transfer to the ice within the cavity. This increase in temperature will accelerate the melting process, leading to a larger mass of ice melted in the same amount of time.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is increased by a factor of 4 (option B) when the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two. This relationship is consistent with the principles of thermodynamics and the transfer of energy in a closed system.",
