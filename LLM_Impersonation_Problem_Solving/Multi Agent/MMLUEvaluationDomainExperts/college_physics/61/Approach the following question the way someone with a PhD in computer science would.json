    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "As a computer scientist with a PhD, I can confidently determine that electromagnetic radiation emitted from a nucleus is most likely to be in the form of gamma rays. This is because gamma rays are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation and are typically emitted during nuclear decay processes. This high-energy radiation is capable of penetrating materials and is often associated with nuclear reactions and radioactive decay. Therefore, the correct answer is A: gamma rays.",
