    "gpt_response": "Given the nature of electromagnetic radiation and the energy levels associated with nuclear processes, it is reasonable to conclude that the radiation emitted from a nucleus would most likely be in the form of gamma rays. Gamma rays are high-energy electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than X-rays, and are typically associated with radioactive decay processes and nuclear reactions. This is due to the fact that such processes involve the release of significant amounts of energy, which is best represented by gamma rays on the electromagnetic spectrum. Microwaves, ultraviolet radiation, and visible light are generally associated with processes involving lesser amounts of energy compared to nuclear reactions, making gamma rays the most plausible form of electromagnetic radiation emitted from a nucleus.",
