Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "In addressing this question, we must first understand the concept of diffraction. Diffraction is the bending of waves around obstacles and the spreading of waves through openings. In this case, we are dealing with sound waves which are subject to diffraction as they pass through the rectangular opening of the speaker enclosure.\n\nThe diffraction pattern of a long rectangular slit can be analyzed using the formula:\n\nsin(theta) = m(lambda) / a\n\nwhere:\ntheta = angle of diffraction\nm = order of diffraction (m = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...)\nlambda = wavelength of sound wave\na = width of the rectangular opening\n\nAt the angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face, we can assume m = 1 for the first minimum (sound wave first disappearing). Thus, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the wavelength of the sound wave:\n\nlambda = a sin(theta) / m\n\nGiven that the width of the rectangular opening, a = 0.14 m, and the angle of diffraction, theta = 45 degrees, we can calculate the wavelength of the sound wave that will first disappear at this angle.\n\nlambda = 0.14 * sin(45) / 1\nlambda = 0.14 * 0.707 / 1\nlambda \u2248 0.099 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of the sound wave using the formula:\n\nv = f * lambda\n\nGiven that the speed of sound in air, v = 350 m/s, and the calculated wavelength, lambda = 0.099 m, we can solve for the frequency:\n\nf = v / lambda\nf = 350 / 0.099\nf \u2248 3535 Hz\n\nTherefore, at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face, the sound wave will first disappear at a frequency of approximately 3535 Hz. Since this is closest to 3,500 Hz, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 3,500 Hz.",
