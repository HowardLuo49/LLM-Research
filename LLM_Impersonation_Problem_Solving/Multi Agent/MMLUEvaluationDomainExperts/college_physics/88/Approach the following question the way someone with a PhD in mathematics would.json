Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the diffraction of sound waves through a long rectangular slit. The first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs when the path length difference between waves diffracting from the top and bottom edges of the slit is half a wavelength.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the wavelength of the sound wave. The speed of sound (v) is 350 m/s. We can use the formula v = f * \u03bb, where f is the frequency and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nLet's assume the wavelength of the sound wave is \u03bb. The path length difference between the waves diffracting from the top and bottom edges of the slit is d sin\u03b8, where d is the width of the slit (0.14 m) and \u03b8 is the angle of diffraction (45 degrees or \u03c0/4 radians).\n\nFor the first minimum, the path length difference is equal to half a wavelength: d sin\u03b8 = \u03bb/2.\n\nNow we can substitute the values and solve for the frequency (f):\n\n0.14 * sin(\u03c0/4) = \u03bb/2\n\u03bb = 0.14 * \u221a2\n\nNow we can calculate the frequency by rearranging the formula v = f * \u03bb and plugging in the values:\n\n350 = f * (0.14 * \u221a2)\nf = 350 / (0.14 * \u221a2)\nf \u2248 2750 Hz\n\nTherefore, the sound will first disappear at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face at a frequency of approximately 2750 Hz. The correct answer is:\n\nC: 2,750 Hz",
