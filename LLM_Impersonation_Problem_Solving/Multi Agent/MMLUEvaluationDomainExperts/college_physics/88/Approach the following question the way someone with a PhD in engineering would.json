Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we need to consider the diffraction of sound waves through a long rectangular slit. Diffraction occurs when waves encounter an obstacle or aperture that is comparable in size to their wavelength. In this case, the opening of the speaker enclosure is the long rectangular slit with a width of 0.14 m.\n\nThe angle at which the sound first disappears can be calculated using the formula for the first minimum in diffraction:\n\nsin(theta) = m * lambda / a,\n\nwhere theta is the angle from the normal to the speaker face, m is the order of the minimum (in this case, m = 1 for the first minimum), lambda is the wavelength of the sound wave, and a is the width of the rectangular slit.\n\nFor a rectangular slit, the first minimum occurs at m = 1, so:\n\nsin(45 degrees) = lambda / 0.14 m.\n\nSolving for lambda, we get:\n\nlambda = 0.14 m * sin(45 degrees),\n\nlambda = 0.14 m * 0.707,\n \nlambda = 0.099 m.\n\nThe speed of sound in air is given as 350 m/s. Therefore, the frequency of the sound wave can be calculated using the formula:\n\nvelocity = frequency * wavelength,\n\n350 m/s = frequency * 0.099 m.\n\nSolving for frequency, we get:\n\nfrequency = 350 m/s / 0.099 m,\n\nfrequency \u2248 3535 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the closest option in the list provided is D: 3,500 Hz.",
