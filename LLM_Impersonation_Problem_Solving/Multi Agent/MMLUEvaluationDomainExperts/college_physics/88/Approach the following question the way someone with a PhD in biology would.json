Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question from a biological perspective, we first need to understand the concept of diffraction. Diffraction is the bending of waves around obstacles and edges, resulting in the spreading of waves as they pass through an opening. In this case, we are dealing with sound waves, which can exhibit diffraction when passing through a small opening such as the rectangular slit in the speaker enclosure.\n\nThe angle at which the sound first disappears due to diffraction can be calculated using the formula for diffraction of waves:\n\nsin(\u03b8) = \u03bb / d,\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave and d is the width of the slit. In this case, we are interested in the frequency at which the sound first disappears at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face. Since sin(45 degrees) = 0.707, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the frequency:\n\nf = v / \u03bb,\n\nwhere v is the speed of sound (350 m/s) and \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave. Substituting the values, we get:\n\n0.707 = \u03bb / 0.14 m,\n\u03bb \u2248 0.099 m.\n\nUsing the formula for the speed of sound:\n\nv = f * \u03bb,\n350 = f * 0.099,\nf \u2248 3535 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the sound first disappears at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal at a frequency of approximately 3535 Hz. Since this value is closest to 3500 Hz, the correct answer is D: 3,500 Hz.",
