A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced EMF in a coil is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the coil.\n\nThe formula for the induced EMF is given by:\n\nEMF = -N * A * (\u0394B/\u0394t)\n\nWhere:\nEMF = Induced electromotive force (V)\nN = Number of turns in the coil (250 turns)\nA = Area of the coil (0.2 m^2)\n\u0394B = Change in magnetic field strength (0.06 T - 0.01 T = 0.05 T)\n\u0394t = Time interval (0.25 s)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.05/0.25) \nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * 0.2\nEMF = -10 V\n\nSince the negative sign indicates the direction of the induced current, we can discard it when considering the magnitude of the EMF.
