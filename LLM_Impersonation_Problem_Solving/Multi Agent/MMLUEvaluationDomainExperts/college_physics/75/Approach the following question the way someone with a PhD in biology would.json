The mean kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in metals is ordinarily much higher than kT because\nA: electrons have many more degrees of freedom than atoms do\nB: the electrons and the lattice are not in thermal equilibrium\nC: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas\nD: electrons in metals are highly relativistic",

    "gpt_response": "C: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas\n\nExplanation: The mean kinetic energy of conduction electrons in metals is much higher than kT due to the fact that these electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas. In this state, the electrons obey Fermi-Dirac statistics, which require them to occupy energy levels up to the Fermi energy at absolute zero temperature, resulting in very high kinetic energies. This phenomenon is independent of the number of degrees of freedom of the electrons, the thermal equilibrium between electrons and lattice, or the relativistic nature of the electrons in metals.",
