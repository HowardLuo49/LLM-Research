The mean kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in metals is ordinarily much higher than kT because\nA: electrons have many more degrees of freedom than atoms do\nB: the electrons and the lattice are not in thermal equilibrium\nC: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas\nD: electrons in metals are highly relativistic",

    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is C: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas. \n\nThis is due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In a metal at low temperatures, the conduction electrons fill up all available energy states up to the Fermi level, leading to a degenerate Fermi gas. This results in very high kinetic energy for the electrons, far exceeding the typical thermal energies at room temperature (kT).",
