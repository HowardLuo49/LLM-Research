    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of electrons in an atom with filled n = 1 and n = 2 levels, we need to understand the electron configuration of an atom based on the Aufbau principle and the maximum number of electrons that can occupy each energy level. \n\nThe n = 1 level can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, while the n = 2 level can hold a maximum of 8 electrons. Therefore, the total number of electrons in an atom with filled n = 1 and n = 2 levels would be 2 (from n = 1 level) + 8 (from n = 2 level) = 10 electrons. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 10 electrons.",
