    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of electrons in an atom with filled n = 1 and n = 2 levels, we need to first understand the maximum number of electrons that can occupy each level. For the n = 1 level, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy it is given by 2n^2, where n = 1. Therefore, the n = 1 level can hold a maximum of 2(1)^2 = 2 electrons.\n\nSimilarly, for the n = 2 level, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy it is 2(2)^2 = 8 electrons. However, since we are told that the n = 2 level is already filled, it means that it contains 8 electrons.\n\nTherefore, the total number of electrons in the atom is the sum of the electrons in the n = 1 and n = 2 levels, which is 2 + 8 = 10 electrons. Hence, the correct answer is D: 10.",
