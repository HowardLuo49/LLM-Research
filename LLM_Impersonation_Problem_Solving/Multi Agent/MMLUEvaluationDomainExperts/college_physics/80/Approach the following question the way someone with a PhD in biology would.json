The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
