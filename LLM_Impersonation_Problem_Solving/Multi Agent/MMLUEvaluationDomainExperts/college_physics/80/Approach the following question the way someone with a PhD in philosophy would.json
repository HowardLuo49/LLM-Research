The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the wavelength at which a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K would reach its maximum thermal emission, one must first consider the principles of blackbody radiation. As articulated by Planck's law, the spectral radiance emitted by a blackbody at a given temperature is characterized by a peak wavelength determined by Wien's displacement law. This law posits that the peak wavelength of thermal radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting body.\n\nGiven that the Sun's surface temperature is close to 6,000 K and its peak wavelength is near 500 nm, one can infer the general relationship between temperature and peak wavelength. By comparing this to an object with a surface temperature close to 300 K, it can be deduced that the peak wavelength of its thermal spectrum would be significantly longer. Barring any specific calculations, one can anticipate that the peak wavelength for a 300 K body would fall within the infrared range, possibly measuring in the millimeter scale.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength at which the thermal spectrum of a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K would reach a maximum is most likely in the range of 10 mm or 100 mm. The answer choices A and B, 10:00 PM and 100 Pm respectively, are not within the appropriate order of magnitude for thermal emissions at this temperature.",
