The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",

    "gpt_response": "As an individual with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength at which the peak of the blackbody spectrum occurs is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting body. \n\nThe formula for Wien's displacement law is given by:\n\u03bb_max * T = constant\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and the constant is approximately 2.89777 x 10^-3 m*K.\n\nGiven that the temperature of the Sun's surface is close to 6,000 K and the peak wavelength is near 500 nm, we can calculate the constant using this information:\n500 nm = 2.89777 x 10^-3 m*K / 6,000 K\n\u03bb_max = 2.89777 x 10^-3 m*K / 6,000 K * 300 K\n\nBy plugging in the temperature of 300 K, we can solve for the wavelength at which the thermal spectrum from a body with a temperature of 300 K would reach a maximum. This calculation would give us the answer in meters. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be closest to option A: 10 mm.",
