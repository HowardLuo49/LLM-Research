A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair.

    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in engineering, we can approach this problem by considering the conservation of energy and momentum. \n\nInitially, the photon has energy E = pc where p is the momentum of the photon and c is the speed of light. Since the electron is initially at rest, the total momentum before the collision is just pc. \n\nAfter the collision, the energy must be conserved. The electron-positron pair has a total rest energy of 2mc^2, where m is the mass of the electron. The total kinetic energy of the electron-positron pair is E_kin = 2mc^2. \n\nSince the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon, the total momentum after the collision is 3p. So, the total energy after the collision must be 3pc = E_kin = 2mc^2. \n\nFrom this, we can solve for the energy of the photon by dividing both sides by c:\n\n3p = 2mc\n3E/c = 2mc\nE = 2mc^2\n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon was 2mc^2, so the correct answer is B.",
