    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by considering energy and momentum conservation in this particular interaction. \n\nInitially, the photon had energy E and momentum p, given by E = pc, where c is the speed of light. The total energy and momentum of the system must be conserved during this interaction, as no external forces are acting on the system. \n\nWhen the photon strikes the electron at rest, it creates an electron-positron pair and all three particles move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. Since the positron and electrons move off at equal speeds, the total momentum of the system is conserved. \n\nAt this point, we can equate the initial energy and momentum of the photon to the total energy and momentum of the electron-positron pair. \n\nEnergy conservation gives:\nE_photon = E_electron + E_positron\nE = 2mc^2\nwhere m is the mass of the electron (and positron) and c is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon was 2mc^2, which corresponds to option B.",
