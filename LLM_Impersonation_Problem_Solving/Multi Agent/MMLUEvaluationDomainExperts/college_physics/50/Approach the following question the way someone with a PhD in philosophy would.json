A grating spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm, respectively. Which of the following gives the resolving power of the spectrometer?\nA: 2\nB: 250\nC: 5,000\nD: 10,000",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the resolving power of the grating spectrometer, it is necessary to calculate the ratio of the difference in wavelengths to the average of the two wavelengths that the spectrometer can resolve. The resolving power (R) is typically defined as the minimum resolvable difference in wavelengths divided by the average wavelength at which this difference is observed.\n\nIn this case, the difference between the two wavelengths that the spectrometer can just barely resolve is 2 nm (502 nm - 500 nm), with an average wavelength of 501 nm [(500 nm + 502 nm) / 2 = 501 nm]. Therefore, the resolving power (R) of the spectrometer can be calculated as follows:\n\nR = (wavelength difference) / (average wavelength)\nR = 2 nm / 501 nm\nR \u2248 0.003987\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the resolving power in terms of a whole number, we must convert this decimal into a whole number. This can be done by taking the reciprocal of the decimal (1/0.003987) which gives us approximately 250. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 250.",
