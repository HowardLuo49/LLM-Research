    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the distance the particle will travel in the lab frame before decaying, we must first account for time dilation and length contraction, as dictated by special relativity. \n\nThe time dilation equation is given by: \n\u0394t_lab =  \u03b3 * \u0394t_rest\nwhere \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v^2/c^2) is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light. \n\nHere, v = 0.60c, so \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - 0.6^2) \u2248 1.25. \nSo,  \u0394t_lab = 1.25 * 2.0 ms = 2.5 ms.\n\nThe distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame is given by the equation:\nd_lab = v * \u0394t_lab\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle in the lab frame, and \u0394t_lab is the time elapsed in the lab frame.\n\nSubstituting in the values, we have:\nd_lab = 0.60c * 2.5 ms \u2248 0.75 * 3*10^8 m/s * 2.5*10^-3 s = 0.75 * 750 m \u2248 562.5 m.\n\nTherefore, the particle will travel approximately 562.5 m before decaying in the lab frame.
