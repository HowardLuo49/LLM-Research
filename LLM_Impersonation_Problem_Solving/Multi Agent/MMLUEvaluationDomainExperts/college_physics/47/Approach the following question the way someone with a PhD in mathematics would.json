    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate the proper lifetime of the particle, which is the amount of time that passes for the particle in its rest frame. The time dilation formula from special relativity can be used: \n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t' is the proper lifetime, t is the lifetime in the lab frame (2.0 ms in this case), v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - (0.60*c)^2/c^2)\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - 0.60^2)\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(0.64)\nt' = 2.0 ms / 0.8\nt' = 2.5 ms\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying using the formula:\n\ndistance = velocity * time\n\ndistance = 0.60c * 2.5 ms\ndistance = 0.60 * 3.00x10^8 m/s * 2.5x10^-3 s\ndistance = 450 m\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 450 m.",
