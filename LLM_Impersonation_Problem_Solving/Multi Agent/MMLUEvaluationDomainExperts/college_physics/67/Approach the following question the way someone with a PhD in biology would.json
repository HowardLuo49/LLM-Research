    "gpt_response": "To determine the energy required to ionize helium by removing one electron, we can use the concept of ionization energy. The total energy required to remove both electrons from helium in its ground state is 79.0 eV. This means that the first ionization energy (energy required to remove one electron) + the second ionization energy (energy required to remove the second electron) = 79.0 eV. \n\nSince the first ionization energy is the energy required to remove one electron, we can calculate it by subtracting the second ionization energy from the total energy: \nFirst ionization energy = Total energy - Second ionization energy\nFirst ionization energy = 79.0 eV - 79.0 eV\nFirst ionization energy = 79.0 eV - 54.4 eV\nFirst ionization energy = 24.6 eV\n\nTherefore, the energy required to ionize helium by removing one electron is 24.6 eV.
