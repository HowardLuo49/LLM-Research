    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In order to approach this question from a perspective consistent with someone holding a PhD in computer science, we would first need to understand the physics behind emission spectra and the relationship between hydrogen and lithium ions.\n\nThe emission spectrum of an atom is determined by the energy differences between its electron energy levels. For hydrogen, the energy levels are quantized and given by the formula E = -13.6 eV / n^2, where n is the principal quantum number. The emission spectrum consists of discrete lines corresponding to transitions between these energy levels.\n\nIn the case of Li++, a doubly ionized lithium atom with atomic number Z = 3, the electron configuration resembles that of helium, with two electrons removed. This results in a higher effective nuclear charge and a more compact system compared to hydrogen.\n\nGiven that the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of hydrogen, we can infer that the wavelengths of the spectral lines are related by a scaling factor. Since scaling is inversely proportional to wavelength, a factor by which the wavelengths are decreased corresponds to an increase in energy levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: increased by a factor of 9, as the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ has energy levels that are 9 times higher than those of hydrogen.",
