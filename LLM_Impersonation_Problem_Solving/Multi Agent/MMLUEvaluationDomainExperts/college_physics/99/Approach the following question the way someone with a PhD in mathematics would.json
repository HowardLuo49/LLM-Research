An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to consider the motion of the airplane and the payload separately. The airplane is traveling due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s. Since the airplane drops the payload while traveling parallel to the ground, the initial velocity of the payload relative to the airplane is also 100 m/s north.\n\nAfter the payload is released, it will continue to move in the north direction at a constant velocity of 100 m/s relative to the ground. However, the airplane will also continue to move in the north direction at a constant velocity of 100 m/s, which means the velocity of the payload relative to the airplane will be 0 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.",
