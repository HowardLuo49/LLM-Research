    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

The work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. \n\nInitial kinetic energy of the box: KE_initial = 0.5 * m * v_initial^2\nKE_initial = 0.5 * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2\nKE_initial = 5 J\n\nFinal kinetic energy of the box: KE_final = 0.5 * m * v_final^2\nKE_final = 0.5 * 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2\nKE_final = 20 J\n\nWork done by the applied force: W = KE_final - KE_initial\nW = 20 J - 5 J\nW = 15 J\n\nThe work done by the applied force is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance it acts over. So, we have:\nW = F * d\n15 J = F * 5 m\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is:\nF = 15 J / 5 m\nF = 3 N\n\nSo the correct answer is C: 3 N.",
