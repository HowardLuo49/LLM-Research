The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this case, the police car is moving towards the wall at a speed of 3.5 m/s, emitting a siren with a frequency of 600 Hz, and the speed of sound is 350 m/s.\n\nWhen the car is moving towards the wall, the sound waves of the siren are compressed, resulting in an increase in the frequency of the sound heard by the driver. This change in frequency can be calculated using the equation:\n\nf' = f ((v + vo) / (v + vs))\n\nwhere f' is the frequency heard by the driver, f is the frequency of the siren, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer (in this case, the driver of the car), and vs is the speed of the source (in this case, the speed of the car).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf' = 600 Hz * ((350 m/s + 3.5 m/s) / (350 m/s + 0 m/s))\nf' = 600 Hz * (353.5 m/s / 350 m/s)\nf' = 600 Hz * 1.010\nf' = 606 Hz\n\nSo, the frequency heard by the driver is 606 Hz. Since this is not an option, we need to consider the echo from the wall. The sound waves that reflect off the wall will travel back towards the car at the speed of sound. This means the relative speed of the sound wave towards the car will be 350 m/s + 3.5 m/s = 353.5 m/s.\n\nUsing the same equation as above with the new relative speed, we get:\n\nf'' = 600 Hz * ((350 m/s + 3.5 m/s) / (350 m/s - 3.5 m/s))\nf'' = 600 Hz * (353.5 m/s / 346.5 m/s)\nf'' = 600 Hz * 1.0202\nf'' = 612 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 612 Hz, which corresponds to option D.",
