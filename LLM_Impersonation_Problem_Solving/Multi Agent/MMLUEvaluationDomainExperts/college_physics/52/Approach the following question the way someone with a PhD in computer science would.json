    "gpt_response": "The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always A: real. This is a fundamental property of Hermitian operators in quantum mechanics, as they correspond to physical observables that must have real values in order to be physically meaningful. The Hermitian operator ensures that its eigenvalues are real due to the self-adjoint property that guarantees that the operator is equal to its own conjugate transpose. This property leads to the diagonalization of Hermitian operators, with real eigenvalues corresponding to orthogonal eigenvectors. The real eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator play a crucial role in determining the possible outcomes of measurements in quantum systems and are therefore of great importance in quantum mechanics.",
