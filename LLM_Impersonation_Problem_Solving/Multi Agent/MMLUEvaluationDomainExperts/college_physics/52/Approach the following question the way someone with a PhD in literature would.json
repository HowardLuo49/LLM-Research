In quantum mechanics, Hermitian operators play a crucial role in representing physical observables, and their eigenvalues correspond to the possible outcomes of measurements. \n\nIn this context, it is well-known that the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are always real. This property stems from the Hermiticity of the operator, which ensures that its eigenvalues are guaranteed to be real numbers. This fundamental property is a key aspect of quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding the behavior of physical systems at the quantum level.\n\nTherefore, I would confidently select option A: real as the correct answer, based on my understanding of the mathematical and conceptual underpinnings of Hermitian operators in quantum mechanics.",
