    "gpt_response": "In the diamond structure of elemental carbon, the nearest neighbors of each C atom lie at the corners of a tetrahedron. This is because each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms, forming a three-dimensional network known as a tetrahedral lattice. This arrangement allows for the strong and stable structure of diamond, as each carbon atom is bonded to its nearest neighbors in a tetrahedral configuration, resulting in a highly symmetrical and coordinated arrangement of atoms within the crystal lattice.",
