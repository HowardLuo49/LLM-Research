Which of the following is true about any system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process?\nA: There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.\nB: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\nC: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\nD: The entropy of the system and its environment must increase.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "A reversible thermodynamic process is characterized by the ability to return the system and its surroundings to their original state with no net change in entropy. This means that options C and D are incorrect. However, option B is true for reversible processes, as the temperature remains constant. Option A is also true for reversible processes, as there are no changes in the internal energy of the system. Thus, the correct answer is A and B.",
