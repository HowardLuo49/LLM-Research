A gas cell with an optical path length of 10 cm is placed in one arm of a Michelson interferometer. If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in engineering, we must first understand the basics of Michelson interferometry. \n\nThe number of fringes observed in an interferometer is related to the optical path length difference between the two arms of the interferometer. In this case, as the gas cell is evacuated, the index of refraction within the cell changes, causing a change in the optical path length and thus a change in the number of fringes observed.\n\nThe relationship between the number of fringes observed (N), the wavelength of light (\u03bb), the optical path length difference (d), and the index of refraction (n) is given by the following equation:\nN = 2*d*n/\u03bb\n\nGiven that the optical path length is 10 cm, the wavelength of the laser is 632.2 nm, and 100 fringes are observed, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the index of refraction (n):\nn = N*\u03bb/(2*d)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nn = 100*(632.2*10^(-9))/(2*10*10^(-2))\nn = 0.000100(632.2*10^(-9))/(0.02)\nn = 0.000100*0.0006322/0.02\nn = 0.00006322/0.02\nn = 0.003161\n\nTherefore, the index of refraction of the original gas is approximately 1.00032.
