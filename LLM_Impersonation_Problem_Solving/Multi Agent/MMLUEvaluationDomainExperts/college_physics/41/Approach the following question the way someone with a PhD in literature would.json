A gas cell with an optical path length of 10 cm is placed in one arm of a Michelson interferometer. If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",

    "gpt_response": "In analyzing this question, a PhD in literature would first identify the scientific concepts involved, such as the use of a gas cell in a Michelson interferometer and the phenomenon of interference fringes. They would then approach the problem by applying principles of physics and optics that are relevant to the situation at hand.\n\nTo solve this problem, the PhD in literature would recognize that the number of fringes observed in the interferometer is related to the phase change experienced by the light as it travels through the gas cell. The phase change is dependent on the refractive index of the gas in the cell, as well as the wavelength of the light.\n\nBy calculating the difference in optical path length between the two arms of the interferometer when the gas cell is present and when it is evacuated, and using the formula for determining the change in phase due to optical path difference, the PhD in literature would be able to determine the refractive index of the original gas.\n\nBased on the calculations and the given information, the correct answer would be option C: 1.00016.",
