In this scenario, the white light incident on the puddle of water and thin layer of oil could be interpreted as symbolic of the multiple perspectives and layers of interpretation that can be present in a literary work.\n\nGiven the differing indices of refraction of water and oil, the light will be partially reflected at the interface between the two materials. The most strongly reflected wavelength of light can be determined by applying the principles of wave interference and the behavior of light at interfaces with different refractive indices.\n\nTo identify the most strongly reflected wavelength in this scenario, one would need to consider the thickness of the oil layer, the indices of refraction of water and oil, and the wavelength of the incident light. By calculating the phase difference between the reflected waves at the water-oil interface, one can determine which wavelength is most strongly reflected.\n\nIn this case, the most strongly reflected wavelength is likely to be 650 nm (option D), as it corresponds to the wavelength that experiences constructive interference and is maximally reflected at the water-oil interface. This conclusion is based on the principles of optical interference and the relative refractive indices of water and oil.",
