    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in physics, I would approach this question by considering the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state in the excited states of the helium atom can be understood in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin, such as electrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In the case of the helium atom, the two electrons in the ground state must occupy different spin states due to their half-integer spin (1/2). When one electron is in the para- state (antiparallel spins), the other must be in the ortho- state (parallel spins) in order to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nSince the two electrons in the ortho- state have parallel spins, they experience a lower overall energy due to the added spin magnetic moment interaction. This results in the ortho- state having lower energy than the corresponding para- state in the excited states of the helium atom. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The Pauli exclusion principle.",
