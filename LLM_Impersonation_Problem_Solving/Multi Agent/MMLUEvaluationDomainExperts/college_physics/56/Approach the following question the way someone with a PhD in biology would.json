In particular, we can analyze the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors to determine the angle between them.\n\nGiven that the particle's speed is 10 meters per second and is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second squared, we can infer that the acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle (centripetal acceleration). This acceleration vector is perpendicular to the velocity vector, which is directed tangentially to the circle.\n\nTo find the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors, we can use the fact that the acceleration vector is changing the direction of the velocity vector. We can calculate this angle using the dot product of the two vectors:\n\ncos(theta) = (v dot a) / (|v || a|),\n\nwhere v is the velocity vector and a is the acceleration vector. Since the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpendicular (as mentioned earlier), the dot product simplifies to 0. Therefore, the cosine of the angle between the vectors is 0, which implies that the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nConsequently, the correct answer is not provided in the given options. The angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors is 90\u00b0.",
