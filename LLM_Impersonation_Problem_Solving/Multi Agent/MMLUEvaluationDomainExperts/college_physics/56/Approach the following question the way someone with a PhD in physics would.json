At one instant, the particle\u2019s speed is 10 meters per second and is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second squared. The angle between the particle\u2019s velocity and acceleration vectors is\nA: 0\u00b0\nB: 30\u00b0\nC: 45\u00b0\nD: 60\u00b0",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the angle between two vectors. The angle between two vectors is given by the equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 = (v * a) / (|v| |a|)\n\nwhere v is the velocity vector, a is the acceleration vector, and \u03b8 is the angle between them. In this case, the velocity vector is tangent to the circle and the acceleration vector is directed towards the center of the circle.\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector |v| is given as 10 m/s. The magnitude of the acceleration vector |a| is given as the rate of change of speed, which is 10 m/s^2. The angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors can be calculated as follows:\n\ncos\u03b8 = (10 * 10) / (10 * 10) = 1\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 = cos^(-1)(1) = 0\u00b0\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 0\u00b0.",
