The first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery. The other two capacitors, initially uncharged and connected in series, are then connected across the first capacitor. What is the final voltage on the first capacitor?\nA: V_0/5\nB: V_0/3\nC: V_0/2\nD: 2V_0/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must consider the principle of conservation of charge in capacitors connected in series. \n\nWhen the first capacitor is disconnected from the battery, it retains its charge Q_0 and has a voltage of V_0 = Q_0/C, where C is the capacitance of each capacitor.\n\nWhen the other two capacitors, initially uncharged, are connected in series across the first capacitor, they will share the charge Q_0 equally due to being connected in series. Therefore, each capacitor will end up with a charge of Q_0/2.\n\nThe final voltage on the first capacitor can be calculated by dividing the total charge (Q_0) by the capacitance (C) of the first capacitor, since V = Q/C. Since each of the three capacitors has the same capacitance, C, the total capacitance of the three capacitors in series is 3C.\n\nFinal voltage on the first capacitor (V_f) = Total charge (Q_0) / Total capacitance (3C) \n= Q_0/3C\n= V_0/3\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: V_0/3.",
