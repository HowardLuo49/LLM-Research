Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",

    "gpt_response": "Based on the given scenario, we can use the relativistic length contraction formula to determine the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth. \n\nThe relativistic length contraction formula is given by:\n\nL = L_0 \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere:\nL = measured length of the meterstick on one spaceship (60 cm)\nL_0 = proper length of the meterstick (rest length)\nv = speed of the spaceship\nc = speed of light\n\nGiven L_0 = 60 cm, and L = 60 cm, we can rearrange the formula to solve for v:\n\n60 = 60 \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n1 = \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n1 = 1 - v^2/c^2\n0 = - v^2/c^2\nv^2 = 0\n\nThus, the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth is 0.
