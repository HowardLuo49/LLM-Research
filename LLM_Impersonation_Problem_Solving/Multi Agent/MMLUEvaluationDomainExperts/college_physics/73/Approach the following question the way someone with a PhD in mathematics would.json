Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the speed of each spaceship as v and the speed of light as c. According to Lorentz transformations in special relativity, the length contraction factor is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nGiven that the occupant of one spaceship measures the meterstick to be 60 cm long. The contracted length from the perspective of the spaceship is given by:\n\nL' = L / \u03b3\n\nwhere L' is the length measured by the occupant of the spaceship and L is the original length of the meterstick.\n\nSubstituting the values given, we have:\n\n60 cm = 1 / \u03b3 * L\n\n60 cm = sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2) * L\n\nTherefore:\n\n1 - (v^2 / c^2) = (60 cm / L)^2\n\nSince the speeds of the spaceships are equal, we have:\n\n1 - v^2 / c^2 = (60 cm / L)^2\n\nSolving for v gives:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (60 cm / L)^2)\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2)\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 0.36)\n\nv = c * sqrt(0.64)\n\nv = 0.8c\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is 0.8c.",
