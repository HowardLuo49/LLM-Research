Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula, which takes into account the effects of special relativity. \n\nLet v be the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth, and c be the speed of light. According to the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv_total = (v1 + v2) / (1 + (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nSince the observer on Earth measures both spaceships to be approaching at the same speed, we have v1 = -v2 = v. \n\nTherefore, the formula simplifies to:\n\nv_total = 2v / (1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nNow, let L be the proper length of the meterstick on the first spaceship (60 cm) as measured by the observer on Earth, and L' be the measured length of the meterstick on the second spaceship. The length contraction formula is given by:\n\nL' = L / \u221a(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nPlugging in the given values, we have L' = 60 cm. Therefore:\n\n60 cm = 60 cm / \u221a(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nSolving for v in the above equation, we find v = 0.6c.\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is 0.6c. So the correct answer is:\n\nC: 0.6c",
