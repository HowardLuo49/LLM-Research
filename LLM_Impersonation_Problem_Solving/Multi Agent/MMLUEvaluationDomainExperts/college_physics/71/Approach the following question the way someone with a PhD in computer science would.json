The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 with respect to Earth, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this case, the shift in the hydrogen lines of the quasar 3C9 indicates a redshift due to its motion away from Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the redshift (z) of the observed wavelengths of the hydrogen lines in 3C9 compared to those observed at rest on Earth. The redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n\nz = \u03bb_observed/\u03bb_rest - 1\n\nGiven that the observed wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the laboratory, we can calculate the redshift (z):\n\nz = 3 - 1\nz = 2\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect to relate the redshift to the relative speed (v) of 3C9 with respect to Earth. The formula for the Doppler effect in terms of redshift is:\n\nz = v/c\n\nwhere v is the relative speed, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSubstitute the redshift value (z = 2) into the formula:\n\n2 = v/c\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv = 2c\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 with respect to Earth is 2 times the speed of light (2c). The correct answer is A: 2c.",
