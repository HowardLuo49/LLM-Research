The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I understand the principles of sound waves and the Doppler effect. When the police car moves towards a reflective surface, the frequency of the siren heard by the driver will appear higher due to the compression of the sound waves. The formula for calculating the observed frequency of a moving source is f' = f((v+vo)/(v-vs)), where f' is the observed frequency, f is the original frequency of the source, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer, and vs is the speed of the source.\n\nIn this case, the police car is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s and the speed of sound is 350 m/s. Thus, the observed frequency when the car is approaching the wall would be f' = 600((350+0)/(350-3.5)) = 612 Hz. Therefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 612 Hz, which corresponds to answer choice C.",
