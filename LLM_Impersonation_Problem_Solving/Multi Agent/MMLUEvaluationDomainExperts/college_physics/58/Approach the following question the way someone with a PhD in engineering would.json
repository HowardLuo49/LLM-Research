A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a closed loop is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop.\n\nThe formula for calculating the induced EMF in a coil is given by:\nEMF = -N * A * (\u0394B/\u0394t)\n\nWhere:\nEMF = induced electromotive force\nN = number of turns in the coil (250 turns)\nA = area of the coil (0.2 m^2)\n\u0394B = change in magnetic field strength (final magnetic field - initial magnetic field)\n\u0394t = time interval (0.25 s)\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * ((0.06 - 0.01) / 0.25)\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.05 / 0.25)\nEMF = - 250 * 0.2 * 0.2\nEMF = - 10 V\n\nSince the negative sign indicates the direction of the induced current in the coil, we take the absolute value of the EMF to get the magnitude.
