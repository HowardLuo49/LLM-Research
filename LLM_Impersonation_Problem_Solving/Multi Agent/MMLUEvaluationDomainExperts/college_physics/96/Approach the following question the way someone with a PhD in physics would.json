In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest. If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\nA: 0\nB: 1/4\nC: 1/3\nD: 1/2",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the fraction of initial kinetic energy lost in the collision between the two particles, we can use the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy principles.\n\nLet the initial velocity of the particle of mass 2m be denoted as u, and the final velocity of the combined particles after the collision be denoted as v.
