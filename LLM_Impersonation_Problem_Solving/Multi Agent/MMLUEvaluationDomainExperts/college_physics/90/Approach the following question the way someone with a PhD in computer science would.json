    "gpt_response": "To analyze this problem, we need to consider the conservation of energy of the system. As the disk rolls down the inclined plane without slipping, its initial potential energy is converted into both translational and rotational kinetic energy.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the disk can be expressed as the sum of its translational kinetic energy (1/2mv^2) and its rotational kinetic energy (1/2I\u03c9^2), where m is the mass of the disk, v is its linear velocity, I is the moment of inertia of the disk, and \u03c9 is its angular velocity.\n\nAt the starting point, the disk only has potential energy, which gets converted entirely into kinetic energy as it reaches the bottom of the incline. Since the disk starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy is entirely in the form of rotational kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, after some time, all of the disk's total kinetic energy will be in the form of rotational kinetic energy. Hence, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is 1 (or 100%), which corresponds to option E: 1.",
