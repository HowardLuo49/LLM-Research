If the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area does which of the following?\nA: Decreases by a factor of 81.\nB: Decreases by a factor of 9.\nC: Increases by a factor of 9.\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The energy radiated by a blackbody per unit area is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the blackbody. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as P/A = \u03c3T^4, where P is the power radiated, A is the area of emission, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nIf the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, then the new temperature will be 3T. Substituting this new temperature into the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we get P_new/A = \u03c3(3T)^4 = 81\u03c3T^4.\n\nTherefore, the energy radiated per second per unit area increases by a factor of 81. The correct answer is D: Increases by a factor of 81.",
