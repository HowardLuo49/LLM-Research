    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the relationship between forces F_A and F_B, we can start by applying Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this can be represented as F = ma.\n\nFor object A, we can write F_A = m_A * a_A, where m_A is the mass of object A and a_A is the acceleration of object A.\n\nFor object B, we know that the mass of object B is twice that of object A, so m_B = 2m_A. Additionally, we are given that the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A, so a_B = 2a_A.\n\nSubstituting these relationships into Newton's second law, we get F_B = m_B * a_B = 2m_A * 2a_A = 4m_A * a_A = 4F_A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: F_B = 4F_A.",
