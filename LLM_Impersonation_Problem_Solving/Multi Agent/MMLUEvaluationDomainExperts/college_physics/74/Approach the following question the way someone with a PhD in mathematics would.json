The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we can use the principle of conservation of energy to determine the heat that the brakes must dissipate. The initial potential energy of the elevator when it fell a distance of 100m can be calculated as:\n\\(PE_{initial} = mgh = 1000kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 100m = 981,000J\\)\n\nSince the elevator came to a stop, all of this initial potential energy was converted into heat by the brakes. Therefore, the heat that the brakes must dissipate is equal to the initial potential energy:\n\\(Q = PE_{initial} = 981,000J\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed, but it is closest to option C: 1,000,000J.",
