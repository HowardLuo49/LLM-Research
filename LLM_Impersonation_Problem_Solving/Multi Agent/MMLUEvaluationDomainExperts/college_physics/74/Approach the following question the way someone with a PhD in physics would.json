The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest, we need to consider the work done on the elevator as it falls. \n\nThe work done on the elevator is equal to the change in potential energy of the elevator. The potential energy of the elevator at the top of the shaft is given by mgh, where m = 1000 kg, g = 9.8 m/s^2, and h = 100 m. Therefore, the potential energy at the top is:\n\nPotential energy at the top = 1000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m = 980,000 J\n\nSince the elevator is brought to rest at the bottom of the shaft, all this potential energy is converted to heat by the brakes. Therefore, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is 980,000 J, which is closest to option C: 1,000,000 J.",
