    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the torus generated by revolving the circle C around the z-axis, we first need to parameterize the circle in the yz-plane. The equation of the circle is given by (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1.\n\nLet y = 3 + cos(theta) and z = sin(theta) for theta in [0, 2\u03c0]. Substituting these into the equation of the circle, we get:\n\n(3 + cos(theta) - 3)^2 + sin^2(theta) = 1,\nwhich simplifies to: cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) = 1, as expected.\n\nNow, to generate the torus by revolving this circle around the z-axis, we consider the radius of the circle from the z-axis. This radius is given by 3 + cos(theta). When the circle is revolved around the z-axis, it traces out the torus with minor radius 1 and major radius 3 (from the z-axis). The center of the torus will be at (3,0,0).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the torus is given by:\n\n(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 1,\n\nwhich expands to:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) + y^2 = 1.\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nx^2 - 6x + y^2 + 8 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 8 = 0.",
