If C is revolved around the z-axis, the surface generated is a torus. What is the equation of this torus?\nA: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6y\nB: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 8 + 36(x^2 + z^2)\nC: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)\nD: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)",

    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the torus generated by revolving the circle C around the z-axis, we first need to understand the geometry involved. When a circle is rotated about an axis that does not intersect it, it generates a torus. \n\nThe equation of a circle in the yz-plane given is (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1. To visualize this, observe that the circle is centered at y=3 and has a radius of 1. Upon revolving the circle around the z-axis, we obtain a torus with a hole in the middle, similar to a donut shape.\n\nThe equation of a torus is given by:\n((x - a)^2 + y^2)^2 + z^2 = R^2\nwhere a is the distance from the center of the hole to the center of the torus, and R is the radius of the circle generating the torus.\n\nIn our case, the center of the torus can be taken as (0, 3, 0) with the radius being 1. Therefore, substituting into the equation, we get:\n((x - 0)^2 + y^2)^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nSimplifying gives:\n(x^2 + y^2)^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: (x^2 + y^2)^2 + z^2 = 1.",
