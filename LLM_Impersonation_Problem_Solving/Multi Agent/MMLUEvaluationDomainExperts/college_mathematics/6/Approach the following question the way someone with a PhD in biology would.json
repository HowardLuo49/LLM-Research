    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. A ladder 9 meters in length is leaning against a vertical wall on level ground. As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\nA: 12*sqrt(2)\nB: 6*sqrt(2)\nC: 4*sqrt(2)\nD: 1/(2*sqrt(2))",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of related rates. Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and let y be the height of the ladder above the ground. Since the ladder, wall, and ground form a right triangle, we have x^2 + y^2 = 9^2.\n\nTaking the derivative of both sides with respect to time t, we get:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nGiven that dx/dt = 2 m/s, we are interested in finding dy/dt when y = 3m. To find dy/dt, we need to find x at y = 3m. Substituting y = 3m into x^2 + y^2 = 9^2, we get x^2 + 3^2 = 9^2, or x = 6*sqrt(2).\n\nSubstituting x = 6*sqrt(2) and y = 3 into the related rates equation, we have:\n\n2(6*sqrt(2))(2) + 2(3)(dy/dt) = 0\n\n24*sqrt(2) + 6(dy/dt) = 0\n\ndy/dt = -24*sqrt(2)/6 = -4*sqrt(2) m/s\n\nTherefore, the top end of the ladder is sliding downward at a rate of 4*sqrt(2) m/s when it is 3 meters above the ground. Hence, the answer is C: 4*sqrt(2).",
