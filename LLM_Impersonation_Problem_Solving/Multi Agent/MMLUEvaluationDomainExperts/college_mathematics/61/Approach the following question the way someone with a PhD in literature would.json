A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?\nA: 20!/2^(10)\nB: 10!/2^9\nC: 10^(20) - 2^(10)\nD: 10^(20) - 100",

This can be represented as a combination problem. The total number of ways to choose two courses out of 20 is given by 20 choose 2, which is equal to 20! / (2!(20-2)!). \n\nFor each professor, there are 20 choose 2 ways to assign them to two courses.
