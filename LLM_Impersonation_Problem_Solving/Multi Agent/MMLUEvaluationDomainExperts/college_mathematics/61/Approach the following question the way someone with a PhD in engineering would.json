A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?\nA: 20!/2^(10)\nB: 10!/2^9\nC: 10^(20) - 2^(10)\nD: 10^(20) - 100",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can use combinatorics. \n\nSince each professor will teach exactly 2 courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it, we can think of this problem as a matching problem. \n\nThe total number of ways to match 10 professors with 20 courses is equivalent to the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph with 10 vertices on one side (professors) and 20 vertices on the other side (courses). \n\nThe number of perfect matchings in this bipartite graph can be calculated using the formula for the number of perfect matchings in a complete bipartite graph. This formula is given by (n!) / 2^(n/2) for even n, and is 0 for odd n.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 20, which is even, so the number of perfect matchings is 20! / 2^(20/2) = 20!/2^10.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses is 20!/2^10.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 20!/2^10.",
