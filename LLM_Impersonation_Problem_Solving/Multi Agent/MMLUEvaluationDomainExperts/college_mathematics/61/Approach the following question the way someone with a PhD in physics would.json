A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?\nA: 20!/2^(10)\nB: 10!/2^9\nC: 10^(20) - 2^(10)\nD: 10^(20) - 100",

    "gpt_response": "The number of different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses can be calculated using the concept of combinations. \n\nFirst, we need to choose 2 courses for each of the 10 professors, which can be done in (20 choose 2) ways. This is equivalent to 20! / (2! * 18!).\n\nThen, we need to account for the fact that the order in which courses are assigned to professors does not matter. Since each professor is assigned exactly 2 courses, there will be 10! ways to arrange the professors.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different complete assignments of professors to courses is given by:\n\n(20! / (2! * 18!)) * 10!\n\nThis simplifies to 20! / 2^10, which is option A: 20!/2^(10).",
