    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of the number 7^25, we must consider the patterns that emerge when raising 7 to different powers. By observing the units digit of successive powers of 7, we can see that there is a cyclical pattern that repeats every 4 powers: 7^1 = 7, 7^2 = 49, 7^3 = 343, 7^4 = 2401, and so on.\n\nSince the exponent 25 is equivalent to 1 (mod 4), we know that the units digit of 7^25 will be the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7.
