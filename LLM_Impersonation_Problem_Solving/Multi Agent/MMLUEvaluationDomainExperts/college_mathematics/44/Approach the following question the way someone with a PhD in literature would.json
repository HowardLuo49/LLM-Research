    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of the number 7^25, we must consider the pattern of units digits when raising 7 to consecutive powers. When we raise 7 to the first few powers, we can observe the following pattern: \n7^1 = 7\n7^2 = 49\n7^3 = 343\n7^4 = 2401\n7^5 = 16807\n7^6 = 117649\n\nFrom the pattern above, it is clear that the units digit of 7^n repeats every 4 powers (i.e., the units digit of 7^n is the same as the units digit of 7^(n+4)). Since 25 is congruent to 1 modulo 4 (25 \u2261 1 (mod 4)), the units digit of 7^25 will be the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 7.",
