    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the number 7^25, we can use modular arithmetic. The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. \n\nWhen we take 7 and raise it to any power, the units digit follows a repeating pattern: 7^1 = 7, 7^2 = 49, 7^3 = 343, 7^4 = 2401, and so on. We can see that the units digit repeats after every 4 powers.\n\nSince 25 is congruent to 1 mod 4, we know that the units digit of 7^25 will be the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of the number 7^25 is D: 7.",
