    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question with a deep understanding of linear algebra and matrix theory. \n\nTo determine which of the statements must be true, let's first recall that two matrices A and B are similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^-1AP. \n\nGiven A and B are similar matrices, B = P^-1AP for some invertible matrix P. \n\nI. To determine if A - 2I and B - 2I are similar, we can consider the matrix C = A - 2I and D = B - 2I. \nD = P^-1(B - 2I)P = P^-1BP - P^-1(2I)P = P^-1AP - 2(P^-1IP) = C - 2I\nTherefore, A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices. So, statement I is true. \n\nII. The trace of a matrix is invariant under similarity transformations. \nTr(A) = Tr(P^-1BP) = Tr(BPP^-1) = Tr(B)\nTherefore, A and B have the same trace. So, statement II is also true. \n\nIII. To determine if A^-1 and B^-1 are similar, we need to find an invertible matrix Q such that B^-1 = Q^-1A^-1Q. If we let Q = P^-1, then\nB^-1 = P^-1A^-1P = (P^-1)^-1A^-1P^-1 = Q^-1A^-1Q\nTherefore, A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices. So, statement III holds true as well.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option D: I, II, and III.",
