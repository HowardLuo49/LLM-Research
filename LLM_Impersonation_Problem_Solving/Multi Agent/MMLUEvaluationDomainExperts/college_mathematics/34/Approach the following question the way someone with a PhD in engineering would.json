    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of similar matrices. Two matrices A and B are said to be similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^-1 * A * P.\n\nGiven that A and B are similar matrices, we can deduce that they share many properties. Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices:\nIf A and B are similar matrices, then we can write B = P^-1 * A * P. Subtracting 2I from both sides gives B - 2I = P^-1 * A * P - 2P^-1 * I * P. This simplifies to B - 2I = P^-1 * (A - 2I) * P, showing that A - 2I and B - 2I are also similar matrices. Therefore, Statement I must be true.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace:\nSince A and B are similar matrices, they have the same eigenvalues. This implies that they have the same trace (sum of diagonal elements), as the trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. Therefore, Statement II must be true.\n\nIII. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices:\nIf A and B are similar matrices, we can write B = P^-1 * A * P. Taking the inverse of both sides gives B^-1 = P^-1 * A^-1 * P. This shows that A^-1 and B^-1 are also similar matrices. Therefore, Statement III must be true.\n\nIn conclusion, all three statements are true, so the correct answer is option D: I, II, and III.",
