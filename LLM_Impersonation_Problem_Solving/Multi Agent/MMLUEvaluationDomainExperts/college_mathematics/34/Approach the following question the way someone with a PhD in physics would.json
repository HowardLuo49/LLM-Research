    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the statements must be true if A and B are similar matrices, we first need to understand what it means for two matrices to be similar. Two matrices A and B are said to be similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = PAP^-1.\n\nGiven that A and B are similar matrices, we can re-write the statement as B = PAP^-1.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the given statements:\n\nI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices.\n\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to find an invertible matrix Q such that B - 2I = QAQ^-1. Let's substitute B = PAP^-1 into the equation:\n\nPAP^-1 - 2I = QAP^-1Q^-1\n\nFactor out A:\n\nA(P^-1Q^-1) = (QAP^-1 - 2I)(P^-1)\n\nSince A and B are similar and therefore B = PAP^-1, we can substitute B in the equation:\n\nA - 2I = QAP^-1Q^-1P = QAQ^-1\n\nThus, statement I is true.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace.\n\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. Since A and B are similar matrices, they have the same trace. Thus, statement II is true.\n\nIII. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices.\n\nWe need to find an invertible matrix R such that B^-1 = RAR^-1.\n\nUsing the fact that B = PAP^-1:\n\nB^-1 = (PAP^-1)^-1 = (P^-1)^-1A^-1P^-1 = PAP^-1 = B\n\nThus, statement III is not true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and II.",
