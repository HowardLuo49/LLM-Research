    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the statements must be true if A and B are similar matrices, we need to consider the properties of similar matrices.\n\nTwo matrices A and B are similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^(-1)AP.\n\nI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices:\nLet C = A - 2I and D = B - 2I. Then D = B - 2I = P^(-1)AP - 2P^(-1)IP = P^(-1)(A - 2I)P = P^(-1)CP.\nTherefore, D and C are similar matrices. So, Statement I is true.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace:\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal. The trace of a matrix is invariant under similarity transformations. Therefore, if A and B are similar matrices, they must have the same trace. So, Statement II is also true.\n\nIII. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices:\nIf A and B are similar matrices, then A^-1 and B^-1 are also similar matrices. This is because if B = P^(-1)AP, then B^(-1) = (P^(-1)AP)^(-1) = P^(-1)A^(-1)P, which shows that A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices. Thus, Statement III is true.\n\nIn conclusion, all three statements must be true if A and B are similar matrices. Therefore, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",
