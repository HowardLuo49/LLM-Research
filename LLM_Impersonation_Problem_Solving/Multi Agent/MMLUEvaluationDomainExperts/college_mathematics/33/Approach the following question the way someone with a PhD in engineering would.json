One way to approach this is to manually draw out all possible nonisomorphic configurations of trees with 5 vertices, keeping in mind that any tree with 5 vertices must have exactly 4 edges to be connected and acyclic.\n\nAfter drawing out all possible nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices, I would count the different configurations.
