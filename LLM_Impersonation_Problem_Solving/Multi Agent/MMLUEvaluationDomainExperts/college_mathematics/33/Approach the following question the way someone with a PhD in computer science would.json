The number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices can be calculated using the Pr\u00fcfer sequence.\n\nFor a tree with 5 vertices, the number of possible Pr\u00fcfer sequences is (n-2)^(n-2) = 3^3 = 27.\n\nNow, we need to eliminate duplicates and consider only nonisomorphic trees. There are 3 different types of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices: star tree, path tree, and caterpillar tree.\n\nTherefore, the number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices is 3.\n\nSo, the answer is C: 3.",
