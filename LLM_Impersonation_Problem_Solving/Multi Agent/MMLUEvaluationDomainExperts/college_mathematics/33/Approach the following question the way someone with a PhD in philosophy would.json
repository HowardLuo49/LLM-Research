    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices, it is important to understand the concept of tree isomorphism in graph theory. Isomorphism refers to the notion that two graphs are considered isomorphic if there exists a bijection between their vertex sets that preserves adjacency relationships.\n\nIn the case of trees, isomorphism is particularly relevant as trees are connected graphs with no cycles.
