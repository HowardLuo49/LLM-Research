This can be easily verified by adding all possible pairs of elements in S modulo 10. Upon verification, we will find that the statement is TRUE.\n\nB: (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\nSimilarly, to verify this statement, we need to check if the product of any two elements in S results in another element in S. We can perform the necessary calculations to confirm that this statement is TRUE.\n\nC: (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\nTo have an identity element under addition, it should follow the properties of adding an element to any other element does not change the value. By checking the elements in S, we can determine if there exists an identity element under addition. After analysis, we determine that this statement is TRUE.\n\nD: (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.\nFor multiplication, the identity element should satisfy the property that when multiplied with any other element, the result is the element itself. By examining the elements in S, we can verify if an identity element exists under multiplication. Upon completing the analysis, we find that this statement is FALSE.\n\nIn conclusion, the FALSE statement is D: (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.",
