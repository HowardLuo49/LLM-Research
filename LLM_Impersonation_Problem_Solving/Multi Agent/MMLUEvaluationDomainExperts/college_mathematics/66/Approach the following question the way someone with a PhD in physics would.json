    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum value of the expression x + 4z subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2, we can use Lagrange multipliers.\n\nLet f(x, y, z) = x + 4z and let g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2. The Lagrange function L is given by:\n\nL(x, y, z, \u03bb) = f(x, y, z) - \u03bbg(x, y, z)\n\nTaking the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and \u03bb and setting them equal to zero, we get the following system of equations:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 1 - 2\u03bbx = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = -2\u03bby = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 4 - 2\u03bbz = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 = 0\n\nFrom the second equation, we get that y = 0. Substituting this into the fourth equation, we get that x^2 + z^2 = 2. Substituting y = 0 into the first and third equations, we get x = 1/(2\u03bb) and z = 16/\u03bb.\n\nSubstitute x = 1/(2\u03bb) into x^2 + z^2 = 2, we get 1/(4\u03bb^2) + 256/(\u03bb^2) = 2. Solving this equation, we get that \u03bb^2 = 1/34. \n\nSubstitute \u03bb^2 = 1/34 into x = 1/(2\u03bb) and z = 16/\u03bb, we get x = sqrt(34)/2 and z = 4sqrt(34). Substituting this back into the function f(x, y, z), we get 0 - 4sqrt(34) = -4sqrt(34).\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression x + 4z subject to the given constraint is C: -sqrt(34).",
