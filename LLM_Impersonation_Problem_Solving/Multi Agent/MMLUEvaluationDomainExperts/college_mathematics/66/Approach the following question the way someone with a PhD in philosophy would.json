Here, \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier that we introduce to take into account the constraint x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \u2264 2.\n\nNext, we solve for the critical points of the Lagrangian by taking the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and \u03bb, setting them to zero, and solving for x, y, z, and \u03bb.\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 1 + 2\u03bbx = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 4 + 2\u03bbz = 0\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 = 0\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 0, y can be any value, z = -2/\u03bb, and \u03bb = \u00b1sqrt(1/2).
