Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must carefully analyze each of the conditions given and determine which ones are equivalent to each other and which one stands alone.\n\nCondition A states that for any two distinct column vectors u and v of matrix M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent. This condition essentially means that the columns of matrix M are linearly independent.\n\nCondition B states that the homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution. This condition indicates that the nullspace of matrix M contains only the trivial vector.\n\nCondition C states that the system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This condition implies that matrix M has full column rank.\n\nCondition D states that the determinant of M is nonzero. This condition indicates that the columns of matrix M are linearly independent, leading to a non-singular matrix.\n\nNow, we must determine which condition is not equivalent to any of the other four. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that condition A, B, C, and D are all closely related to the linear independence of the columns of matrix M. However, condition B stands out as it specifically refers to the nullspace of the matrix, while the other conditions focus on the uniqueness of solutions and the non-singularity of the matrix. Therefore, condition B is the one that is not equivalent to any of the other four conditions.",
