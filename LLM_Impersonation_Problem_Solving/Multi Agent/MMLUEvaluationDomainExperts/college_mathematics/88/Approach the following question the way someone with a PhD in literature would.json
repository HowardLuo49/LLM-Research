For which of the following rings is it possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero?\nA: The ring of complex numbers\nB: The ring of integers modulo 11\nC: The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]\nD: The ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must consider the zero divisors in each of the given rings. A zero divisor is a nonzero element a in a ring R such that there exists a nonzero element b in R such that the product ab is equal to zero.\n\nA: In the ring of complex numbers, the product of two nonzero elements can never be zero. This is because complex numbers form a field, which means that every nonzero complex number has a multiplicative inverse. Therefore, no zero divisors exist in the ring of complex numbers.\n\nB: In the ring of integers modulo 11, the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, in this ring, 2 * 6 mod 11 = 0. Therefore, it is possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero in this ring.\n\nC: In the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1], it is not possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero. This is because the product of two continuous functions is still continuous, and a continuous function can only be zero at isolated points. Therefore, no zero divisors exist in this ring.\n\nD: In the ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}, the product of two nonzero elements can be zero. For example, in this ring, (1 + sqrt(2)) * (1 - sqrt(2)) = 1 - 2 = -1, which is a rational number. Therefore, it is possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero in this ring.\n\nIn conclusion, the rings in which it is possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero are B and D.",
