    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we start by defining the properties of eigenvectors of a matrix. An eigenvector of a matrix A is a non-zero vector v which, when multiplied by A, results in a scaled version of v, i.e., Av = \u03bbv, where \u03bb is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector v.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\nI. v is also an eigenvector of 2A.\nTo determine if this statement is true, we evaluate (2A)v. Using the properties of matrix multiplication and eigenvectors, we have:\n(2A)v = 2(Av) = 2(\u03bbv) = 2\u03bbv\nSince v is an eigenvector of A, we know that Av = \u03bbv. Therefore, (2A)v = 2\u03bbv, which implies that v is an eigenvector of 2A with eigenvalue 2\u03bb. So, option I is true.\n\nII. v is also an eigenvector of A^2.\nSimilarly, we evaluate (A^2)v to determine if v is an eigenvector of A^2:\n(A^2)v = A(Av) = A(\u03bbv) = \u03bb(Av) = \u03bb(\u03bbv) = \u03bb^2v\nSince v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, we find that v is not necessarily an eigenvector of A^2. Therefore, option II is false.\n\nIII. v is also an eigenvector of A^(-1).\nTo determine if v is an eigenvector of A^(-1), we evaluate (A^(-1))v:\n(A^(-1))v = A^(-1)(Av) = A^(-1)(\u03bbv) = \u03bb(A^(-1)v)\nIf v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, then (A^(-1))v is not necessarily equal to \u03bbv. Therefore, option III is false.\n\nBased on our analysis, only option I is necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer is A: I only.",
