If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

R is commutative:\nIf R is not commutative, then there exist elements a and b in R such that ab is not equal to ba. In this case, the set {0, a} would form a right ideal of R, as a(rb) = 0 for all r in R. If R has exactly two right ideals, it must be the case that R is commutative to prevent the existence of non-commutative elements and hence non-commutative right ideals.\n\nII. R is a division ring:\nIf R is a division ring, then all non-zero elements have multiplicative inverses. If R has exactly two right ideals, one of them must be the trivial ideal {0}, as it is always a right ideal of any ring. The other non-trivial right ideal must contain all non-zero elements, which implies that every non-zero element must have a multiplicative inverse. Therefore, R must be a division ring.\n\nIII. R is infinite:\nThe fact that R has exactly two right ideals does not impose any restriction on the cardinality of R. It can be finite or infinite. Therefore, R being infinite is not a necessary consequence of having exactly two right ideals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
