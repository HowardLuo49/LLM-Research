    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this equation, we need to analyze the properties of the cosine function and its relationship with the variable x.\n\nGiven the equation cos(97x) = x, we know that the domain of the cosine function is [-1,1], and since x is a positive number, it must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nTo find the number of positive solutions for x, we can examine the graph of the function f(x) = cos(97x) - x. The function f(x) will have a zero when cos(97x) = x.\n\nConsidering the periodic behavior of the cosine function, we should look for solutions within one period of the function. The period of the function cos(97x) is 2\u03c0/97. In this interval ([0,2\u03c0/97]), the cosine function and the line y=x intersect at exactly one point, as verified by plotting the graph. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive solutions for x that satisfy the equation is 1. So the correct answer is A: 1.",
