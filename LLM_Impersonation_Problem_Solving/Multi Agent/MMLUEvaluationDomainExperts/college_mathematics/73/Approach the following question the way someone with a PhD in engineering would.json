Suppose A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix such that det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, where I is the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix. Which of the following are TRUE of A?\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nII. The determinate of A is \u22123.\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues \u22123 and 1.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",
