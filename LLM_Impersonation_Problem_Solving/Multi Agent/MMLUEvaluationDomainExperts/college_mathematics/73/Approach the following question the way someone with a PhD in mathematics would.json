    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationships between the eigenvalues of a matrix, the trace of a matrix, and the determinant of a matrix.\n\nLet's denote the eigenvalues of matrix A as \u03bb1, \u03bb2, and \u03bb3. From the given information, we know that the determinant of A - \u03bbI is equal to -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3. This means that the characteristic polynomial of A is -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3.\n\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. Therefore, the trace of matrix A is given by:\n\nTrace(A) = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3\n\nThe determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Therefore, the determinant of matrix A is given by:\n\ndet(A) = \u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * \u03bb3\n\nNow, let's consider the options given:\n\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nFrom the characteristic polynomial, we know that the sum of the roots is the opposite of the coefficient of \u03bb^2, which is 3. Therefore, the trace of A is indeed 3. This statement is TRUE.\n\nII. The determinant of A is -3.\nFrom the characteristic polynomial, we know that the constant term is the determinant, which is -3. This statement is also TRUE.\n\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues -3 and 1.\nFrom the characteristic polynomial, we can see that the roots of the polynomial are not necessarily -3 and 1. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which are not explicitly specified. This statement is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
