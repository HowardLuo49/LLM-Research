    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by first determining the pattern in the given equation f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]. \n\nGiven that the function passes through the origin, this means that f(0) = 0. We can use this information to work out the pattern in the function.\n\nLet's substitute different values for n into the equation f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)] and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nWhen n = 1: f(2(1)) = 1^2 + f[2(1 - 1)]  \nThis simplifies to f(2) = 1 + f(0)  \nf(2) = 1 + 0  \nf(2) = 1\n\nWhen n = 2: f(2(2)) = 2^2 + f[2(2 - 1)]  \nThis simplifies to f(4) = 4 + f(2)  \nf(4) = 4 + 1  \nf(4) = 5\n\nWhen n = 3: f(2(3)) = 3^2 + f[2(3 - 1)]  \nThis simplifies to f(6) = 9 + f(4)  \nf(6) = 9 + 5  \nf(6) = 14\n\nWhen n = 4: f(2(4)) = 4^2 + f[2(4 - 1)]  \nThis simplifies to f(8) = 16 + f(6)  \nf(8) = 16 + 14  \nf(8) = 30\n\nTherefore, the value of f(8) is 30.
