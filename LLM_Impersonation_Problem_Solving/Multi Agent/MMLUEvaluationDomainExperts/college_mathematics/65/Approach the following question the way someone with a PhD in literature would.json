    "gpt_response": "In order to determine which of the given expressions must also be divisible by 11, we must first consider the property that if 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, then any linear combination of 3x and 7y will also be divisible by 11, in particular any integer multiple of 3x added to any integer multiple of 7y. \n\nNow, looking at the given expressions: \nA: 4x + 6y = (3x + 7y) + (x - y), a linear combination of 3x and 7y plus a multiple of x and y, may or may not yield a number divisible by 11. \nB: x + y + 5 = (3x + 7y) + (-2x -6y +5), a linear combination of 3x and 7y plus a multiple of x and y, may or may not yield a number divisible by 11. \nC: 9x + 4y = 3(3x) + 4y, a multiple of 3x plus a multiple of y, may or may not yield a number divisible by 11. \nD: 4x - 9y = 1(3x) + (- 2)(7y), a multiple of 3x plus a multiple of 7y, will definitely yield a number divisible by 11 since 3x + 7y is divisible by 11.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice must be D: 4x - 9y.",
