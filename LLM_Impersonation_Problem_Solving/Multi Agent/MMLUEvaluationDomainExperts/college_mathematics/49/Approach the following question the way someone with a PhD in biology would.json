    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in biology, I would evaluate the options based on mathematical principles that I have learned and applied in my research. \n\nFirstly, we know that if a function is Lebesgue integrable, it may not necessarily be Riemann integrable. This is because Lebesgue integrability is a more general concept that allows for a wider range of functions to be integrated compared to Riemann integrability. Thus, option A is not necessarily true.\n\nNext, we consider options B and C. These options relate to the differentiability of the function at certain points. It is known that a bounded Lebesgue integrable function may be nondifferentiable at a set of points with Lebesgue measure zero. However, if the set of points where the function is nondifferentiable is countably infinite (as in option B) or uncountably infinite (as in option C), then we run into issues. It is possible for a Lebesgue integrable function to be nondifferentiable at an uncountable set of points, which would contradict options B and C.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of Lebesgue integrability and differentiability, the correct answer would be option D: None of the above.",
