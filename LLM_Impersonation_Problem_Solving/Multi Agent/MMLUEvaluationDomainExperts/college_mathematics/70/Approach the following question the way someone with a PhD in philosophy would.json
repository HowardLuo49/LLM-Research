The\ncone\u2019s height and radius are 2 cm and 1 cm, respectively. At what rate does the height of the water change\nwhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone?

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first establish a relationship between the height of the water in the cone and the volume of water in the cone.

Since the cone and the water level are similar, the ratio of the height of the water to the height of the cone is equal to the ratio of the radius of the water level to the radius of the cone:\nh/(2cm) = r/(1cm) => r = (1/2)h\n\nDifferentiating both sides of this equation with respect to t, we get:\ndr/dt = (1/2) * dh/dt\n\nNow substitute r = (1/2)h and dr/dt = (1/2) * dh/dt into the expression for dV/dt:\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3) * 2(1/2) * h * (1/2) * dh/dt * h + (\u03c0/3) * (1/2 * h)^2 * dh/dt\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/3) * h^2 * (1/4) * dh/dt + (\u03c0/3) * (1/4) * h^2 * dh/dt\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/12) * h^2 * dh/dt + (\u03c0/12) * h^2 * dh/dt\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/6) * h^2 * dh/dt\n\nGiven that the rate at which the volume of water is changing is 3 cm^3 per minute and the height of the water is half a centimeter below the top of the cone (i.e., h = 1.5 cm), we can solve for dh/dt:\n3 = (\u03c0/6) * (1.5)^2 * dh/dt\n3 = (\u03c0/6) * (2.25) * dh/dt\n3 = (3/4)\u03c0 * dh/dt\ndh/dt = 4/(3\u03c0) cm/min\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the height of the water is changing when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone is option B: -4/(3\u03c0) cm/min.",
