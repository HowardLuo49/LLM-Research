A compact space is one in which every open cover has a finite subcover, while a complete space is one in which every Cauchy sequence converges. \n\nStatement A asserts that every compact space is complete. This statement is false, as there exist examples of compact spaces that are not complete. For example, consider the closed interval [0,1] in the standard topology. This interval is compact, as every open cover has a finite subcover. However, it is not complete, as the sequence of rational numbers in [0,1] is Cauchy but does not converge in [0,1].\n\nStatement B asserts that every complete space is compact. This statement is also false, as there exist examples of complete spaces that are not compact. For example, consider the set of real numbers with the usual metric. This space is complete, as every Cauchy sequence converges in the real numbers. However, it is not compact, as the set of real numbers is not bounded. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Neither (a) nor (b).",
