    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the properties of the given system of linear equations. \n\nTo determine whether the system of equations is consistent, we need to verify if there exists at least one solution. This can be done by checking the rank of the augmented matrix of the coefficients. If the rank is equal to the rank of the matrix of coefficients, then the system has at least one solution. \n\nTo determine if the system has infinitely many solutions, we need to check if the rank of the augmented matrix is less than the number of unknowns. If this is the case, then there are infinitely many solutions. \n\nTo determine if the sum of any two solutions is a solution, we need to analyze the properties of linear equations. Adding two solutions to the system should result in another valid solution. \n\nTo determine if every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0), we need to check if all solutions can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the given solution. This can be done by checking if the given solution is a linear combination of the solutions to the system. \n\nBased on the analysis above, I can conclude that statement D is false.
