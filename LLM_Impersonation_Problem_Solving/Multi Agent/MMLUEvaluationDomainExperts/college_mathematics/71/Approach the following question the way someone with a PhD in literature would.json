    "gpt_response": "In order to determine which of the statements is false, a PhD in literature would likely approach the question by analyzing the mathematical properties of the system of linear equations and the implications of each statement.\n\nA: The system is consistent.\nA system of linear equations is consistent if it has at least one solution. In this case, if the system has any solutions, it is considered consistent. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nB: The system has infinitely many solutions.\nA system of linear equations can have infinitely many solutions if it has more than one solution and there is a parameter involved in the solutions. In this case, the system is consistent, but it is not explicitly stated that it has infinitely many solutions. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true and may be false.\n\nC: The sum of any two solutions is a solution.\nIn a linear system, if two solutions are combined in a linear manner, the resulting sum should also be a solution. This is one of the fundamental properties of linear systems. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nD: Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\nIf every solution to the system is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0), it means that all solutions are multiples of this particular solution vector. This statement may be true or false depending on the specific solutions of the system. The PhD in literature would likely analyze the solutions of the system to determine if they can all be expressed as scalar multiples of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the statements, the PhD in literature would likely identify statement B as potentially false and would scrutinize the solutions of the system to confirm whether every solution is indeed a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).",
