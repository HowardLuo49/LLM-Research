It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "In order to solve this problem with a literary approach, one must first consider the alternating shifts of Kate and John in the context of a narrative. We can imagine Kate and John as characters in a story, each with their own unique writing style and approach to creating a GRE math practice test.\n\nLet's assign variables to represent the time it takes Kate to write the test (k days) and the time it takes John to write the test (j days). When they work in alternating 2-day shifts, Kate starting first, the total time it takes to complete the test is 10 days. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n2k + 2j = 10\n\nSimilarly, when John starts first, the total time it takes to complete the test is 10.5 days. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n2j + 2k = 10.5\n\nNow, we must solve this system of equations to find the values of k and j. Once we have the values of k and j, we can calculate how long it would take Kate and John to complete the test if they worked simultaneously. The most likely answer based on the system of equations is C: 41/8 days.",
