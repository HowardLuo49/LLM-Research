    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. It takes Kate k days to write a GRE math practice test. It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Let us consider the efficiencies of Kate and John in terms of the fraction of the test that they complete in a day. Let e be Kate's efficiency and f be John's efficiency. Therefore, we have the equations:\n\nk = 1 / (k * e) + 1 / (k * f)\nk + 0.5 = 1 / (k * f) + 1 / (k * e)\n\nSolving these equations, we find that e = 2/5 and f = 1/5. Therefore, their combined efficiency when working simultaneously is 3/5. \n\nSo, the time it takes for Kate and John to complete the test if they work simultaneously is:\n\n1 / (k * 3/5) = 5/3k = 5/3 * 3 = 5 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 5 days.",
