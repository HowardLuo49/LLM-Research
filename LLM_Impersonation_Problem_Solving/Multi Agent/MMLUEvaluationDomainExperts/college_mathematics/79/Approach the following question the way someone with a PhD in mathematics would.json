This is because the closure of A includes all limit points of A, and if the closure were disconnected, it would contradict A being connected. Therefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nFor the second statement, we can approach this using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Since the interval (0, 1) is a convex set in Euclidean space, any continuous function f from (0, 1) to itself will have a fixed point according to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. Therefore, Statement 2 is also True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
