    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "As a philosopher with expertise in mathematics, we can approach this question by applying the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots, counting multiplicities. In this case, we are dealing with a polynomial of degree 5, so it may have up to 5 complex roots.\n\nTo determine the number of real roots, we can analyze the graph of the polynomial and look for sign changes in the y-values. By examining the function f(x) = 2x^5 + 8x - 7, we notice that the leading coefficient is positive, which means the graph goes from negative to positive at some point. This indicates that there is at least one real root.\n\nAdditionally, by applying the intermediate value theorem, we can deduce that there is exactly one real root based on the behavior of the function as x approaches negative and positive infinity. Therefore, the correct answer is B: One.",
