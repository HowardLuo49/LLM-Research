    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of real roots of the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7, we can use the Descartes' rule of signs. This rule states that the number of positive real roots of a polynomial is either equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the terms of the polynomial, or less than that by an even number. Similarly, the number of negative real roots is either equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial, or less than that by an even number.\n\nIn this case, the coefficients of the terms of the polynomial are 2, 8, and -7. There are two sign changes in the coefficients, from positive to negative between 8 and -7, and from negative to positive between 2 and 8. Thus, according to Descartes' rule of signs, the number of positive real roots of the polynomial is either 2 or less than that by an even number. Similarly, the number of negative real roots is either 0 or less than that by an even number.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7 may have two positive real roots and no negative real roots. Since the question specifically asks for the number of real roots, it is safe to conclude that the polynomial has two real roots. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Two.",
