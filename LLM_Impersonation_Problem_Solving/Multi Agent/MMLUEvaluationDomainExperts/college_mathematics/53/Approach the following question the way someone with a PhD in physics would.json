    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the area of an equilateral triangle with an inscribed circle of radius 2, we first need to determine the side length of the triangle. \n\nFor an equilateral triangle, the radius of the inscribed circle is related to the side length of the triangle by the formula: \nradius = (sqrt(3)/6) * side length\n\nGiven that the radius is 2, we can solve for the side length: \n\n2 = (sqrt(3)/6) * side length \nside length = (2 * 6) / sqrt(3) \nside length = 12 / sqrt(3) \n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula: \nArea = (sqrt(3)/4) * side length^2 \n\nPlugging in the side length we found: \nArea = (sqrt(3)/4) * (12/sqrt(3))^2 \nArea = (sqrt(3)/4) * (144/3) \nArea = (sqrt(3)/4) * 48 \nArea = 12 * sqrt(3) \n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 12 * sqrt(3), which corresponds to option C.",
