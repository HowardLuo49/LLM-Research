Statement 1 | Suppose f : [a, b] is a function and suppose f has a local maximum. f'(x) must exist and equal 0?

    "gpt_response": "In considering Statement 1, we must analyze the conditions that lead to a function having a local maximum. A function f : [a, b] has a local maximum at a point c if there exists an open interval (c - \u03b4, c + \u03b4) containing c such that f(x) \u2264 f(c) for all x in (c - \u03b4, c + \u03b4). The existence of a local maximum does not necessarily require the derivative f'(x) to exist at c, as it is possible for a function to have a local maximum at a point where the derivative is undefined. Additionally, even if the derivative exists at c, it does not necessarily have to equal 0 for the function to have a local maximum. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nTurning to Statement 2, the property of the rational numbers Q is such that they are countable and have gaps between them, meaning there exist irrational numbers between any two distinct rational numbers. As a result, it is indeed possible to construct non-constant continuous maps from the real numbers R to the rational numbers Q, as there are infinite possible ways to map the continuous real line to the countable rational numbers while preserving continuity. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nConsidering both statements together, we find that the correct answer is C: False, True.",
