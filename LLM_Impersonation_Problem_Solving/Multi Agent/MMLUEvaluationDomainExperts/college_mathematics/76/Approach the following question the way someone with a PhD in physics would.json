    "gpt_response": "Statement 1 can be evaluated by considering the definition of a local maximum for a function. A local maximum occurs at a point where the function is greater than or equal to the function values around that point within a certain neighborhood. In mathematical terms, for a function f(x) with a local maximum at x=c, there exists a \u03b4>0 such that f(x) \u2264 f(c) for all x in (c-\u03b4, c+\u03b4) \u2229 [a, b]. \n\nIn order for f'(c) to exist and equal 0 at a local maximum, we would typically require that the function is differentiable in a neighborhood around the point of interest. This is not always the case, as it is possible for a function to have a local maximum at a point where the derivative does not exist. One common example is the function f(x) = |x| at x=0, where the function has a local maximum at x=0 but the derivative does not exist at that point.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\nStatement 2 pertains to the existence of non-constant continuous maps from the real numbers to the rationals. This statement is indeed true due to the cardinality difference between the set of real numbers (uncountably infinite) and the set of rational numbers (countably infinite).
