    "gpt_response": "To determine where the relative extrema and the absolute minimum of the function f(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^3 lie, we need to first find the critical points of the function and then analyze their nature using the second partial derivative test.\n\nTo find the critical points of f, we need to find where the gradient of f is equal to the zero vector.
