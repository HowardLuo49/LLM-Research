If f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on the open interval (-1, 4) such that f(3) = 5 and f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, what is the greatest possible value of f(0)?\nA: 3\nB: 4\nC: 5\nD: 8",

    "gpt_response": "To address this question, one must first recognize the implications of the given conditions on the function f. \n\nThe fact that f'(x) is greater than or equal to -1 for all x on the interval (-1, 4) implies that the function f is non-decreasing. This means that the function is continuously increasing or remaining constant over the interval. \n\nGiven that f(3) = 5, the function attains a value of 5 at x = 3. Since the function is non-decreasing, the maximum value it can achieve before x = 3 is 5. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of f(0) is equal to f(3) = 5. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 5.",
