    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the options is NOT a group, we must first understand the necessary criteria for a set to be a group. A group is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. Closure: For any two elements a and b in the group, the result of the binary operation must also be an element of the group.\n2. Associativity: The binary operation must be associative, meaning that (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all elements a, b, and c in the group.\n3. Identity Element: There exists an element e in the group such that for any element a in the group, a * e = e * a = a.\n4.

For example, multiplying two nonzero integers can result in a zero, which is not included in the set of nonzero integers.\n- Therefore, option B is NOT a group.\n\nC: The nonzero real numbers under multiplication\n- This is a group known as the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers.
