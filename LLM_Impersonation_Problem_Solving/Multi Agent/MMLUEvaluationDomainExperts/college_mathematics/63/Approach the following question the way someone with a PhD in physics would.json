    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must consider the probabilities of the different possible outcomes of the game.\n\nLet us define the event E as the event of the player who makes the first toss winning the game, and let F be the event of the player who makes the second toss winning the game.\n\nThe probability of event E happening is equal to the probability of the player who makes the first toss getting a head on their first toss, which is 1/2.\n\nThe probability of event F happening is equal to the probability of the player who makes the first toss getting a tail on their first toss, followed by the player who makes the second toss getting a head on their first toss. This can be calculated as (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is P(E) = 1/2.\n\nSo, the answer is C: 1/2.",
