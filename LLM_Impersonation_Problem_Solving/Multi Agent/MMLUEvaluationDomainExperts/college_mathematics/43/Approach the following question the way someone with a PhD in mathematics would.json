    "gpt_response": "To determine which statements are true, we will analyze each one separately.\n\nI. The trace of A^2 is nonnegative:\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. Therefore, the trace of A^2 would be the sum of the squares of the diagonal elements of A. Since the squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, the trace of A^2 will always be nonnegative. Therefore, Statement I is true.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative:\nIf A^2 = A, then A(A) = A, which implies that A is idempotent. For an idempotent matrix, the eigenvalues can only be 0 or 1. Since the sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its trace, if A is idempotent, the trace of A will be equal to the number of eigenvalues equal to 1, and hence nonnegative. Therefore, Statement II is true.\n\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B:\nThe trace of a matrix represents the sum of its diagonal elements. When we multiply two matrices, the trace of the resulting matrix will be the sum of the products of corresponding diagonal elements of the original matrices. Therefore, the trace of AB will not necessarily be equal to the product of the traces of A and B. Therefore, Statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, only Statements I and II are true. The correct answer is option C: I and II only.",
