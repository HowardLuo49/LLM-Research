    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged, we can use combinatorial analysis. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25, which is given by the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nWhere n is the total number of suitcases (25) and r is the number of suitcases selected (3).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25 is:\n\n25C3 = 25! / 3!(25-3)! = 25! / 3!22! = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2300\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 total damaged suitcases, combined with 1 undamaged suitcase out of the 20 total undamaged suitcases. This can be calculated as:\n\n5C2 * 20C1 = (5! / 2!(5-2)!) * (20! / 1!(20-1)!) = (10) * (20) = 200\n\nFinally, the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\nP(exactly 2 damaged) = 200 / 2300 = 2/23\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2/23.",
