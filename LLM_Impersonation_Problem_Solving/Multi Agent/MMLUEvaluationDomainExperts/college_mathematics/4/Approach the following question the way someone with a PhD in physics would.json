    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged, we can use combinatorial analysis. \n\nThere are a total of 25 suitcases, from which we need to select 3. This can be done in 25 choose 3 ways, denoted as C(25,3) = 25! / (3!(25-3)!) = 2300 ways.\n\nTo determine the probability of selecting exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 damaged ones, we can select 2 out of the 5 damaged suitcases in 5 choose 2 ways, denoted as C(5,2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10 ways. \n\nFor the third suitcase, we need to select 1 out of the 20 undamaged suitcases in 20 choose 1 ways, denoted as C(20,1) = 20 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select 2 damaged suitcases and 1 undamaged suitcase out of the 25 is given by 10 * 20 = 200 ways.\n\nSo, the probability of this happening is 200 / 2300 = 2 / 23.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: C: 2/23.",
