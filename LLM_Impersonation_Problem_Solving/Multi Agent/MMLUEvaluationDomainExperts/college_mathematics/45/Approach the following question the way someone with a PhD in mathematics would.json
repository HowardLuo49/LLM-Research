    "gpt_response": "Let us approach each statement separately.\n\nStatement 1:\nFirst, we are given that the function f : X \u2192 Y is continuous and X is compact. Since X is compact, every continuous function on X is uniformly continuous. This is because in a compact set, any sequence has a convergent subsequence, and the continuity of f ensures that sequences which are close together in the domain must map to points that are close together in the codomain. Therefore, it follows that f must be uniformly continuous. \n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2:\nWe are given that f(x) and g(x) are everywhere differentiable. In order for the composition f(g(x)) to be differentiable, we need to check the differentiability conditions. By the chain rule, if f and g are differentiable, then the composition f(g(x)) will also be differentiable. \n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
