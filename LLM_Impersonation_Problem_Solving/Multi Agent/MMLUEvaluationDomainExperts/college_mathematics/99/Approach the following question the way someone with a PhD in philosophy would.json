Let T: R^2 -> R^2 be the linear transformation that maps the point (1, 2) to (2, 3) and the point (-1, 2) to (2, -3). Then T maps the point (2, 1) to\nA: (1, 6)\nB: (-1, 4)\nC: (3, 2)\nD: (-4, 3)",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the image of the point (2, 1) under the linear transformation T, we must first find the matrix representation of T. \n\nLet A = (a11, a12; a21, a22) be the matrix representation of T. Since T maps the point (1, 2) to (2, 3) and the point (-1, 2) to (2, -3), we can set up the following system of equations:\n\na11 + 2a21 = 2\na12 + 2a22 = 3\n-a11 + 2a21 = 2\n-a12 + 2a22 = -3\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that a11 = 3/2, a12 = 7/2, a21 = -1/2, and a22 = 5/2. Therefore, the matrix representation of T is A = (3/2, 7/2; -1/2, 5/2).\n\nNow, to find the image of the point (2, 1) under T, we multiply the matrix A by the point (2, 1) as follows:\n\nA * (2, 1) = (3/2 * 2 + 7/2 * 1, -1/2 * 2 + 5/2 * 1) = (3 + 7/2, -1 + 5/2) = (17/2, 3/2)\n\nTherefore, T maps the point (2, 1) to (17/2, 3/2), which is equivalent to (8.5, 1.5).\n\nAs such, none of the answer choices match the result of the linear transformation T, so we conclude that the correct response is not given among the options provided.",
