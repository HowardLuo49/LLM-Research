Points A and B are chosen randomly such that A and B divide the segment into three smaller segments. What is the probability that the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle?\nA: 0\nB: 10%\nC: 25%\nD: 50%",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem. \n\nAccording to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. In this case, we have three smaller segments of length x, y, and 10-x-y.\n\nTo form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side:\nx + y > 10 - x - y\ny + 10 - x - y > x\nx + 10 - x - y > y\n\nSimplifying the inequalities:\n2x + 2y > 10\n2y > x\nx > -y\n\nFrom the first inequality, we have 2x + 2y > 10. Since the length of the segment is 10, we can deduce that x + y > 5. From this, we can see that the only way for the three smaller segments to form a triangle is if each segment is less than half the length of the total segment.\n\nTherefore, the probability that randomly chosen points A and B will create three smaller segments that can form a triangle is 0, hence the answer is A: 0.",
