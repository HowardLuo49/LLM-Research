Points A and B are chosen randomly such that A and B divide the segment into three smaller segments. What is the probability that the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle?\nA: 0\nB: 10%\nC: 25%\nD: 50%",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the conditions under which the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet the segment have a length of 10 units. Without loss of generality, let's assume that point A is chosen first, and point B is chosen second. The position of A can vary from 0 to 10, and B can vary from 0 to 10, yielding a total of 100 possibilities.\n\nFor the three segments to be able to form a triangle, the lengths of the segments must satisfy the triangle inequality conditions. Let's denote the lengths of the segments formed by points A and B as a, b, and c.\n\nThe conditions for the segments to form a triangle can be expressed as:\n1) a + b > c\n2) b + c > a\n3) a + c > b\n\nConsidering the possible values of a, b, and c with our segment length of 10 units, we can see that there are certain configurations where one or more of the conditions fail. For example, if point A is chosen at position 0 and point B is chosen at position 5, we have segments of lengths 0, 5, and 5, which do not satisfy condition 1.\n\nBy systematically analyzing all possible configurations, we can conclude that the probability of randomly choosing points A and B such that the three segments could form the sides of a triangle is 0. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 0",
