    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in computer science, we would approach it mathematically. \n\nGiven the recursive formula x_(n+1) = sqrt(3+2x_n) for all positive integers n, with x_1 = 1, we are looking for the limit as n approaches infinity of the sequence {x_n}.\n\nTo find the limit, we would start by analyzing the behavior of the sequence as n approaches infinity. We can see that as n approaches infinity, x_n will also approach infinity. \n\nTo find the limit, we could start by assuming that the limit L exists, and that it equals the limit of x_n as n approaches infinity. Therefore, we have L = sqrt(3 + 2L).\n\nSolving this equation for L, we get L^2 = 3 + 2L, which simplifies to L^2 - 2L - 3 = 0. This is a quadratic equation that can be factored as (L-3)(L+1) = 0, which gives us two potential solutions for L: L = 3 or L = -1.\n\nSince we are dealing with a sequence of real numbers, the limit L must be a real number. Therefore, the limit of the sequence {x_n} is lim x_n = 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 3.",
