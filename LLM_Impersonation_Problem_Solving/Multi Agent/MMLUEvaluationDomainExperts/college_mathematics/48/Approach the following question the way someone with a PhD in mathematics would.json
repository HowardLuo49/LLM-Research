By applying this test, we can find the valid interval of convergence for this series.\n\nFor (II) (\u2212\u221e, 0], the interval extends to negative infinity and includes 0. This interval allows for convergence in the power series as it contains all values less than or equal to 0.\n\nFor (III) [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3], these intervals do not form a continuous range necessary for the convergence of a power series.
