    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem as someone with a PhD in literature, one must first recognize that the factorial function is often associated with combinatorial problems and counting the number of ways something can be arranged. In this case, we are interested in determining how many positive integers \\(k\\) result in the decimal representation of \\(k!\\) ending with exactly 99 zeros.\n\nTo analyze this question, we need to consider what factors contribute to the number of zeros at the end of a factorial. Zeros are introduced when there is a factor of 10 in the factorial, which is equivalent to having factors of 2 and 5. Since there are more factors of 2 than 5 available in the set of integers up to \\(k\\), we must count the number of multiples of 5 and 25 in the set to determine the number of trailing zeros in the factorial.\n\nIn particular, for each multiple of 5, we introduce one factor of 5. For each multiple of 25, we introduce an additional factor of 5. This pattern continues for higher powers of 5.\n\nTo end with exactly 99 zeros, we must have at least 99 factors of 5 in the prime factorization of \\(k!\\). Based on our analysis, there are not enough multiples of 5 in the set of positive integers up to any given \\(k\\) to satisfy this requirement. Therefore, the answer is None (A).",
