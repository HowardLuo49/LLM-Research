    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine for how many positive integers k the ordinary decimal representation of k! ends in exactly 99 zeros, we must consider the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of k!. Since the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of k! is equal to the number of factors of 10 in its prime factorization, and a factor of 10 consists of factors of both 2 and 5.\n\nConsidering that the number of factors of 2 in the prime factorization of k! is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5, we may determine the number of factors of 5 by dividing k by 5 and adding the result to the number of factors of 5 in the result of that division, and so on.\n\nTo end with exactly 99 zeros in the decimal representation of k!, the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of k! must be 99. Therefore, we must solve the equation k/5 + k/25 + k/125 + ... = 99.\n\nBy considering the values of k as we divide by 5 multiple times, it is evident that the only possible values for k that would satisfy the equation are 495, 496, 497, and 498. Thus, there are four positive integers k for which the ordinary decimal representation of k! ends in exactly 99 zeros.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Four.",
