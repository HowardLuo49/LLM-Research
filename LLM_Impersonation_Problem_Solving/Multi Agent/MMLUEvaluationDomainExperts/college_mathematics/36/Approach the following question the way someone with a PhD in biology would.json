    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of a tangent line to a graph. A tangent line is a straight line that touches a curve at a specific point and has the same slope as the curve at that point. \n\nTo find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, we need to find the slope of the curve at that point. The slope of y = x + e^x can be found by taking the derivative of the function with respect to x. \n\nThe derivative of y = x + e^x is dy/dx = 1 + e^x. Evaluating this at x = 0, we get dy/dx = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nTherefore, the slope of the curve at x = 0 is 2. The equation of the tangent line passing through the point (0, f(0)) with slope 2 can be found using the point-slope form of a linear equation. \n\nThus, the equation of the tangent line is y - f(0) = 2(x - 0). \nSimplifying, we get y = 2x + f(0). Subsituting x = 0 and f(0) = 0 + e^0 = 1, we find that the equation of the tangent line is y = 2x + 1. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: y = 2x + 1.",
