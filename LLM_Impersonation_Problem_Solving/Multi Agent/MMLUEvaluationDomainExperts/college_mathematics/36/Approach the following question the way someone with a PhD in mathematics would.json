    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, we first need to find the slope of the tangent line at that point. \n\nThe slope of the tangent line at x = 0 can be found by taking the derivative of the function y = x + e^x and evaluating it at x = 0. The derivative of y = x + e^x is y' = 1 + e^x. Evaluating at x = 0 gives y'(0) = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThis means that the slope of the tangent line is 2. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line can be written in point-slope form as y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is the point of tangency, which is (0, 1), and m is the slope, which is 2.\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation to get: \ny - 1 = 2(x - 0)\ny - 1 = 2x\ny = 2x + 1\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x + 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: y = 2x + 1.",
