    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, we first need to find the slope of the tangent line. The slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point is given by the derivative of the curve at that point.\n\nThe derivative of y = x + e^x with respect to x is dy/dx = 1 + e^x. Evaluating this derivative at x = 0, we get dy/dx = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is 2. The equation of a line with slope m passing through the point (x1, y1) is given by y - y1 = m(x - x1).\n\nSince the tangent line passes through the point (0, 0), the equation of the tangent line is y - 0 = 2(x - 0), which simplifies to y = 2x.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: y = 2x.",
