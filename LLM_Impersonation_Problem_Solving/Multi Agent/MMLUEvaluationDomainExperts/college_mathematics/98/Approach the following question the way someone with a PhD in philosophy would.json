X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. How many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements?\nA: 24\nB: 25\nC: 28\nD: 35",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first understand the concept of subsets and their cardinality within set theory. Given that X is a finite set with a specific property, we can utilize combinatorial reasoning to determine the number of subsets of X with a certain number of elements.\n\nLet n be the number of elements in set X. We know that the number of subsets of X with exactly k elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k). Therefore, if the number of subsets of X with 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets with 2 elements, we can write the following equation:\n\nC(n, 3) = C(n, 2) + 14\n\nSolving this equation will give us the value of n. Once we find n, we can then calculate the number of subsets of X with 4 elements by using the formula for binomial coefficients. Substituting the value of n into C(n, 4) will provide us with the answer.\n\nIt is important to note that this problem involves precise mathematical reasoning and a systematic approach to solving combinatorial problems. By leveraging the properties of binomial coefficients and set theory, we can arrive at the correct answer to the question posed.",
