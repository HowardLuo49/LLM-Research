Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",

    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the dimension of the subspace kernel of the linear transformation T from V onto W, we must analyze the nullity of T. \n\nGiven that T is a linear transformation from V to W, we know that the kernel of T is the set of all vectors in V that map to the zero vector in W. \n\nSince V is the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices and W is the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors, the matrix representation of T can be represented as a 4 x 2 matrix. \n\nUsing the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which states that the sum of the rank and nullity of a linear transformation is equal to the dimension of the domain of the transformation, we have:\n\nRank(T) + Nullity(T) = dim(V)\n\nRank(T) represents the dimension of the range of T, and dim(V) represents the dimension of the domain of T, which is 6 in this case.\n\nSince T is onto W, the rank of T is equal to the dimension of W, which is 4.
