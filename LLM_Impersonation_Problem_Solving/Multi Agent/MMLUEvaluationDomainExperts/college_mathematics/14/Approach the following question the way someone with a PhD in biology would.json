    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other, we first need to determine how many pairs of integers have this relationship.\n\nThere are 10 integers from 1 to 10, which means there are 10*10 = 100 possible pairs of integers that can be chosen.\n\nFor each pair, we need to calculate the number of pairs where one integer is the square of the other. The pairs that have this relationship are (1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,2), (9,3).\n\nTherefore, there are 5 pairs out of 100 where one integer is the square of the other.\n\nThe probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is calculated as (100-5)/100 = 95/100 = 0.95.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 0.95.",
