Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to find the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3. The probability that X \u2264 3 is the sum of the probabilities that X = 1, X = 2, and X = 3, which is 1/2^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3 = 7/8. \n\nSince X and Y are independent, the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3 is (7/8)^2 = 49/64. \n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of X or Y is greater than 3 is 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 15/64.",
