This involves factoring n into prime powers, which allows for a unique representation of n in terms of primes. \n\nFor n = 4, the primary decomposition is 2^2, which results in the two abelian groups of order 4 being isomorphic to either Z/4Z or Z/2Z x Z/2Z. Both of these groups are isomorphic to each other and are the only abelian groups of order 4 up to isomorphism.\n\nFor n = 7, the primary decomposition is 7, which means that there is only one abelian group of order 7, namely Z/7Z.\n\nFor n = 8, the primary decomposition is 2^3, which results in the abelian groups of order 8 being isomorphic to either Z/8Z, Z/4Z x Z/2Z, or Z/2Z x Z/2Z x Z/2Z. These three groups are pairwise non-isomorphic, resulting in three abelian groups of order 8.\n\nFor n = 12, the primary decomposition is 2^2 x 3, which results in the abelian groups of order 12 being isomorphic to either Z/12Z, Z/6Z x Z/2Z, or Z/4Z x Z/3Z.
