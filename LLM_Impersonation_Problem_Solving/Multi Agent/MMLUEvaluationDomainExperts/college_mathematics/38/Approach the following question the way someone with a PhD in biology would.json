    "gpt_response": "As a biologist with a PhD, I would approach this question by analyzing the mathematical statements provided. \n\nIn Statement 1, we are given that the series \u2211|a_i| diverges and that the sum of the series \u2211 a_i is equal to 2. This implies that the series \u2211 a_i oscillates around 2, with the absolute values of the terms diverging. It is known in mathematics that a series with alternating values can be rearranged to converge to a different sum, which is illustrated by the rearrangement a_i_k summing to 4. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nIn Statement 2, we are provided with metric spaces X and Y, where X is closed and bounded, and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT closed and bounded. This statement is also true, as it is possible for a continuous mapping to transform a closed and bounded space into a non-closed and non-bounded space through continuous deformations. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True",
