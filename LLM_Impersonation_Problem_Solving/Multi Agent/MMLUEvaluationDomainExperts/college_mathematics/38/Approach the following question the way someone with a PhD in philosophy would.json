In relation to Statement 1, it is well-known that for a series to converge, the absolute values of its terms must also converge. In this case, if the series \u2211|a_i| diverges but \u2211a_i = 2, then there exists a rearrangement a_i_k such that \u2211a_i_k = 4. This is a result from the Riemann series theorem, which states that conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to any value or even diverge.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2, we are asked to consider the existence of metric spaces X and Y, with X being closed and bounded, and a continuous mapping f: X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is not closed and bounded. This statement is actually false. By the Heine-Borel theorem, a subset of a metric space is closed and bounded if and only if it is compact. Since the continuous image of a compact set is also compact, the statement that f(X) is not closed and bounded contradicts these principles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC: False, True",
