    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon, we first need to understand the properties of a convex polygon. In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. \n\nFor a 10-gon (decagon), the sum of all interior angles can be calculated using the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. In this case, for a 10-gon the sum of all interior angles is (10-2) * 180 = 1440 degrees.\n\nTo maximize the number of acute angles, we need to minimize the number of obtuse angles. The maximum number of obtuse angles that a convex polygon can have is 3, with the remaining angles being acute. This is because each obtuse angle would be at least 180 degrees, and having more than 3 obtuse angles would result in the sum of interior angles exceeding 1440 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is 10 - 3 = 7. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC: 3",
