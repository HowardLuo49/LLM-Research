    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72, we must first factorize the order 72 into its prime factorization. Since 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, we can see that there are three prime factors: 2 and 3.\n\nAbelian groups of order 72 can be represented as direct products of cyclic groups of prime power order. In this case, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. Two cyclic groups of order 2^3 and 3^2: (Z/8Z) x (Z/9Z) = Z/72Z\n2. Two cyclic groups of order 2^3 and 3, and one cyclic group of order 3: (Z/8Z) x (Z/3Z) x (Z/9Z) = Z/72Z\n3. One cyclic group of order 2^3 and two cyclic groups of order 3: (Z/8Z) x (Z/3Z) x (Z/3Z) = Z/72Z\n4. Three cyclic groups of order 2^2, 2, and 3: (Z/4Z) x (Z/2Z) x (Z/3Z) = Z/72Z\n\nTherefore, there are four structurally distinct Abelian groups of order 72, making the correct answer choice A: 4.",
