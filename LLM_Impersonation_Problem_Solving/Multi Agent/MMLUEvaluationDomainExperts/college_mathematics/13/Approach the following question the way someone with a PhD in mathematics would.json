A large class is to be divided into teams and each student must be a member of exactly one team. However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem mathematically, we can think of it as a graph theory problem. Let each student be represented by a vertex in a graph, and let an edge between two vertices represent that the two students dislike each other. \n\nWe are looking to partition the vertices of the graph into teams such that no two vertices connected by an edge are in the same team. This is equivalent to finding the chromatic number of the graph, which represents the minimum number of teams needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nIn this case, we are given that each student dislikes three classmates, so each vertex has degree 3. We know that for any graph with maximum degree 3, the chromatic number is at most 4. Therefore, the minimum number of teams needed is 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 4.",
