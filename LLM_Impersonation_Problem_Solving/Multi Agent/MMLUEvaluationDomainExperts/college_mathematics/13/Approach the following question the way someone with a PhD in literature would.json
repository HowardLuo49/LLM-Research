However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In considering this question, it is helpful to first establish the parameters of the problem. We are tasked with dividing a large class into teams in such a way that each student is not on the same team as three classmates they dislike. This implies that the teams must be constructed with careful attention to the interrelationships between the students' dislikes.\n\nTo begin, let us set up a hypothetical scenario where there are 12 students in the class, labeled A through L. Each student dislikes three other students, as stated in the problem. For example, student A dislikes students B, C, and D. In this case, we can see that each student is connected to 3 other students, forming a dislike triangle.\n\nAs we construct teams, we must ensure that no student is placed on the same team as any of the three students they dislike. This implies that each team must be constructed in such a way that it excludes these disliked students. In the case of student A, for example, their team cannot include students B, C, or D.\n\nIf we continue this process for each student in the class, we will find that each student is connected to exactly three other students through dislikes. To ensure that no student is on the same team as any of these disliked classmates, we must create teams that exclude these individuals.\n\nGiven that each student is connected to 3 disliked classmates, the optimal team size would be 4 students. This would allow for each student to be placed on a team with none of their disliked classmates, as there would be 3 other students on the same team.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is A: 4 teams must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike.",
