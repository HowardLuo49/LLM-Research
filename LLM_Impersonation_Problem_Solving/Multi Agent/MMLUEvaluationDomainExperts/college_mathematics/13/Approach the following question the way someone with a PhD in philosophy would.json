However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the minimum number of teams needed to ensure that no student is on the same team as someone they dislike, we can approach this problem through graph theory.\n\nLet each student in the class be represented by a vertex in a graph, and let edges connect vertices corresponding to students who dislike each other. Since each student dislikes exactly three other students, each vertex will have degree 3 in the graph.\n\nIn order to create teams where no student is on the same team as someone they dislike, we need to find a graph coloring where no adjacent vertices (representing students who dislike each other) have the same color (representing being on the same team).\n\nIt is well-known in graph theory that the chromatic number of a graph (the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph such that no adjacent vertices have the same color) is at most the maximum degree of the graph plus 1. In this case, since every vertex has degree 3, the maximum degree is 3, so the chromatic number is at most 4.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of teams needed to ensure that no student is on the same team as someone they dislike is 4. Hence, the correct answer is A: 4.",
