    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of connectedness, compactness, and the Hausdorff property in topological spaces. \n\nI. If A and C are connected, then B is connected:\nThis statement is true. Since A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, if A and C are connected, then if there were a separation of B into two disjoint open sets, this would imply a separation of A or C as well, which contradicts the assumption that A and C are connected.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact:\nThis statement is true. Since A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, B has to be compact. The finite subcover property holds for B, as it is a proper subset of a compact set.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff:\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The Hausdorff property is not preserved under taking subsets. B may or may not be Hausdorff even if A and C are Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: I and II only.",
