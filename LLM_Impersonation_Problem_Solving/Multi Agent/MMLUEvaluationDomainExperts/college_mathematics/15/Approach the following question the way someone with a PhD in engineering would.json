If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would approach this question by considering the definitions and properties of compact sets, continuous functions, bounded functions, and connectedness in a mathematical context.\n\nFor statement I, it can be proven that if a set K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K must be bounded. This is a direct consequence of the Extreme Value Theorem, which states that a continuous function on a compact set attains both its maximum and minimum values. Therefore, statement I must be true.\n\nFor statement II, it is not necessarily true that if every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact. A counterexample can be constructed by considering the set K as a closed interval in R^n, which is not compact but every continuous function defined on it is bounded. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\nFor statement III, it is known that if a set K is compact, then K is connected. This is a property of compact sets in Euclidean space. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nIn conclusion, statements I and III must be true, while statement II is false. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: I and III only.",
