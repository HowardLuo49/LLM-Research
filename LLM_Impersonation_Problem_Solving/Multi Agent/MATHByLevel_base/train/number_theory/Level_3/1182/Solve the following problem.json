    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",
    "gpt_response": "We can simplify the expression first:\n\n$182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 10\\cdot 12 - 1\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 120 - 7 + 3 \\equiv 116 \\pmod{14}$\n\nTherefore, the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3\\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
