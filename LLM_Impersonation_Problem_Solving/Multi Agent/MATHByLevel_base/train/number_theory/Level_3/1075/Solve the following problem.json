    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 199, subtract that power of 2 from 199, and repeat the process with the remaining difference until we reach 0.\n\n$199_{10} = 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 11000111_2$\n\nIn base 2, there are 6 zeros and 3 ones.
