    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime, which means that $A$ must be an even prime (the only even prime is 2). Therefore, $A=2$. \n\nThis means that $B$ must be odd since $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime. The only odd prime number is 3, so $B=3$.\n\nThus, $A-B=2-3=-1$ and $A+B=2+3=5$, so the sum of these four primes is $2+3+(-1)+5=9$, which is divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }$divisible by $3}$.",
