    "solution": "Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$.  Then $n^2 \\equiv d^2 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$.  Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The units digit of a perfect square can only be one of the following digits: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. This is because the units digit of a perfect square is determined by squaring the units digit of the number being squared.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 6?: The units digit of a perfect square can only be one of the following digits: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. This is because the units digit of a perfect square is determined by squaring the units digit of the number being squared.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number.",
