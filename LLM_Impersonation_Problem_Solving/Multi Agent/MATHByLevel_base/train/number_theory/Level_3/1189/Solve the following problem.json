    "solution": "We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s. Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1. We can only vary the tens digit. Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime would be the next palindromic prime after 101. \n\nChecking the next palindromic numbers after 101, we find that 111 is not prime (since it is divisible by 3), 121 is not prime (since it is divisible by 11), and 131 is prime. Therefore, the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$.",
