    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime number which is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers is 3.\n\nTo prove this, let's consider three consecutive integers: n, n+1, and n+2.\n\nThe sum of these three integers is:\nn + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n+1)\n\nSince the sum of three consecutive integers is always divisible by 3, 3 is a factor of every such sum. It is also important to note that 3 is a prime number.",
