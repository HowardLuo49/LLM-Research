He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the number of jellybeans Alex buys. We know that $x$ leaves a remainder of $11$ when divided by $13$. This implies that $x = 13k + 11$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe also know that $x \\geq 100$ since Alex wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans.\n\nSubstitute $x = 13k + 11$ into $x \\geq 100$, we have $13k + 11 \\geq 100$.\nSolving for $k$, we get $k \\geq \\frac{89}{13}$.\nSince $k$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $k$ that satisfies the inequality $k \\geq \\frac{89}{13}$ is $k=7$.\n\nTherefore, the number of jellybeans Alex should buy is $x = 13 \\times 7 + 11 = \\boxed{102}$.",
