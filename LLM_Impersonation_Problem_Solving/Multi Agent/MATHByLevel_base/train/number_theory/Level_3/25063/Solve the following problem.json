    "solution": "Since $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are both odd, their sum is even and therefore divisible by 2.  There are no smaller primes than $\\boxed{2}$, so it is the smallest prime divisor of the sum.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$, we can first simplify the expression. \n\nWe can rewrite $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ as $5^{23} + (5+2)^{17}$. \n\nExpanding the binomial using the binomial theorem, we get:\n\n$5^{23} + (5+2)^{17} = 5^{23} + \\binom{17}{0}5^{17}2^0 + \\binom{17}{1}5^{16}2^1 + \\dots + \\binom{17}{16}5^12^{16} + 2^{17}$\n\nAll terms in the expansion are divisible by 5 except for the last term $2^{17}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ is 2.",
