    "solution": "The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$. Therefore, we only need to consider these squares. Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$. Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$. No square begins and ends with $5$. One square begins and ends with $6: 676$. No square begins and ends with $9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of 3-digit squares that are palindromes, we first need to determine the range of 3-digit numbers that could be perfect squares. The smallest 3-digit number is 100, whose square is $100^2 = 10000$. The largest 3-digit number is 999, whose square is $999^2 = 998001$. So, perfect squares in the range of 100 to 999 would be counted.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these perfect squares are palindromes. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For a 3-digit number to be a palindrome, it must have the form $aba$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits. \n\nLet's list the possible values for $a$ and $b$:\n- $a$ can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since a leading zero in a 3-digit number is not allowed).\n- $b$ can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nTherefore, there are $9$ possible values for $a$ and $10$ possible values for $b$. This gives us a total of $9 \\times 10 = 90$ 3-digit palindromic numbers.\n\nHowever, not all of these numbers are perfect squares. We need to check which of these palindromic numbers are squares between 100 and 999. \n\nChecking the squares of the palindromic numbers with $aba$ form, we find that the squares with $aba$ form that fall in the range of 100 to 999 are $121$, $484$, and $676$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ 3-digit squares that are also palindromes.",
