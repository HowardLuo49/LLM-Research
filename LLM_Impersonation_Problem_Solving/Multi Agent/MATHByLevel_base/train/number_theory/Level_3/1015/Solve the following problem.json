    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if a number is divisible by $11$, we can use the rule that the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by $11$. \n\nIn this case, the alternating sum is $8 - 5 + 4 - n + 5 - 2 + 6 = 16 - n$. For this expression to be divisible by $11$, $16 - n$ must be either $0$ or a multiple of $11$. \n\nTherefore, we can set $16 - n = 0$ and solve for $n$:\n\n$16 - n = 0$\n\n$n = 16$\n\nTherefore, $n = 16$.",
