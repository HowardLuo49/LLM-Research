    "solution": "Marsha has two equations: \\[a=70n+64\\]and \\[b=105m+99.\\]When she adds these she gets \\begin{align*}\na+b&=70n+105m+64+99 \\\\\n&=35(2n+3m)+163=35(2n+3m+4)+23.\n\\end{align*}The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 35 is $\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to set up some equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's say $a = 70n + 64$ and $b = 105m + 99$, where $n$ and $m$ are integers. This means that $a$ leaves a remainder of 64 when divided by 70, and $b$ leaves a remainder of 99 when divided by 105.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 35. We can express $a+b$ as $(70n + 64) + (105m + 99)$.\n\nTherefore, $a+b = 70n + 105m + 163$.\n\nTo find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 35, we need to find an equivalent expression of $a+b$ in terms of 35. We know that $70 = 35 * 2$ and $105 = 35 * 3$, so we can express $a+b$ as:\n\n$a+b = 35(2n + 3m) + 163$.\n\nSince $35(2n + 3m)$ is divisible by 35, the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 35 is the same as the remainder when 163 is divided by 35.\n\nDividing 163 by 35, we get a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 23.\n\nTherefore, the remainder that Marsha gets when she divides $a+b$ by 35 is $\\boxed{23}$.",
