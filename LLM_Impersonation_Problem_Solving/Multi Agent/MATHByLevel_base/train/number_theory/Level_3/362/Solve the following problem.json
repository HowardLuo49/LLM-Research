    "solution": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer values of $x$ for which $10 \\star x$ is a positive integer, we need to solve the inequality:\n\n$$\\frac{10^2}{x} > 0$$\n\nThis simplifies to $100 > 0$, which is always true. Therefore, $10 \\star x$ will always be a positive integer regardless of the value of $x$. \n\nTherefore, the number of integer values of $x$ for which $10 \\star x$ is a positive integer is infinite.",
