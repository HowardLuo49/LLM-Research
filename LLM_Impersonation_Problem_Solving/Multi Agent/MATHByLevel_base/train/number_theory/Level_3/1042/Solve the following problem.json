    "solution": "$175=5^2\\cdot7^1$. To arrange the divisors of 175, we can (conveniently) start with the divisor 7. Since $\\gcd(5,7)=1$, the two divisors that are adjacent to 7 must be multiples of 7, which means they have to be $5^1\\cdot7=35$ and $5^2\\cdot7=175$. Thus, the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7 is $35+175=\\boxed{210}$.",
