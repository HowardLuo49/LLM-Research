    "solution": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 200th term of the sequence of positive integers formed by omitting perfect squares, we first need to find the first few terms of the sequence so we can identify the pattern.\n\nFirst, let's list out the perfect squares. The first few perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...\n\nThe sequence formed by omitting these perfect squares is: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, ...\n\nIt can be observed that after each square number, there are 2 consecutive numbers omitted.\n\nSince the 200th term falls between the perfect squares at term 199 and term 201 (200 is not a perfect square), we know there are 199 numbers between the perfect squares at terms 198 and 202.\n\nThe 198th term in this sequence is the square of 198 plus 1, which is 198^2 + 1 = 39205, and the 202nd term is the square of 202 plus 1, which is 202^2 + 1 = 40805.\n\nSo, the 200th term is 39205 + 2 = \\boxed{39207}.",
