    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the units digit of a number is the remainder when that number is divided by 10. So, to find the units digit of $n$, we can first find the units digit of $mn$ (which is $1$) and then divide by the units digit of $m$ (which is $7$).\n\nSince $mn = 21^6$ and $m$ has a units digit of 7, we know that $n = \\frac{21^6}{7} = 3\\cdot21^5$.\nNow, to find the units digit of $3\\cdot21^5$, we first find the units digit of $21^5$.\n\nThe units digits of the powers of 21 cycle in the pattern 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, so the units digit of $21^5$ is 1.
