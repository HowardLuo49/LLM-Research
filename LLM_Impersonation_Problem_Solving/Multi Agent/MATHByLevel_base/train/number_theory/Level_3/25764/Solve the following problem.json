    "solution": "First, we find $150=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2.$ The prime factorization of a divisor of 150 must take the form $2^m3^n5^p$ for nonnegative integers $m\\leq 1$, $n\\leq 1$, and $p\\leq 2$. The requirement that the divisor is not divisible by 5 means that we must have $p=0$. Therefore, there are $2$ possibilities for $m$ (namely, 0 or 1) and the same for $n$ for a total of $2\\cdot 2=\\boxed{4}$ such factors.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the prime factorization of 150: $150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2$.\n\nA positive divisor of 150 that is not divisible by 5 cannot have a factor of 5 in its prime factorization. This means that the divisor can only be made up of the factors 2 and 3 from the prime factorization of 150.\n\nSince 150 has 2 choices for the power of 2 (0 or 1), and 2 choices for the power of 3 (0 or 1), there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ total divisors of 150 that are not divisible by 5: 1, 2, 3, and 6.",
