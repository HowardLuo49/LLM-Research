    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100, we need to consider the last two digits of $99^{36}$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the pattern of the last two digits of powers of 9: \n$9^1 = 09$\n$9^2 = 81$\n$9^3 = 29$\n$9^4 = 61$\n$9^5 = 49$\n$9^6 = 41$\n...\n\nAs we can see, the last two digits of powers of 9 repeat in cycles of 2. Since $36$ is divisible by 2, the last two digits of $99^{36}$ will be the same as the last two digits of $9^6$ which is $41$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $99^{36}$ is divided by 100 is $\\boxed{41}$.",
