    "solution": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The largest possible value of $m$ occurs when $x$ and $y$ are the largest possible values less than 10. Therefore, let $x = 7$ and $y = 5$. Then the three-digit positive integer $m$ is equal to $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (10 \\cdot 7 + 5) = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 75 = 2625$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is $\\boxed{2625}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 795?: The largest possible value of $m$ occurs when $x$ and $y$ are the largest possible values less than 10. Therefore, let $x = 7$ and $y = 5$. Then the three-digit positive integer $m$ is equal to $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot (10 \\cdot 7 + 5) = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 75 = 2625$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is $\\boxed{2625}$.",
