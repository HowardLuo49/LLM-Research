    "solution": "We know that at least one of our three consecutive positive integers must be a multiple of $2$ since every other integer in a list of consecutive integers is divisible by $2$. Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$. Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers.",
    "gpt_response": "The greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is 6.\n\nTo determine this, let's consider three consecutive positive integers: n, n+1, and n+2.\n\nThe product of these three integers is:\nn(n+1)(n+2) = n(n^2 + 3n + 2) = n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n\n\nIf we factor out an n from the expression, we get:\nn(n^2 + 3n + 2) = n(n+1)(n+2)\n\nThis shows that the product of any three consecutive positive integers is always divisible by n, n+1, and n+2.\n\nSince we want to find the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product, we can see that 6 is the greatest number that divides n, n+1, and n+2 for any positive integer n.\n\nTherefore, the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is 6.",
