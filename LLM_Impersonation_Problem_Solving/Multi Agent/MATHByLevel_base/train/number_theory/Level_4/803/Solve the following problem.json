    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Nine stones are arranged in a straight line. They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10. The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17. The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on. The counting continues in this manner. Which of the original stones is counted as 99? Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone.",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "gpt_response": "Since the counting pattern repeats every 16 stones, to find out which stone is counted as 99, we need to find the remainder when 99 is divided by 16. \n\n$99 \\div 16 = 6$ with a remainder of 3.\n\nTherefore, the original stone counted as 3 is counted as 99. The first digit of 3 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
