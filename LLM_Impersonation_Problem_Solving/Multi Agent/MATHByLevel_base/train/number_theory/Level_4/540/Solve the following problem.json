    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can simplify the equation $17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7}$ by first reducing 1234 modulo 7:\n\\[1234 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}.\\]\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\\[17n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}.\\]\nNext, we can find the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 7. Since $17 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to get:\n\\[n \\equiv 20 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}.\\]\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{6}$.",
