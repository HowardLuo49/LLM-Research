    "solution": "$285_{10}$ is only four digits for bases 5 and 6, since only these two bases satisfy $b^{4}>285_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. Testing each of our two cases, we find that $285_{10}= 2120_{5} = 1153_{6}$, so only base $\\boxed{6}$ yields a four-digit representation with an odd units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a base in which the representation of $285_{10}$ is a four-digit number whose final digit is odd. \n\nLet's start by converting $285_{10}$ to base $b$. We can do this by dividing 285 by $b$ repeatedly to find the digits in the new base. \n\n$285_{10} = 5 \\pmod b$\n\nDividing by $b$ we get $57$ with no remainder.\n\n$57 = 7 \\pmod b$\n\nDividing by $b$ we get $8$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\n$8 = 1 \\pmod b$\n\nSo, the base $b$ representation of $285_{10}$ is $(185)_b$.\n\nSince we want the representation to be a four-digit number with an odd final digit, we want $b^3 < 285 < b^4$ and the final digit of the base $b$ representation of $285_{10}$ to be odd.\n\nIf the final digit is odd, then $b$ must be odd.
