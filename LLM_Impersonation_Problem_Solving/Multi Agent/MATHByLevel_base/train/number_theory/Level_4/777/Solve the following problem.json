    "solution": "The greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer is $777_8$, which is equal to $7 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 7 = 511$.  This number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so we subtract 1, to get $\\boxed{776_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5, we need to find the highest number that, when converted to base 10, is divisible by 5.\n\nIn base 8, the highest 3-digit number is 777 (which is equal to 511 in base 10).\n\nNow, we need to find the largest number less than or equal to 511 that is divisible by 5. \n\nThe largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 511 is 505. When expressed in base 8, 505 is equal to 777.\n\nTherefore, the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5 is 777.",
