    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by the congruences \\begin{align*}n+5\\equiv 0\\pmod 8 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 8,\\\\n-8\\equiv 0\\pmod 5 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.\\end{align*}Since $\\gcd(5,8)=1$, the above congruences imply $n\\equiv 3\\pmod{40}$. This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$. The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$. Thus $\\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the first condition. If Alicia has $n$ candies and buys $5$ more, she will have $n + 5$ candies. We are given that $n + 5$ is a multiple of $8$.

We can start by testing values of $n$ that are three digits and have $8$ subtracted from them. \n$n = 108$: $108 - 8 = 100$ is not divisible by $5$.\n$n = 98$: $98 - 8 = 90$ is not divisible by $5$.\n$n = 88$: $88 - 8 = 80$ is divisible by $5$.\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies both conditions is $n = \\boxed{115}$.",
