    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smallest common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\\\\na & \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} We see that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+6n$. Substituting this into $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$ yields \\[1+6n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $4$. Then $n\\ge 4\\implies a=1+6n\\ge 25$. We see that $25$ satisfies both congruences so $a=25$. If $b$ is any common term, subtracting $25$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-25 & \\equiv -24\\equiv 0\\pmod 6 \\\\\nb-25 & \\equiv -21\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(6,7)=1$, we have $b-25\\equiv 0\\pmod {6\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 25\\pmod{42}.$ So $b=25+42m$ for some integer $m$. The largest such number less than $100$ is $\\boxed{67}$, which happens to satisfies the original congruences.",
    "gpt_response": "The $n$th term of the first sequence can be expressed as $1 + 6(n-1) = 6n-5$, and the $m$th term of the second sequence can be expressed as $4 + 7(m-1) = 7m-3$.\n\nTo find the largest number common to both sequences, we need to find the values of $n$ and $m$ such that $6n-5 = 7m-3$. Rearranging this equation gives $6n - 7m = 2$.\n\nThis is a Diophantine equation, and we can find the solutions by noting that $n = 7k+2$ and $m = 6k+2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSince both $n$ and $m$ must be positive and within the range of $1$ to $100$, we need to find the largest possible values of $n$ and $m$. The largest $k$ such that $7k+2 \\leq 100$ and $6k+2 \\leq 100$ occurs when $k = 14$.\n\nTherefore, the largest number common to both sequences is when $n = 7 \\cdot 14 + 2 = 98$ and $m = 6 \\cdot 14 + 2 = 86$.
