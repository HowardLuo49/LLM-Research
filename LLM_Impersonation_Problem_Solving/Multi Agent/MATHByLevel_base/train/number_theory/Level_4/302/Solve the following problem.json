    "solution": "For the greatest common divisor of 15 and $n$ to be equal to 3, $n$ must be divisible by 3 but not divisible by 5.  In other words, $n$ is divisible by 3, but not by 15.\n\nThe greatest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 100 is 99, so there are $99/3 = 33$ multiples of 3 from 1 to 100.  We must subtract from this the number of multiples of 15 from 1 to 100.\n\nThe greatest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 100 is 90, so there are $90/15 = 6$ multiples of 15 from 1 to 100.  Therefore, there are $33 - 6 = \\boxed{27}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 3, but not 15.",
    "gpt_response": "We can think of this problem in terms of the prime factorization of the numbers involved. We know that the prime factorization of 15 is $3 \\times 5$. We are looking for integers $n$ such that the greatest common divisor of 15 and $n$ is 3. This means that the number $n$ must have a factor of 3 but not a factor of 5.\n\nIn the range from 1 to 100, there are 33 integers that have 3 as a factor (every third number starting from 3 up to 99). However, we need to exclude numbers that also have 5 as a factor. This occurs every 15th number starting from 15 up to 90.
