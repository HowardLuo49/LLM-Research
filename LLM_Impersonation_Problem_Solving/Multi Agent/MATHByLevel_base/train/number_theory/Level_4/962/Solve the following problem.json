    "solution": "Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=\\boxed{24}.$\n\nWe can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four consecutive integers be $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$. The product of these four integers is $(n)(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$.\n\nThe largest integer that must divide this product is the least common multiple (LCM) of the four consecutive integers. \n\nThe LCM of $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$ is the product of the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. This means we need to find the highest power of each prime factor that appears in the numbers $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$.\n\nSince the four consecutive integers differ by $1$ each, one of them must be even. Thus, at least one of $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$ is divisible by $2$. Since $2$ is a prime number, the LCM will have a power of at least $1$ in its factorization.\n\nSimilarly, at least one of the numbers is divisible by $3$. Thus, the LCM will have a power of at least $1$ for the prime factor $3$.\n\nSince we are taking the product of $4$ consecutive integers, at least one of them is divisible by $4=2^2$. Therefore, the LCM must have a power of at least $2$ for the factor $2$.\n\nIn general, the LCM of $n, n+1, n+2, n+3$ is divisible by all prime numbers from $2$ to $4$ (since $2^2 = 4$), inclusive.\n\nThus, the largest integer that must divide the product of any $4$ consecutive integers is $4$.",
