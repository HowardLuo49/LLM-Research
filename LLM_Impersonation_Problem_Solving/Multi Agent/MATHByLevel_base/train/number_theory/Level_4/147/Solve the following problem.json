Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The second smallest number of packs of hot dogs Phil could have bought is 2.\n\nSince each pack contains 10 hot dogs and he has 4 left over, Phil must have bought a total of 20 hot dogs. This means he bought 2 packs of hot dogs.\n\nIf he had bought only 1 pack, he would have had 10 hot dogs. But since he has 4 left over, it means he must have bought at least 2 packs, making it the second smallest number of packs he could have bought.",
