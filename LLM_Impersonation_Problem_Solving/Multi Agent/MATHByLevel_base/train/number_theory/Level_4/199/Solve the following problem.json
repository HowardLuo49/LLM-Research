    "solution": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8, we can use Euler's theorem which states that if $a$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, then $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, where $\\phi$ represents Euler's totient function.\n\nSince 5 and 8 are relatively prime, we can apply Euler's theorem. The totient function of 8 is $\\phi(8) = 8 \\times (1- 1/2) = 4$.\n\nTherefore, we have $5^{137} \\equiv 5^{137 \\mod 4} \\equiv 5^1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{5}$.",
