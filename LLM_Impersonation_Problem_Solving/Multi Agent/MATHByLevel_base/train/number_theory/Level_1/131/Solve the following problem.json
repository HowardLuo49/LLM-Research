    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "In order for Daniel to be able to distribute the candy equally among his $3$ sisters, the total number of pieces of candy must be divisible by $3$.\n\nWe can see that $20$ is not divisible by $3$, so Daniel needs to take away enough pieces of candy so that the remaining candies can be evenly divided among $3$ sisters.\n\nThe nearest multiple of $3$ less than $20$ is $18$. In order to distribute the candy equally, Daniel needs to take away $20 - 18 = 2$ pieces of candy. \n\nTherefore, Daniel should take away $2$ pieces of candy so that he could distribute the remaining $18$ pieces of candy equally among his $3$ sisters.",
