    "solution": "We look for the remainder when $25,197,624$ is divided by $4$. We could manually divide to see that $4$ divides evenly into $25,197,624$ for a remainder of $0$, but the quicker way is to know the divisibility rule for $4$. If the last two digits of the number form a multiple of $4$, then the number itself is divisible by $4$.  In this case, $24$ is a multiple of $4$, so $25,197,624$ is also a multiple of $4$. That means $\\boxed{0}$ hot dogs will be left over.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the remainder when 25,197,624 is divided by 4.\n\n25,197,624 divided by 4 is equal to 6,299,406 with a remainder of 0.\n\nTherefore, there will be 0 hot dogs left over when 25,197,624 are packaged in sets of 4.",
