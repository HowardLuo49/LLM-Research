    "solution": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. \n\nSince the number $712n$ is even (since it ends in an even digit, which is $n$), it is divisible by 2. \n\nTo determine if $712n$ is divisible by 9, we find the sum of the digits of $712n$:\n$7 + 1 + 2 + n = 10 + n$\n\nFor $712n$ to be divisible by 9, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. Since $10 + n$ must be divisible by 9, $n$ must be equal to 8, so that the sum is 18, which is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ that makes $712n$ divisible by 18 is $n=\\boxed{8}$.",
