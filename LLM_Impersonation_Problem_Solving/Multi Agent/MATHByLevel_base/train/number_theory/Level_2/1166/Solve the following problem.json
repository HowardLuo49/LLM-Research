    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit 9-heavy number, we need to find the smallest three-digit number that gives a remainder greater than 5 when divided by 9.\n\nThe smallest three-digit number is 100. When we divide 100 by 9, we get a remainder of 1 (100 = 9*11 + 1). Since the remainder is less than 5, 100 is not a 9-heavy number.\n\nThe next three-digit number is 101. When we divide 101 by 9, we get a remainder of 2 (101 = 9*11 + 2). Since the remainder is less than 5, 101 is not a 9-heavy number.\n\nThe next three-digit number is 102. When we divide 102 by 9, we get a remainder of 3 (102 = 9*11 + 3). Since the remainder is less than 5, 102 is not a 9-heavy number.\n\nThe next three-digit number is 103. When we divide 103 by 9, we get a remainder of 4 (103 = 9*11 + 4). Since the remainder is less than 5, 103 is not a 9-heavy number.\n\nThe next three-digit number is 104. When we divide 104 by 9, we get a remainder of 5 (104 = 9*11 + 5). Since the remainder is not greater than 5, 104 is not a 9-heavy number.\n\nThe next three-digit number is 105. When we divide 105 by 9, we get a remainder of 6 (105 = 9*11 + 6). Since the remainder is greater than 5, 105 is the least three-digit 9-heavy number.\n\nTherefore, the least three-digit 9-heavy number is 105.",
