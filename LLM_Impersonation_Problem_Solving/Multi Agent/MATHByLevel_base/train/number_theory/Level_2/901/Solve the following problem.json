    "solution": "Since 32 is a power of 2, its only factors are the powers of 2 less than or equal to it.  These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, so there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive factors of 32.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of 32 is 2^5. To find the total number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and then multiply these results together. \n\n(5+1) = 6\n\nTherefore, 32 has 6 distinct positive factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.",
