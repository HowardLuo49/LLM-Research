    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. What is the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors?",
    "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A positive integer will have exactly eight factors if it is in the form of a product of two distinct prime factors, or if it is in the form of a prime number raised to the power of 7.\n\nThe smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors is 2^3 * 3 = 24. This integer has the factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.",
