    "solution": "The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5. Thus, there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors of 30. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.",
    "gpt_response": "The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. Therefore, 30 has a total of 8 positive factors.",
