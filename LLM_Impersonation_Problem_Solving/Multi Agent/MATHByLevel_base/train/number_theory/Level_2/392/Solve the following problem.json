    "solution": "For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible. Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$. The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$. The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$. Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\\boxed{9700}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16, we need to maximize the digits in each place value starting from the left.\n\nLet's start by putting the largest possible digit, which is 9, in the thousand's place. This leaves us with a sum of 7 to distribute among the remaining three digits.\n\nSince we want to maximize the number, we should put 7 in the hundred's place, 0 in the ten's place, and 0 in the one's place. \n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16 is 9700.",
