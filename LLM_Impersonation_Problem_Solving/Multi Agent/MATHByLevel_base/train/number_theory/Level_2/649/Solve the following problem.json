When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's represent the number of dimes Natasha has with $d$. We know that $1 < d < 10$.\n\nWe can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nd &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nd &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nd &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n\\end{align*}\n\nLooking at the equations, we see that we need to find a number that is one more than a multiple of 3, one more than a multiple of 4, and one more than a multiple of 5. \n\nThe least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is $60$. So, the number we are looking for is $60k + 1$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nNow, if we try out values of $k$, we find that $k=1$ satisfies the conditions. So, the number of dimes Natasha has is $60 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 61$.\n\nTherefore, Natasha has $\\boxed{61}$ dimes.",
