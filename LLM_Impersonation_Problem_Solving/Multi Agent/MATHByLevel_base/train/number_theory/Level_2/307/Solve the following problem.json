    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the time after 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds, we need to convert the hours, minutes, and seconds into the appropriate units and add them to the current time.\n\nFirst, let's convert the 122 hours into days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we have $122 \\div 24 = 5$ days and $2$ hours remaining.\n\nAdding the 39 minutes and 44 seconds, we get a total of $5$ days, $2$ hours, $39$ minutes, and $44$ seconds.\n\nWhen we add this time to the current time of midnight, we get:\n\n$12:00:00 + 2:39:44 = 14:39:44$\n\nSince the time is read on a 12-hour clock, we need to convert 14 hours to its equivalent on a 12-hour clock, which is 2:39:44 PM.\n\nTherefore, $A = 2$, $B = 3$, and $C = 4$.\n\nFinally, $A + B + C = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $A + B + C$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",
