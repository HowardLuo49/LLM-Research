    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote Jane's current age as x. \n\nAccording to the problem, one year ago she was x-1 years old, and the number of years in her age was a perfect square. This means that (x-1) is a perfect square. \n\nSimilarly, one year from now she will be x+1 years old, and the number of years in her age will be a perfect cube. This means that (x+1) is a perfect cube. \n\nSince we know that (x-1) is a perfect square and (x+1) is a perfect cube, we can rewrite these expressions as (x-1) = y^2 and (x+1) = z^3, where y and z are some integers. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can rewrite it as x = y^2 + 1. Plugging this into the second equation, we get y^2 + 1 + 1 = z^3, which simplifies to y^2 + 2 = z^3. \n\nAfter checking some small integer values for y and z, we find that y = 1 and z = 2 is the only solution that satisfies the equation. \n\nSo, x = y^2 + 1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2. \n\nTherefore, Jane is currently 2 years old.",
