    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Every bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the number of Dummies in each bag be $x$. From the given information, we know that $x$ leaves a remainder of $7$ when divided by $9$, which can be represented as:\n\n$x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$\n\nSince we want to find the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when three bags are divided among $9$ kids, we need to find the smallest common remainder when dividing the sum of three $x$'s by $9$. \n\nThis can be represented as:\n\n$3x \\equiv y \\pmod{9}$\n\nwhere $y$ is the smallest number of pieces left over.\n\nThe smallest number that satisfies the equation $x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$ is $x=7$. Plugging in $x=7$ into the equation $3x \\equiv y \\pmod{9}$, we get:\n\n$3(7) = 21 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when three bags are divided among $9$ kids is $\\boxed{3}$.",
