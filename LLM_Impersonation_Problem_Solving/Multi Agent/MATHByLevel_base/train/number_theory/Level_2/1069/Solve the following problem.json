    "solution": "The largest Mersenne Prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = \\boxed{127}$. The next possible Mersenne Prime, $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$, is much too large (and is not prime).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest Mersenne prime less than 200, we can start with the largest possible value of $n$ that would result in a Mersenne prime less than 200, which would be $n = 7$ since $2^7 - 1 = 127$. However, we need to check if 7 is a prime number, which it is.\n\nTherefore, the largest Mersenne prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 127$.",
