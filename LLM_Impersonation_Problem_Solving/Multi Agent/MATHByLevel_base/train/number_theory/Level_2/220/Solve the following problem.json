    "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers that are both a square and a cube, we need to find numbers that are both a perfect square and a perfect cube. \n\nThe perfect squares less than 100 are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2. When we calculate the cubes of these numbers, we find that 1, 8, 27, and 64 are also perfect cubes.\n\nTherefore, the positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube are 1, 8, 27, and 64. \n\nSo, there are 4 positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
