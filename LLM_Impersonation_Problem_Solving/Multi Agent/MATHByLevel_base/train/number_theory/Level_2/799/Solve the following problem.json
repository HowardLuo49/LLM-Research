    "solution": "We have $840=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot7=4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The largest of the four integers is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four consecutive integers be x, x+1, x+2, and x+3.\n\nSince the product of the four integers is 840:\n\nx * (x+1) * (x+2) * (x+3) = 840\n\nExpanding the above equation:\n\nx^4 + 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x - 840 = 0\n\nWe can factor out (x+6) from the left side of the equation:\n\n(x+6)(x^3 + 11x^2 + 66x - 140) = 0\n\nWe can see that x = 7 satisfies the equation, which means the four numbers are 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nTherefore, the largest of the four integers is 10.",
