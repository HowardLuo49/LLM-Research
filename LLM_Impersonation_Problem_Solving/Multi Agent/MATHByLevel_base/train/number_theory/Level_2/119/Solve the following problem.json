    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of students in each of the rows with the same number of students as x. Since there are 3 rows with the same number of students, the total number of students in these 3 rows is 3x. \n\nOne row has one more student than the other three rows, so the total number of students in that row is x+1. \n\nTherefore, the total number of students in the class is 3x + x + 1 = 4x + 1. \n\nSince the class has over 30 students, we can deduce that 4x + 1 > 30. \n\nSolving for x, we get x > 7.25. Since the number of students must be a whole number, the smallest possible value for x is 8. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is 4(8) + 1 = 33 students.",
