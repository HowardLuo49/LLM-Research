    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$, we perform the division $5 \\div 7$. We find that the decimal representation is $0.\\overline{714285}$.\n\nSince the decimal representation is repeating, each digit ($0$, $7$, $1$, $4$, $2$, $8$, $5$) has an equal probability of being selected. Therefore, the probability of selecting the digit 4 is $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nThus, the probability that the digit selected is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$.",
