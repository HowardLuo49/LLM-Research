    "solution": "Noticing that 221 is close to the perfect square 225, we write 221 as a difference of two squares: $221=225-4=15^2-2^2=(15-2)(15+2)=13\\cdot 17$.  The largest prime factor here is $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest prime factor of 221, we first need to factorize 221.\n\n221 = 13 x 17\n\nBoth 13 and 17 are prime numbers, but the greatest prime factor of 221 is 17.\n\nTherefore, the greatest prime factor of 221 is 17.",
