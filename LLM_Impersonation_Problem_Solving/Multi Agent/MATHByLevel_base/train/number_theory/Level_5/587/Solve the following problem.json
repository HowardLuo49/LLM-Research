    "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.",
    "gpt_response": "We first rewrite the expression as \n\\[(n+1)(n+9)(n+3)(n+7)(n+5).\\]\nIf $n$ is a positive even integer, then $n+1$, $n+3$, $n+5$, $n+7$, and $n+9$ are all consecutive odd integers. One of these odd integers must be divisible by $5$. Since there are only five odd residues modulo $5$, at least one of $n+1$, $n+3$, $n+5$, $n+7$, and $n+9$ is divisible by $5$.\n\nTherefore, for any positive even integer $n$, $(n+1)(n+9)(n+3)(n+7)(n+5)$ is divisible by $5$. The largest integer that is a divisor of $(n+1)(n+9)(n+3)(n+7)(n+5)$ for all positive even integers $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
