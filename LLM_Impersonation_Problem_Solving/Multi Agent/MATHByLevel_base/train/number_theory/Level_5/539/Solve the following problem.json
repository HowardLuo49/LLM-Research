    "solution": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits, we need to find the range of possible values for the first two digits.\n\nSince a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, we know that the sum of the digits of our four-digit number must be divisible by 3.\n\nWe already have the last two digits as 23, so the sum of the first two digits must be congruent to 3 modulo 3.\n\nThis means the possible values for the sum of the first two digits are 3, 6, or 9.\n\nIf the sum of the first two digits is 3, then the only possible number would be 123.\n\nIf the sum of the first two digits is 6, then the possible numbers would be 213, 243, 273, 303, 333, 363, 393.\n\nIf the sum of the first two digits is 9, then the possible numbers would be 333, 363, 393, 423, 453, 483, 513, 543, 573, 603, 633, 663, 693, 723, 753, 783, 813, 843, 873, 903, 933, 963, 993.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits is 1 (for the sum of the first two digits being 3) + 7 (for the sum of the first two digits being 6) + 23 (for the sum of the first two digits being 9) = 31.",
