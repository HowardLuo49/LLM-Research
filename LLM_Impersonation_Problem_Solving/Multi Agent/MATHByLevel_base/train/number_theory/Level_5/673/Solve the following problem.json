    "solution": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the divisors of $400$. Prime factorizing $400$, we have $400 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. To find the sum of the divisors, we need to consider all the numbers that can be formed by multiplying some combination of the prime factors $2$ and $5$. This gives us $(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4)(5^0 + 5^1 + 5^2) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16)(1 + 5 + 25) = 31 \\cdot 31$. \n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the divisors of $400$ has only one distinct prime factor, which is $31$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ has $1$ distinct prime factor.",
