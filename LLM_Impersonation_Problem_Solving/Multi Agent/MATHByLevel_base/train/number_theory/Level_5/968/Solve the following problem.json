    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "If $x$, $y$, and $z$ each have exactly three factors, then they must be prime numbers squared. Let $x = p^{2}$, $y = q^{2}$, and $z = r^{2}$ where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nFor $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$: $$x^2y^3z^4 = (p^{2})^{2}(q^{2})^{3}(r^{2})^{4} = p^{4}q^{6}r^{8}.$$\n\nThe number of factors of $p^{4}q^{6}r^{8}$ is equal to $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{315}$.",
