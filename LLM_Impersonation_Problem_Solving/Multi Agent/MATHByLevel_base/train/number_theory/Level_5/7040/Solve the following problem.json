For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",

Then the maximum possible value of $N$ would be $6 \\cdot 7^{d-1} + 6 \\cdot 7^{d-2} + \\dots + 6 = 6(7^d - 1)$.\n\nLet $2N$ have $d+1$ digits in base-$7$. Since $2N = 2 \\cdot 7^d + 2 \\cdot 7^{d-1} + \\dots + 2$, the largest possible value of $2N$ would be $2(7^{d+1} - 1)$.\n\nSince $N$ is a 7-10 double, the digits of $N$ must form $2N$ in base-$10$.
