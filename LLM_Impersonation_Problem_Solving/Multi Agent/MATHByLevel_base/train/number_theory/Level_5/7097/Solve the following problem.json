    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, so $m+n$ can only have prime factors that are not factors of $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Since $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, $m$ must have at least the same prime factors as $n$, and possibly more.

If $m=2$, then $m^m=2^2=4$ which is a multiple of $n^n=2^2=4$. However, $m$ needs to have a prime factor that $n$ does not have, which is not the case in this scenario.
