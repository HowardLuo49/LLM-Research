    "solution": "Note firstly that $f(i)$ must be an integer, so this means that $i$ must be a perfect square in order for $\\sqrt{i}$ to be an integer. Out of the perfect squares, we claim that $i$ must be the square of some prime $p$. For if $\\sqrt{i}$ is composite, then it can be written as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$ and we find $f(i) \\ge 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i + a + b > 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. Moreover, if $\\sqrt{i}$ is prime, then the only factors of $i$ are 1, $\\sqrt{i}$, and $i$, so $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ as desired. It follows that we only need to calculate the number of primes less than $\\sqrt{2010}$. Since $\\sqrt{2010} < 45$, the desired set of primes is $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\\}$. The set has $\\boxed{14}$ elements.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $i$ be a positive integer such that $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. \n\nFirst, note that $f(i)$ is always greater than $i$ because $1$ and $\\sqrt{i}$ are divisors of $i$ but $1 < \\sqrt{i} < i$ for all $i > 1$. Therefore, if $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$, then $f(i) > i$.\n\nNext, consider the divisors of $i$. If $d$ is a divisor of $i$, then $\\frac{i}{d}$ is also a divisor of $i$. We can pair up divisors such that the product of each pair is equal to $i$. Since $1 < \\sqrt{i} < i$, there must be exactly one divisor in this pair that is less than or equal to $\\sqrt{i}$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all divisors of $i$ is equal to the sum of all divisors less than or equal to $\\sqrt{i}$ plus the sum of all divisors greater than $\\sqrt{i}$. Since the sum of divisors of $i$ is equal to $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$, we have \n$$f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i = \\sigma(i) = \\sigma(\\text{divisors less than or equal to } \\sqrt{i}) + \\sigma(\\text{divisors greater than }\\sqrt{i})$$\nwhere $\\sigma(n)$ denotes the sum of all positive divisors of $n$. \n\nSince $f(i) > i$ and the sum of divisors function is multiplicative, we can conclude that $\\sigma(i) > i$.

Therefore, there are no integers $i$ such that $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$.\n\nHence, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.",
