    "solution": "If $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5. We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nWe find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160. Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128. 125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine when $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal, we must figure out when all of the prime factors in the denominator of the fraction can be expressed as a product of 2's and 5's. \n\nThe prime factorization of $n+101$ is $n+101 = 101\\cdot 1 = 101\\cdot 1^2$, which only contains the prime factor $101$. Since $101$ is not a factor of $10$ (the only prime factors in the denominator of a terminating decimal), we know that $n+101$ cannot be expressed as a product of 2's and 5's. \n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n+101$ is composed of only 2's and 5's. The prime factorization of $101$ is $101 = 101\\cdot 1$, so we can see that $n = 101-101 = 0$ is the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal is $\\boxed{0}$.",
