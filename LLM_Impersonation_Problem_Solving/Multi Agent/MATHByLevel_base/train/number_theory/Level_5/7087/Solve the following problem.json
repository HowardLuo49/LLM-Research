    "solution": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $N^2 \\equiv N \\pmod{10000}$, therefore $N(N-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$.\n\nSince $N$ and $N-1$ are coprime, one of them must be divisible by $2^4$ and the other by $5^4$. Since the digit $a$ is not zero, $N$ must be divisible by $5^4 = 625$, thus $N = 625k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nSubstituting $N=625k$ back into $N(N-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$, we have $625k(625k-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$, or $k(625k-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\n\nNow, $625k-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$ implies $9k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. Therefore $k \\equiv 9^{-1} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{16}$.\n\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, $k = 9 + 16m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Substituting back into $N=625k$, we get $N = 625(9 + 16m) = 5625 + 10000m$.\n\nSince we want the three-digit number $abc$, we have $abc = 562$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{562}$.",
