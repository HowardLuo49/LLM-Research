    "solution": "The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}}2} = \\frac{2xy}{x+y}$, so we have $xy=(x+y)(3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})$, and by SFFT, $(x-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})(y-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})=3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$. Now, $3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$ has $41\\cdot39=1599$ factors, one of which is the square root ($3^{20}2^{19}$). Since $x<y$, the answer is half of the remaining number of factors, which is $\\frac{1599-1}{2}= \\boxed{799}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $h$ be the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$. Then we have \\[h = \\frac{2xy}{x+y} = 6^{20}.\\]We are given that $x < y$, so let $y = ax$. Substituting this into the equation above gives \\[h = \\frac{2ax^2}{x(1+a)} = 6^{20}.\\]This simplifies to \\[2ax = 6^{20}(1+a).\\]Since $a$ must be a positive integer, $1+a$ divides $2ax$. We have $2ax = 2\\cdot 3^{20} \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot b$, where $b$ is an integer. Thus, $1+a$ must divide $2\\cdot 3^{20} \\cdot 2^4$. The prime factorization of $2\\cdot 3^{20} \\cdot 2^4$ is $2^5\\cdot 3^{20}$. The number of divisors of $2^5\\cdot 3^{20}$ is $6\\cdot 21 = 126$.\n\nHowever, we must exclude the case where $a=1$, as then $x=y$ which is not allowed.
