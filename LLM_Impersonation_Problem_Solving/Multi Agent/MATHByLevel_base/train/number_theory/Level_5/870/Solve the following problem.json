    "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$ as a fraction in lowest terms, we can let $x = 0.\\overline{ab}$. Multiplying by 100, we have $100x = ab.\\overline{ab}$. Subtracting the two equations gives $99x = ab$, so $x = \\frac{ab}{99}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $0 \\leq a, b \\leq 9$.\n\nNow, we need to find all possible values of $ab$ such that $a$ and $b$ are not both nine and not both zero. This gives us 72 possible combinations for $ab$. \n\nTherefore, the fractions can be written as $\\frac{ab}{99}$, and since $ab$ can take on 72 different values, there are $\\boxed{72}$ possible denominators.",
