    "solution": "To find the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we can look at the first few power of 17 modulo 100: \\begin{align*}\n17^0 &\\equiv 1, \\\\\n17^1 &\\equiv 17, \\\\\n17^2 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 17 \\equiv 289 \\equiv 89, \\\\\n17^3 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 89 \\equiv 1513 \\equiv 13, \\\\\n17^4 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 13 \\equiv 221 \\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe know that if we find a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, then the last two digits in the power of 17 become periodic at that point.  We don't have that in $17^4$, but the units digit in $17^4$ is 1.  We have matched the units digit, so let's use powers of $17^4$: \\begin{align*}\n17^4 &\\equiv 21, \\\\\n17^8 &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 21 \\equiv 441 \\equiv 41, \\\\\n17^{12} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 41 \\equiv 861 \\equiv 61, \\\\\n17^{16} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 61 \\equiv 1281 \\equiv 81, \\\\\n17^{20} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 81 \\equiv 1701 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*} We found a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, so the last two digits are periodic, with period 20.\n\nSince $1993 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{20}$, \\[17^{1993} \\equiv 17^{13} \\pmod{100}.\\] Then \\begin{align*}\n17^{13} &\\equiv 17^{12} \\cdot 17 \\\\\n&\\equiv 61 \\cdot 17 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1037 \\\\\n&\\equiv 37 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we first need to find the last two digits of $17^{1993}$. To do this, we can look for a pattern in the last two digits of powers of $17$.\n\nNotice that $17^1 = 17$, $17^2 = 289$, $17^3 = 4913$, $17^4 = 83521$, and $17^5 = 1419857$.\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the pattern of the last two digits of powers of $17$ repeats every 20 powers. Therefore, we can rewrite $1993$ as $1990 + 3$, where $1990$ is a multiple of $20$. This means that $17^{1990}$ will have the same last two digits as $17^0 = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to find the last two digits of $17^3$. From our earlier calculation, we know that $17^3 = 4913$.\n\nTherefore, the last two digits of $17^{1993}$ are the same as the last two digits of $17^3$, which is $13$.\n\nSince we are looking for the tens digit, we conclude that the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
