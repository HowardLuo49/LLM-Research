    "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive integers $n\\geq 2$ for which $1001_n$ is a prime number, we need to consider the possible values of $n$.\n\nNotice that in base $n$, the number $1001_n$ can be written as $n^3 + 1$. We can factor this as $(n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$.\n\nFor $1001_n$ to be a prime number, one of the factors $(n+1)$ or $(n^2 - n + 1)$ must be equal to 1, since prime numbers have only two factors (1 and the number itself).\n\nIf $(n+1) = 1$, then $n = 0$, which is not a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.\n\nIf $(n^2 - n + 1) = 1$, then $n^2 - n = 0$, which implies $n(n-1) = 0$. This gives us two solutions: $n=0$ and $n=1$, but again, these are not positive integers greater than or equal to 2.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{0}$ positive integers $n\\geq 2$ for which $1001_n$ is a prime number.",
