    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four-digit integer be denoted by abcd. Then, the eight-digit integer formed by repeating abcd is 10000abcd + abcd = 10001abcd.\n\nSince the four-digit integer is a factor of the eight-digit integer, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all eight-digit integers of this form will be equal to the GCD of all numbers of the form 10001abcd.\n\nNote that 10001 is a prime number, so the GCD of all numbers of the form 10001abcd will be 10001.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of the given form is 10001.",
