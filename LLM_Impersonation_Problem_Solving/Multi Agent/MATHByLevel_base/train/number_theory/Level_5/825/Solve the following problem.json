    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.",
