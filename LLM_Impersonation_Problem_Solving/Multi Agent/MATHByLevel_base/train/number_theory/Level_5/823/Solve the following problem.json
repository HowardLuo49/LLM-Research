    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to determine the possible clever integers. Since the clever integer must be greater than 20 and less than 120, it can be any of the following:\n\n30, 42, 54, 66, 78, 90, 102, 114\n\nNext, we need to find the clever integers that are divisible by 27, which means they must also be divisible by 3. Checking each of the clever integers given above, we see that 78 and 90 are divisible by 27.\n\nTherefore, out of the 8 clever integers, only 2 are divisible by 27.\n\nThe fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nSo, $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ of all clever integers are divisible by 27.",
