    "solution": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$.",

Also, notice that each power of 3 is $3^k$ where $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nTo find the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence, we need to express 100 as a sum of distinct powers of 3:\n$100 = 81 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 3^4 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^0$\n\nSo, the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is $3^{4} + 3^{2} + 3^{2} + 3^{0} = 81 + 9 + 9 + 1 = \\boxed{100}$.",
