    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Lucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. That Wednesday was the first day of her life. Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life. On which day of the week was the party?",
    "solution": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine on which day of the week the party was held, we need to find the day of the week after $1000$ days have passed since Lucy was born.\n\nSince there are $7$ days in a week, we can find the remainder when $1000$ is divided by $7$.\n\n$1000 \\div 7 = 142$ with a remainder of $6$\n\nThis means that after $1000$ days, there are $6$ remaining days in the week from Wednesday. Therefore, the party was held on the $6$th day after Wednesday, which is a $\\boxed{\\text{Tuesday}}$.",
