What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $11^4$ in base $b$ be written as $\\overline{ab}_b$, where $a$ is the digit in the $b^1$ place and $b$ is the digit in the $b^0$ place. Then, we have $11^4 = b a + b = b(a+1)$. Since $11^4 = 14641$ in base 10, we have: \\[14641 = b(a+1)\\]\nIn order for the sum of the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ to not add up to $2^4 = 16$, we must have $a+1 < b$. We also know that $a,b \\geq 1$, so the largest possible value for $b$ is when $a=1$ and $b=7$. \nThen, $14641 = 7\\cdot 2 = 14_7$, where the base-7 digits do not add up to $16$. For base-8 or greater, $a+1 \\geq b$ so the sum of the base-$b$ digits will be at least $b+1 > 16$. Therefore, the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
