    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We first note that $\\text{lcm}[n,100] = \\frac{n \\cdot 100}{\\gcd(n,100)}$, so our original equation becomes $\\frac{n \\cdot 100}{\\gcd(n,100)} = \\gcd(n,100) + 450$. \n\nLetting $d = \\gcd(n,100)$, we can rewrite our equation as $\\frac{n \\cdot 100}{d} = d +450$. This can be further simplified to $n = d^2 + 450d$.\n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $d$ must be a divisor of 100. We also get $n = 100d + 450d=550d$. Therefore, it is clear that $d$ must divide 550.\n\nThe positive divisors of 550 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 22, 25, 50, 55, 110, 275, and 550. This gives 12 possible values of $d$, each corresponding to a value of $n$. Thus, we get a total of $\\boxed{12}$ positive integers $n$ that satisfy the given equation.",
