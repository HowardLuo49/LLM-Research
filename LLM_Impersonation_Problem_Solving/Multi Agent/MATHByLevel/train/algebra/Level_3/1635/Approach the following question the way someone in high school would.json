If a carton of dates costs twice as much as a sack of apples and the price of a cantaloupe is equal to the price of a sack of apples minus a bunch of bananas, how much would it cost George to purchase a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the price of a sack of apples, $b$ the price of a bunch of bananas, $c$ the price of a cantaloupe, and $d$ the price of a carton of dates. We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 20\\\\\n2a &= d\\\\\na-b &= c\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting into the first equation for $c$ and $d$ gives $a + b + a - b + 2a = 20$, which simplifies to $4a = 20$, so $a = 5$. From here, we use $a$ to find $d = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. We put these values into the first equation to get $5 + b + c + 10 = 20$, so $b + c = \\boxed{ \\$ 5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's define some variables:\nLet $x$ be the cost of a sack of apples.\nThen, a carton of dates costs $2x$.\nAnd a cantaloupe costs $x - y$, where $y$ is the cost of a bunch of bananas.\n\nWe know that the total cost of all the items George purchased is $20$. \nSo, we can create the equation: $x + 2x + (x-y) + 2x = 20$\n\nSimplifying the equation gives: $6x - y = 20$\n\nWe also know that George purchased a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe, so the cost would be $y + (x - y) = x$\n\nTo find out how much George would spend on a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe, we need to solve for $x$ in the equation $6x - y = 20$ and then substitute that value back into $x$ in the equation $y + (x - y)$.",
