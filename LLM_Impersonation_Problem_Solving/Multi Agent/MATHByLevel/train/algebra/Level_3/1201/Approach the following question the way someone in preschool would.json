    "solution": "The given ratio tells us that $\\frac{b}{a}=3$ or that $b=3a$. We substitute this value for $b$ so we have an equation with only one variable. We find  \\begin{align*}\n3a&=12-5a \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 8a&=12 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= 12/8 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}",

A ratio compares two numbers and shows how many times one number is contained within another number. \n\nSo, if the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3, that means that for every 3 $b$, there is 1 $a$. \n\nNext, we are given that $b=12-5a$. We can substitute this into the ratio to find the value of $a.\n\nSince the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3, we can say:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = 3$\n\nSubstitute $b=12-5a$ into the equation:\n$\\frac{12-5a}{a} = 3$\n\nNow we can solve for $a:\n\n$12-5a = 3a$\nCombine like terms:\n$12 = 8a$\nDivide both sides by 8:\n$a = 1.5$\n\nSo, the value of $a$ when the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3 is 1.5.",
