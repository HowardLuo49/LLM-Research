    "solution": "The given ratio tells us that $\\frac{b}{a}=3$ or that $b=3a$. We substitute this value for $b$ so we have an equation with only one variable. We find  \\begin{align*}\n3a&=12-5a \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 8a&=12 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= 12/8 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "So first, let's remember what ratio means. Ratio is like comparing two numbers to each other. It's like saying how many times one number fits into another number. So if the ratio of b to a is 3, that means for every 3 of b, there is 1 of a.\n\nNow we have another equation that says b equals 12 minus 5 times a. We can use the ratio to help us solve for a. Since the ratio of b to a is 3, we can write that as b/a = 3.\n\nNow we can put the value of b from the second equation into our ratio equation. Since b equals 12 minus 5 times a, we have (12-5a)/a = 3. \n\nNow we can solve this equation to find the value of a. I know it looks a little tricky, but we can do it step by step. Let's start by multiplying both sides by a to get rid of the fraction. \n\n(12-5a) = 3a. \n\nNow, let's simplify this equation by adding 5a to both sides:\n\n12 = 8a.\n\nFinally, to solve for a, we need to divide both sides by 8:\n\na = 12/8 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nSo the value of a is 1.5. I hope that makes sense! Let me know if you have any questions.",
