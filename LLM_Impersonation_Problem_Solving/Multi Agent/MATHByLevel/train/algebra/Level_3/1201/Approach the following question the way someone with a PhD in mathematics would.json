    "solution": "The given ratio tells us that $\\frac{b}{a}=3$ or that $b=3a$. We substitute this value for $b$ so we have an equation with only one variable. We find  \\begin{align*}\n3a&=12-5a \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 8a&=12 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= 12/8 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first express the given ratio mathematically. The ratio of $b$ to $a$ can be written as $b/a = 3$. \n\nNext, we can substitute $b=12-5a$ into the ratio equation:\n\n$(12-5a)/a = 3$\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by $a$:\n\n$12-5a = 3a$\n\nNext, we can combine like terms by adding $5a$ to both sides:\n\n$12 = 8a$\n\nFinally, we can solve for $a$ by dividing both sides by 8:\n\n$a = 12/8 = 3/2 = 1.5$\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ when the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3 and $b=12-5a$ is $a=1.5$.",
