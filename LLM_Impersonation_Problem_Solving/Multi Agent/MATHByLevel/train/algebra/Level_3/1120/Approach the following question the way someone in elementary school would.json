    "solution": "Note that $\\left(x^4+6\\right)^2=x^8+12x^4+36$. So $\\frac{x^8+12x^4+36}{x^4+6}=\\frac{\\left(x^4+6\\right)^2}{x^4+6}=x^4+6$. Our answer is therefore $5^4+6=625+6=\\boxed{631}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we have to plug in the value of $x$ which is 5 into the expression. \n\nSo we have $\\frac{(5)^8+12(5)^4+36}{(5)^4+6}$.\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by using the rules of exponents. \n\nThis gives us $\\frac{390625+12(625)+36}{625+6}$.\n\nNext, we can simplify further by doing the calculations. \n\nSo, $\\frac{390625+7500+36}{625+6} =\\frac{398161}{631}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{x^8+12x^4+36}{x^4+6}$ when $x=5$ is equal to $\\frac{398161}{631}$.",
