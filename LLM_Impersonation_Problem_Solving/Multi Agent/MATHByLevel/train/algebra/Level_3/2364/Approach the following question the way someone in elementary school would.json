    "solution": "The slope between the first two points must be the same as the slope between the second two points, because all three points lie on the same line. We thus have the equation $\\frac{k-6}{6-(-1)}=\\frac{3-k}{20-6}$. Solving for $k$ yields $k=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $k$, we can use the slope formula. The slope of a line is the change in the $y$-coordinates divided by the change in the $x$-coordinates. \n\nFirst, we need to find the slope of the line connecting the points $(-1, 6)$ and $(6, k)$. \n\nThe change in $y$-coordinates is $k - 6$ and the change in $x$-coordinates is $6 - (-1) = 7$. \n\nSo, the slope is $\\frac{k - 6}{7}.$\n\nNext, we need to find the slope of the line connecting the points $(6, k)$ and $(20, 3)$. \n\nThe change in $y$-coordinates is $3 - k$ and the change in $x$-coordinates is $20 - 6 = 14$. \n\nSo, the slope is $\\frac{3 - k}{14}$.\n\nSince the line contains the three points, the slopes must be equal. So, we can set the two slopes equal to each other:\n\n$\\frac{k - 6}{7} = \\frac{3 - k}{14}.$\n\nNow we can solve for $k$. \n\nFirst, cross multiply to get rid of the fractions:\n\n$14(k - 6) = 7(3 - k).$\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n$14k - 84 = 21 - 7k.$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$14k + 7k = 21 + 84$\n\n$21k = 105$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 21 to solve for $k$:\n\n$k = 5.$\n\nSo, the value of $k$ is 5.",
