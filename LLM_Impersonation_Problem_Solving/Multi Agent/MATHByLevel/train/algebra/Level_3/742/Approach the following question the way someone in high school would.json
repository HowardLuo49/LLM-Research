The point $(28, t)$ lies on the same line. What is the value of $t?$ \\begin{tabular}{c|c}\n$x$ & $y$ \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 7 \\\\\n3 & 13 \\\\\n5 & 19 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}",
    "solution": "Looking at the table, we see that increasing $x$ by two results in an increase in $y$ of $6.$ Thus for every increase in $x$ of $1,$ $y$ increases by $3.$ If $x = 1$ gives $y = 7,$ then $x = 28 = 1 + 27$ gives $y = 7 + 27\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{88}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $t$, we need to first find the slope of the line that the points lie on. \n\nWe can do this by looking at the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$ for any two points on the line. Let's look at the first and second points: \nThe change in $y$ is $13 - 7 = 6$ and the change in $x$ is $3 - 1 = 2$. \nTherefore, the slope of the line is $6/2 = 3$. \n\nNow that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point $(1, 7)$: \n$y - 7 = 3(x - 1)$\n$y - 7 = 3x - 3$\n$y = 3x + 4$\n\nNow we can use the $x$-coordinate of $(28, t)$ to find the $y$-coordinate: \n$t = 3(28) + 4$\n$t = 84 + 4$\n$t = 88$\n\nTherefore, the value of $t$ is $\\boxed{88}$.",
