    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down the problem. We have $2^{x-3}$ on one side of the equation and $4^{x+1}$ on the other side. \n\nWe know that $4$ is the same as $2^2$ because $4 = 2 \\times 2$, so $4^{x+1}$ is the same as $(2^2)^{x+1}$. And when we raise a power to another power, we multiply the exponents, so $4^{x+1}$ simplifies to $2^{2(x+1)}$.\n\nNow our equation looks like this: $2^{x-3} = 2^{2(x+1)}$.\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other: $x-3 = 2(x+1)$.\n\nNow we just need to solve for $x$. First, distribute the $2$ on the right side: $x-3 = 2x + 2$.\n\nSubtract $2x$ from both sides: $-3 = x + 2$.\n\nSubtract $2$ from both sides: $x = -5$.\n\nSo, $x = -5$ is the solution to the equation $2^{x-3} = 4^{x+1}$.",
