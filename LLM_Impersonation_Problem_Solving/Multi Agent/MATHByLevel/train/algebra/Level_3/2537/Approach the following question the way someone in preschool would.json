    "solution": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5a+2b&=0, \\\\\nb-2&=a.\n\\end{align*}Making the substitution for $a$ from the second equation to the first, we get $5(b-2)+2b=0$, which simplifies to $7b-10=0$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=\\frac{10}{7}$. Hence $7b=7\\cdot \\frac{10}{7}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count to 5 together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! Now, let's look at the question. It says $5a+2b=0$ and $a$ is two less than $b\". That means we have to find out what number is two less than another number. So if $a$ is two less than $b$, that means $b$ is two more than $a. So if we plug in that information into the first equation, we get $5a+2(a+2)=0$. Now we can solve for $a$, and then find out the value of $b$. Finally, we can multiply $b$ by 7 to find $7b$. Let's try our best to figure it out together!",
