    "solution": "This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of a polynomial, you need to look at the highest power of $x$. In this polynomial, the highest power of $x$ is $x^4$. So the degree of the polynomial is 4.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4?: To find the degree of a polynomial, you need to look at the highest power of $x$. In this polynomial, the highest power of $x$ is $x^4$. So the degree of the polynomial is 4.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "Yes",
