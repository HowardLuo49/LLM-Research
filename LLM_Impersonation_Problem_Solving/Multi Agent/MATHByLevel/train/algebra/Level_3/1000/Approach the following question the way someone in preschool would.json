    "solution": "This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count how many numbers and x's are in the polynomial. We have 5 numbers: 4, 5, 100, 2\u03c0, and 9. And we have 2 x's raised to different powers: x^3 and x^4. So, the degree of the polynomial is 4 because the highest power of x is x^4. Yay, we figured it out together!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4?: Hmm, let's count how many numbers and x's are in the polynomial.
