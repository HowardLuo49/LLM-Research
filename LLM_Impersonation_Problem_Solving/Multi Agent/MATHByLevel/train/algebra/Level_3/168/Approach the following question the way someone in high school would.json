    "solution": "When graphed, this function is a parabola that opens upwards. Thus, the minimum possible value of y occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The $x$ coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}$. Substituting the given values, this yields $\\frac{-10}{2}=-5$. Substituting this for $x$ gives the minimum value of $y$ to be \\begin{align*}\ny&=x^2+10x+21 \\\\\n&=(-5)^2+10(-5)+21 \\\\\n&=25+(-50)+21 \\\\\n&=25-50+21 \\\\\n&=-25+21 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{-4}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least possible value of $y$, we need to find the minimum point of the function. \n\nFirst, we need to find the x-coordinate of the minimum point. To do this, we can use the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a=1$ and $b=10$ (from the form of the function $y=ax^2+bx+c$).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get $x=-\\frac{10}{2(1)}=-5$. \n\nNext, we plug the value of $x$ back into the original function to find the corresponding value of $y$: $y=(-5)^2+10(-5)+21=25-50+21=-4$.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $y$ is $-4$.",
