    "solution": "When graphed, this function is a parabola that opens upwards. Thus, the minimum possible value of y occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The $x$ coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}$. Substituting the given values, this yields $\\frac{-10}{2}=-5$. Substituting this for $x$ gives the minimum value of $y$ to be \\begin{align*}\ny&=x^2+10x+21 \\\\\n&=(-5)^2+10(-5)+21 \\\\\n&=25+(-50)+21 \\\\\n&=25-50+21 \\\\\n&=-25+21 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{-4}\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see. To find the least possible value of y, we need to find the lowest point on the graph of the function. Let me try drawing a graph. Uh-oh, I can't draw very well yet. But I remember that the graph of a parabola looks like a smile or a frown. So the lowest point would be the bottom of the smile or the bottom of the frown. I think we can find that point by using something called the vertex. I remember that the vertex of a parabola is like the tip top or the tip bottom point. Let's use that to find the least possible value of y. Oh, I see that the vertex of this parabola is at (-5,-4). So, the least possible value of y is -4. Yay, we did it!",
