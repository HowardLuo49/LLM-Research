    "solution": "Suppose that the number of ounces of pure water necessary is equal to $w$. Then, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is $30 + w$. The acid content of the mixture will always be $30\\% \\times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid. Thus, the amount of acid in the mixture is equal to $\\frac{9}{30 + w}$. Setting this equal to $20\\% = \\frac 15$, it follows that $$\\frac{9}{30+w} = \\frac 15 \\Longrightarrow 30+w = 45.$$ Thus, $w = \\boxed{15}$ ounces of pure water.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ represent the amount of pure water that needs to be added to the $30$ ounces of $30\\%$ acid solution. Since we are adding pure water, the amount of acid in the solution remains the same, which is $30 \\times 0.30$ ounces.\n\nAfter adding water, the total amount of solution is $30 + x$ ounces, and the amount of acid in the solution is still $30 \\times 0.30$ ounces. Since the final solution is $20\\%$ acid, we have the equation:\n\n$\\frac{30 \\times 0.30}{30 + x} = 0.20$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\n$0.09 = 0.20(30 + x)$\n\n$0.09 = 6 + 0.20x$\n\n$0.09 - 6 = 0.20x$\n\n$-5.91 = 0.20x$\n\n$x = \\frac{-5.91}{0.20} = -29.55$\n\nSince the amount of water added cannot be negative, we have made a mistake in the calculation. Let's revisit the equation:\n\n$\\frac{30 \\times 0.30}{30 + x} = 0.20$\n\n$9 = 0.20(30 + x)$\n\n$9 = 6 + 0.20x$\n\n$3 = 0.20x$\n\n$x = \\frac{3}{0.20} = 15$\n\nTherefore, $15$ ounces of pure water must be added to the $30$ ounces of $30\\%$ acid solution to yield a solution that is $20\\%$ acid.",
