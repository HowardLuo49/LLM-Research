    "solution": "The common ratio is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2}=\\frac{1}{8}$, so the $k^{th}$ term is $2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{k-1}$. Thus we have:\n\n$2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^4=\\frac{2}{2^{12}}=\\frac{1}{2^{11}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2048}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So, we start with the first term, which is $2$. Then we have the second term, which is $\\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nTo find the next term, we need to multiply the previous term by the common ratio. The common ratio is found by dividing the second term by the first term. So, $\\frac{1}{4} \\div 2 = \\frac{1}{8}$. \n\nNow, we can find the third term by multiplying the second term by the common ratio. So, $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{32}$. \n\nNext, we find the fourth term by multiplying the third term by the common ratio. So, $\\frac{1}{32} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{256}$.\n\nFinally, we find the fifth term by multiplying the fourth term by the common ratio. So, $\\frac{1}{256} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2048}$.\n\nTa-da! The fifth term of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{1}{2048}$. Great job, everyone!",
