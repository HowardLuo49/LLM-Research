    "solution": "The common ratio is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2}=\\frac{1}{8}$, so the $k^{th}$ term is $2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{k-1}$. Thus we have:\n\n$2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^4=\\frac{2}{2^{12}}=\\frac{1}{2^{11}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2048}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fifth term of a geometric sequence, we need to first find the common ratio between consecutive terms. \n\nTo find the common ratio, we divide the second term by the first term:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n\nNow that we know the common ratio is $\\frac{1}{8}$, we can find the fifth term by raising the common ratio to the fourth power (since we want the fifth term and we already know the first term):\n$$2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^4 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4096} = \\frac{2}{4096} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2048}}$$\n\nTherefore, the fifth term of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{1}{2048}$.",
