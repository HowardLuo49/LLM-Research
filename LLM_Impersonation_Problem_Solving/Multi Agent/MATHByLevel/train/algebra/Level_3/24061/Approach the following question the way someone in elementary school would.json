    "solution": "Since $(4, -3)$ lies on the line, we plug $x = 4$ and $y = -3$ into the equation to get $1 - 4k = -3\\cdot -3 \\Rightarrow k = \\boxed{-2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $k$, we need to substitute the point $(4,-3)$ into the equation $1-kx = -3y$. Then we can solve for $k$.\n\nFirst, we substitute $x=4$ and $y=-3$ into the equation:\n\n$1-k(4) = -3(-3)$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$1-4k = 9$\n\nNow we need to solve for $k$:\n\n$1-4k = 9$\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n$-4k = 8$\n\nDivide by -4:\n\n$k = -2$\n\nSo, the value of $k$ that makes the line contain the point $(4,-3)$ is $-2$.",
