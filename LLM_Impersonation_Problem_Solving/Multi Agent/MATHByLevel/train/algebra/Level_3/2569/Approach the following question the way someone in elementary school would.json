    "solution": "Two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.  The slope of a line whose equation is $y = mx + b$ is $m$.  Thus $8 = 2c \\Rightarrow c = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "When two lines are parallel, it means they have the same slope. In this case, the slope of the first line is 8 and the slope of the second line is 2c.\n\nSo we can set them equal to each other:\n\n8 = 2c\n\nTo find the value of c, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n8 / 2 = 2c / 2\n\n4 = c\n\nTherefore, the value of c is 4.",
