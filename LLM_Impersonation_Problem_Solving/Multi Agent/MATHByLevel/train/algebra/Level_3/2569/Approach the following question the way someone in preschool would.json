    "solution": "Two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.  The slope of a line whose equation is $y = mx + b$ is $m$.  Thus $8 = 2c \\Rightarrow c = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In preschool terms, parallel means the lines are like train tracks that never touch. So if the two lines with the equations are parallel, it means they go in the same direction but are not the same line.\n\nTo find the value of $c$ if the lines are parallel, we need to look at the slopes of the two lines. The slope of a line tells us how steep it is. If the two lines are parallel, then they have the same slope.\n\nThe slope of a line with the equation $y = mx + b$ is just the number in front of $x$, which is $m$.\n\nSo for the first line $y = 8x + 2$, the slope is $8$.\nAnd for the second line $y = (2c)x - 4$, the slope is $2c$.\n\nSince the lines are parallel, we know that the slopes must be the same. So we set $8$ equal to $2c$ and solve for $c$:\n$8 = 2c$\n$4 = c$\n\nTherefore, the value of $c$ is $4$ if the lines with the equations $y = 8x + 2$ and $y = (2c)x - 4$ are parallel.",
