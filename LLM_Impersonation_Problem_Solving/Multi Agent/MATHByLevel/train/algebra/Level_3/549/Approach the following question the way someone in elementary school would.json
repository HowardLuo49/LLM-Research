    "solution": "Distributing the left side of the inequality, we have $x^{2}+6x+9\\leq1$, which simplifies to $x^{2}+6x+8\\leq0$. This can be factored into $(x+2)(x+4)\\leq0$, and we can now look at the three regions formed by this inequality: $x<-4, -4\\leq x\\leq -2,$ and $x>-2$. We know that the signs in each of these regions alternate, and we test any number in each of the regions to make sure. Plugging into $(x+2)(x+4)$, any $x$ less than $-4$ yields a positive product, and any $x$ greater than $-2$ also yields a positive product. The remaining interval between $-2$ and $-4$ inclusive yields a nonpositive product. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers which satisfy the inequality: $-2, -3$, and $-4$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integers satisfy the inequality $(x+3)^{2}\\leq1$, we need to figure out what values of $x$ make the inequality true. \n\nFirst, let's expand the left side of the inequality: $(x+3)^{2} = x^{2} + 6x + 9$. \n\nNow, we have the inequality $x^{2} + 6x + 9 \\leq 1$. \n\nNext, let's simplify further by moving all terms to one side of the inequality to get: $x^{2} + 6x + 8 \\leq 0$. \n\nNow, we need to find out what values of $x$ will make this inequality true. To do that, we can factor the quadratic expression on the left side. \n\n$(x+4)(x+2) \\leq 0$. \n\nNow, we can see that the inequality will be satisfied if either $x+4 \\leq 0$ and $x+2 \\geq 0$ or $x+4 \\geq 0$ and $x+2 \\leq 0$. \n\nSo, the integers that satisfy the inequality are $x = -4, -3, -2$. \n\nTherefore, there are 3 integers that satisfy the inequality $(x+3)^{2}\\leq1$.",
