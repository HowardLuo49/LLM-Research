    "solution": "The common difference $d$ is $85-88 = -3$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in the arithmetic sequence is $88 - 3(n - 1) = 91 - 3n$.  If $91 - 3n = -17$, then $3n = (91 + 17) = 108$, so $n = 108/3 = 36$.  Hence, $-17$ is the $36^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence, which means that $36 - 1 = \\boxed{35}$ terms appear before $-17$ does.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the terms one by one! The first term is 88, the second term is 85, and the third term is 82. So far, we have three terms. The fourth term would be 79, the fifth term would be 76, and so on. Keep counting until we reach -17.",
