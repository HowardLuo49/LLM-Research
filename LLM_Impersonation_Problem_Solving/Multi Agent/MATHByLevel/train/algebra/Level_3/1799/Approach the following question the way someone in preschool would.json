    "solution": "The only way $|3x+5|$ is not positive is if it is 0.  We have $|3x+5| = 0$ if and only if $3x+5 = 0$.  Solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of x for which |3x+5| is not positive, we need to think about the numbers that are not positive. That means the numbers that are less than zero (like -1, -2, -3, etc.).\n\nWhen we put those numbers into the expression |3x+5|, we want the result to be not positive. So we need to find the value of x that makes |3x+5| a negative number.\n\nLet's think about what number x will make |3x+5| negative. We know that when x = -5/3, |3x+5| will be equal to 0. \n\nTherefore, the value of x for which |3x+5| is not positive is -5/3.",
