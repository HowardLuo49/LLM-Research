    "solution": "First we bring $x$ to the left side to get  \\[x^2-4x+9=41.\\]We notice that the left side is almost the square $(x-2)^2=x^2-4x+4$. Subtracting 5 from both sides lets us complete the square on the left-hand side, \\[x^2-4x+4=36,\\]so  \\[(x-2)^2=6^2.\\]Therefore $x=2\\pm6$.  The positive difference between these solutions is $8-(-4)=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... to find the positive difference, first we can solve the equation by moving everything to one side. Let's subtract x and 41 from both sides. So now the equation looks like this: x^2 -3x -x +9 -41 = 0. Hmm... this can simplify to x^2 -4x -32 = 0. Now we can try finding the solutions to this equation. Maybe we can use a square root or something, what do you think? Oh, maybe we can factor it! Let's see... the factored form of x^2 -4x -32 is (x-8)(x+4) = 0. That means x could be either 8 or -4. But the question is asking for the positive difference between the solutions, so we should take the positive value 8 and subtract -4 from it. The positive difference between the solutions is 8-(-4) = 8+4 = 12!",
