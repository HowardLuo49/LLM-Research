    "solution": "First, we recognize that $\\frac{4}{3x^{-3}}$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{4x^3}{3}$. Thus, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{3x^{-3}} \\cdot \\frac{3x^{2}}{2} & = \\frac{4x^3}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3x^2}{2} \\\\\n& = \\frac{(4 \\cdot 3)(x^3 \\cdot x^2)}{3 \\cdot 2} \\\\\n& = 2x^{3+2} \\\\\n& = \\boxed{2x^5}.\n\\end{align*}",
