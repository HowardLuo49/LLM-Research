    "solution": "The product of two positive numbers is positive, and the product of two negative numbers is also positive. Therefore, if the product of two numbers is less than or equal to $0$, then one of the numbers must be greater than or equal to $0$ and one of the numbers must be less than or equal to $0$.\n\nIf $(n+3)(n-7)\\le 0$, then because we know $n+3\\ge n-7$, we must specifically have $n+3\\ge 0$ and $n-7\\le 0$. The first condition, $n+3\\ge 0$, is true when $n\\ge -3$. The second condition, $n-7\\le 0$, is true when $n\\le 7$. Since both conditions must be true, the only solutions are the integers from $-3$ through $7$ (inclusive). These are $$n = -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.$$ Counting, we see that there are $\\boxed{11}$ solutions.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see... we have $(n+3)(n-7) \\le 0$. I know that this means either one of the factors should be negative and the other one positive or both factors should be zero.

So any integer from -2 to 6 would work.\n\nIf $n+3$ is positive and $n-7$ is negative, then $n$ should be outside the interval $(-3,7)$. So any integer less than -3 or greater than 7 would work.\n\nIf both factors are zero, then $n$ could be either -3 or 7.\n\nSo there are a total of 10 integers $n$ that satisfy $(n+3)(n-7) \\le 0$.
