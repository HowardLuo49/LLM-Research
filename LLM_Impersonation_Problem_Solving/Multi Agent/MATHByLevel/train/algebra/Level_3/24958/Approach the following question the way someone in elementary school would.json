    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. On Monday, I worked $t-6$ hours and earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour. My friend Andrew worked $2t-8$ hours but only earned $t-5$ dollars an hour. As it turns out, we earned the same amount. What is the value of $t$?",
    "solution": "Since we both earned the same amount, \\begin{align*}\n(t-6) (2t-5) &= (2t-8)(t-5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2t^2-17t+30 &= 2t^2 - 18t+ 40.\n\\end{align*}Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's see how much money I earned on Monday. I worked $t-6$ hours and earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour. To find out my total earnings, we can multiply the number of hours I worked by how much money I earned per hour. \n\nSo my total earnings would be ($t-6) \\times (2t-5)$ dollars. This is equal to $2t^2 - 17t + 30$. Now let's see how much money Andrew earned. He worked $2t-8$ hours and earned $t-5$ dollars per hour. \n\nHis total earnings would be ($2t-8) \\times (t-5)$ dollars. This is equal to $2t^2 - 18t + 40$. \n\nSince we earned the same amount, my total earnings should be equal to Andrew's total earnings. So we can set up the equation:\n\n$2t^2 - 17t + 30 = 2t^2 - 18t + 40$\n\nNow we need to solve for $t$. First, we can subtract $2t^2$ from both sides to simplify the equation. \n\n$-17t + 30 = -18t + 40$\n\nNext, we can add $18t$ to both sides to get the variables on one side of the equation. \n\n$1t + 30 = 40$\n\nFinally, we can subtract 30 from both sides to solve for t. \n\n$t = 10$\n\nSo, the value of $t$ is $10$.",
