    "solution": "Writing the equation $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$ in exponential notation gives $r+16 = 16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\\frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32$. Solving $r+16 = 32$ gives $r = \\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $r$, we need to rewrite the equation in exponential form. Since $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$, this can be rewritten as $16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = r + 16$. \n\nNow we need to simplify $16^{\\frac{5}{4}}$. Since $16 = 2^4$, we can rewrite $16^{\\frac{5}{4}}$ as $(2^4)^{\\frac{5}{4}} = 2^{4\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32$.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes $32 = r + 16$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r = 16$.",
