    "solution": "Writing the equation $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$ in exponential notation gives $r+16 = 16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = (2^4)^{\\frac{5}{4}} = 2^5 = 32$. Solving $r+16 = 32$ gives $r = \\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $r$ that satisfies the equation $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$, we first need to convert the given equation to exponential form. \n\nRecall that for any positive numbers $a$ and $b$, if $\\log_{a} b = c$, then $a^c = b$. Applying this to our equation, we get $16^{\\frac{5}{4}} = r + 16$. \n\nNow, simplify $16^{\\frac{5}{4}}$ to get $r + 16 = 2^4 = 16$. This gives us $r = 16 - 16 = 0$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $r$ that satisfies the equation $\\log_{16} (r+16) = \\frac{5}{4}$ is $r = 0$.",
