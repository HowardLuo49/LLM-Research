On a balance scale, $3$ green balls balance $6$ blue balls, $2$ yellow balls balance $5$ blue balls, and $6$ blue balls balance $4$ white balls. How many blue balls are needed to balance $4$ green, $2$ yellow and $2$ white balls?",
    "solution": "We will herein give the weight of each color ball a variable determined by the first letter of the color. We have $3G=6B\\implies 1G=2B$, $2Y=5B\\implies 1Y=2.5B$, and $6B=4W\\implies 1W=1.5B$. Thus $4G+2Y+2W=4(2B)+2(2.5B)+2(1.5B)=8B+5B+3B=16B$, and our answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use the balance scale to see how many blue balls we need! \n\nFirst, we know that $3$ green balls balance $6$ blue balls. So to balance $4$ green balls, we would need $\\frac{4}{3} \\times 6 = 8$ blue balls.\n\nNext, we know that $2$ yellow balls balance $5$ blue balls. So to balance $2$ yellow balls, we would need $\\frac{2}{2} \\times 5 = 5$ blue balls.\n\nFinally, we know that $6$ blue balls balance $4$ white balls. So to balance $2$ white balls, we would need $\\frac{2}{4} \\times 6 = 3$ blue balls.\n\nNow, let's add up all the blue balls we need: $8$ blue balls for the green balls, $5$ blue balls for the yellow balls, and $3$ blue balls for the white balls. \n\nAdding them up, we get $8 + 5 + 3 = 16$ blue balls needed to balance $4$ green, $2$ yellow, and $2$ white balls! Yay, we did it!",
