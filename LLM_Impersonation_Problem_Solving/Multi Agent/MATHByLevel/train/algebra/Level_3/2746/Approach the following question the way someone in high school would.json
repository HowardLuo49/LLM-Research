    "solution": "The absolute value of a real number is equal to $3$ if and only if the number is $3$ or $-3$.  Solving $2n-7=3$ and $2n-7=-3$ we find the solutions $n=5$ and $n=2$.  The sum of these solutions is $5+2=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value(s) of $n$, we need to solve the equation $|2n - 7| = 3$. \n\nWhen $2n - 7$ is positive, $|2n - 7| = 2n - 7$, so we have $2n - 7 = 3$. \nAdding 7 to both sides gives $2n = 10$ and then dividing by 2, we get $n = 5$. \n\nWhen $2n - 7$ is negative, $|2n - 7| = -(2n - 7)$, so we have $-(2n - 7) = 3$. \nMultiplying by -1 gives $2n - 7 = -3$. \nAdding 7 to both sides gives $2n = 4$ and then dividing by 2, we get $n = 2. \n\nSo, the sum of the values of $n$ for which $|2n - 7| = 3$ is $5 + 2 = 7$.",
