    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Sarah is trying to fence a rectangular area containing at least 100 sq. ft while using the least amount of material to build the fence. The length of the rectangular area should be 15 ft longer than the width. What should the width, in ft, be?",
    "solution": "We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\\ge100$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$. We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq. ft is $\\boxed{5}$ ft.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum amount of material needed for the fence, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangular area that will still give us an area of at least 100 sq. ft. Let's call the width of the rectangle \"x\" ft.\n\nSince the length of the rectangular area is 15 ft longer than the width, the length would be x + 15 ft.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length x width\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle in this case would be: Area = (x + 15) * x = x^2 + 15x\n\nWe know that the area should be at least 100 sq. ft, so:\n\nx^2 + 15x >= 100\n\nLet's solve this inequality:\n\nx^2 + 15x - 100 >= 0\n(x + 20)(x - 5) >= 0\n\nThis means that the width should be greater than or equal to 5 ft in order to have an area of at least 100 sq. ft. So, the width should be 5 ft.\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangular area should be 5 ft.",
