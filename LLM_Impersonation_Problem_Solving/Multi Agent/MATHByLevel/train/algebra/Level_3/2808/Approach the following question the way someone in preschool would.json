    "solution": "The degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 1, and the only way that $g(x)$ can cancel the term of $-7x^4$ in $f(x)$ is if $g(x)$ contains the term $7x^4$.  Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about this with some fun math! We have our friend $f(x)$, and we want to add another friend $g(x)$ to it. We want the degree of the sum of these two friends to be 1, which means they need to act like a line when they're together.\n\nOur friend $f(x)$ has a degree of 4, because the biggest number on his x is 4. So, if we want him to be a line when we add $g(x)$, then $g(x)$ must be a linear polynomial with a degree of 1!\n\nThat means the degree of $g(x)$ is 1. Yay, now we have two new friends that work together to make a line! Maths is so cool, right?",
