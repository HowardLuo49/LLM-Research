    "solution": "32000 bacteria is $32000/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish. Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number. Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\\cdot6=\\boxed{24}$ hours.",
    "gpt_response": "So, we have some little bacteria friends in a dish, and they like to multiply! They double in number every four hours. Right now, there are 500 bacteria in the dish. We want to know how many hours it will take for there to be 32,000 bacteria.\n\nLet's count by fours and see how many times the bacteria will double:\n- After 4 hours: 500 x 2 = 1000 bacteria\n- After 8 hours: 1000 x 2 = 2000 bacteria\n- After 12 hours: 2000 x 2 = 4000 bacteria\n- After 16 hours: 4000 x 2 = 8000 bacteria\n- After 20 hours: 8000 x 2 = 16000 bacteria\n- After 24 hours: 16000 x 2 = 32000 bacteria\n\nSo, after 24 hours, there will be exactly 32,000 bacteria in the dish! Yay, our bacteria friends have been busy multiplying!",
