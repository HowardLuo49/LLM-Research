    "solution": "Knowing that $3$ is a root of $9$, we see that $x = 8,2$. Hence, the sum of the roots is $10$.\n\nAlternatively, we can rearrange the equation so that we have $x^2 - 10x + 16 = 0$. Then, using the case of Vieta's formula for a quadratic, we again see that the sum of the roots is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the roots of the equation $(x - 5)^2 = 9$, we first need to expand the left side of the equation and then solve for the roots.\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n$(x - 5)(x - 5) = x^2 - 5x - 5x + 25 = x^2 - 10x + 25 = 9$\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to set it equal to zero:\n$x^2 - 10x + 25 - 9 = 0$\n$x^2 - 10x + 16 = 0$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n$x = \\frac{-(-10) \\pm \\sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4(1)(16)}}{2(1)}$\n$x = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 64}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{10 \\pm 6}{2}$\n\nSo, the roots of the equation are:\n$x = 8$ and $x = 2$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the roots is:\n$8 + 2 = 10$",
