    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Samson derives utility according the relation  $$\\text{Utility} = \\text{hours of math done} \\times \\text{hours of frisbee played}.$$On Monday he plays $t$ hours of frisbee and spends $8 - t$ hours doing math.  On Tuesday, he ends up getting the same amount of utility as Monday while spending $2-t$ hours playing frisbee and $t+3$ hours on math.  Find $t$.  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
    "solution": "Since he derived equal utility from both days, we have $$t (8 - t) = (2 - t)(t + 3),$$so $$8t - t^2 = -t^2 -t + 6.$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
