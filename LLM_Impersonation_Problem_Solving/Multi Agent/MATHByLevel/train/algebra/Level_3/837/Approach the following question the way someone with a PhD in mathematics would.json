    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When a car's brakes are applied, it travels 7 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
    "solution": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 28 and common difference $-7$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $28+21+14+7 = \\boxed{70}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first recognize that the distance the car travels decreases by 7 feet each second. This can be represented by a sequence of numbers where the first term is 28 feet and each subsequent term is 7 feet less than the previous term.\n\nTo find the total distance traveled from the time the brakes are applied to the time the car stops, we need to sum the terms of this sequence. The sequence can be defined as:\n\na_n = 28 - 7(n-1)\n\nWhere n represents the number of seconds since the brakes were applied. The total distance traveled is the sum of all terms in this sequence, starting from n=1 to the time it takes for the car to stop. \n\nThe car will stop when the distance traveled in a given second becomes negative, meaning the car has come to a complete stop. So, we need to find the value of n for which a_n is less than or equal to 0:\n\n28 - 7(n-1) \u2264 0\n28 - 7n + 7 \u2264 0\n35 - 7n \u2264 0\n-7n \u2264 -35\nn \u2265 5\n\nThis implies that the car takes 5 seconds to come to a complete stop. We can now calculate the total distance traveled by summing the terms of the sequence from n=1 to n=5:\n\nTotal distance = 28 + 21 + 14 + 7 + 0\nTotal distance = 70 feet\n\nTherefore, the car travels a total of 70 feet from the time the brakes are applied to the time the car stops.",
