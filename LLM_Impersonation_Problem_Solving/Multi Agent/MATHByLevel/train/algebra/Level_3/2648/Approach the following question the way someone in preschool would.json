Starting with the number 100, Shaffiq repeatedly divides his number by two and then takes the greatest integer less than or equal to that number. How many times must he do this before he reaches the number 1?",
    "solution": "After doing so twice, he gets $25$. He then divides $25$ by $2$ to get $12.5$, and then takes the greatest integer to get $12$. He now divides by $2$ twice to get $3$. Finally, he divides by $2$ to get $1.5$ and takes the greatest integer to get $1$. This is a total of $\\boxed{6}$ times.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start with the number 100. \n\nFirst, Shaffiq divides 100 by 2, which is 50. Then he takes the greatest integer less than or equal to 50, which is 50.\n\nNext, he divides 50 by 2, which is 25. Then he takes the greatest integer less than or equal to 25, which is 25.\n\nAfter that, he divides 25 by 2, which is 12.5. Then he takes the greatest integer less than or equal to 12.5, which is 12.\n\nThen he divides 12 by 2, which is 6. Then he takes the greatest integer less than or equal to 6, which is 6.\n\nNext, he divides 6 by 2, which is 3.
