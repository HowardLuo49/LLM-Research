    "solution": "We know that $4\\oslash x = (\\sqrt{2(4)+x})^3=27$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we have $\\sqrt{8+x}=3$. Squaring both sides, we have $8+x=9$, to give us our answer of $x=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we substitute in the given values and set up the equation $4 \\oslash x = 27$ as $(\\sqrt{2(4)+x})^3 = 27$. \n\nNext, simplify the expression inside the parentheses: $(\\sqrt{8+x})^3 = 27$. Cube root both sides to get $\\sqrt{8+x} = 3$. \n\nSquare both sides to isolate $x$: $8+x = 9$. \n\nLastly, subtract 8 from both sides to find the value of $x$: $x = 1$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is 1.",
