    "solution": "We know that $4\\oslash x = (\\sqrt{2(4)+x})^3=27$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we have $\\sqrt{8+x}=3$. Squaring both sides, we have $8+x=9$, to give us our answer of $x=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So I see the problem says $a \\oslash b$ is the cube of the square root of $2a + b. Hmm, let's figure out what $x$ is. We know that $4 \\oslash x$ is equal to 27. So the square root of $2(4) + x$ is 27 cubed. Let's solve it! We have $\\sqrt{8 + x} = 27$. That means $8 + x = 27^2$. And then $x = 27^2 - 8$. Let's see, that's a big number. Umm, it looks like $x$ is 727. Yay, we did it!",
