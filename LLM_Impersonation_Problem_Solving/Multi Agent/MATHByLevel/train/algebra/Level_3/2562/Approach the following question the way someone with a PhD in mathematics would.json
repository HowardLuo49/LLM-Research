    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Four pens and three pencils cost $\\$2.24$. Two pens and five pencils cost $\\$1.54$. No prices include tax. In cents, what is the cost of a pencil?",
    "solution": "Let the price of a pen be $x$ and the price of a pencil be $y$, in cents. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \\begin{align*}\n4x + 3y &= 224, \\\\\n2x + 5y &= 154. \\\\\n\\end{align*}We can subtract the first equation from twice the second equation to obtain $7y = 84$, so $y = 12$. Therefore, the cost of a pencil is $\\boxed{12}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the cost of a pen be denoted as $p$, and the cost of a pencil be denoted as $q$. We can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information:\n\nFrom the first statement:\n4p + 3q = 224\n\nFrom the second statement:\n2p + 5q = 154\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:\n\nFirst, we can multiply the second equation by 2:\n4p + 10q = 308\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate the variable $p$:\n(4p + 10q) - (4p + 3q) = 308 - 224\n7q = 84\nq = 12\n\nTherefore, the cost of a pencil is $0.12 or 12 cents.",
