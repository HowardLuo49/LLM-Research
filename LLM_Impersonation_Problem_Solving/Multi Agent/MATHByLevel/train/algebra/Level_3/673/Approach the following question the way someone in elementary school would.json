    "solution": "We solve each equation separately. First off, we have $8x^2 + 7x - 1 = (8x-1)(x+1) = 0.$ We can also see that $24x^2+53x-7 = (8x-1)(3x+7) = 0.$ It is clear that both equations are satisfied only when $8x - 1 = 0,$ therefore $x = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{8}}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$, we need to solve the two equations given. \n\nFirst, let's solve $8x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0$. We can factor this equation as $(8x - 1)(x + 1) = 0$. This means that either $8x - 1 = 0$ or $x + 1 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \\frac{1}{8}$ or $x = -1$. \n\nNext, let's solve $24x^2 + 53x - 7 = 0$.
