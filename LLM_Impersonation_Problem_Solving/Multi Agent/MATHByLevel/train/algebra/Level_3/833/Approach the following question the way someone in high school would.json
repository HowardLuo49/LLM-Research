    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Abby, Bart, Cindy and Damon weigh themselves in pairs. Together Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds, Bart and Cindy weigh 245 pounds, and Cindy and Damon weigh 270 pounds. How many pounds do Abby and Damon weigh together?",
    "solution": "Let the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=260\\\\\nb+c&=245\\\\\nc+d&=270\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $(a+b)-(b+c)=260-245 \\Rightarrow a-c=15$. Adding this last equation to the third given equation, we have $(a-c)+(c+d)=15+270 \\Rightarrow a+d=285$. Thus, Abby and Damon together weigh $\\boxed{285}$ pounds.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many pounds Abby and Damon weigh together, we first need to figure out how much each pair weighs. \n\nWe know that Abby and Bart weigh 260 pounds together, Bart and Cindy weigh 245 pounds together, and Cindy and Damon weigh 270 pounds together. \n\nIf we add up all three pairs, we get:\n\nAbby + Bart + Bart + Cindy + Cindy + Damon = Abby + 2Bart + 2Cindy + Damon = 260 + 245 + 270 = 775 pounds\n\nNow, we can subtract the weight of Bart and Cindy (245 pounds) from the total weight of all three pairs to find out how much Abby and Damon weigh together:\n\n775 - 245 = 530 pounds\n\nSo, Abby and Damon weigh 530 pounds together.",
