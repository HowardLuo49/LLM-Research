Let's see if we can find a pattern in the numbers.\n\nWe see that each number is getting multiplied by a negative number. The first number is $16$, then it becomes $-24$ which is $16$ times $-1.5$. Then it becomes $36$ which is $-24$ times $-1.5$. And finally, it becomes $-54$ which is $36$ times $-1.5$.\n\nSo the common ratio seems to be $-1.5$. Yay, we found the pattern in the sequence!",
