    "solution": "We have the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 399 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.9 \\\\\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.9y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.9y+y=399$, or $y=210$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+210=399$ or $x=189$. Thus, $y-x=210-189=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh boy, math time! So we know that the sum of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is 399. That means if we add $x$ and $y$ together, we get 399.\n\nAlso, the value of the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is 0.9. That's like saying that if we divide $x$ by $y$, we get 0.9.\n\nNow we want to find the value of $y - x$. Hmm, that's like subtracting $x$ from $y$.\n\nLet's see if we can figure this out. Since we know that $x + y = 399$, and $\\frac{x}{y} = 0.9$, maybe we can use that information to find $y - x.\n\nLet's see, I think we may need to solve these equations at the same time. So we have:\n\n$x + y = 399$ \n$\\frac{x}{y} = 0.9$\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky, but maybe if we rewrite the second equation as $x = 0.9y$ we can substitute it into the first equation.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n$0.9y + y = 399$\n\nIf we solve for $y$, we get $y = 225$. \n\nNow that we know $y = 225$, we can find $x$ by plugging it into $x = 0.9y$. So $x = 0.9(225) = 202.5$. \n\nFinally, we can find the value of $y - x$ which is $225 - 202.5 = 22.5$. \n\nSo the value of $y - x$ is 22.5. Yay, we did it! Math is fun!",
