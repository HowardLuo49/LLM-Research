    "solution": "For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $1 + 2 + \\dots + 102 = 102 \\cdot 103/2 = 5253$.  The remainder when 5253 is divided by 5250 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the first 102 counting numbers, we can use the formula: sum = n/2 * (first number + last number), where n is the number of counting numbers.\n\nSo, the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is 102/2 * (1 + 102) = 102/2 * 103 = 5103.\n\nTo find the remainder when 5103 is divided by 5250, we need to see how many times 5250 can go into 5103 without going over.\n\nIf we divide 5103 by 5250, we get 0 with a remainder of 5103.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250 is 5103.",
