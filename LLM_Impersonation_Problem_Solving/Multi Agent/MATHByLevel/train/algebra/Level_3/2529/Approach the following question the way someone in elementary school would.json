    "solution": "Writing the equation in exponential form gives us $2x-7 = 9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = (9^{\\frac{1}{2}})^3 = 3^3 = 27$. Solving $2x-7=27$ gives us $x = \\boxed{17}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find $x$, we need to remember that the logarithm is the exponent that we can raise 9 to get $2x-7$. Since the logarithm is $\\frac{3}{2}$, we know $\\log_9(2x-7) = \\frac{3}{2}$ means $9^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 2x-7$. \n\nSo, we need to find $9^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ which means $\\sqrt{9^3} = \\sqrt{729} = 27$.\n\nNow we know $2x-7 = 27$. We can add 7 to both sides to find $2x = 34$. Finally, we divide by 2 to find $x = 17$. So, $x = 17$.",
