    "solution": "Factoring, we have $x^2 - 16x + 60 = (x - 10)(x - 6)$ Therefore, $a = 10$ and $b = 6,$ and $3b - a = 18 - 10 = \\boxed{8}.$",

So, we can write $x^2 - 16x + 60$ as $(x - 10)(x - 6)$.\n\nThis means that $a = 10$ and $b = 6$. Now we can find $3b - a$.\n\n$3b - a = 3(6) - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8$\n\nSo, the value of $3b - a$ is 8.",
