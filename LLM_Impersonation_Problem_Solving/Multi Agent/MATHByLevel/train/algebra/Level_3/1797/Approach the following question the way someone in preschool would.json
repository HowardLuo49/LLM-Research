    "solution": "Let $x=\\log_432$.  Then, we must have $4^x = 32$.  Writing both 4 and 32 with 2 as the base gives $(2^2)^x = 2^5$, so $2^{2x} = 2^5$.  Therefore, we must have $2x =5$, so $x =\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... Let's see. So, I think the question is asking us to figure out what number we need to raise 4 to in order to get 32. That's a tricky one! Maybe we can start by trying to figure out what number we can multiply by itself 4 times to get 32. Let's give it a try!\n\n4 x 4 = 16\nNow, let's multiply 16 by 2 to see if we get 32.\n16 x 2 = 32 \n\nSo, I think the answer is 3. That means $\\log_4 32 = 3$. Yay, we did it!",
