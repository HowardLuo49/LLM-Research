    "solution": "Let $x=\\log_432$.  Then, we must have $4^x = 32$.  Writing both 4 and 32 with 2 as the base gives $(2^2)^x = 2^5$, so $2^{2x} = 2^5$.  Therefore, we must have $2x =5$, so $x =\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $\\log_432$, we want to figure out what power 4 would have to be raised to in order to get 32. \n\nLet's start with $4^2=16$, which is too small. Then we try $4^3=64$, which is too big. So $\\log_432$ would be between 2 and 3.\n\nSince we want to find the exact answer, we can use trial and error or guess and check to find that $4^{2.5}=32$. This means that $\\log_432=2.5$.",
