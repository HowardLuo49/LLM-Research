    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The midpoint of a line segment is located at $(1, -2)$. If one of the endpoints is $(4, 5)$, what is the other endpoint? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "solution": "The $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the midpoint are the averages of the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of the endpoints, respectively.  Since $4-3=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $1-3=-2$.  Since $5-7=-2$, the $y$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $-2-7=-9$.  Therefore, the endpoints are $(4,5)$ and $\\boxed{(-2,-9)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember what the midpoint formula is: \nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})$.\n\nGiven that the midpoint is $(1, -2)$ and one of the endpoints is $(4, 5)$, we can plug in these values into the formula and solve for the other endpoint:\n$(\\frac{4 + x}{2}, \\frac{5 + y}{2}) = (1, -2)$\n\nFrom this, we can see that:\n$4 + x = 2 \\times 1$  \n$5 + y = 2 \\times -2$\n\nSolving these equations, we find:\n$x = -2$  \n$y = -9$\n\nTherefore, the other endpoint is $(-2, -9)$.",
