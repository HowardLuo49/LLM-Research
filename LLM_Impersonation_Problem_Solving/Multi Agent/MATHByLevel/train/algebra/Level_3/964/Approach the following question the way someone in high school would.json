    "solution": "This problem is immediate once you know the following fact:\n\nFor the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the solutions of the equation is $-b/a$ and the product of the solutions is $c/a$.\n\nIn this case, $b = 1992$ and $a = 1$, so the sum of the solutions is $-b/a = \\boxed{-1992}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + 1992x = 1993$, we need to first set the equation equal to zero.\n\n$x^2 + 1992x - 1993 = 0$\n\nSince this is a quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for $x$. The quadratic formula is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$, $b$ is the coefficient of $x$, and $c$ is the constant term.\n\nIn this case, $a=1$, $b=1992$, and $c=-1993$.
