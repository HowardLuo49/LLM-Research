    "solution": "The center of the circle is located at the midpoint of any diameter. Thus, the center of the circle is $\\left(\\frac{9+(-3)}{2}, \\frac{(-5)+(-1)}{2}\\right) = (3, -3)$. The sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is therefore $3 + (-3) = \\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the center of the circle, we need to find the midpoint of the diameter. \n\nTo find the midpoint, we add the x-coordinates of the endpoints and divide by 2, and add the y-coordinates of the endpoints and divide by 2. \n\nFor the x-coordinate:\n$(9 + (-3)) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3$\n\nFor the y-coordinate:\n$(-5 + (-1)) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3$\n\nSo the center of the circle is at (3, -3). \n\nTo find the sum of the coordinates, we add 3 and -3:\n$3 + (-3) = 0$\n\nSo, the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is 0.",
