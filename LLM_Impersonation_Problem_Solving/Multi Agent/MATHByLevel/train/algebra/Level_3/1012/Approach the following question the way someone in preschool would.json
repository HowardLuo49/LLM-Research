    "solution": "The center of the circle is located at the midpoint of any diameter. Thus, the center of the circle is $\\left(\\frac{9+(-3)}{2}, \\frac{(-5)+(-1)}{2}\\right) = (3, -3)$. The sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is therefore $3 + (-3) = \\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's draw a big circle on a paper with the points (9, -5) and (-3, -1) as the ends of the line across the middle. Now we need to find the center of the circle. So where do we think the center might be? Maybe in the middle between the two points? \n\nLet's count the points between (9, -5) and (-3, -1). We can see that there are 6 points in between. Since the diameter goes through the center of the circle, there will be 3 points on each side of the center.\n\nSo, if we start at the point (-3, -1) and move 3 points to the left, we get to (-6, -1). That must be the x-coordinate of the center. \n\nThen, if we start at the point (-3, -1) and move 3 points down, we get to (-3, -4). That must be the y-coordinate of the center.\n\nSo, the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is $(-6) + (-4) = -10$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is $-10$.",
