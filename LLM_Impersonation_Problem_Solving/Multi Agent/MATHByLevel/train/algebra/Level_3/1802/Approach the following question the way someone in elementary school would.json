    "solution": "We rearrange the given equation to $|x-7| = 1$.  Thus either $x-7 = 1$, meaning $x = 8$, or $x-7 = -1$, meaning $x=6$.  Our answer is therefore $6\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{48}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So in the equation $|x-7| -3 = -2$, we need to figure out what numbers we can put in for $x$ to make the equation true. \n\nFirst, let's solve for $|x-7|$. Since $|x-7| -3 = -2$, we can add 3 to both sides to get $|x-7| = 1$. \n\nNow we know that $|x-7|$ is equal to 1. This means that $x$ could either be 6 or 8, because when we subtract 7 from these numbers, we get 1. \n\nSo the possible values for $x$ are 6 and 8. \n\nTo find the product of all possible values of $x$, we just need to multiply 6 and 8 together. \n\n6 * 8 = 48\n\nSo the product of all possible values of $x$ in the equation is 48.",
