    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Lisa has 10 friends and 34 marbles. What is the minimum number of additional marbles she needs so that she can give each friend at least one marble and no two friends receive the same number of marbles?",
    "solution": "Lisa wants to minimize the number of marbles she gives to her friends without giving any two of them the same number of marbles. The minimum number of marbles she can give to a friend is 1. She then gives 2 marbles to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 10. The total number of marbles Lisa has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+10 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2}=55$.\n\nThus, Lisa needs $55-34=\\boxed{21}$ more marbles.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first distribute the marbles to each friend one by one. Since Lisa has 10 friends, we can start by giving each friend one marble. After giving each friend one marble, Lisa will have 24 marbles left.\n\nNext, we need to give an additional marble to each friend, starting from the friend who received the least number of marbles in the first round. Since there are 10 friends, we will give away 10 more marbles in total. After giving away these 10 marbles, Lisa will be left with 14 marbles.\n\nNow, we need to distribute the remaining 14 marbles in such a way that no two friends receive the same number of marbles. Since there are 10 friends, the numbers of marbles they can receive without any overlap are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since these numbers add up to 15 (1+2+3+4+5), Lisa will need at least one more marble to distribute among her friends without any overlap.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of additional marbles Lisa needs is 1.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 21?: To solve this problem, we need to first distribute the marbles to each friend one by one. Since Lisa has 10 friends, we can start by giving each friend one marble.

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No, the final solution obtained is not equal to 21. The final solution obtained is that Lisa needs at least one more marble to distribute among her friends without any overlap. So, the total number of marbles needed is 25, not 21.",
