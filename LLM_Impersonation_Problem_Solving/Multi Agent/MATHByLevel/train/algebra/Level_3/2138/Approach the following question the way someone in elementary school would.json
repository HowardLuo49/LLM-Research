    "solution": "Letting $x= \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \\!\\sqrt{2 - x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 2 - x$, so $x^2 + x -2 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x+2)(x-1) = 0$. Therefore, $x=-2$ or $x=1$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow, this looks tricky! But let's start by trying to figure out what happens when we keep taking the square root of 2 and subtracting it from 2 again and again. Maybe we can find a pattern!\n\nLet's say the whole expression is equal to x. That means $\\sqrt{2 -\\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\!\\sqrt{2 - \\cdots}}}} = x$. \n\nNow, we can substitute x back into itself to see if it helps us figure out what x is. So now we have $\\sqrt{2 - x} = x$. \n\nHmmm, let's try to solve this equation. \n\nWe know that $x = \\sqrt{2 - x}$. So, we can square both sides to help us solve for x. \n\n$x^2 = 2 - x.$ \n\nIf we rearrange this equation to get everything on one side, we have $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. \n\nNow, we can solve this equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula to find the value of x. \n\nI hope this helps you understand how to evaluate the square root expression! It's like a fun math puzzle to solve!",
