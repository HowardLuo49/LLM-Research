    "solution": "$1<\\frac54<2$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\frac54$ is $2$. Similarly, $-2<-\\frac54<-1$, so the largest integer less than or equal to $-\\frac54$ is $-2$. The original expression, $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lfloor{-\\frac54}\\right\\rfloor$, is equal to the sum of the two, which is just $2+(-2)=\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's use our special symbols to figure out the answer. First, we need to figure out what $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil$ is. The ceiling of $\\frac54$ means rounding up to the nearest whole number, which in this case is 2. Then, we need to figure out what $\\left\\lfloor{-\\frac54}\\right\\rfloor$ is. The floor of $-\\frac54$ means rounding down to the nearest whole number, which in this case is -2. Now, we just need to add 2 and -2 together to get our final answer. 2 + (-2) = 0. So, the answer is 0. Great job!",
