    "solution": "We start by completing the square.  \\[x^2-10x+24=(x-5)^2-1.\\] Since the square of a real number is at least 0, $(x-5)^2\\ge 0$ and $(x-5)^2-1 \\ge -1.$ Thus, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-1,$ which occurs when $x=\\boxed{5}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum value for $x^2-10x+24$, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes the quadratic equation at its lowest point. \n\nOne way to do this is by finding the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ and $b$ is the coefficient of $x$. \n\nIn this case, $a = 1$ and $b = -10$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = -\\frac{-10}{2*1} = 5$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value for $x^2-10x+24$ is $x=5$.",

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. The minimum value for $x^2-10x+24$ is obtained by plugging in $x=5$ into the equation to get $(5)^2-10(5)+24 = 25-50+24 = -1$. So, the minimum value is -1, not 5.",
