    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Find $x$ such that $\\log_x 4=\\log_{27} 3$.",
    "solution": "We begin by evaluating the RHS of the equation. Since $27=3^3$, we know that $27^{\\frac13}=3$ and $\\log_{27} 3=\\frac13$. This allows us to simplify the original equation as $\\log_x 4=\\frac13$. Writing this equation in exponential form, we get $x^{\\frac13}=4$, which gives us the solution $x=4^3=\\boxed{64}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie, this problem is asking us to find the value of $x$ so that the logarithm of $4$ base $x$ is equal to the logarithm of $3$ base $27$. Let's think like a detective and try to solve this mystery!\n\nFirst, remember that $\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}$. So in our case, we have $\\frac{\\log_4 4}{\\log_4 x} = \\frac{\\log_{27} 3}{\\log_{27} 27}$.\n\nSince $\\log_a a = 1$ for any $a$, the numerator on the left side simplifies to $1$. And since the logarithm of a number base itself is also $1$, the denominator of the left side simplifies to $1$ as well. This leaves us with $\\frac{1}{\\log_4 x} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow we can see that $\\log_4 x = 3$. In other words, $4^3 = x$.\n\nSo the mystery is solved! $x=64$. Yay, we did it!",
