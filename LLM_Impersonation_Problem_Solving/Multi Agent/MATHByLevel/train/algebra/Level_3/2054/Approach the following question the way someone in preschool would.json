    "solution": "We begin by evaluating the RHS of the equation. Since $27=3^3$, we know that $27^{\\frac13}=3$ and $\\log_{27} 3=\\frac13$. This allows us to simplify the original equation as $\\log_x 4=\\frac13$. Writing this equation in exponential form, we get $x^{\\frac13}=4$, which gives us the solution $x=4^3=\\boxed{64}$.",

    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 64?: Hmm, let's see. We need to find $x$ when $\\log_x 4 = \\log_{27} 3. Let's think about it. Oh, I know! If $\\log_x 4 = \\log_{27} 3$, that means $4$ and $3$ are the same when x is changed to 27. So, x should be 27! Yay, we found it!",
