    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Margo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes. Using the same route, it takes Margo 20 minutes to get back home. If her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, how many total miles did she walk?",
    "solution": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can apply the concept of average speed. Let x be the total distance Margo walked. Since her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, the total time she spent walking can be calculated by the formula:\n\nx / 4 = 10 + 20\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 4 * (10 + 20) = 120\n\nTherefore, Margo walked a total of 120 miles.",
