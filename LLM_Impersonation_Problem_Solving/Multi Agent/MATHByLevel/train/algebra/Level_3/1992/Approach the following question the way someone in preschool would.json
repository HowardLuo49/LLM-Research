If we increase $b$ by 7, we get the value $N$. If we multiply $c$ by 7, we also get the value $N$. What is the value of $N$?",
    "solution": "Translating words into math, we have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=60\\\\\na-7&=N\\\\\nb+7&=N\\\\\n7c&=N\\\\\n\\end{align*} We will express the value of each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $N$ and then substitute these equations into the first given equation to solve for $N$. From the second given equation, we have $a=N+7$. From the third given equation, we have $b=N-7$. From the fourth given equation, we have $c=N/7$. Plugging these equations into the first given equation to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we have $(N+7)+(N-7)+(N/7)=60\\Rightarrow N=\\boxed{28}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let\u2019s count together! One, two, three\u2026 We know that if we decrease $a$ by 7, we get the value $N$. So, let's count down from 60 by 7 until we find $N$. It goes like this: 60, 53, 46, 39, 32, 25, 18, 11. So, if we decrease $a$ by 7, we get the value 11. \n\nNow, let's find the value of $b$. If we increase $b$ by 7, we get the value $N. Let\u2019s count up from 60 by 7 until we find $N. It goes like this: 60, 67. So, if we increase $b$ by 7, we get the value 67. \n\nLastly, let's find the value of $c$. If we multiply $c$ by 7, we get the value $N. Since we already know the value of $a$ and $b, we can just add them up and subtract from 60 to find $c$. So, $c = 60 - 11 - 67 = -18$. However, since $c$ cannot be a negative number, we should count down from 60 by 7 until we find a positive number. It goes like this: 60, 53, 46, 39, 32, 25, 18. So, if we multiply $c$ by 7, we get the value 18. \n\nTherefore, the value of $N$ is 11, 67, or 18.",
