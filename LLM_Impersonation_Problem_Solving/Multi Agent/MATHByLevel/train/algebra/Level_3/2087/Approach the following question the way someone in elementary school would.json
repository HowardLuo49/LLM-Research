    "solution": "Cubing both sides of  \\[\n1\\text{ yard}=3\\text{ feet}\n\\] we find that 1 cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.  Therefore, 3 cubic yards are equal to $27\\cdot3=\\boxed{81}$ cubic feet.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many cubic feet are in three cubic yards, you have to remember that there are 27 cubic feet in one cubic yard. So if you have three cubic yards, you just have to multiply 27 by 3. \n\n27 x 3 = 81 \n\nSo, there are 81 cubic feet in three cubic yards.",
