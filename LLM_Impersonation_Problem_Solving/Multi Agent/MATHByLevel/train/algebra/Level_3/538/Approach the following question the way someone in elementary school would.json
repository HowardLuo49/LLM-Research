    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-6.$  Since they are in the ratio $2:1,$ the roots are $-4$ and $-2.$  Then $k$ is their product, namely $(-4)(-2) = \\boxed{8}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the two numbers that have a ratio of 2:1 and add up to 6 (from the equation $x^2 + 6x + k = 0$). \n\nLet's start by finding the two numbers. We know that the two numbers have a ratio of 2:1, so let's call the smaller number 2x and the larger number 1x. \n\nSo, 2x + 1x = 3x and we know that 3x = 6 (since they add up to 6). This means that x = 2.\n\nNow, we can find the values of the two numbers: 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 and 1x = 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nNow we can plug these values back into the equation $x^2 + 6x + k = 0$.\n\nWe get: $2^2 + 6(2) + k = 0$, which simplifies to $4 + 12 + k = 0$, and further simplifies to $16 + k = 0$.\n\nFinally, we solve for k by subtracting 16 from both sides, so k = -16.\n\nTherefore, the value of k is -16.",
