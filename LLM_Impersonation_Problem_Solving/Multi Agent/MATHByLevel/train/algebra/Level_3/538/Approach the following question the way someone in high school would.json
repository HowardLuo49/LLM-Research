    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-6.$  Since they are in the ratio $2:1,$ the roots are $-4$ and $-2.$  Then $k$ is their product, namely $(-4)(-2) = \\boxed{8}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $k$, we can first write the quadratic equation in the form $(x-r)(x-s) = 0$, where $r$ and $s$ are the roots of the equation. Since the roots are in the ratio $2:1$, we can write them as $2m$ and $m$ for some constant $m$. \n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n$(x-2m)(x-m) = x^2 - (2m + m)x + 2m \\cdot m = x^2 - 3mx + 2m^2 = 0$\n\nComparing this with the original equation $x^2 + 6x + k = 0$, we can see that $-3m = 6$ and $2m^2 = k$.\n\nSolving $-3m = 6$ gives $m = -2$, and substituting this back into $2m^2 = k$ gives $k = 2(-2)^2 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
