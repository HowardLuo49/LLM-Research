    "solution": "Let the other endpoint be $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+8)/2=6$ and $(y+0)/2=-10$, or $x=4$ and $y=-20$. The sum of the coordinates is $4+(-20)=\\boxed{-16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so to find the other endpoint we need to think about what it means to have a midpoint. The midpoint is like the middle point of a line segment. So if the midpoint is at $(6,-10)$ and one endpoint is at $(8,0)$, that other endpoint must be on the other side of the midpoint.\n\nTo find the other endpoint, we need to think about how far the midpoint is from each endpoint. Since the midpoint is in the middle, it is the same distance from each endpoint. So we can find the distance from the midpoint to one endpoint and then use that distance to find the other endpoint.\n\nThe distance from $(6,-10)$ to $(8,0)$ can be found by counting how many units we need to move in the x-direction and y-direction. We need to move 2 units to the left and 10 units down to get from $(8,0)$ to $(6,-10)$.\n\nNow, if we do the same thing from the midpoint to the other endpoint, we will find the other endpoint at $(4,-20)$. \n\nTo find the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint, we just add the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate together: $4 + (-20) = -16$. \n\nSo, the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is $-16$.",
