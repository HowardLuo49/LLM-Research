    "solution": "Repeatedly dividing by 2, we find the next terms in the sequence to be 125000, 62500, 31250, 15625,... 15625 is no longer a multiple of 2, so when we divide by 2 again, we will not get an integer, nor will it be a multiple of 2. Thus, no number in the sequence after 15625 can be an integer. Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{15625}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start with one million and then we divide by 2. So, 1,000,000 divided by 2 is 500,000. Then we divide 500,000 by 2 and we get 250,000. We keep dividing by 2 and we get 125,000, 62,500, 31,250, 15,625, 7,812, 3,906, 1,953, and finally 976. \n\nSo, the last integer in the sequence is 976.",
