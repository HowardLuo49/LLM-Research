    "solution": "If the two solutions are $r$ and $s$, then the left-hand side of the equation may be factored as $-(x-r)(x-s)$. When multiplied out, this expression takes the form $-x^2+(r+s)x-rs$.  Therefore, $r+s$ is the coefficient of $x$ in the equation, namely $\\boxed{-15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the two solutions to the equation, we first need to solve the equation for x. \n\nLet's rewrite the equation as $-x^2 - 15x + 54 = 0$.\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can either use the quadratic formula or factor the equation.\n\nThe factors of -54 that add up to -15 are -18 and +3, so we can rewrite the equation as $-(x^2 + 18x) + 3x + 54 = 0$.\n\nThen we can factor out an x on the left side, so we have $-x(x + 18) + 3(x + 18) = 0$.\n\nNow we see that we have the common factor of (x + 18), so we can rewrite the equation as $-(x + 18)(x - 3) = 0$.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we find the solutions x = -18 and x = 3.\n\nTo find the sum of the two solutions, we simply add -18 and 3 together to get -15. \n\nSo the sum of the two solutions to the equation $54 - 15x - x^2 = 0$ is -15.",
