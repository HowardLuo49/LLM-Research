    "solution": "Let $x= \\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})$.  Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\\sqrt{6})^x = 216\\sqrt{6}$.  Writing both sides with $6$ as the base gives us $6^{\\frac{x}{2}} = 6^3\\cdot 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To evaluate this logarithm, we need to rewrite the expression $216 \\sqrt{6}$ in terms of the base of the logarithm, which is $\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nWe know that $216 = 6^3$, so we can rewrite $216 \\sqrt{6}$ as $6^3 \\cdot \\sqrt{6}$. \n\nNow, we can simplify this expression by multiplying $6^3$ by $\\sqrt{6}$, which gives us $\\sqrt{6^{7}} = \\sqrt{216} = 6$.\n\nTherefore, $\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (216\\sqrt{6}) = \\boxed{3}$.",
