    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. If $m+\\frac{1}{m}=8$, then what is the value of $m^{2}+\\frac{1}{m^{2}}+4$?",
    "solution": "Squaring the equation provided, we get $m^2+2(m)\\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right) +\\frac{1}{m^2}=64,$ so $m^2+\\frac{1}{m^2}+4=\\boxed{66}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If m plus 1 over m equals 8, then that means m squared plus 1 over m squared equals 64. We can find this by squaring the equation m plus 1 over m equals 8. So, m squared plus 2 plus 1 over m squared equals 64. Then, if we subtract 2 from both sides, we get m squared plus 1 over m squared equals 62. Finally, if we add 4 to m squared plus 1 over m squared, we get 66. So, the value of m squared plus 1 over m squared plus 4 is 66.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 66?: If m plus 1 over m equals 8, then that means m squared plus 1 over m squared equals 64. We can find this by squaring the equation m plus 1 over m equals 8. So, m squared plus 2 plus 1 over m squared equals 64. Then, if we subtract 2 from both sides, we get m squared plus 1 over m squared equals 62. Finally, if we add 4 to m squared plus 1 over m squared, we get 66. So, the value of m squared plus 1 over m squared plus 4 is 66.",
