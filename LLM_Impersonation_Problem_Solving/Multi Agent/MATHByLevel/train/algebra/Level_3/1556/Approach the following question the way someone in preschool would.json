    "solution": "Squaring the equation provided, we get $x^2+2(x)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) +\\frac{1}{x^2}=36,$ so $x^2+\\frac{1}{x^2}=\\boxed{34}.$",
    "gpt_response": "If we have $x+\\frac{1}{x}=6$, that means we have a number and its reciprocal that add up to 6. To find out what $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ is, we can square the equation $x+\\frac{1}{x}=6$.\n\nFirst, let's multiply both sides of the equation by $x$ to clear the fraction:\n\n$x^{2}+1=6x$\n\nNow, let's square both sides of the equation:\n\n$(x^{2}+1)^{2}=(6x)^{2}$\n\n$x^{4}+2x^{2}\\cdot1+1=36x^{2}$\n\n$x^{4}+2x^{2}+1=36x^{2}$\n\nNow, our equation is $x^{4}+2x^{2}+1=36x^{2}$.
