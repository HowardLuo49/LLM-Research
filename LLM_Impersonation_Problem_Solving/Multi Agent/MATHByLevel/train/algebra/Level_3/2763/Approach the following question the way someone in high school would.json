    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The second and fifth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 17 and 19, respectively. What is the eighth term?",
    "solution": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d = 17$, fifth term is $a + 4d = 19$, and the eighth term is $a + 7d$.  Note that $(a + 4d) - (a + d) = 3d$, and $(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 3d$, so the terms $a + d = 17$, $a + 4d = 19$, and $a + 7d$ also form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nIf 17 and 19 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then the common difference is $19 - 17 = 2$, so the next term must be $19 + 2 = \\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the eighth term in an arithmetic sequence, we first need to find the common difference between each term. \n\nWe can find the common difference by subtracting the second term from the fifth term:\nCommon difference = 19 - 17 = 2\n\nNow that we know the common difference is 2, we can find the eighth term by adding this common difference to the fifth term:\nEighth term = 19 + 2(3) = 19 + 6 = 25\n\nTherefore, the eighth term of the arithmetic sequence is 25.",
