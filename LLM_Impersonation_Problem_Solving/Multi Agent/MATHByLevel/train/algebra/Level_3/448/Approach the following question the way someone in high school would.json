    "solution": "We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides.  This gives us $2-\\frac{x}{2} = -27$.  Solving this equation gives $x =\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all solutions to the equation $\\displaystyle\\sqrt[3]{2 - \\frac{x}{2}} = -3$, we first need to isolate the cube root. \n\nFirst step is to cube both sides of the equation to get rid of the cube root on the left side. This will give us:\n$\\displaystyle 2 - \\frac{x}{2} = -3^3$\n\nSimplify the right side to get:\n$\\displaystyle 2 - \\frac{x}{2} = -27$\n\nNow, let's solve for $\\displaystyle x$. \n\nAdd $\\displaystyle \\frac{x}{2}$ to both sides:\n$\\displaystyle 2 = \\frac{x}{2} - 27$\n\nAdd $\\displaystyle 27$ to both sides:\n$\\displaystyle 29 = \\frac{x}{2}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\displaystyle 2$ gives us:\n$\\displaystyle 58 = x$\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation $\\displaystyle \\sqrt[3]{2 - \\frac{x}{2}} = -3$ is $\\displaystyle x = 58$.",
