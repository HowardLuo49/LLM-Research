    "solution": "We have $ 27\\sqrt3 = (3^3)(3^\\frac12)=3^{(3+\\frac12)}=3^{\\frac72}$. Therefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3=\\boxed{\\frac72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can first simplify the expression $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3$ by using the properties of logarithms. We know that $\\log_a b = x$ is equivalent to $a^x = b$. So, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3$ is the exponent we need to raise 3 to in order to get $27\\sqrt3$.\n\nWe can write $27\\sqrt3$ as $3^3\\cdot3^{1/2} = 3^{3+1/2} = 3^{7/2}$. Therefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3 = \\log_3 3^{7/2} = 7/2$. \n\nAs an improper fraction, the evaluation of the expression $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$.",
