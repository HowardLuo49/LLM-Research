    "solution": "We have $ 27\\sqrt3 = (3^3)(3^\\frac12)=3^{(3+\\frac12)}=3^{\\frac72}$. Therefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3=\\boxed{\\frac72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we can simplify $27\\sqrt3$ by breaking it down into its factors. We know that $27 = 3^3$ and $\\sqrt3 = 3^{1/2}$. So, $27\\sqrt3 = 3^3 \\cdot 3^{1/2} = 3^{3 + 1/2} = 3^{7/2}$.\n\nNow we can rewrite the original expression as $\\log_3 3^{7/2}$. Since $\\log_a a^n = n$ for any base $a$, we can simplify this to be $7/2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3 = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$.",
