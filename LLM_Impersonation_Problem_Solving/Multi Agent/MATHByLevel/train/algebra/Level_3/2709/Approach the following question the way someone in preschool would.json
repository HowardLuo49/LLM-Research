    "solution": "We have $ 27\\sqrt3 = (3^3)(3^\\frac12)=3^{(3+\\frac12)}=3^{\\frac72}$. Therefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3=\\boxed{\\frac72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Well, let's see. We need to figure out what number we need to raise 3 to in order to get $27\\sqrt{3}$. Hmm, I know that $27$ is $3^3$ because $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$. And $\\sqrt{3}$ is like saying $3^{1/2}$. So $27\\sqrt{3}$ can be written as $3^3 \\cdot 3^{1/2}$. When we multiply numbers with the same base, we add their exponents. So, $3^3 \\cdot 3^{1/2} = 3^{3 + 1/2} = 3^{7/2}$. Therefore, $\\log_3 27\\sqrt3 = 7/2$. So my answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$!",
