At the end of five years, what is the total number of dollars in this investment? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "solution": "After five years, at a six percent annual interest rate, the investment will have grown to $10000 \\cdot 1.06^5 = \\boxed{13382}$, to the nearest dollar.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So, we start with $\\$$10,000 and it grows by 6$\\%$ each year. That means after the first year, we have $\\$$10,000 + 6$\\%$ of $\\$$10,000. That's $\\$$10,000 + $\\$$600 = $\\$$10,600. Then, after the second year, we have $\\$$10,600 + 6$\\%$ of $\\$$10,600. That's $\\$$10,600 + $\\$$636 = $\\$$11,236. We keep doing this for five years. So after five years, we have a total of $\\$$15,438. Yay, we did it!",
