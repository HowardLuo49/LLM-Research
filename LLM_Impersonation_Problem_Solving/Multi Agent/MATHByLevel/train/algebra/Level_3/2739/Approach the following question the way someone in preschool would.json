    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Ryosuke is picking up his friend from work. The odometer reads 74,568 when he picks his friend up, and it reads 74,592 when he drops his friend off at his house. Ryosuke's car gets 28 miles per gallon and the price of one gallon of gas is $\\$4.05$. What was the cost of the gas that was used for Ryosuke to drive his friend back home from work? (Express your answer in dollars and round to the nearest cent.)",
    "solution": "Ryosuke traveled a distance of $74,592 - 74,568 = 24$ miles between the time he picked up his friend and when he dropped him off. Since his car gets 28 miles per gallon, he used 24/28 or 12/14 of a gallon. At $\\$4.05$ per gallon, the cost of the trip is about $12/14 \\times 4.05 \\approx \\boxed{\\$3.47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count how many miles Ryosuke drove. If the odometer read 74,568 when he picked up his friend and 74,592 when he dropped him off, that means he drove 74,592 - 74,568 = 24 miles.\n\nNow, we need to figure out how many gallons of gas Ryosuke used. Since his car gets 28 miles per gallon, we can divide the total miles driven (24) by the miles per gallon (28) to find the number of gallons used. 24 miles \u00f7 28 miles per gallon = 0.8571 gallons.\n\nNext, we need to find out the cost of the gas used. One gallon of gas costs $\\$4.05$, so we can multiply the number of gallons used (0.8571) by the price per gallon ($4.05) to find the total cost. $4.05/gallon x 0.8571 gallons = $\\$3.47.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the gas that was used for Ryosuke to drive his friend back home from work was $\\$3.47.",
