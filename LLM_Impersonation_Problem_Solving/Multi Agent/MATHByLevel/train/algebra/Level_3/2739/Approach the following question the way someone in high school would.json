    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Ryosuke is picking up his friend from work. The odometer reads 74,568 when he picks his friend up, and it reads 74,592 when he drops his friend off at his house. Ryosuke's car gets 28 miles per gallon and the price of one gallon of gas is $\\$4.05$. What was the cost of the gas that was used for Ryosuke to drive his friend back home from work? (Express your answer in dollars and round to the nearest cent.)",
    "solution": "Ryosuke traveled a distance of $74,592 - 74,568 = 24$ miles between the time he picked up his friend and when he dropped him off. Since his car gets 28 miles per gallon, he used 24/28 or 12/14 of a gallon. At $\\$4.05$ per gallon, the cost of the trip is about $12/14 \\times 4.05 \\approx \\boxed{\\$3.47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the cost of the gas that Ryosuke used to drive his friend home from work, we need to first find out how many miles he drove. \n\nHe started with the odometer at 74,568 miles and ended with the odometer at 74,592 miles. The difference is 74,592 - 74,568 = 24 miles driven.\n\nSince his car gets 28 miles per gallon, he needed $\\frac{24}{28} \\approx 0.857$ gallons of gas.\n\nSince the price of one gallon of gas is $\\$4.05$, the cost of the gas used to drive his friend home is $0.857 \\times \\$4.05 \\approx \\$3.46.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the gas that Ryosuke used to drive his friend back home from work is approximately $\\$3.46.",
