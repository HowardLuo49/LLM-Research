    "solution": "We have: $$3 < \\sqrt{2x} < 4 $$$$\\Rightarrow 9 < 2x < 16 $$$$\\Rightarrow 4.5 < x < 8$$The integers from 5 to 7 inclusive satisfy this inequality, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers that satisfy the condition.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the possible range of values for $x$ given the condition that the square root of $2x$ is between 3 and 4.\n\nLet $\\sqrt{2x} = k$, where $3 < k < 4$. Squaring both sides, we get $2x = k^2$. \n\nSince $3 < k < 4$, we know that $9 < k^2 < 16$. Therefore, $9 < 2x < 16$. This simplifies to $4.5 < x < 8$. \n\nNow, we need to find the integer values of $x$ that satisfy $4.5 < x < 8$. The integers that satisfy this condition are $5, 6, 7$. \n\nTherefore, there are 3 integer values of $x$ (namely, 5, 6, and 7) that satisfy the condition that the square root of $2x$ is greater than 3 and less than 4.",
