    "solution": "We have: $$3 < \\sqrt{2x} < 4 $$$$\\Rightarrow 9 < 2x < 16 $$$$\\Rightarrow 4.5 < x < 8$$The integers from 5 to 7 inclusive satisfy this inequality, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers that satisfy the condition.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If the square root of $2x$ is greater than 3 and less than 4, that means $2x$ is greater than 9 but less than 16. So, for $2x$ to be between 9 and 16, $x$ must be between 4.5 and 8. Since x has to be an integer, the only integer values that satisfy this condition are 5, 6, 7, and 8. So, there are four integer values of x that satisfy this condition.",
