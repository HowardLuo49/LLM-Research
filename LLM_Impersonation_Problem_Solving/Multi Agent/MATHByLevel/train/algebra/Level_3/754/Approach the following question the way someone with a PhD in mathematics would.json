    "solution": "Let point $B$ have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+9)/2=3$ and $(y+3)/2=7$, or $x=-3$ and $y=11$. Thus, the sum of coordinates of point $B$ is $-3+11=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coordinates of point $B$, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint $(M)$ of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$.\n\nIn this case, the coordinates of point $M$ are $(3,7)$, the coordinates of point $A$ are $(9,3)$, and we want to find the coordinates of point $B$.\n\nLet the coordinates of point $B$ be $(x,y)$. Using the midpoint formula:\n\n$\\frac{9+x}{2} = 3$ and $\\frac{3+y}{2} = 7$\n\nSolving these two equations will give us the coordinates of point $B$. \n\nFrom the first equation, we get $9+x = 6$, which gives $x = -3$.\nFrom the second equation, we get $3+y = 14$, which gives $y = 11$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $B$ are $(-3,11)$. The sum of the coordinates of point $B$ is $-3 + 11 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $B$ is $8$.",
