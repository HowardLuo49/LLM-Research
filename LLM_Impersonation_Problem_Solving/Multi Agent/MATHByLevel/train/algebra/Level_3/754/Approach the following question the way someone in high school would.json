    "solution": "Let point $B$ have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+9)/2=3$ and $(y+3)/2=7$, or $x=-3$ and $y=11$. Thus, the sum of coordinates of point $B$ is $-3+11=\\boxed{8}$.",

This formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a segment is the average of the coordinates of the endpoints.\n\nGiven that the midpoint $M$ is $(3,7)$ and point $A$ is $(9,3)$, we can write out the formula and solve for the coordinates of point $B$.\n\nLet the coordinates of point $B$ be $(x,y)$. \n\nUsing the midpoint formula, we have:\n$$\\left(\\frac{x+9}{2}, \\frac{y+3}{2}\\right) = (3,7)$$\n\nWe can then find the coordinates of point $B$ by solving for $x$ and $y:\n$$\\frac{x+9}{2} = 3 \\implies x+9 = 6 \\implies x = -3$$\n$$\\frac{y+3}{2} = 7 \\implies y+3 = 14 \\implies y = 11$$\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $B$ are $(-3,11)$.\n\nTo find the sum of the coordinates, we add the x-coordinate and y-coordinate together:\n$$-3 + 11 = 8$$\n\nSo, the sum of the coordinates of point $B$ is $8$.",
