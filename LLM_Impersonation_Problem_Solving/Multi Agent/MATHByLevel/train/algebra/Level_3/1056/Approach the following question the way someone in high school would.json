    "solution": "Let our integer be $x$.  Then we have that $x^2 = 182 + x$, or $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this equation is just $-(-1) = \\boxed{1}$.  Note that we are given that one solution is an integer, and so the other one must be as well since they add to 1.\n\nNote that we can factor $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$ as $(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0$.  So the integers that work are 14 and $-13$, and their sum is $14 + (-13) = 1,$ as expected.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by defining an equation for this problem. Let's say the integer we're looking for is x. The problem states that the square of the integer is 182 greater than the integer itself, so we can write the equation as:\nx^2 = x + 182\n\nTo solve this equation, we can rearrange it to:\nx^2 - x - 182 = 0\n\nNow we need to factorize this quadratic equation:\n(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0\n\nFrom here, we have two solutions for x:\nx = 14 and x = -13\n\nSo, the sum of all integers for which this is true is:\n14 + (-13) = 1\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integers for which the square of the integer is 182 greater than the integer itself is 1.",
