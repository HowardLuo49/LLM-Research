    "solution": "We use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points, which is the side length of the square.\n$\\sqrt{(3-2)^2+(4-1)^2}=\\sqrt{1+9} = \\sqrt{10}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(\\sqrt{10})^2 = \\boxed{10}$.",

We can see that we moved up by 3 units and to the right by 1 unit. So if we draw a square around these two points, we will have a square with side lengths of 3 units.\n\nTo find the area of a square, we just need to multiply the length of one side by itself. So the area of our square is 3 units x 3 units = 9 square units.\n\nYay! We found the area of the square. Good job, little friend!",
