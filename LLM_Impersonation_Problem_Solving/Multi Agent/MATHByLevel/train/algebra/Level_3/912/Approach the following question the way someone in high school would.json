    "solution": "Call the first number $x$ and the second number $y$. Without loss of generality, assume $x > y$. We can represent the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nx - y &= 9\\\\\nx^2 + y^2 &= 153\n\\end{align*} Solving for $x$ in the first equation and substituting into the second yields $(9+y)^2 + y^2 = 153$, or $2y^2 + 18y - 72 = 0$. Canceling a $2$ gives $y^2 + 9y - 36 = 0$, which factors into $(y+12)(y-3)$. Thus, $y = 3$ and $x = 12$. So, $x \\cdot y = \\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to set up two equations based on the information given.\n\nLet's say the two numbers are x and y. We know that the difference between them is 9, so we can write the equation:\nx - y = 9\n\nWe also know that the sum of the squares of each number is 153, so we can write the equation:\nx^2 + y^2 = 153\n\nNow we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Once we have found the values of x and y, we can then find the product of the two numbers by multiplying them together.",
