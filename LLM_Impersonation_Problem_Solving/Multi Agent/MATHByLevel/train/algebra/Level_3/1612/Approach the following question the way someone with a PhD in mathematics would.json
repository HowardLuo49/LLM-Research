    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?",
    "solution": "If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional. Consequently, if I only work $\\frac{10}{12}=\\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week. $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\\boxed{24}$ hours a week.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first calculate how many hours I have lost due to being sick. Since I had planned to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks, the total number of hours I planned to work was $20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 240 \\text{ hours}$. The number of hours I lost due to being sick is $20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ hours}$. \n\nTherefore, the number of hours I still need to work to earn $\\$3000$ is $240 \\text{ hours} - 40 \\text{ hours} = 200 \\text{ hours}$.\n\nSince I have 10 weeks left in the summer after being sick, I will need to work $\\frac{200 \\text{ hours}}{10 \\text{ weeks}} = 20 \\text{ hours/week}$ for the rest of the summer in order to reach my goal of earning $\\$3000$ to buy the used car.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 24?: To solve this problem, we first calculate how many hours I have lost due to being sick. Since I had planned to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks, the total number of hours I planned to work was $20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 240 \\text{ hours}$. The number of hours I lost due to being sick is $20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 2 \\text{ weeks} = 40 \\text{ hours}$. \n\nTherefore, the number of hours I still need to work to earn $\\$3000$ is $240 \\text{ hours} - 40 \\text{ hours} = 200 \\text{ hours}$.\n\nSince I have 10 weeks left in the summer after being sick, I will need to work $\\frac{200 \\text{ hours}}{10 \\text{ weeks}} = 20 \\text{ hours/week}$ for the rest of the summer in order to reach my goal of earning $\\$3000$ to buy the used car.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. \n\nTo calculate the final solution, we need to determine how much money I will earn by working 20 hours per week for the remaining 10 weeks of the summer. This can be calculated as $20 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 10 \\text{ weeks} = 200 \\text{ hours}$. \n\nSince I earn $\\$15$ per hour, the total amount of money I will earn in those 10 weeks is $200 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$15/\\text{hour} = \\$3000$. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is indeed 3000, not 24.",
