    "solution": "The horizontal separation between $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $4-1=3$ units.  The vertical separation between the points is $7-1=6$ units.  Therefore, the segment whose endpoints are (1,1) and (4,7) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs measure 3 units and 6 units.  By the Pythagorean, the length of this segment is $\\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=3\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$, we can use the distance formula.\n\nThe distance formula is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.\n\nPlugging in the coordinates $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$:\n\n$\\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (7-1)^2}$\n\n$\\sqrt{3^2 + 6^2}$\n\n$\\sqrt{9 + 36}$\n\n$\\sqrt{45}$\n\nSo, the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}$.",
