    "solution": "The horizontal separation between $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $4-1=3$ units.  The vertical separation between the points is $7-1=6$ units.  Therefore, the segment whose endpoints are (1,1) and (4,7) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs measure 3 units and 6 units.  By the Pythagorean, the length of this segment is $\\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=3\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we have to find the difference between the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two points.\n\nThe difference in x-coordinates is $4 - 1 = 3$.\n\nThe difference in y-coordinates is $7 - 1 = 6$.\n\nNext, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the two points. The distance formula is $\\sqrt{(3)^2 + (6)^2}$.\n\nCalculating, we get $\\sqrt{9 + 36} = \\sqrt{45}$.\n\nSince $45$ can be simplified as $9 \\cdot 5$, we can simplify the square root to $\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}$.",
