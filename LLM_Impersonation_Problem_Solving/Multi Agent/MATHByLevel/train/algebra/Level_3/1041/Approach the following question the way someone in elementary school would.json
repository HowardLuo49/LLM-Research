    "solution": "Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $x^2-x-6=14 \\Rightarrow x^2-x-20=0$. Since in a quadratic  with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $1/1=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find all the possible values of x that make the equation $(x+2)(x-3)=14$ true. To do this, we need to expand the left side of the equation. \n\nFirst, we multiply the terms in the first set of parentheses: $x \\cdot x = x^2$.\n\nNext, we multiply the terms in the second set of parentheses: $-3 \\cdot x = -3x$.\n\nThen, we multiply the terms in the first and second set of parentheses: $x \\cdot -3 = -3x$.\n\nLastly, we multiply the terms in the second set of parentheses: $-3 \\cdot -3 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the expanded equation is: $x^2 - 3x + 2x - 6 = 14$.\n\nSimplify this equation: $x^2 - x - 6 = 14$.\n\nNow, we can solve for x. To find the possible values of x that make the equation true, we need to factor the quadratic equation.\n\n$(x-3)(x+2)=14$\n\nThis factorization leads to the solutions x = 3 and x = -2.\n\nTo find the sum of the possible values of x, we add them together: $3 + (-2) = 1$.\n\nSo, the sum of the possible values of x in the equation is 1.",
