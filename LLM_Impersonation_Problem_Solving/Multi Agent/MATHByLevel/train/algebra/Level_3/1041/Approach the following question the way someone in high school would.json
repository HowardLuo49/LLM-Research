    "solution": "Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $x^2-x-6=14 \\Rightarrow x^2-x-20=0$. Since in a quadratic  with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $1/1=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the possible values of x, we first need to expand the left side of the equation $(x+2)(x-3)$. \n\nWe can expand this by using the foil method: \n\n$(x+2)(x-3) = x^2 - 3x + 2x - 6$\n$= x^2 - x - 6$\n\nNow we have the equation $x^2 - x - 6 = 14$. To solve for x, we need to set this equation equal to 0 by subtracting 14 from both sides: \n\n$x^2 - x - 6 - 14 = 0$\n$x^2 - x - 20 = 0$\n\nNow we can factor this quadratic equation by finding two numbers that multiply to -20 and add up to -1. These numbers are -5 and 4.\nSo we can rewrite the equation as: \n\n$(x-5)(x+4) = 0$\n\nNow we can solve for x by setting each factor equal to 0: \n\n$x-5 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 5$\n$x+4 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -4$\n\nThe sum of the possible values of x is $5 + (-4) = 1$. \n\nSo the sum of the possible values of x is 1.",
