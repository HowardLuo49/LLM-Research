    "solution": "In this particular case, the fraction will be undefined only if its denominator is equal to zero. Because of this, we can ignore the numerator. We start by setting the binomial in the denominator equal to 0: \\begin{align*} 8x^2-65x+8=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (8x-1)(x-8)=0\n\\end{align*} We find that the two possible values for $x$ are $\\frac18$ and $8$. Since the question asks for the largest value, the final solution is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. To find the largest value of x that would make that expression not defined, we need to figure out when something in the expression would make it so we couldn't do math with it. \n\nSo, first we need to think about what would make that expression not defined. Usually, we can't divide by 0. So we need to figure out when the denominator, which is the bottom part of the fraction, would be 0. \n\nTo do that, we can set the denominator equal to 0 and solve for x. Let's try that. \n\n\\[8x^2 - 65x + 8 = 0\\]\n\nHmm, this looks like a tricky math problem. We might need some help from a grown-up to solve this equation. Let's ask someone for help so we can find the largest value of x that would make that expression not defined.",
