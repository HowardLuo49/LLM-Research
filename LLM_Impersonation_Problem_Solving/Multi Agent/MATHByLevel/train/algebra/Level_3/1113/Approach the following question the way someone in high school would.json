    "solution": "Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this quadratic is negative its linear coefficient, which is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(The above is true because if a quadratic has roots $r$ and $s$, we have $(x-r)(x-s) = x^2 - (r+s)+rs = 0$.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$, we first need to simplify the equation. \n\n$x^2-5x+5=9$\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n$x^2-5x-4=0$\n\nNow we need to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n$(x-4)(x+1)=0$\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives us the possible values of $x$:\n\n$x-4=0 \\Rightarrow x=4$\n\n$x+1=0 \\Rightarrow x=-1$\n\nThus, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation is $4 + (-1) = 3$.",
