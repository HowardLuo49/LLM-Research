    "solution": "Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this quadratic is negative its linear coefficient, which is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(The above is true because if a quadratic has roots $r$ and $s$, we have $(x-r)(x-s) = x^2 - (r+s)+rs = 0$.)",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! We have to find the values of $x$ that make the equation true. So, we need to add those values together to find the sum. Let's start by solving the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$. \n\nFirst, we need to bring all the terms to one side of the equation, so it looks like $x^2-5x+5-9=0$. \n\nThen, we simplify the equation to get $x^2-5x-4=0$.\n\nNext, we can factor the equation to get $(x-4)(x+1)=0$. \n\nSo, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x=4$ and $x=-1$. \n\nTo find the sum of these values, we just add them together. So, $4+(-1)=3$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$ is $3$.",
