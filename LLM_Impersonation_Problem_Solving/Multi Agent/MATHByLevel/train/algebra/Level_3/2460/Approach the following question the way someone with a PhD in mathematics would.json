    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Joann ate a total of 100 lollipops in five days. Each day after the first day she ate six more than she had eaten on the previous day. How many lollipops did she eat on the third day?",
    "solution": "Let the number of lollipops Joann ate on the first day be $a-12$, so she ate $a-6$ lollipops on the second day, $a$ on the third, and so on, eating $(a-12)+(5-1)\\cdot 6=a+12$ lollipops on the last day. The total number of lollipops is $5a$, which we are told is 100. Thus, $5a=100$ and $a=20$. Since $a$ is the number of lollipops Joann ate on the third day, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$ lollipops.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation representing the total number of lollipops Joann ate over the five days. Let x be the number of lollipops she ate on the first day. \n\nThe total number of lollipops she ate can be expressed as:\n\nx + (x + 6) + (x + 12) + (x + 18) + (x + 24) = 100\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n5x + 60 = 100\n5x = 40\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, Joann ate 8 lollipops on the first day, 8 + 6 = 14 on the second day, and 14 + 6 = 20 on the third day. So, Joann ate 20 lollipops on the third day.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 20?: To solve this problem, we can set up an equation representing the total number of lollipops Joann ate over the five days.
