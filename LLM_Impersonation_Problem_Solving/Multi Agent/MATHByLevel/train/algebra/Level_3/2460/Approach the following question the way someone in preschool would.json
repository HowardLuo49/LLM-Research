    "solution": "Let the number of lollipops Joann ate on the first day be $a-12$, so she ate $a-6$ lollipops on the second day, $a$ on the third, and so on, eating $(a-12)+(5-1)\\cdot 6=a+12$ lollipops on the last day. The total number of lollipops is $5a$, which we are told is 100. Thus, $5a=100$ and $a=20$. Since $a$ is the number of lollipops Joann ate on the third day, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$ lollipops.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! Joann ate some lollipops on the first day, then she ate 6 more each day after that. So on the second day she had eaten more than on the first day, and on the third day she ate even more than that! Let's use our counting fingers to figure it out.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 20?: Let's count together! Joann ate some lollipops on the first day, then she ate 6 more each day after that. So on the second day she had eaten more than on the first day, and on the third day she ate even more than that!
