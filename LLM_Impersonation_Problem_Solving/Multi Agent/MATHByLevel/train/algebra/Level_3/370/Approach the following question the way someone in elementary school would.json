    "solution": "Turning the division sign into multiplication and simplifying, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{2}{x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{4}&=.75 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{2}&=.75\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x}&=.25\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=\\boxed{4}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. First, we need to add $\\frac{1}{x}$ and $\\frac{2}{x}$ together, which gives us $\\frac{3}{x}$. Then we need to divide that by $\\frac{4}{x}$ which is the same as multiplying by $\\frac{x}{4}$. So now we have $\\frac{3}{x} \\times \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. And we know that equals 0.75. So, 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. Therefore, the value of x in this equation is 4. Ta-da!",
