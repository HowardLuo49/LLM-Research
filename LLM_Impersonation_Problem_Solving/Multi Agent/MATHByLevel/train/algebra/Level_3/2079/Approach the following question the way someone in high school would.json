    "solution": "Since $r$ and $s$ vary inversely, $r\\cdot s$ must be a constant.  Thus $1200\\cdot .35 = s \\cdot 2400 \\Rightarrow s = \\frac{.35}2 = \\boxed{.175}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we know that when two quantities vary inversely, their product remains constant. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n$r \\cdot s = k$\n\nwhere $k$ is the constant of variation. We are given that when $r = 1200,$ $s = 0.35,$ so we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n$1200 \\cdot 0.35 = k$\n\n$420 = k$\n\nNow, we can use this constant to find the value of $s$ when $r = 2400:$\n\n$2400 \\cdot s = 420$\n\n$s = \\frac{420}{2400}$\n\n$s \\approx 0.175$\n\nTherefore, when $r = 2400,$ $s \\approx 0.175$ which is the value of $s$ expressed as a decimal to the nearest thousandths.",
