    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Lulu has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+44$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Lulu is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. What is $b$?",
    "solution": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$, which has a constant term of $m^2+8$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2+8 = 44$, which yields the possibilities $m=6$ and $m=-6$.\n\nIf $m=6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2+12x+44$. If $m=-6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2-12x+44$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. Lulu has a special kind of math problem called a \"quadratic\" with the equation $x^2+bx+44$ and she wants to change it to a different form called a \"perfect square trinomial\" which looks like $(x+m)^2+8. I remember that to change a quadratic to a perfect square trinomial, we need to use a special formula called \"completing the square.\"\n\nSo, in Lulu's new form, we know that $b=2m$ because $2mx$ is in the middle of the perfect square trinomial. We also know that the constant term that was added to make the perfect square trinomial is $8$.\n\nSince $b$ is a specific positive number, we need to find two numbers that add up to $b$ and multiply to $44$ because the constant term in the original quadratic is $44$.\n\nLet's think about what numbers can add up to $b$ and multiply to $44. We know that $b$ must be $16$ because $16$ is positive and is the only pair of numbers that add up to $16$ and multiply to $44$. So, the number $b$ is $16$. Yay, we did it!",
