    "solution": "Converting the given information to equational form, we find $M(M-6) = -5$.  Rearranging, $M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0$.  Using Vieta's equations for sum and product of roots, we find that the sum of the solutions to this equations is $-(-6) = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break down the problem. We know that the product of a number $M$ and six less than $M$ is $-5$. So, we can write it as an equation:\n\n$M(M-6)=-5$\n\nNow, we need to solve this equation to find the possible values of $M$. Let's expand the left side of the equation:\n\n$M^2-6M=-5$\n\nNow, let's turn this into a quadratic equation by moving everything to one side:\n\n$M^2-6M+5=0$\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$M=\\frac{-(-6)\u00b1\\sqrt{(-6)^2-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}$\n\nSolving this gives us two possible values for $M$:\n\n$M=1$ or $M=5$\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of all possible values of $M$:\n\n$1+5=6$\n\nSo, the sum of all possible values of $M$ is $6$.",
