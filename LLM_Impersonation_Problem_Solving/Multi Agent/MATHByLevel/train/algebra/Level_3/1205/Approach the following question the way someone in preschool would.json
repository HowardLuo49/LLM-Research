    "solution": "We note that $\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 9^t} = 3 \\cdot 3^t$. The equation becomes: \\begin{align*}\n3 \\cdot 3^t + 3 \\cdot 3^t &= 18\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 6 \\cdot 3^t &= 18 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3^t &= 3.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $t = \\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! Let's see. We have $3 \\cdot 3^t + \\sqrt{9 \\cdot 9^t} = 18$. Hmm, I see $3 \\cdot 3^t$ is like $3$ groups of $3^t$, and $\\sqrt{9\\cdot 9^t}$ means we have to find the square root of $9$ times $9^t$. So if we simplify that part, we get $\\sqrt{81^t}$, which is just $9^t$. \n\nSo now our equation becomes $3 \\cdot 3^t + 9^t = 18$. This is like saying we have 3 apples and some more apples that we can't see, but altogether we have 18 apples. \n\nSince the apples are the same, we can say that $3^t + 3^t = 18$. That means $2\\cdot 3^t = 18$. Now if we divide both sides by 2, we get $3^t = 9$. And we know that $3$ to the power of what number gives us $9$? That's right, it's $2$. So t = 2. \n\nYay, we solved for t! Good job everyone!",
