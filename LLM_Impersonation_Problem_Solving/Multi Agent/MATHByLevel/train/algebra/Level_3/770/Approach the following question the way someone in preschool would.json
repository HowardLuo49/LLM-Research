    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",
    "gpt_response": "\"Alex has 12 friends! Wow, that's a lot of friends. And he has 63 coins, that's a big number too. But, let's see how many more coins he needs so he can give each friend at least one coin and make sure no two friends get the same number of coins.\n\nSo, if each friend gets one coin, that's 12 coins already gone. And we don't want any two friends to get the same number of coins. So, the next friend should get 2 coins, then the next friend should get 3 coins, and so on.\n\nLet's add up the coins so far: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12 = 78. So, Alex needs 78 coins to give each friend at least one coin and make sure no two friends get the same number of coins. Since he already has 63 coins, he needs 78 - 63 = 15 more coins. Alex needs 15 more coins.\"",
