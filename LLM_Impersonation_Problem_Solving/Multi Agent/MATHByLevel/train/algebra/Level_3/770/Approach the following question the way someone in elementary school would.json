    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many extra coins Alex needs, we should first think about how many different amounts of coins he can give to his friends. Since each friend needs at least 1 coin, the first friend can get 1 coin, the second friend can get 2 coins, the third friend can get 3 coins, and so on, until the twelfth friend gets 12 coins.\n\nTo find out how many different amounts of coins that is, we can add up the numbers from 1 to 12: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78.\n\nSo, Alex needs at least 78 coins to give each friend a different amount of coins. Since he already has 63 coins, he will need 15 more coins (78 - 63 = 15) to make sure each friend gets at least 1 coin and no two friends get the same amount.",
