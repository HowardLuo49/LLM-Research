    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Alex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",
    "solution": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the possible number of coins that Alex can give to each friend while still ensuring that no two friends receive the same number of coins.\n\nSince Alex has 12 friends, the possible number of coins he can give to each friend must be distinct positive integers that sum up to 63. Let's denote the number of coins given to each friend as x1, x2, ..., x12.\n\nTherefore, we have the following system of equations:\n\nx1 + x2 + ... + x12 = 63\nx1, x2, ..., x12 are distinct positive integers\n\nTo minimize the number of additional coins Alex needs, we need to find the solution where the difference between the largest and smallest numbers of coins given is minimized.\n\nIn this case, the minimum difference occurs when the coins are distributed in such a way that the friends receive consecutive integers starting from 1. Thus, the first friend receives 1 coin, the second friend receives 2 coins, and so on until the twelfth friend receives 12 coins.\n\nThe sum of the first 12 positive integers is given by the formula: n(n+1)/2, where n is the largest number of coins given to a friend. In this case, n is 12, so the sum of the first 12 positive integers is 12(12+1)/2 = 78.\n\nSince Alex only has 63 coins, he needs 78 - 63 = 15 additional coins to ensure that each friend receives at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins. Therefore, the minimum number of additional coins he needs is 15.",
