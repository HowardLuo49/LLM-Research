    "solution": "The greatest integer less than $-2.54$ is $-3$; the smallest integer greater than $25.4$ is $26$. So $\\lfloor -2.54 \\rfloor + \\lceil 25.4 \\rceil = -3+26=\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First we've got to figure out what those weird symbols mean. The squiggly \"lfloor\" with a number inside means the greatest integer less than or equal to that number, and the upside-down question mark \"lceil\" means the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number. So let's start by finding the greatest integer less than or equal to -2.54. That's -3. Then we need to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to 25.4. That's 26. Finally, we add -3 and 26 together to get 23. So, the answer is 23!",
