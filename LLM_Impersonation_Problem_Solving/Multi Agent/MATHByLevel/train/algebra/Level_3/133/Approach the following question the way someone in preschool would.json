    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's think about this together! We need to find the value of $2a + 1$, but first we need to solve the equation $6a^2 + 5a + 4 = 3$.

Hmmm... let's see... maybe we can break it down into $(3a + 1)(2a + 1)$. \n\nSo it looks like one of the solutions is $a = -\\frac{1}{3}$ or $a = -1/2$. Let's try $a = -1/2$:\n\n$2a + 1 = 2(-1/2) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0$\n\nSo the smallest possible value of $2a + 1$ is 0! Yay, we did it!",
