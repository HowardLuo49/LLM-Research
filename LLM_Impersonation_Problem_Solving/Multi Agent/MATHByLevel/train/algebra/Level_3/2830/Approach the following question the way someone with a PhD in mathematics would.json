    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "solution": "We see that we can rewrite the left side of the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35$ as $(2x - 7)(4x - 5)$, so we have $(2x - 7)(4x - 5) = 0$. Thus, solving the equations $2x - 7 = 0$ and $4x - 5 = 0$ gives us $x = 3.5$ and $x = 1.25$ as our solutions. Since $1.25 < 3.5$, our final answer is $x = \\boxed{1.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $8x^2 - 38x + 35 = 0$, we first need to solve the quadratic equation. By factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the equation are $x = 5/4$ and $x = 7/4$.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation, we choose the smaller root, which is $x = 5/4$. Therefore, the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 1.25$.",
