    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Find $x$ such that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x = \\dfrac{13}{3}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\\dfrac{1}{3}$. We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\dfrac{13}{3}$. Solving, we get $n=2$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down the equation. We know that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$. So, if $x = n + f$, where $n$ is an integer and $0 \\leq f < 1$, then $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = n$. \n\nNow let's substitute $x = n + f$ into the equation $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x = \\frac{13}{3}$:\n\n$n + n + f = \\frac{13}{3}$ \n\n$2n + f = \\frac{13}{3}$\n\n$2n = \\frac{13}{3} - f$\n\nBecause $n$ is an integer, the right side of the equation must be an integer.
