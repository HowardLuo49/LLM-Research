    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Find $x$ such that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x = \\dfrac{13}{3}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\\dfrac{1}{3}$. We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\dfrac{13}{3}$. Solving, we get $n=2$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{3}}$.",

The floor value of $2$ is $2$, the floor value of $2.5$ is $2$, and the floor value of $3$ is $3$.
