    "solution": "First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\\dfrac{1}{3}$. We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\dfrac{13}{3}$. Solving, we get $n=2$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{3}}$.",
