    "solution": "We have that $c=4d$, $b=2c$, and $a=3b$ and thus we can use the equations $c=4d$, $b=8d$, and $a=24d$ to find the value of the expression.  Plugging in these values we get $\\frac{24d \\cdot 4d}{8d \\cdot d}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by coloring some circles to help us understand the numbers. \n\nLet's draw 4 circles and label them as $d$. \n\nSince $c$ is four times $d$, we need to draw four groups of these $d$ circles for $c$. So let's draw 4 groups of 4 circles each, for a total of 16 circles, and label this group as $c$.\n\nSince $b$ is twice $c$, we need to draw two groups of the $c$ circles for $b$. So let's draw 2 groups of 16 circles each, for a total of 32 circles, and label this group as $b$.\n\nSince $a$ is three times $b$, we need to draw three groups of the $b$ circles for $a$. So let's draw 3 groups of 32 circles each, for a total of 96 circles, and label this group as $a$.\n\nNow, let's count how many circles are in each group:\n- $a$ has 96 circles\n- $b$ has 32 circles\n- $c$ has 16 circles\n- $d$ has 4 circles\n\nNow, let's find the value of $\\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}$:\n$\\frac{96 \\cdot 16}{32 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{1536}{128} = 12$\n\nSo, the value of $\\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}$ is 12.",
