    "solution": "If we multiply the second equation, the reciprocal of the first equation, and the reciprocal of the third equation, we get \\[\\frac{s}{r}\\cdot\\frac{r}{q}\\cdot \\frac{t}{s} = 6\\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\\cdot2\\Rightarrow \\frac{t}{q}= \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at what information we're given.\n\nWe know that $\\displaystyle\\frac{q}{r} = 9$, which means that the ratio of $\\displaystyle q$ to $\\displaystyle r$ is $\\displaystyle 9$. This means that if we divide the value of $\\displaystyle q$ by the value of $\\displaystyle r$, we will get $\\displaystyle 9$.\n\nWe also know that $\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{r} = 6$, which means that the ratio of $\\displaystyle s$ to $\\displaystyle r$ is $\\displaystyle 6$. This means that if we divide the value of $\\displaystyle s$ by the value of $\\displaystyle r$, we will get $\\displaystyle 6$.\n\nLastly, we know that $\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{t} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which means that the ratio of $\\displaystyle s$ to $\\displaystyle t$ is $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}$. This means that if we divide the value of $\\displaystyle s$ by the value of $\\displaystyle t$, we will get $\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe want to find $\\displaystyle\\frac{t}{q}$. To do this, we need to manipulate the equations we have to get $\\displaystyle t$ and $\\displaystyle q$ in terms of other variables. \n\nStarting with the equation $\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{t} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we can rearrange it to get $\\displaystyle s = \\frac{1}{2}t$.\n\nNext, we can use this to substitute $\\displaystyle s$ in the equation $\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{r} = 6$. This gives us $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}t}{r} = 6$, which simplifies to $\\displaystyle \\frac{t}{2r} = 6$.\n\nFrom this equation, we can find the value of $\\displaystyle r$ in terms of $\\displaystyle t$, which is $\\displaystyle r = \\frac{t}{12}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $\\displaystyle r$ and $\\displaystyle s$ into the equation $\\displaystyle\\frac{q}{r} = 9$ to get $\\displaystyle\\frac{q}{\\frac{t}{12}} = 9$, which simplifies to $\\displaystyle \\frac{12q}{t} = 9$. Multiplying both sides by $\\displaystyle\\frac{t}{12}$, we get $\\displaystyle q = \\frac{3t}{4}$.\n\nFinally, we can substitute $\\displaystyle q$ into the expression we want to find, $\\displaystyle\\frac{t}{q}$, to get $\\displaystyle\\frac{t}{\\frac{3t}{4}}$.
