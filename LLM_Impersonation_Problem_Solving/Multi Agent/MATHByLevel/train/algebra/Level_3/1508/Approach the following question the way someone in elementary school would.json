    "solution": "If we multiply the second equation, the reciprocal of the first equation, and the reciprocal of the third equation, we get \\[\\frac{s}{r}\\cdot\\frac{r}{q}\\cdot \\frac{t}{s} = 6\\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\\cdot2\\Rightarrow \\frac{t}{q}= \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at what we know. We know that $\\displaystyle \\frac{q}{r} = 9$ and $\\displaystyle \\frac{s}{r} = 6$. \n\nThat means $\\displaystyle q = 9r$ and $\\displaystyle s = 6r$. \n\nNext, we are given that $\\displaystyle \\frac{s}{t} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This means that $\\displaystyle s = \\frac{1}{2}t$. \n\nWe know from earlier that $\\displaystyle s = 6r$. We can set these two expressions for s equal to each other and solve for $\\displaystyle t$. \n\nThis gives us $\\displaystyle 6r = \\frac{1}{2}t$, so $\\displaystyle 12r = t$. \n\nFinally, we want to find $\\displaystyle \\frac{t}{q}$. \n\nNow that we know that $\\displaystyle t = 12r$ and $\\displaystyle q = 9r$, we can substitute them in to find: \n\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{t}{q} = \\frac{12r}{9r} = \\frac{4}{3}$. \n\nTherefore, $\\displaystyle \\frac{t}{q} = \\frac{4}{3}$.",
