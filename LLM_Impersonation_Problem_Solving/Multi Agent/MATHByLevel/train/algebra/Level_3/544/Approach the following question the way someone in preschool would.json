    "solution": "$y = 7$ represents a horizontal line that intersects a circle of radius $10$ around the origin. The symmetry of the circle guarantees that the points of intersection have a sum which add up to $0.$\n\nAlternatively, we can simply substitute $7$ into the second equation for $y,$ to get that $x^2 = 51.$ Then, the two possible values for $x$ are $\\sqrt{51},-\\sqrt{51}.$ It's clear that they add up to $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "gpt_response": "We need to find the two numbers that make $y = 7$ and $x^2+ y^2= 100$ true. \n\nFirst, we know that $y$ is equal to 7. So, $y=7.$\n\nNow we can substitute this into the second equation: $x^2+ (7)^2= 100.$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x^2+ 49= 100.$\n$x^2= 51.$\n\nSo the possible values for $x$ are $x = \\sqrt{51}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{51}.$\n\nTo find the sum of the solutions for $x$, we can add these two values together: $\\sqrt{51} + (-\\sqrt{51}) = 0.$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the solutions for $x$ is 0.",
