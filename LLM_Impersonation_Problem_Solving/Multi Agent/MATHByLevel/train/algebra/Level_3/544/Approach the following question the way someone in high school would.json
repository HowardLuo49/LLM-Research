    "solution": "$y = 7$ represents a horizontal line that intersects a circle of radius $10$ around the origin. The symmetry of the circle guarantees that the points of intersection have a sum which add up to $0.$\n\nAlternatively, we can simply substitute $7$ into the second equation for $y,$ to get that $x^2 = 51.$ Then, the two possible values for $x$ are $\\sqrt{51},-\\sqrt{51}.$ It's clear that they add up to $\\boxed{0}.$",
