    "solution": "Since $58=2\\cdot29$ and $203=7\\cdot29$, we can factor a $29x^5$ from the expression, to get $$58x^5-203x^{11}=\\boxed{-29x^5(7x^6-2)}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To factor $58x^5-203x^{11}$, first we need to find the greatest common factor of the two terms. The greatest common factor is $x^5$. \n\nNow we divide each term by the greatest common factor:\n\n$58x^5 / x^5 = 58$\n\n$203x^{11} / x^5 = 203x^6$\n\nSo, when we factor out the greatest common factor $x^5$, we get:\n\n$58x^5-203x^{11} = x^5(58-203x^6)$\n\nTherefore, $58x^5-203x^{11}$ can be factored as $x^5(58-203x^6)$.",
