    "solution": "Since $58=2\\cdot29$ and $203=7\\cdot29$, we can factor a $29x^5$ from the expression, to get $$58x^5-203x^{11}=\\boxed{-29x^5(7x^6-2)}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's look at the numbers first. We have 58 and 203. What numbers can we multiply to get 58? Hmm... 2 and 29! And for 203, we can use 7 and 29!\nNow let's look at the x's. We have x^5 and x^11. We can take out some x's. Let's see... we can take out x^5!\n\nSo the factored form of 58x^5-203x^11 is 29x^5(2-7x^6).",
