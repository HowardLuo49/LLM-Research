    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A motel bills its customers by charging a flat fee for the first night and then adding on a fixed amount for every night thereafter. If it costs George $\\$155$ to stay in the motel for 3 nights and Noah $\\$290$ to stay in the motel for 6 nights, how much is the flat fee for the first night?",
    "solution": "Let $f$ be the flat fee for the first night and $n$ be the fixed fee for each night thereafter. Notice that the first night is incorporated into the flat fee. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf + 2n &= 155 \\\\\nf + 5n &= 290 \\\\\n\\end{align*}It's easiest to eliminate $f,$ solve for $n$ and then solve for $f$ using that value. To solve for $n$, subtract the first equation from the second, obtaining $3n = 135$, or $n = 45$. Substitute for $n$ in the first equation to obtain $f = 155 - 90$, or $f = 65$. Thus, the flat fee for the first night is $\\boxed{\\$65}$.",

The motel charges a flat fee for the first night and then adds on more money for each night after that. \n\nGeorge stayed for 3 nights and paid $\\$155$, while Noah stayed for 6 nights and paid $\\$290$. \n\nTo find out how much the flat fee is, we need to figure out how much extra money Noah paid for staying 3 more nights than George. \n\nIf we subtract George's total cost from Noah's total cost, we find that Noah paid $\\$135$ more for staying 3 extra nights. \n\nSince we know that each extra night costs the same amount, we can divide $\\$135$ by 3 to find out how much it costs per night. \n\nSo, the flat fee for the first night is $\\$45$.
