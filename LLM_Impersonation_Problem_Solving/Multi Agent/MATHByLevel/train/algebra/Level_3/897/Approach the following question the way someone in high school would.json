    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Suppose $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are polynomials in $z$, and the degree of $g(z)$ is less than the degree of $f(z)$.  If the degree of $f(z)$ is two, what is the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$?",
    "solution": "We have $f(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+a_1 \\cdot z+a_0$, and $g(z)=b_1 \\cdot z+b_0$, where $a_2$ is nonzero.  Then $f(z)+g(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+(a_1+b_1) \\cdot z+(a_0+b_0)$.  The degree of this polynomial is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so if $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree two, that means it can be written as $f(z) = az^2 + bz + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and $a$ is not equal to zero. \n\nSince the degree of $g(z)$ is less than the degree of $f(z)$, that means $g(z)$ can be written as $g(z) = dz + e$, where $d$ and $e$ are constants.\n\nNow, to find the degree of $f(z) + g(z)$, we add $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ together:\n\n$f(z) + g(z) = (az^2 + bz + c) + (dz + e)$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$f(z) + g(z) = az^2 + (b + d)z + (c + e)$\n\nSo, the degree of $f(z) + g(z)$ is $\\boxed{2}$, since the highest power of $z$ is still squared.",
