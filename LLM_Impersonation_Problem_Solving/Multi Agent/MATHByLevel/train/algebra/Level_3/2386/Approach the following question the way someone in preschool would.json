    "solution": "We can find $x$ by taking four times the second equation plus the first:\n\n$4(7x+y)+(9x-4y)=28x+9x=37x=4(17)+6=74\\implies x=2$.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we can find $y$:\n\n$7x+y=17\\implies y=17-7x=17-7(2)=3$.\n\nThus our answer is $\\boxed{(2,3)}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! To find the intersection of the lines, we can pretend we have two trains. One train is following the path $9x-4y=6$ and the other train is following the path $7x+y=17$. We need to figure out where these two trains meet!\n\nFirst, let's use our magic crayons to solve the system of equations! We'll start by solving $9x-4y=6$ and $7x+y=17$.\n\nFirst we need to find $y$ in terms of $x$ by solving $7x+y=17$ for $y$: $y=17-7x$. Next, we can plug in $y$ into the first equation $9x-4y=6$: $9x-4(17-7x)=6$. Simplifying this, we get $9x-68+28x=6$. Combining like terms, we have $37x-68=6$. Adding $68$ to both sides gives $37x=74$, so $x=2$.\n\nNow that we know $x=2$, let's plug that back into either of the equations to solve for $y$. Let's use $y=17-7x$: $y=17-7(2)=17-14=3$.\n\nSo, the intersection point is $(2, 3)$. Yay, we found where the trains met on the magical crayon tracks! Great job, friends!",
