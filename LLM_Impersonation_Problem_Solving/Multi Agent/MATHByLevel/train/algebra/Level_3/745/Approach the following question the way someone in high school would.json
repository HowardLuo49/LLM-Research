    "solution": "This is a finite geometric series with first term 1, common ratio 2 and 11 terms. Thus the sum is: $$\\frac{1(1-2^{11})}{1-2} = \\frac{1-2^{11}}{-1} = 2^{11}-1 = 2048-1 = \\boxed{2047}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of $1+2+4+8+16+ \\cdots + 1024$, we can see that each term is being multiplied by 2.
