    "solution": "Inputting $f^{-1}(x)$ into $f$, we have $f(f^{-1}(x)) =4f^{-1}(x) + 5$, so $x = 4f^{-1}(x) + 5$.  Solving this equation for $f^{-1}(x)$, we get that $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x-5}{4}$. Thus, we have  \\begin{align*}\nf^{-1}(f^{-1}(9)) & = f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{9-5}{4}\\right) \\\\\n& = f^{-1}(1) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1-5}{4} \\\\\n& = \\boxed{-1}.\n\\end{align*}",
