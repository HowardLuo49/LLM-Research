    "solution": "Since $\\sqrt{9}<\\sqrt{12}<\\sqrt{16}$, or, equivalently $3<\\sqrt{12}<4$, the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\sqrt{12}$ must be $3$. Thus, $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{12}}\\rfloor^2=3^2=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to find the square root of 12. The square root of 12 is between 3 and 4 because 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. \n\nSince the square root of 12 is between 3 and 4, the greatest integer that is less than or equal to the square root of 12 is 3. \n\nSo, 3 squared is 9. Therefore, $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{12}}\\rfloor^2$ is equal to 9.",
