    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's calculate the late charge added after the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past due. Since the late charge is $1\\%$, we can find it by doing: \n\n$\\$400 \\times 1\\% = \\$4$\n\nSo, after 30 days past due, the total bill is $\\$400 + \\$4 = \\$404$. \n\nThen, the total bill was increased by another $1\\%$ after another 30 days. Again, we can find this additional charge by doing: \n\n$\\$404 \\times 1\\% = \\$4.04$\n\nTherefore, the final total bill after 60 days past due is $\\$404 + \\$4.04 = \\$408.04$. \n\nSo, Jenna's bill now is $\\$408.04$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 408.04?: First, let's calculate the late charge added after the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past due. Since the late charge is $1\\%$, we can find it by doing: \n\n$\\$400 \\times 1\\% = \\$4$\n\nSo, after 30 days past due, the total bill is $\\$400 + \\$4 = \\$404$. \n\nThen, the total bill was increased by another $1\\%$ after another 30 days.
