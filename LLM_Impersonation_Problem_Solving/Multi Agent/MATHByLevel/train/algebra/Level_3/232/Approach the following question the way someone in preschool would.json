    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Jenna's bill was $\\$400$. She was late paying it, so they added a 1$\\%$ late charge after 30 days. That means they added $\\$4$ because 1$\\%$ of $\\$400$ is $\\$4$. So now her total bill is $\\$404$. But then Jenna didn't pay the bill for another 30 days, so they added another 1$\\%$. That means they added $\\$4.04$ because 1$\\%$ of $\\$404$ is $\\$4.04$. So now her final bill is $\\$408.04$. Tada!",
