    "solution": "First, we find $p(1,-1)$. Since it falls into the otherwise category, $p(1,-1) = 3 \\cdot 1 - 1 = 2$.\n\nNext, we find $p(-5,-2)$. Since both numbers are negative, it follows that $p(-5,-2) = -5 - 2(-2) = -1$.\n\nThus, $p(p(1,-1),p(-5,-2)) = p(2,-1)$. This again falls into the otherwise category, and we find that $p(2,-1) = 3 \\cdot 2 - 1 = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! First, let's figure out what $p(1, -1)$ is. Since 1 is greater than or equal to 0 and -1 is less than 0, we use the formula where $p(x, y) = x - 2y$. So, $p(1, -1) = 1 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nNext, let's find $p(-5, -2)$. Since both numbers are less than 0, we use the formula $p(x, y) = x - 2y$. This means $p(-5, -2) = -5 - 2(-2) = -5 + 4 = -1$.\n\nNow, we need to find $p(3, -1)$. Since 3 is greater than 0 and -1 is less than 0, we use the formula $p(x, y) = x - 2y$. So, $p(3, -1) = 3 - 2(-1) = 3 + 2 = 5$.\n\nTherefore, $p(p(1, -1), p(-5, -2)) = p(3, -1) = 5$. So, the answer is 5! Yay!",
