    "solution": "Since $f(n)=n^2$ is a monotonically increasing function (on the set of positive integers), we can find the least and greatest integer solutions and count the integers between them.  Since $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225$, $n=15$ is the smallest solution.  Since $30^2=900$, $n=29$ is the largest solution.  There are $29-15+1=\\boxed{15}$ integers between 15 and 29 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers $n$ that satisfy the inequality $200 < n^2 < 900$, we can first find the range of possible values for $n$. Since the square of a positive integer is always positive, we know that $n^2 > 0$ for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, we can rewrite the given inequality as $0 < n^2 < 900$.\n\nNext, we find the square roots of both sides of the inequality to determine the range of values for $n$. Taking the square root of each side, we get $0 < n < 30$. This means that $n$ can take on any positive integer value from 1 to 29.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the restriction that $n$ must be an integer. Since $n$ must be an integer, we need to find the integers in the range $1 < n < 29$ that satisfy the given inequality. \n\nWe can quickly determine that the positive integers $n$ that satisfy the inequality $200 < n^2 < 900$ are $n = 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28$. \n\nTherefore, there are 14 positive integers $n$ that satisfy the inequality $200 < n^2 < 900$.",
