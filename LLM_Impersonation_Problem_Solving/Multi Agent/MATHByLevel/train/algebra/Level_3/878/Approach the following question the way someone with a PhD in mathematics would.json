    "solution": "The two lines have equations \\[\ny -15=3(x-10)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad y -15=5(x-10).\n\\]The $x$-intercepts, obtained by setting $y=0$ in the respective equations, are 5 and 7.  The distance between the  points $(5,0)$ and $(7,0)$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the distance between the $x$-intercepts of the two lines, we first need to determine the $y$-intercepts of each line. \n\nLet the equations of the lines be $y = 3x + b_1$ and $y = 5x + b_2$. Since both lines pass through the point $(10, 15)$, we can substitute these values into the equations to find the values of $b_1$ and $b_2$. \n\nSubstituting $(10, 15)$ into the first equation, we get $15 = 3(10) + b_1$, which gives us $b_1 = -5$. Substituting $(10, 15)$ into the second equation, we get $15 = 5(10) + b_2$, which gives us $b_2 = -35$. \n\nNow, to find the $x$-intercept of each line, we set $y = 0$ in the equations. For the first line, we have $0 = 3x - 5$, which gives us $x_1 = \\frac{5}{3}$. For the second line, we have $0 = 5x - 35$, which gives us $x_2 = 7$. \n\nThe distance between the $x$-intercepts of the two lines can be found by taking the absolute difference of the two intercepts: $|x_1 - x_2| = |7 - \\frac{5}{3}| = \\frac{16}{3}$. \n\nTherefore, the distance between the $x$-intercepts of the two lines is $\\frac{16}{3}$.",
