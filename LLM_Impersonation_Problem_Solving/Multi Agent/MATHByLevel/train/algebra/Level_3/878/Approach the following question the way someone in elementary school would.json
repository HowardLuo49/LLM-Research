    "solution": "The two lines have equations \\[\ny -15=3(x-10)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad y -15=5(x-10).\n\\]The $x$-intercepts, obtained by setting $y=0$ in the respective equations, are 5 and 7.  The distance between the  points $(5,0)$ and $(7,0)$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find the equations of the two lines. We know that the line with slope 3 intersects point (10,15), so we can use the point-slope form of the equation which is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is the point. Plugging in the values we have, the equation of this line is $y - 15 = 3(x - 10)$.\n\nNext, we'll find the equation of the other line with slope 5. Using the same point-slope form with the point (10,15), the equation of this line is $y - 15 = 5(x - 10)$.\n\nTo find the $x$-intercepts, we set $y = 0$ in each equation and solve for $x$. For the line with slope 3, we get $0 - 15 = 3(x - 10) \\Rightarrow -15 = 3x - 30 \\Rightarrow x = 5$. For the line with slope 5, we get $0 - 15 = 5(x - 10) \\Rightarrow -15 = 5x - 50 \\Rightarrow x = 7$.\n\nFinally, we find the distance between these two $x$-intercepts, which is $7 - 5 = 2$. So, the distance between the $x$-intercepts of these two lines is 2.\n\nSo, the distance between the two $x$-intercepts is 2. Yay!",
