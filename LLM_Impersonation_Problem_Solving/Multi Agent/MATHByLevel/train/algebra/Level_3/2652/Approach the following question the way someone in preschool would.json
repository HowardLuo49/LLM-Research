    "solution": "We could substitute $(-21-\\sqrt{301})/10$ for $x$ in the equation, but the quadratic formula suggests a quicker approach. Substituting $5$, $21$, and $v$ into the quadratic formula gives  \\[\n\\frac{-(21)\\pm\\sqrt{(21)^2-4(5)(v)}}{2(5)}= \\frac{-21\\pm\\sqrt{441-20v}}{10}.\n\\]Setting $(-21+\\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ and $(-21-\\sqrt{441-20v})/10$ equal to $(-21-\\sqrt{301})/10$, we find no solution in the first case and $441-20v=301$ in the second case.  Solving yields $v=(301-441)/(-20)=(-140)/(-20)=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's try to find the number that makes this problem work. We have a big icky number in the square root, so let's see if we can make it simpler by using our magic math powers. If we try to rewrite $\\sqrt{301}$ as a different number times itself, maybe we can make it easier to work with. Let's try to find a number that when multiplied by itself equals $301$. \n\nHmm...let's see...what number could it be? Oh! I know! I think it might be $17$, because $17 \\times 17 = 289$ and that's sort of close to $301$! So, let's try rewriting $\\sqrt{301}$ as $\\sqrt{17} \\times \\sqrt{19}$.\n\nNow that we have that figured out, let's plug in our new number for $\\sqrt{301}$ and see what happens. So the expression becomes \n\n$$\\frac{-21-\\sqrt{17} \\times \\sqrt{19}}{10}$$\n\nand we want to find the value of $v$ that makes this answer the root of $5x^2+21x+v$. Since this is a bit hard for me to solve all at once, let's take it one step at a time. We can rewrite it as:\n\n$$\\frac{-21 -\\sqrt{17} \\times \\sqrt{19}}{10} = \\frac{-21}{10} - \\frac{\\sqrt{17} \\times \\sqrt{19}}{10}$$\n\nNow, let's think about $5x^2+21x+v$. Since we know our answer is $\\frac{-21}{10} - \\frac{\\sqrt{17} \\times \\sqrt{19}}{10}$ we can plug that in to see if it makes the equation true. \n\nGreat job! You're doing awesome! Let's keep going to find the answer!",
