    "solution": "We have $i^6 = i^4\\cdot i^2 = 1\\cdot (-1) = -1$.  We also have $i^{16} = (i^4)^4 = 1^4 =1$, and $i^{-26} = 1/i^{26} = 1/(i^{24}\\cdot i^2) = 1/[1\\cdot (-1)] = -1$. So, adding these three results gives $i^6 + i^{16} + i^{-26} = -1+1-1 = \\boxed{-1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding out what $i$ is. $i$ is a special number that represents the square root of -1. When we multiply $i$ by itself, we get $-1$.\n\nNow, let's look at the question. We need to evaluate $i^6+i^{16}+i^{-26}$. To do that, we need to multiply $i$ by itself multiple times.\n\n$i^6$ means we multiply $i$ by itself 6 times. So, $i^6 = i * i * i * i * i * i = -1$.\n\n$i^{16}$ means we multiply $i$ by itself 16 times. So, $i^{16} = i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i = 1$.\n\n$i^{-26}$ means we multiply $i$ by itself 26 times but in the opposite direction. So, $i^{-26} = 1 / (i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i * i) = -1$.\n\nNow, we can add them all up: $-1 + 1 + (-1) = -1$.\n\nSo, $i^6+i^{16}+i^{-26} = -1$.",
