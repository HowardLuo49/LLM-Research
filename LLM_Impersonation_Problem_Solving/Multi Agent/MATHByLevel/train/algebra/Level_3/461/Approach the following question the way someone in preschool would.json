    "solution": "We can find the roots of this equation by factoring the quadratic as $(x + 18)(x - 3) = 0$. This gives us the solutions $x = -18$ or $x = 3$. We want the greater solution, so our answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",

We can solve this by using our ABCs or by drawing pictures of circles and squares. The solution to the problem is when x is either -6 or 9. Now we can see that 9 is greater than -6, so 9 is the greater solution to the equation! Yay, we did it!",
