So let's start by putting some blocks together in a row, like this:\n\n1003 + 997 + 1001 + 999 = ?\n\nNow let's see, I know that 1003 is 3 more than 1000, and 997 is 3 less than 1000, so they can cancel each other out. Same with 1001 and 999. So the answer is just the middle number, which is 1003 + 997! \n\nSo $1003^2-997^2-1001^2+999^2$ is 1003 + 997 = 2000!",
