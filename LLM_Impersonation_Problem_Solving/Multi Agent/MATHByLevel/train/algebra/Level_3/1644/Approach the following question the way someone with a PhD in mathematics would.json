    "solution": "First we solve for $x$. Converting our logarithm to exponential form gives $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=x-4$. We know $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5$, so we have $5=x-4$ or $x=9$. Then we must find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3}$ where $x=9$. Let $\\log_{9}{3}=a$. Then $9^a=3$. Since $9=3^2$ we have $3^{2a}=3^1$ so $2a=1$ or $a=\\frac{1}{2}$. We want to find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{9}3}=\\frac{1}{a}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given $\\log_{25}(x-4)=\\frac{1}{2}$, we can rewrite this as $25^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x-4$. Simplifying the left-hand side gives $5=x-4$, which implies $x=9$. \n\nNow, we need to find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3}$. We know that $\\log_{x}(3)=\\frac{1}{\\log_{3}(x)}$. Since $x=9$, $\\log_{9}(3)=\\frac{1}{\\log_{3}(9)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2$.",
