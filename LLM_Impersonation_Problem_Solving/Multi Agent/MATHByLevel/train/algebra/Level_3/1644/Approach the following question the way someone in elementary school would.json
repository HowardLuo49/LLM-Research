    "solution": "First we solve for $x$. Converting our logarithm to exponential form gives $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=x-4$. We know $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{25}=5$, so we have $5=x-4$ or $x=9$. Then we must find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3}$ where $x=9$. Let $\\log_{9}{3}=a$. Then $9^a=3$. Since $9=3^2$ we have $3^{2a}=3^1$ so $2a=1$ or $a=\\frac{1}{2}$. We want to find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{9}3}=\\frac{1}{a}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by figuring out what $x$ is. Since $\\log_{25}(x-4)=\\frac{1}{2}$, we can rewrite it as $25^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x-4$. Since $25^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ is the same as $\\sqrt{25}$, we get $5=x-4$. Adding 4 to both sides, we find that $x=9$.\n\nNow we need to find $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3}$. Since $x=9$, we can rewrite it as $\\frac{1}{\\log_{9}3}$. Since $\\log_{9}3$ is asking what power we need to raise 9 to get 3, we can rewrite this as $3^{\\frac{1}{2}}$. This simplifies to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{\\log_{x}3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$.",
