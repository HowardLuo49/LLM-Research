    "solution": "Let the two integers be $n$ and $n + 1,$ so $n(n + 1) < 400.$  Then the largest possible value of $n$ will be close to the square root of 400, which is $\\sqrt{400} = 20.$  For $n = 19,$ $n(n + 1) = 19 \\cdot 20 = 380,$ and for $n = 20,$ $n(n + 1) = 20 \\cdot 21 = 420,$ so the largest possible sum of two consecutive integers whose product is less than 400 is $19 + 20 = \\boxed{39}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let x and x+1 be the two consecutive integers. The product of these two integers is x(x+1) = x^2 + x. We are interested in finding the greatest possible sum of these two integers subject to the condition that their product is less than 400.\n\nSince we have the constraint x^2 + x < 400, we can set up the inequality:\n\nx^2 + x < 400\n\nRewriting this inequality in standard form:\n\nx^2 + x - 400 < 0\n\nTo find the maximum sum of the two consecutive integers, we need to analyze the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 400 = 0. The roots can be found using the quadratic formula: \n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nWhere a = 1, b = 1, and c = -400 in this case. Calculating this, we obtain:\n\nx \u2248 19.3007 or x \u2248 -20.8007\n\nSince x must be a positive integer, the largest possible value for x is 19. Therefore, the two consecutive integers are 19 and 20. \n\nThe greatest possible sum of these two consecutive integers is:\n19 + 20 = 39\n\nThus, the greatest possible sum of two consecutive integers whose product is less than 400 is 39.",
