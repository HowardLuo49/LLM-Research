    "solution": "We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form.  Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x +4$.  So, the slope is $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the slope of the line, we can use the formula y = mx + b. First, let's make the equation look like that by solving for y:\n\n5y = -3x + 20\ny = (-3/5)x + 4\n\nNow we see that the slope is -3/5.",
