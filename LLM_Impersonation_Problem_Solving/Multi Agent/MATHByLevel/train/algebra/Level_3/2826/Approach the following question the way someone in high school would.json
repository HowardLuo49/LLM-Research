    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The sum of 49 consecutive integers is $7^5$. What is their median?",
    "solution": "The sum of a set of integers is the product of the mean of the integers and the number of integers, and the median of a set of consecutive integers is the same as the mean. So the median must be $7^5/49=7^3$, or $\\boxed{343}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that the sum of the 49 consecutive integers is $7^5$, which is 16,807. To find the median, we first need to find the middle number in the sequence. Since there are 49 numbers, the middle number will be the 25th number.\n\nTo find the middle number, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S = (n/2)(first term + last term), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, and the first and last terms are the first and last numbers in the sequence.\n\nPlugging in our values, we have 16,807 = (49/2)(first term + last term). Since we know the sum of the sequence is 16,807, we can simplify this equation to 16,807 = 24(first term + last term).\n\nNow, we know that the terms are consecutive integers, so the difference between any two consecutive integers is 1. This means that for the 25th number (our middle number), the number before it will be 24 less and the number after it will be 24 more.\n\nIf we let our middle number be x, then the sum of the middle number and the number before it will be x + (x-1) = 2x - 1, and the sum of the middle number and the number after it will be x + (x+1) = 2x + 1.\n\nNow we know that 2x - 1 + 2x + 1 = 16,807. Simplifying this equation, we get 4x = 16,807. Solving for x, we find that x = 4,201.\n\nTherefore, the median of the 49 consecutive integers is 4,201.",
