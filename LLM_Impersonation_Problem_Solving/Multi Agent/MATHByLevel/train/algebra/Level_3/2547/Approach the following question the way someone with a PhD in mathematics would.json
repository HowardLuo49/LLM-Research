    "solution": "We will complete the square for $y^2 + 10y + 33.$\n\nThe binomial to be squared will be of the form $y+a$ because the coefficient of $y^2$ is 1. By squaring the binomial, we get $y^2+2ay+a^2$. We want $2ay$ to be equal to $10y$, therefore $a=5$. $(y+5)^2=y^2+10y+25$.\n\n$y^2+10y+33=(y^2+10y+25)+8=(y+5)^2+8$. Therefore, the binomial is $y+5$ and the integer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express the given expression $y^2+10y+33$ as a combination of a square of a binomial and an integer, we need to identify whether it can be factored into the form $(y+a)^2 + b$ for some values of $a$ and $b$. \n\nExpanding $(y+a)^2$ gives $y^2 + 2ay + a^2$. Comparing this to the given expression $y^2 + 10y + 33$, we see that $2a = 10$ which implies $a = 5$. Substituting $a=5$ back into the expanded form, we get $(y+5)^2 = y^2 + 10y + 25$.\n\nTherefore, the expression $y^2 + 10y + 33$ can be written as $(y+5)^2 + 8$, where the integer is 8.",
