    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The expression $y^2+10y+33$ can be written as a combination of a square of a binomial and an integer. Find the integer.",
    "solution": "We will complete the square for $y^2 + 10y + 33.$\n\nThe binomial to be squared will be of the form $y+a$ because the coefficient of $y^2$ is 1. By squaring the binomial, we get $y^2+2ay+a^2$. We want $2ay$ to be equal to $10y$, therefore $a=5$. $(y+5)^2=y^2+10y+25$.\n\n$y^2+10y+33=(y^2+10y+25)+8=(y+5)^2+8$. Therefore, the binomial is $y+5$ and the integer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To write the expression as a square of a binomial, we need to find two numbers that add to $10$ and multiply to $33$. The numbers that satisfy this are $6$ and $5$ because $6+5=11$ and $6 \\times 5 = 30$. Since we want the product to be positive $33$, we can adjust the numbers to $6$ and $5$.\n\nTherefore, we can write $y^2 + 10y + 33$ as $(y+6)^2 - 1$. So, the integer in the expression is $-1$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: To write the expression as a square of a binomial, we need to find two numbers that add to $10$ and multiply to $33$.
