    "solution": "Since the two lines intersect at $(6,10)$, each must pass through that point.  So, we can substitute this point for $x$ and $y$ in the two given equations, then solve for $m$ and $b$.  In the first equation we find: \\begin{align*}\n10&=m(6)+4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6&=6m\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1&=m\n\\end{align*} Using the same method in the second equation gives: \\begin{align*}\n10&=3(6)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 10&=18+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -8&=b\n\\end{align*} The value of $b+m$ is equal to $1+(-8)=\\boxed{-7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let's see. We have two lines that cross each other at a special spot. The first line goes up and down but starts at 4. The other line goes up a bit faster and starts at a mystery number b. Where they meet, the people who know lots of math say it's at the spot (6, 10). So, if we add the starting number of the second line (which is b) to the speed of the first line (which is m), we get... umm... 13! So, b + m equals 13. Yay, we did it!",
