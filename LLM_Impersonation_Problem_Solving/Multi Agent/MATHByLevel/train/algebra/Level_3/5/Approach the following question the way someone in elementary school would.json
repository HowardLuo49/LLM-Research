    "solution": "The given expression is undefined when the denominator is zero. Thus, we want to find the sum of the zeros $y$ to the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$. Since for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the zeros of the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$ is $5/1=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the values of $y$ that make the expression undefined, we need to see where the denominator equals 0. \n\nThe denominator $y^2-5y+4$ can be factored into $(y-4)(y-1)$. So the expression is undefined when $y-4=0$ or $y-1=0$. \n\nThis means the expression is undefined when $y=4$ or $y=1$. \n\nTo find the sum of these values, we add them together: $4+1=5$. \n\nSo, the sum of all values of $y$ for which the expression is undefined is 5.",
