    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, $d + e = -\\frac{3}{2}$ and $de = -\\frac{5}{2},$ so\n\\[(d - 1)(e - 1) = de - (d + e) + 1 = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 1 = \\boxed{0}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the solutions of the equation $2x^{2}+3x-5=0$. Let's use our math skills to solve it! Let's see... we can factor this equation into $(2x-1)(x+5)=0$. So the solutions are $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $x=-5$. \n\nNow let's find the value of $(d-1)(e-2)$. Since $d$ is one solution and $e$ is the other solution, we can substitute them into the expression. \n\nLet's start with $d-1$. So $d=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $d-1=\\frac{1}{2}-1=-\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nNow let's look at $e-1$. So $e=-5$, and $e-1=-5-1=-6$. \n\nFinally, let's multiply these two values together. $(-\\frac{1}{2})(-6)=3$. \n\nSo the value of $(d-1)(e-1)$ is 3. Yay, we did it!",
