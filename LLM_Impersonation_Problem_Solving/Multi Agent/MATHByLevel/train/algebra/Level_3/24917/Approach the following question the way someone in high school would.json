    "solution": "The slope of a line is $\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. In this case, there is no vertical difference between points $A$ and $B$, so the line is simply a horizontal line with a slope of 0. Since the line is a horizontal line, its $y$-intercept equals the $y$-coordinate of all the other points on the line, 13. So, the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the slope of the line containing points $A$ and $B$. Since the $y$-coordinates are the same, the line is horizontal and the slope is 0. \n\nNow, let's find the $y$-intercept of the line containing points $A$ and $B$. We know that the line passes through $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, which in this case are points $A$ and $B$. Since both points have a $y$-coordinate of 13, the $y$-intercept of the line is also 13. \n\nFinally, the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept is $0 + 13 = 13$. So, the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept of the line containing both points $A$ and $B$ is 13.",
