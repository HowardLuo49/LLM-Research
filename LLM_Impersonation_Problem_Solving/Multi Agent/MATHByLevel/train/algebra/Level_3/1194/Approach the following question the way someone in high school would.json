    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. You have a whole pizza in the refrigerator. On your first trip to the refrigerator, you eat half the pizza. On each successive trip, you eat half of the remaining pizza. After five trips to the refrigerator, what fractional part of the pizza have you eaten?",
    "solution": "On the second, third, fourth, and fifth trips, you eat $\\frac1{2^2}$, $\\frac1{2^3}$, $\\frac1{2^4}$, and $\\frac1{2^5}$ of the pizza, respectively. The total portion of the pizza eaten is the geometric series \\begin{align*}\n\\frac12+\\frac1{2^2}+\\frac1{2^3}+\\frac1{2^4}+\\frac1{2^5} &= \\frac{\\frac12\\left(1-\\left(\\frac12\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac12}\\\\\n&=1-\\left(\\frac12\\right)^5\\\\\n&=1-\\frac1{32}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{31}{32}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so on the first trip I ate half the pizza, which means I have half left. On the second trip, I eat half of what's left, so I eat a quarter of the original pizza. On the third trip, I eat half of what's left again, so I eat an eighth of the original pizza. Then on the fourth trip, I eat half of what's left, which is a sixteenth. Finally, on the fifth trip, I eat half of what's left, which is a thirty-second. \n\nSo, after five trips to the refrigerator, I have eaten:\n\n1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 = 31/32 \n\nSo, I have eaten 31/32 of the original pizza.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\frac{31?: Ok, so on the first trip I ate half the pizza, which means I have half left. On the second trip, I eat half of what's left, so I eat a quarter of the original pizza. On the third trip, I eat half of what's left again, so I eat an eighth of the original pizza.
