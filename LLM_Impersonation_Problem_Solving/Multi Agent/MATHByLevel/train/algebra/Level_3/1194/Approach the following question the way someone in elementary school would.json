On your first trip to the refrigerator, you eat half the pizza. On each successive trip, you eat half of the remaining pizza. After five trips to the refrigerator, what fractional part of the pizza have you eaten?",
    "solution": "On the second, third, fourth, and fifth trips, you eat $\\frac1{2^2}$, $\\frac1{2^3}$, $\\frac1{2^4}$, and $\\frac1{2^5}$ of the pizza, respectively. The total portion of the pizza eaten is the geometric series \\begin{align*}\n\\frac12+\\frac1{2^2}+\\frac1{2^3}+\\frac1{2^4}+\\frac1{2^5} &= \\frac{\\frac12\\left(1-\\left(\\frac12\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac12}\\\\\n&=1-\\left(\\frac12\\right)^5\\\\\n&=1-\\frac1{32}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{31}{32}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "If I have a whole pizza and I eat half of it on my first trip to the refrigerator, that means I have eaten 1/2 of the pizza. \n\nThen, on my second trip, I eat half of what's left, which is half of the original half. That means I have eaten 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 of the pizza.\n\nOn my third trip, I eat half of what's left, which is half of the original fourth. That means I have eaten 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8 of the pizza.\n\nOn my fourth trip, I eat half of what's left, which is half of the original eighth. That means I have eaten 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 15/16 of the pizza.\n\nOn my fifth and final trip, I eat half of what's left, which is half of the original sixteenth. That means I have eaten 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 = 31/32 of the pizza.\n\nSo, after five trips to the refrigerator, I have eaten 31/32 of the pizza.",
