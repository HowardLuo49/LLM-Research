    "gpt_response": "To do this problem, we first need to multiply 2 by 3 and 6i. That gives us 6 + 12i. Then, we need to subtract 6 + 12i from 5 - 4i. That gives us (5-4i) - (6+12i). When we distribute the negative sign, we get 5 - 4i - 6 - 12i. Then we can combine like terms to get our answer. 5 - 6 = -1 and -4i - 12i = -16i. So the final answer is -1 - 16i.",
