    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?",
    "solution": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the original price of the shirt be $P$ dollars. \nThe first discount of $20\\%$ off reduces the price to $0.8P$ dollars.\nThe second discount of $25\\%$ off reduces the price to $0.75(0.8P) = 0.6P$ dollars.\nLet $x$ be the single percent discount that would give the same final price as the two successive discounts.\nThen, $(1-\\frac{x}{100})P = 0.6P$.\nSolving for $x$ gives $x=40$.\nTherefore, a $40\\%$ single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 40\\%?: Let the original price of the shirt be $P$ dollars. \nThe first discount of $20\\%$ off reduces the price to $0.8P$ dollars.\nThe second discount of $25\\%$ off reduces the price to $0.75(0.8P) = 0.6P$ dollars.\nLet $x$ be the single percent discount that would give the same final price as the two successive discounts.\nThen, $(1-\\frac{x}{100})P = 0.6P$.\nSolving for $x$ gives $x=40$.\nTherefore, a $40\\%$ single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts.",
