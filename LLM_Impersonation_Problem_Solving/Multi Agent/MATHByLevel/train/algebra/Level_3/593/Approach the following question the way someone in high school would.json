    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?",
    "solution": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the price of the shirt after the first discount of $20\\%$ off. \n\n$20\\%$ of $\\$30$ is $\\$6$, so the sale price after the first discount is $30 - 6 = \\$24$. \n\nNext, we need to find the price of the shirt after the second discount of $25\\%$ off. \n\n$25\\%$ of $\\$24$ is $\\$6$, so the final price after both discounts is $24 - 6 = \\$18$. \n\nNow, we need to find the single percent discount that would give the same final price of $\\$18$ as the two successive discounts. \n\nLet $x$ be the single percent discount. \n\nWe can set up the equation: \n\n$\\$30 - \\frac{x}{100}(\\$30) = \\$18$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$30 - 0.3x = 18$\n\n$0.3x = 12$\n\n$x = 40$\n\nTherefore, a single percent discount of $40\\%$ would give the same final price as the two successive discounts of $20\\%$ and $25\\%$.",
