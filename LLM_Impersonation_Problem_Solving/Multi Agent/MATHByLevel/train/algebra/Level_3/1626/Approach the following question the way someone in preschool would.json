    "solution": "We only need to look at the constant terms; all the other terms will have variables in them when multiplied.  Thus we have $(5)(15)$, which equals $\\boxed{75}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the constant term, we have to multiply the constant terms of both expressions. In this case, the constant terms are 5 and 15.
