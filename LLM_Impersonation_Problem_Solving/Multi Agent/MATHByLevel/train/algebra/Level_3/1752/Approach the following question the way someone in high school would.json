    "solution": "If the line $x+y=b$ intersects the midpoint, which is: $$\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2},\\frac{5+9}{2}\\right)=(3,7)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+7=b$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that the formula for the midpoint of a line segment is $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$. In this case, our two points are $(2,5)$ and $(4,9)$, so the midpoint would be $\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2}, \\frac{5+9}{2}\\right)$ which simplifies to $(3,7)$. \n\nNow, we also know that the line $x+y=b$ intersects this midpoint, so when you plug in the values $x=3$ and $y=7$ into the equation $x+y=b$, you should get the value of $b$. \n\nSo, plugging in $x=3$ and $y=7$, we get $3+7=b$ which simplifies to $b=10$. Therefore, the value of $b$ is 10.",
