Which digit is represented by $\\Theta$ if $252/\\Theta=\\underline{3\\Theta}+\\Theta$, where $\\underline{3\\Theta}$ represents a two-digit number with $3$ in the tens digit and $\\Theta$ in the ones digit?",
    "solution": "Rewrite $\\underline{3\\Theta}+\\Theta$ as $30+\\Theta+\\Theta=30+2\\Theta$, so we have an algebraic expression we can manipulate. Multiply by $\\Theta$ to obtain: \\begin{align*}\n252/\\Theta&=30+2\\Theta\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n252&=30\\Theta+2\\Theta^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=2\\Theta^2+30\\Theta-252\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=\\Theta^2+15\\Theta-126\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(\\Theta+21)(\\Theta-6).\n\\end{align*}Or using the quadratic formula: \\begin{align*}\n\\Theta&=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{225-4\\cdot1\\cdot-126}}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{729}}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{-15\\pm27}{2}\n\\end{align*}Either way, because $\\Theta$ must be a positive digit, $\\Theta=\\boxed{6}$.",

That means we have to find a number that, when we divide $252$ by it, we get a number that has a $3$ in the tens digit and the same number in the ones digit. \n\nHmm... let's try some numbers. If we try $252/1$, that gives us $252$. But that doesn't have a $3$ in the tens place. Let's try $252/2$, that gives us $126$. Still not right. Let's try $252/3$, that gives us $84$. Aha! That works because $84$ has a $3$ in the tens place and $4$ in the ones place. \n\nSo the digit represented by $\\Theta$ is $4$. Yay, we did it!",
