    "solution": "First, we see that $0$ does not satisfy the inequality, so we can divide by $x$.  If $x$ is positive, we can divide to get $x<7$, and there are $6$ positive integers satisfying this. If $x$ is negative, we divide to get $x>7$, which is not satisfied by any negative integers.  So the number of integer solutions is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integer values of x make x\u00b2 < 7x, we first need to find when x\u00b2 is equal to 7x.\n\nLet's try some numbers:\n- When x = 0, 0\u00b2 < 7(0) is true.\n- When x = 1, 1\u00b2 < 7(1) is true.\n- When x = 2, 2\u00b2 < 7(2) is also true.\n- When x = 3, 3\u00b2 < 7(3) is not true.\n\nSo, we have found that when x is 0, 1, or 2, x\u00b2 < 7x is true. That means there are 3 integer values of x that make this statement true.",
