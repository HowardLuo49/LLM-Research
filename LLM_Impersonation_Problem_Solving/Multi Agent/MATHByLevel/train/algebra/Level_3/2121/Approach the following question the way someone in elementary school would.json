    "solution": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding the first few primes that are greater than 5: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29... \n\nNow we know that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with common difference 6. This means that each prime number is 6 more than the previous one.\n\nSo, starting with 7, we add 6 to find the next prime number in the sequence: 7 + 6 = 13, 13 + 6 = 19, 19 + 6 = 25 (which is not prime), so we keep going until we find the next prime number: 29.\n\nTherefore, the primes in the sequence are: 7, 13, 19, 29.\n\nFinally, we want to find the ones digit of $a$, which is the first prime in the sequence. The ones digit of 7 is 7.\n\nSo, the ones digit of $a$ is 7.",
