    "solution": "Point B has coordinates $(x,4)$.  We know the slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so we know that: $\\frac{4-0}{x-0} = \\frac{2}{3}$, thus, $x = 6$, and the sum of the coordinates of point B is $\\boxed{10}$.",

Hmm... so point $B$ must be higher up, right? Let's imagine point $B$ being somewhere along that line.\n\nWe also know that the slope of the segment $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Slope is like how steep the line is. So if we go over $3$ and up $2$, we will get to point $B$.

Since point $B$ is on the line $y=4$, the $y$-coordinate of point $B$ is $4$. \n\nTo find the $x$-coordinate of point $B$, we know the slope is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so it's like going over $3$ and up $2$ from $A$. This means the $x$-coordinate of point $B$ is $0 + 3 = 3$. \n\nSo, the sum of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of point $B$ is $4+3=\\boxed{7}$.",
