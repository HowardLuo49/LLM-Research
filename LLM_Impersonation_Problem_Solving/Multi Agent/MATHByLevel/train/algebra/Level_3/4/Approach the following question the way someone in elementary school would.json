    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?",
    "solution": "Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so a rectangle has four sides. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the rectangle. If the perimeter is 24 inches, that means all the sides added together equal 24 inches.\n\nTo find the maximum area of the rectangle, we need to know that the sides are equal. That way, we can make a square, which has the largest area for a given perimeter. So, since all sides are equal, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by 4 (24 divided by 4 equals 6 inches).\n\nNow we have a square with each side measuring 6 inches. To find the area of a square, we multiply the length of one side by itself (6 x 6 equals 36). So, the maximum possible area for the rectangle is 36 square inches.",
