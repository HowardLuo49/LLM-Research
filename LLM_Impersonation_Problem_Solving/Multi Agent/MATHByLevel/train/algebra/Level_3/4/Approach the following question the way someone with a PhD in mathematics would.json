    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?",
    "solution": "Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the area of a rectangle given its perimeter, we need to ensure that the sides are as close to each other in length as possible. This means that the rectangle should be as close to a square as possible.\n\nLet the length of one side of the rectangle be x inches. Then the length of the other side must be 12 - 2x inches, as the perimeter is given as 24 inches.\n\nThe area A of the rectangle is given by A = x(12 - 2x) = 12x - 2x^2.\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the critical points of the area function. Taking the derivative of the area function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:\n\ndA/dx = 12 - 4x = 0\n4x = 12\nx = 3\n\nThis critical point occurs at x = 3. We can confirm that this is a maximum by checking the second derivative of the area function:\n\nd^2A/dx^2 = -4 < 0\n\nTherefore, the area is maximized when x = 3 inches. The maximum possible area is obtained by plugging x = 3 back into the area function:\n\nA = 3(12 - 2*3) = 3(6) = 18 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the rectangle is 18 square inches.",
