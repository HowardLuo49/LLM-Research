    "solution": "Simplify the two factors first.  Factor $2^4$ from $576$ to get $36$, and since $36=6^2$, the fourth root of $576$ is $(2^\\frac44)(6^\\frac24)=2\\sqrt{6}$.  Because $6^2$ evenly divides $216$, the square root of $216$ is $(6^\\frac22)(6^\\frac12)=6\\sqrt{6}$.  Multiply those two quantities together to obtain $\\boxed{72}$ as an answer.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's simplify the numbers inside the parentheses. $576$ can be written as $2^6 \\cdot 3^2$ and $216$ can be written as $2^3 \\cdot 3^3$. \n\nNow, using the properties of exponents, we have $(576)^\\frac{1}{4}(216)^\\frac{1}{2} = (2^6 \\cdot 3^2)^\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot (2^3 \\cdot 3^3)^\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSimplifying the exponents, we have $2^\\frac{6}{4} \\cdot 3^\\frac{2}{4} \\cdot 2^\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3^\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThis simplifies to $2^\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3^\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2^\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3^\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nNow, when we multiply the terms with the same base, we can add the exponents: $2^\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 2^\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3^\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3^\\frac{3}{2} = 2^{(3/2 + 3/2)} \\cdot 3^{(1/2 + 3/2)}$.\n\nThis simplifies to $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = 8 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{72}$.",
