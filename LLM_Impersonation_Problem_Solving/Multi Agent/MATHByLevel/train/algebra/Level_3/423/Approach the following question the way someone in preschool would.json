    "solution": "Simplify the two factors first.  Factor $2^4$ from $576$ to get $36$, and since $36=6^2$, the fourth root of $576$ is $(2^\\frac44)(6^\\frac24)=2\\sqrt{6}$.  Because $6^2$ evenly divides $216$, the square root of $216$ is $(6^\\frac22)(6^\\frac12)=6\\sqrt{6}$.  Multiply those two quantities together to obtain $\\boxed{72}$ as an answer.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start with breaking down the numbers. \n576 can be written as 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 * 4, and (4 * 4 * 4 * 4) is 256.\n216 can be written as 6 * 6 * 6, and (6 * 6) is 36.\n\nSo now we have:\n$256^\\frac{1}{4}$ * $36^\\frac{1}{2}$ \n\nA quarter root of 256 is 4, because 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256.\nAnd a half root of 36 is 6, because 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nTherefore, $256^\\frac{1}{4}$ * $36^\\frac{1}{2}$ simplifies to 4 * 6, which equals 24.",
