    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. At constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume. I have some oxygen in a 2.28 liter container with a pressure of 5 kPa. If I move all of it to a 5.7 liter container at the same temperature, what will the new pressure be in kPa?",
    "solution": "Since the pressure $p$ of the oxygen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$. From the first container, we know that $k=2.28\\cdot5=11.4$. Consequently, when we move it to the 5.7 liter container, we get that $5.7p=11.4$, so $p=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If you have oxygen in a little container and it has a big pressure, and then you put it in a bigger container, the pressure will get smaller. So in the big container, the pressure will be less than 5 kPa. Maybe it will be 2.5 kPa?",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: If you have oxygen in a little container and it has a big pressure, and then you put it in a bigger container, the pressure will get smaller. So in the big container, the pressure will be less than 5 kPa. Maybe it will be 2.5 kPa?",
