In preschool terms, we can think of $\\log_3$ as a special way to figure out what power of 3 equals a certain number. \n\nSo, we need to find out what power of 3 equals $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt3}$. Hmm... this is a bit tricky, but let's break it down. We know that $\\sqrt3$ is the same as $3^{1/2}$. \n\nSo, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt3}$ is the same as $\\frac{1}{3^{1/2}} = 3^{-1/2}$. \n\nThis means that $\\log_3\\frac{1}{\\sqrt3} = \\log_3 3^{-1/2}$. \n\nNow, we just need to figure out what power of 3 equals $3^{-1/2}$. \n\nIn preschool terms, we need to think about what number we can raise 3 to in order to get $3^{-1/2}$. Can you figure it out? \n\nHint: Remember that $3^{-1/2}$ is the same as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt3}$. \n\nWhat do you think the answer is?",
