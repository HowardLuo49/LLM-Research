    "solution": "Expanding the first given equation using the distributive property, we have \\begin{align*}\n25&=(x+y+z)(xy+xz+yz)\\\\&=x(xy+xz+yz)+y(xy+xz+yz)+z(xy+xz+yz)\\\\\n&=x^2y+x^2z+xyz+xy^2+xyz+y^2z+xyz+xz^2+yz^2\\\\\n&=3xyz+x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2\n\\end{align*}Expanding the second given equation using the distributive property, we have \\begin{align*}\n7&=x^2(y+z)+y^2(x+z)+z^2(x+y)\\\\\n&=x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2.\\end{align*}We substitute the equation $$7=x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+y^2z+xz^2+yz^2$$into the expanded form of the first given equation to get \\[25=3xyz+7\\]or $xyz=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's use our counting and matching skills to figure this out! We have three numbers: $x$, $y$, and $z. We can count the number of times each number appears in the equations to help us find the value of $xyz$.\n\nIn the first equation, $x$, $y$, and $z$ all appear three times: $1$ time each by themselves, and $3$ times as pairs ($y$ and $z$ together, $x$ and $z$ together, and $x$ and $y$ together). So, they add up to $3+3=6$. \n\nIn the second equation, $x$, $y$, and $z$ each appear $2$ times: once with another number ($y$ and $z$ with $x$, $x$ and $z$ with $y$, $x$ and $y$ with $z$). So, they add up to $2+2+2=6$.\n\nSince the product of $x$, $y$, and $z$ is the same in both equations (they're both equal to $xyz$), we know that $xyz = 6/6 = 1$.\n\nSo, the value of $xyz$ is $1$. Great job, preschool mathematician!",
