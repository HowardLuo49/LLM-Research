    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?",
    "solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $q$, we can begin by eliminating $p$. In order to do this, we multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, giving us a system of two equations that both have 12 as the coefficient of $p$ \\begin{align*} 12p+16q&=32\n\\\\ 12p+9q&=39\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(12p+16q)-(12p+9q)=32-(39)$, which simplifies to $7q=-7$ or $q=\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this system of equations, we need to use the method of substitution or elimination. We will use the elimination method in this case.\n\nFirst, we will multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4 to obtain:\n\n$9p + 12q = 24$  \n$16p + 12q = 52$\n\nNext, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the variable $q$:\n\n$16p + 12q - (9p + 12q) = 52 - 24$  \n$7p = 28$\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we get:\n\n$p = 4$\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $p$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $q.
