    "solution": "The powers of $i$ repeat every four powers: $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, $i^5=i$, $i^6=-1$ and so on. So to determine $i^n$, where $n$ is an integer, we only need to find the remainder of $n$ when it is divided by 4. The remainder of both 22 and 222 when divided by 4 is 2, so $i^{22} + i^{222} = i^2 + i^2 = -1 + (-1) = \\boxed{-2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "i is a special imaginary number that represents the square root of -1. When we raise i to a power, it goes in a cycle of repeating every 4 powers. For example, i to the 1st power is i, i to the 2nd power is -1, i to the 3rd power is -i, and i to the 4th power is 1.\n\nLet's find out what happens when we raise i to the 22nd power and i to the 222nd power.\n\n22 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2, so i to the 22nd power is the same as i squared, which equals -1.\n\n222 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2, so i to the 222nd power is also -1.\n\nNow let's add -1 and -1 together: -1 + (-1) = -2\n\nSo, the answer is -2.",
