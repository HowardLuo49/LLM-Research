    "solution": "Since $4^2=16$, $\\log_7x$ must equal $2$. Writing the equation $\\log_7x=2$ in exponential form gives $7^2=x$, so $x=\\boxed{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's use the property of logarithm that says $a^{\\log_a b}=b$. In this case, we have $4^{\\log_7 x}=16$. So we know that $4$ is equal to $16$ raised to some power. We also know that $4$ is the same as $2^2$. This means that $2^2$ raised to the power of $\\log_7x$ equals $16$. Therefore, $2^{2\\log_7x}=16$. We can rewrite this as $2^{\\log_7x^2}=16$. Now we see that $x^2$ is equal to $7$. So $x=\\sqrt{7}$ or $x=-\\sqrt{7}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 49?: Ok, so first let's use the property of logarithm that says $a^{\\log_a b}=b$.
