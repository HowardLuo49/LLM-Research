    "solution": "Simply back up from $11$. Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\\cdot 1 = 8$. So the answer is $7 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of the first two terms, we need to figure out what the first term and the common difference are in the arithmetic sequence. \n\nSince the fifth term is $11$, we know that the sequence is going up by $1$ each time. So the fourth term must be $11-1=10$, the third term must be $10-1=9$, the second term must be $9-1=8$, and the first term must be $8-1=7$. \n\nNow we can find the product of the first two terms: $7\\times8=\\boxed{56}$.",
