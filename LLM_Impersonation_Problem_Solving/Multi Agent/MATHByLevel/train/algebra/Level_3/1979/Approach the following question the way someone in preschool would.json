    "gpt_response": "Wow, this is a big question! Let's break it down step by step. First, let's see if we can simplify the equation $(x + 2)(3x^2 - x + 5)$. We can do this by using the distributive property. \n\nSo, $(x + 2)(3x^2 - x + 5)$ can be rewritten as $3x^2(x) + 3x^2(2) - x(x) - x(2) + 5(x) + 5(2)$. \n\nThis simplifies to $3x^3 + 6x^2 - x^2 - 2x + 5x + 10$. \n\nNow, we can combine like terms to get $3x^3 + 5x^2 + 3x + 10 = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D$. \n\nSo, we can see that $A = 3$, $B = 5$, $C = 3$, and $D = 10$. \n\nTo find the value of $A + B + C + D$, we just add them all together. \n\nSo, $A + B + C + D = 3 + 5 + 3 + 10 = 21$. \n\nGreat job working through that big question!",
