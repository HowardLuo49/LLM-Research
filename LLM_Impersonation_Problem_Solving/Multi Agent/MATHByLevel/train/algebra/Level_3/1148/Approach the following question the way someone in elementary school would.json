On a particular day in Salt Lake, UT, the temperature was given by $-t^2 +12t+50$ where $t$ is the time in hours past noon. What is the largest $t$ value at which the temperature was exactly 77 degrees?",
    "solution": "We set the temperature equal to 77 degrees: \\begin{align*}\n-t^2 +12t+50&=77\\\\\nt^2-12t+27&=0\\\\\n(t-3)(t-9)&=0\n\\end{align*}We see then that the temperature is 77 degrees exactly twice: at $t=3$ and $t=9$, so our answer is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh! This is a math problem about finding the time when the temperature was 77 degrees in Salt Lake! Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that the temperature is given by the equation $-t^2 + 12t + 50$. \n\nNext, we want to find when the temperature was exactly 77 degrees. So, we can set the equation equal to 77 and solve for $t$.\n\n$-t^2 + 12t + 50 = 77$\n\nNow, we simplify this equation:\n\n$-t^2 + 12t + 50 = 77$\n$-t^2 + 12t - 27 = 0$\n\nTo make it easier, let's try to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n$(-t + 15)(t - 3) = 0$\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero:\n\n$-t + 15 = 0$ or $t - 3 = 0$\n\nSo, $t = 15$ hours past noon or $t = 3$ hours past noon.\n\nSince we are looking for the largest $t$ value when the temperature was exactly 77 degrees, the answer is $t = 15$ hours past noon. That was fun to figure out!",
