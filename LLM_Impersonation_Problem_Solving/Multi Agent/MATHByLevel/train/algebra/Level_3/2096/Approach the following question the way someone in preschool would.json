    "solution": "If you solved this problem by finding the solutions to the equation, go back and read the section again.  The sum of the roots is $-b/a$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term and $a$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term.  So, the desired sum is $-(84)/(-32)=\\boxed{\\frac{21}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So the first thing we need to do is find the sum of the solutions of this funny looking equation. We can do this by using a special formula called Vieta's formulas. \n\nFirst, we'll write down the equation: $-32x^2 + 84x + 135=0$. Then we'll remember that the sum of the solutions of an equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c=0$ is given by $-b/a$. \n\nSo in this case, our $a$ is -32 and our $b$ is 84. When we plug these values into the formula $-b/a$, we get $-84/-32$, which simplifies to $21/8$. \n\nYay! That's the sum of the solutions of the equation $-32x^2 + 84x + 135=0$. Great job, friends!",
