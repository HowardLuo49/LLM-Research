    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The new Perry Hotter book will have a cover price of $\\$25$. The local bookstore is offering two discounts $\\$4.00$ off and $20\\%$ off. A clever shopper realizes that the prices will be different depending on the order in which she claims her discounts. How much more money will she save by taking the better valued approach rather than the other approach? Express your answer in cents.",
    "solution": "If the clever shopper takes $4 off followed by $20\\%$ off, the book will cost $0.8 \\times (\\$25 - \\$4) = 0.8 \\times \\$21 = \\$16.80$. If she takes $20\\%$ off followed by $4 off, it will cost $(0.8 \\times \\$25) - \\$4 = \\$20 - \\$4 = \\$16.00$. She will save $\\$16.80 - 16.00 = \\$0.80 = \\boxed{80\\text{ cents}}$ by taking the better-valued approach.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, let us denote the original price of the book as $P = \\$25$. \n\nLet us first consider a shopper that takes the $\\$4.00$ discount first. The discounted price can be calculated as $P_1 = P - \\$4.00 = \\$25 - \\$4.00 = \\$21.00$. Subsequently, the shopper applies the $20\\%$ discount, resulting in a final price of $P_2 = P_1 - 0.2P_1 = \\$21.00 - 0.2 \\cdot \\$21.00 = \\$16.80$. \n\nOn the other hand, if the shopper takes the $20\\%$ discount first, the discounted price would be $P_3 = P - 0.2P = \\$25 - 0.2 \\cdot \\$25 = \\$20.00$. Then, applying the $\\$4.00$ off discount would result in a final price of $P_4 = P_3 - \\$4.00 = \\$20.00 - \\$4.00 = \\$16.00$. \n\nTherefore, by taking the better valued approach of claiming the $20\\%$ discount first and then the $\\$4.00$ off discount, the shopper saves $P_2 - P_4 = \\$16.80 - \\$16.00 = \\$0.80 = 80$ cents.",
