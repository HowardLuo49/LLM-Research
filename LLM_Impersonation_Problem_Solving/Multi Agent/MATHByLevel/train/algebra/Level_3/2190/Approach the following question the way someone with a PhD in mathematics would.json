    "solution": "Note that $a \\star b = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$. Thus, $4 \\star 6 = (4 + 6)^2 = 10^2 = \\boxed{100}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $a \\star b$ when $a = 4$ and $b = 6$, we substitute these values into the expression for $a \\star b$:\n\n$4 \\star 6 = 4^2 + 2(4)(6) + 6^2 \\\\\n= 16 + 48 + 36 \\\\\n= 100$\n\nTherefore, $4 \\star 6 = 100$.",
