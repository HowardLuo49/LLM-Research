    "solution": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out how long it takes one faucet to fill the tub. Since three faucets can fill the tub in 6 minutes, that means each faucet takes 6 minutes x 3 = 18 minutes to fill the tub by itself.\n\nNow, let's convert 18 minutes into seconds because we need to know how many seconds it takes one faucet to fill the tub. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so 18 minutes x 60 = 1080 seconds.\n\nNext, we figure out how long it takes six faucets to fill the tub. Since each faucet takes 1080 seconds, six faucets will take 1080 seconds \u00f7 6 = 180 seconds to fill the tub.\n\nLastly, let's see how long it takes six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub. Since the original tub was 100 gallons, and the new tub is 25 gallons, we take 100 gallons / 25 gallons = 4. That means the new tub is 1/4 the size of the original tub.\n\nSince we found out it takes 180 seconds for six faucets to fill the original tub, it will take them 180 seconds x 1/4 = 45 seconds to fill the new tub.\n\nSo, it takes six faucets 45 seconds to fill a 25-gallon tub.",
