    "solution": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $f$ be the rate at which one faucet fills the tub in gallons per minute. Therefore, three faucets fill the 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, so we can write the equation:\n\n$3f \\cdot 6 = 100$\n\nSolving for $f$ gives:\n\n$f = \\frac{100}{3 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{100}{18} = \\frac{25}{4}$ gallons/minute\n\nNow we want to find out how long it takes six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub.
