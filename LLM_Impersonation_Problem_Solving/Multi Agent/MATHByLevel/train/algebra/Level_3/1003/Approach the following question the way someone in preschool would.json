Let's try to figure out what they're asking us to do. There's a big bracket with a fancy \"L\" and a \"3\" and some more brackets and numbers. Hmm... let's start with the numbers. We have 6 and 1/2. Let's see, 6 - 1/2 is... umm... maybe we can just take away the 1 from 6? Yeah, so that leaves us with 5. Then we have to do something with the 5, the 3, and the big brackets. Oh, the big \"L\" means we have to round up to the nearest whole number! So, since 3 times 5 is 15, if we round up to the nearest whole number, we get... 16! Yay, we did it! \ud83c\udf89",
