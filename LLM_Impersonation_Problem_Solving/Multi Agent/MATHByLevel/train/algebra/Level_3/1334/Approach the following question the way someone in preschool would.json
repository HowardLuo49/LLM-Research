    "solution": "Let $l$ represent the length of the rectangle and $w$ represent the width so that $l = 3x$ and $w = x + 5$. Since the area of the rectangle equals its perimeter, we have that $l \\times w = 2l + 2w$. We can then substitute $3x$ back in for $l$ and $x + 5$ in for $w$ to get  \\begin{align*}\n& (3x)(x+5) = 2(3x) + 2(x + 5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 + 15x = 6x + 2x + 10 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & (x - 1)(3x + 10) = 0.\n\\end{align*}Solving this equation, we get that the two possible values of $x$ are $x = 1$ and $x = - \\frac{10}{3}$. However, both the length $3x$ and the width $x + 5$ must be positive, so the only solution is $x = \\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the sides of the rectangle! We have 3 sides that are x inches long and 2 sides that are (x + 5) inches long. When we add them all together, we get the perimeter. And the area is length times width. \n\nBut the problem says the area and perimeter are equal! So we can set up an equation where the perimeter equals the area.\n\n$2(3x) + 2(x + 5) = 3x(x + 5)$\n\nNow, we can solve this equation to find the value of x.
