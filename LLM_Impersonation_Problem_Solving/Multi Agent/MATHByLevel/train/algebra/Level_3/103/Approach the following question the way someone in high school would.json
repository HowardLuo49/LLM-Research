    "solution": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion, we need to multiply the terms that will give us an $x^2$ when combined.\n\nFirst, let's multiply the $3x^2$ from the first expression by the $-7x$ from the second expression. This will give us $3x^2 \\cdot -7x = -21x^3$.\n\nNext, let's multiply the $ax^3$ from the first expression by the $bx^2$ from the second expression. This will give us $ax^3 \\cdot bx^2 = abx^5$.\n\nLastly, let's combine the $-2x$ from the first expression with the $-4$ from the second expression. This will give us $-2x \\cdot -4 = 8x$.\n\nNow, when we add all these terms together, we get: $-21x^3 + abx^5 + 8x$.\n\nSince we are looking for the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, we can see that the only term that will contribute to this is $8x$. So, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion is $\\boxed{8}$.",
