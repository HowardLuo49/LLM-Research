    "solution": "We must check whether or not the difference between 40 and each of the prime numbers less than 20 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) is prime. We find that only $40-3=37$, $40-11=29$, and $40-17=23$ are prime. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ pairs of prime numbers have a sum of 40.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of unordered pairs of prime numbers that sum up to 40, we start by listing out all possible prime numbers that are less than or equal to 40. These prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.\n\nNext, we consider all possible pairings of these prime numbers that sum up to 40. We can intuitively see that the only pair of prime numbers that adds up to 40 is (3, 37).\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 unordered pair of prime numbers that has a sum of 40, namely (3, 37).",
