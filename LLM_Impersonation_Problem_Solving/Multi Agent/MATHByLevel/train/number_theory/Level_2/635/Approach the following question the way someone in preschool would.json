    "solution": "We must check whether or not the difference between 40 and each of the prime numbers less than 20 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) is prime. We find that only $40-3=37$, $40-11=29$, and $40-17=23$ are prime. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ pairs of prime numbers have a sum of 40.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see...to find unordered pairs of prime numbers that add up to 40, we need to try out different combinations. We can start with the first prime number, which is 2, and then try adding it to other prime numbers to see if they equal 40.\n\nLet's try: 2 + 3 = 5 (not equal to 40)\n2 + 5 = 7 (not equal to 40)\n2 + 7 = 9 (not equal to 40)\n2 + 11 = 13 (not equal to 40)\n2 + 13 = 15 (not equal to 40)\n\nHmm, it seems like none of these combinations work. Maybe we should try starting with a different prime number and see if we get any pairs that add up to 40. Let's try 3 next!",
