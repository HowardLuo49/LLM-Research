    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. There are 54 chips in a box. Each chip is either small or large. If the number of small chips is greater than the number of large chips by a prime number of chips, what is the greatest possible number of large chips?",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips. From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $2l+p=54$. We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$. Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\\boxed{26}$.",

Let's pretend we have 30 small chips and 24 large chips. That's a difference of 6 chips, which is not a prime number. Let's try again. Um, what if we have 28 small chips and 26 large chips? That's a difference of 2 chips, which is a prime number! Yay!\n\nSo the greatest possible number of large chips in the box is 26. Hooray!",
