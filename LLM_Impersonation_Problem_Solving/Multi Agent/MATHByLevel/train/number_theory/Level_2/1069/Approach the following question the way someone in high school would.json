    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A Mersenne prime is defined to be a prime number of the form $2^n - 1$, where $n$ must itself be a prime. For example, since $2^3 - 1 = 7$, and 3 is a prime number, 7 is a Mersenne prime. What is the largest Mersenne prime less than 200?",
    "solution": "The largest Mersenne Prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = \\boxed{127}$. The next possible Mersenne Prime, $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$, is much too large (and is not prime).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest Mersenne prime less than 200, we can start by testing different values of $n$ to see if $2^n - 1$ is a prime number. Let's start with $n = 7$.\n\n$2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127$\n\nSince 127 is a prime number, we have found a Mersenne prime less than 200. \n\nTherefore, the largest Mersenne prime less than 200 is 127.",
