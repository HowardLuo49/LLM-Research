    "solution": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count our fingers to find the answer! The least three-digit number is 100. But if we multiply 1 x 0 x 0, we get 0, not 6. So let's try the next number, 101. Again, multiplying 1 x 0 x 1 equals 0, not 6. Let's keep going and try 102. Yay! 1 x 0 x 2 equals 2, not 6. Let's keep trying. The next number is 103. And guess what? 1 x 0 x 3 equals 6! So, the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6, is 103. Great job!",
