    "solution": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integers between 500 and 1000 contain both the digits 3 and 4, we can break it down into two cases.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many integers between 500 and 1000 contain the digit 3. Since there are 5 numbers (3,4,5,6,7) and 8 choices for the other two digits, we have a total of $5 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 320$ integers that contain the digit 3.\n\nNext, let's find out how many integers between 500 and 1000 contain the digit 4. Using the same reasoning, we also have 320 integers that contain the digit 4.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many integers contain both the digits 3 and 4. Since some of the integers found in the first case are also counted in the second case, we can simply add the number of integers with the digit 3 and the number of integers with the digit 4, and then subtract the overlap.\n\n$320 + 320 - 80 = 560$\n\nSo, there are 560 integers between 500 and 1000 that contain both the digits 3 and 4.",
