    "solution": "The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5. Thus, there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors of 30. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many factors 30 has, we need to think about all the numbers that can divide evenly into 30. The numbers that can do this are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30 itself. So, 30 has 8 positive factors.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 8?: To find out how many factors 30 has, we need to think about all the numbers that can divide evenly into 30. The numbers that can do this are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30 itself. So, 30 has 8 positive factors.",
