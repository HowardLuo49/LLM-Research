    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count together! Firstly, what is 7 times 17? Let's see... 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119! So, the first part is 119. Next, let's figure out 119 times 1977. Hmm... that's a big number! But let's try counting by adding 119 to itself 1977 times. 119, 238, 357, 476, 595, 714, 833... Okay, okay, we won't count it all. But we know it ends with 3. Now, it's time to find 7 cubed. 7 times 7 is 49, and 49 times 7 is... 343! So, when we subtract 343 from 593463, we get... 593120! Finally, the unit digit is 0! Yay!",
