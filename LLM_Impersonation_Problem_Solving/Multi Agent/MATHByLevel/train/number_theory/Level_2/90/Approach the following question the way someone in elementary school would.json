    "solution": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when we divide a number by 10, we just look at the last digit of the number. \n\nFirst, let's find the last digit of each number:\n- The last digit of 1734 is 4.\n- The last digit of 5389 is 9.\n- The last digit of 80,607 is 7.\n\nNow, let's multiply the last digits together: 4 x 9 x 7 = 252. \n\nSince we only care about the last digit, the remainder when we divide the product by 10 is 2.
