    "solution": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count on our fingers and help our teacher figure this out! We need to multiply all those big numbers together and then see what the remainder is when we divide by 10. Let's start with $1734\\times5389$...\n\n1. $1734\\times9 = 15,606$\n2. $1734\\times80 = 138,720$\n3. $1734\\times5,000 = 8,670,000$\n4. $5389\\times80 = 431,120$\n5. $5389\\times5,000 = 26,945,000$\n6. Now, let's add those products together: $15,606 + 138,720 + 8,670,000 + 431,120 + 26,945,000 = 35,200,446$\n\nNow let's multiply that by 80,607...\n\n7. $35,200,446\\times7 = 246,403,122$\n8. $35,200,446\\times80,000 = 2,816,035,680$\n9. Finally, let's add those two products together: $246,403,122 + 2,816,035,680 = 3,062,438,802$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when we divide $3,062,438,802$ by 10.
