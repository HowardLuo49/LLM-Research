    "solution": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these four numbers. \n\nFirst, we can start by multiplying the four prime numbers together to find their LCM: 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 = 210.\n\nSince we are looking for a four-digit number, we need to find the smallest multiple of 210 that is greater than or equal to 1000. \n\nStarting with 210, we can continue adding multiples of 210 until we find a four-digit number. \n\n210, 420, 630, 840, 1050\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers is 1050.",
