    "gpt_response": "To change $\\frac{37}{80}$ into a terminating decimal, we need to see how many times 80 can fit into 37. But wait, 80 is bigger than 37, so it won't fit at all! That's okay, we can still figure it out.\n\nInstead, let's remember how to do long division. We can start by writing 37 as 37.00, to show that there are two decimal places. Now, we can try to divide 80 into 3700.\n\n80 goes into 3700 four times (80 x 4 = 320), with a remainder of 30. So, we bring down the next digit of 0 to make it 300.\n\nThen, 80 goes into 300 three times evenly (80 x 3 = 240), with no remainder. So, $\\frac{37}{80}$ as a terminating decimal is 0.4625. Yay, we did it!",
