    "solution": "Since a terminating decimal can be written in the form of $\\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, we want to rewrite our fraction with a denominator of $10^b=2^b\\cdot5^b$. \\[ \\frac{37}{80}=\\frac{37}{2^{4}\\cdot5}\\cdot\\frac{5^{3}}{5^{3}}=\\frac{37\\cdot5^{3}}{10^{4}}=\\frac{4625}{10^{4}}=\\boxed{0.4625}. \\]",
    "gpt_response": "To change the fraction $\\frac{37}{80}$ into a decimal, we need to divide 37 by 80. \n\nLet me get out my handy-dandy calculator. \n\nSo, when we divide 37 by 80, we get 0.4625.\n\nSo, $\\frac{37}{80}$ as a decimal is 0.4625.",
