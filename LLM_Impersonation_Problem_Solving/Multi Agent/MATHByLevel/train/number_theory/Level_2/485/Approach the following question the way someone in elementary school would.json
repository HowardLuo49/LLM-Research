    "solution": "If $x=.\\overline{28}$, then $100x=28.\\overline{28}$. Notice that we can eliminate the repeating decimal by subtracting $.\\overline{28}$ from $28.\\overline{28}$. We have $100x-x=99x=28$, so $x=\\frac{28}{99}$. The repeating decimal can be expressed as the fraction $\\boxed{\\frac{28}{99}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To change the decimal .$\\overline{28}$ into a fraction, you can call it x and subtract it from the original decimal like this:\nx = $.282828...$\n100x = $28.282828...$\nNow we subtract the first x from the second 100x:\n100x - x = $28.282828...$ - $.282828...$\n99x = $28\nThen we divide both sides by 99:\nx = $\\dfrac{28}{99}$\nSo, the decimal .$\\overline{28}$ is equal to the fraction $\\dfrac{28}{99}$.",
