    "solution": "$3206_7 = 3 \\cdot 7^3 + 2 \\cdot 7^2 + 0 \\cdot 7^1 + 6 \\cdot 7^0 = 1029 + 98 + 6 = \\boxed{1133}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $3206_7$ to a base 10 number, we need to count the number of each digit in the number and multiply them by their respective place values.\n\nStarting from the right, the first digit is 6. Since 6 is in the one's place, we keep it as 6.\n\nThe next digit is 0, which is in the seven's place. We don't need to add anything for this digit since it is already 0.\n\nThe next digit is 2, which is in the seven squared place (49). So we multiply this digit by 49 to get 2 * 49 = 98.\n\nThe last digit is 3, which is in the seven cubed place (343). So we multiply this digit by 343 to get 3 * 343 = 1029.\n\nNow we add up all these values to get our final answer: 6 + 0 + 98 + 1029 = 1133.\n\nSo, the base 10 equivalent of $3206_7$ is 1133.",
