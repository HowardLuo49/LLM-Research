    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors?",
    "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly eight distinct positive factors, we need to think about what factors are. Factors are numbers that can be multiplied together to get another number. \n\nFirst, let's figure out what eight distinct positive factors would look like. Since factors of a number come in pairs, we need to find a number that can be expressed as the product of two other numbers in different ways. \n\nThe number that fits this description is 24. \n\nOne way to express 24 as the product of two numbers is 1 x 24. The factors of 24 in this case are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. \n\nSo, the smallest positive integer with exactly eight distinct positive factors is 24.",
