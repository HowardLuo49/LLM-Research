    "solution": "Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$.  We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8).",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many positive two-digit numbers leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8, we can start by listing out the two-digit numbers and finding which ones satisfy this condition.\n\nLet's start with the smallest two-digit number, which is 10. If we divide 10 by 8, we get a remainder of 2. So 10 is one of the numbers that satisfy the condition.\n\nNext, let's move on to the next two-digit number, which is 11. If we divide 11 by 8, we get a remainder of 3, not 2. So 11 is not one of the numbers that satisfy the condition.\n\nWe can continue this process for the rest of the two-digit numbers until we find all the numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8.",
