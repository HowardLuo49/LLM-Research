A number is divisible by $8$ if the number formed by its last $3$ digits is divisible by $8.$ For example, the number $47\\,389\\,248$ is divisible by $8$ because $248$ is divisible by $8.$ However, $47\\,389\\,284$ is not divisible by $8$ because $284$ is not divisible by $8.$\n\nIf $992\\,466\\,1A6$ is divisible by $8,$ where $A$ represents one digit, what is the sum of the possible values of $A?$",
