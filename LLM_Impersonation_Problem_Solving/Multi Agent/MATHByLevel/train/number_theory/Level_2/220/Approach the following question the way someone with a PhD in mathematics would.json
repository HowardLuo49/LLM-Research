    "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider a positive integer x that is both a square and a cube. This means that x must be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth power less than 100 is 64, which is equal to 2^6.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 positive integer less than 100 that is both a square and a cube, which is 64.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: Let's consider a positive integer x that is both a square and a cube. This means that x must be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth power less than 100 is 64, which is equal to 2^6.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 positive integer less than 100 that is both a square and a cube, which is 64.",
