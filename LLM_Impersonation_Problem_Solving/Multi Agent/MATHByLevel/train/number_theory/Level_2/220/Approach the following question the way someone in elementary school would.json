    "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many numbers are both a square and a cube, we need to think of numbers that can be both. The square numbers less than 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81. The cube numbers less than 100 are 1, 8, 27, 64. We see that the only number that is both a square and a cube is 64. So the answer is 1.",
