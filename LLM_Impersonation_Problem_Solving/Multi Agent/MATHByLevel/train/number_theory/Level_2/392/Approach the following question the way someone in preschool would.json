    "solution": "For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible. Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$. The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$. The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$. Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\\boxed{9700}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the biggest four-digit number with numbers that add up to 16. Hmm, let's see... maybe we can start with the biggest number we can make with the number 9. So the biggest four-digit number starting with 9 is 9999. But that only adds up to 36, which is too big. Let's try the next biggest number, which is 8999. That adds up to 35, which is still too big. So, let's keep trying different numbers until we find the right one!",
