    "solution": "Since 32 is a power of 2, its only factors are the powers of 2 less than or equal to it.  These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, so there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive factors of 32.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many distinct positive factors 32 has, we can try counting them! Let's see... \n\nWe know that the factors of 32 are the numbers that can be multiplied together to get 32. So, let's start by thinking about what numbers can multiply together to get 32. \n\nOne and 32 can multiply together to get 32, so those are two factors. \nTwo and 16 can multiply together to get 32, so those are two more factors. \nAnd, four and eight can multiply together to get 32, so those are two more factors. \n\nNow, let's count them all together. Two plus two plus two equals... six! So, 32 has six distinct positive factors. Yay, we did it!",
