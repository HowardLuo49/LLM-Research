    "solution": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the time 2004 hours from now, we just need to count how many times the hour hand goes around the clock.\n\nWe can start by figuring out how many full 12-hour cycles there are in 2004 hours. Since 2004 \u00f7 12 = 167 with a remainder of 4, it means the time will be the same as the current time after 167 full cycles. \n\nThis means the hour hand will return to the same position in 2004 hours, so the time will still be 9 o'clock.",
