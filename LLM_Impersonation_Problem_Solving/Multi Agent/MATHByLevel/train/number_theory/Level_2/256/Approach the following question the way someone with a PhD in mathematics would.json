    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Palindromes are numbers that read the same backwards and forwards, like 5665. What is the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3?",
    "solution": "The smallest four-digit palindromes have $1$ on each end.  $1001$ is not divisible by $3$, nor is $1111$, but $\\boxed{1221}$ is, so it is the smallest possible.",
    "gpt_response": "To identify the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3, we must consider the properties of palindromic numbers and divisibility by 3. \n\nFirst, we note that a palindromic number in the form of ABBA can be expressed as 1000A + 100B + 10B + A = 1001A + 110B. \n\nNext, we recall that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. For a four-digit palindrome ABBA, the sum of its digits is 2A + 2B. To ensure that the number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 3. \n\nConsidering the constraints, we aim to find the smallest values of A and B that satisfy the divisibility condition. Assuming A = 1 and B = 0, the sum 2A + 2B = 2(1) + 2(0) = 2 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, we increment the value of B while maintaining A as 1 until we find a combination that yields a sum divisible by 3. \n\nBy setting A = 1 and B = 1, the sum 2A + 2B = 2(1) + 2(1) = 4 is still not divisible by 3. Thus, we increment B further. \n\nEventually, by setting A = 1 and B = 2, the sum becomes 2A + 2B = 2(1) + 2(2) = 6, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the smallest positive four-digit palindromic number that is divisible by 3 is 1221.",
