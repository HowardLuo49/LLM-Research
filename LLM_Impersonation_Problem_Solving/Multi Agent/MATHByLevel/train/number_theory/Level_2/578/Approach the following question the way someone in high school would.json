    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The decimal representation of a fraction ends in $0.\\overline{3}$. When the decimal is changed to a common fraction and reduced to lowest terms, what is the denominator of the fraction?",
    "solution": "Let $S = 0.\\overline{3}$. Then $10S = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the second equation from the first we obtain $9S = 3$, so $S = \\frac13$. The desired denominator is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmmm, so the decimal representation of the fraction is 0.3333... which means it goes on forever with a 3 repeating. To change this into a common fraction, let's call the decimal x. \n\nSo, our equation would be:\nx = 0.3333...\n10x = 3.3333...\n\nNow, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n\n9x = 3\nx = 3/9\nx = 1/3\n\nSo, the fraction is 1/3. And the denominator is 3.",
