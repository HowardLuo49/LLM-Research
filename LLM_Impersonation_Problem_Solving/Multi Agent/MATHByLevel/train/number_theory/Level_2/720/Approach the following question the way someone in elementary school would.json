    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Winnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.  With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.  Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.  How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's add up all of Winnie's lollipops:\n\n45 cherry + 116 wintergreen + 4 grape + 229 shrimp cocktail = 394 lollipops\n\nNow, Winnie needs to divide her lollipops among her 11 friends:\n\n394 lollipops \u00f7 11 friends = 36 lollipops each\n\nEach friend gets 36 lollipops, so Winnie gives away:\n\n36 lollipops/friend x 11 friends = 396 lollipops\n\nSince Winnie only had 394 lollipops to start with, she ends up keeping:\n\n394 lollipops - 396 lollipops = 0 lollipops\n\nSo, Winnie ends up not keeping any lollipops for herself! She gave them all away to her friends.",
