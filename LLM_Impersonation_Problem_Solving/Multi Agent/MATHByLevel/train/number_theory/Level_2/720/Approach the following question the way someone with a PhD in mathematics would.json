    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Winnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.  With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.  Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.  How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of lollipops Winnie has. We do this by adding up the number of each flavor: \n\n45 cherry + 116 wintergreen + 4 grape + 229 shrimp cocktail = 394 lollipops\n\nNext, we divide this total number of lollipops by the number of friends Winnie has (11). This will give us the number of lollipops each friend receives: \n\n394 lollipops / 11 friends = 35 lollipops each\n\nSince Winnie gives each friend 35 lollipops, she gives away a total of 11 friends * 35 lollipops = 385 lollipops. \n\nTo calculate how many lollipops Winnie keeps for herself, we subtract the number of lollipops she gives away from the total number she has: \n\n394 lollipops - 385 lollipops = 9 lollipops\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself.",
