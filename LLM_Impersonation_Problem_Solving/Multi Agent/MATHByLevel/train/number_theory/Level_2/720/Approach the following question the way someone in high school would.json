    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Winnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.  With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.  Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.  How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's add up all the lollipops Winnie has: \n45 cherry + 116 wintergreen + 4 grape + 229 shrimp cocktail = 394 lollipops\n\nNext, let's divide the total number of lollipops by the number of friends she has:\n394 lollipops / 11 friends = 35 lollipops per friend\n\nWinnie gives out 35 lollipops to each of her 11 friends, which means she gives out a total of:\n35 lollipops/friend * 11 friends = 385 lollipops\n\nSo, Winnie ends up keeping:\n394 total lollipops - 385 given out = 9 lollipops\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 9?: First, let's add up all the lollipops Winnie has: \n45 cherry + 116 wintergreen + 4 grape + 229 shrimp cocktail = 394 lollipops\n\nNext, let's divide the total number of lollipops by the number of friends she has:\n394 lollipops / 11 friends = 35 lollipops per friend\n\nWinnie gives out 35 lollipops to each of her 11 friends, which means she gives out a total of:\n35 lollipops/friend * 11 friends = 385 lollipops\n\nSo, Winnie ends up keeping:\n394 total lollipops - 385 given out = 9 lollipops\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself.",
