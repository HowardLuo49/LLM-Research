One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total distance Leila covered in her ten marathons, we need to first find the total distance in yards. \n\nEach marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards. So, the total distance in yards for one marathon is $26(1760) + 385 = 45745$ yards. \n\nSince Leila ran ten marathons, the total distance in yards for all ten marathons is $10(45745) = 457450$ yards. \n\nNow, we need to express this total distance in yards as miles and yards. Since one mile is equal to $1760$ yards, we can divide $457450$ yards by $1760$ to find the total distance in miles and what's left over in yards. \n\n$457450\\div1760= 260$ with a remainder of $650$. \n\nTherefore, the total distance Leila covered in her ten marathons is $260$ miles and $650$ yards. \n\nSince $0\\le y<1760$, the value of $y$ is $\\boxed{650}$.",
