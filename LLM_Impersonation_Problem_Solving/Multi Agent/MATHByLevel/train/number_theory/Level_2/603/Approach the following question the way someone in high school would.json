The number of students in Teresa's graduating class is more than 50 and fewer than 100 and is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5. How many students are in Teresa's graduating class?",
    "solution": "Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv -1\\equiv 2\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv -2\\equiv 2\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv -3\\equiv 2\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv 2\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 2\\pmod{60}$. Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break it down! Since the number of students is more than 50 and fewer than 100, we know that the number must fall between 51 and 99.\n\nNext, we are told that the number is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5. This means that the number must be 2 less than a common multiple of 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThe least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is 60.
