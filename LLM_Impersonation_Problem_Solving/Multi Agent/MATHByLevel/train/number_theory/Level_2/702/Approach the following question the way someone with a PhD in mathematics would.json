    "solution": "$2^{12}\\times5^8=2^4\\times(2\\times5)^8=16\\times10^8$. $10^8$ has 9 digits, so $16\\times(10)^8$ has 10 digits (1, 6, and eight 0's). Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ digits in the value of $2^{12}\\times5^8$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of digits in the value of $2^{12} \\times 5^8$, we first need to compute the value of the expression. \n\n$2^{12} = 4096$ and $5^8 = 390625$.
