    "solution": "Note that $16^2 = 256 < 273$ while $17^2 = 289 > 273$.  Since all other perfect squares are farther away from $273$, our answer is the closer of these two, $\\boxed{289}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see, a perfect square is a number that you get when you multiply a number by itself. So let's look at the square numbers and find one that is closest to 273. Let's start with 10, because 10 times 10 is 100. That's too small. Let's try 20, because 20 times 20 is 400. That's too big. Let's try 15, because 15 times 15 is 225. That's too small. Let's try 16, because 16 times 16 is 256. That's too small. Let's try 17, because 17 times 17 is 289. That's too big. So the perfect square number closest to 273 is 16! Yay, we did it!",
