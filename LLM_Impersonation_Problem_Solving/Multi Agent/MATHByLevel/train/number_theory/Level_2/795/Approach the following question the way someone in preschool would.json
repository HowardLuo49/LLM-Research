    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $12$ are $2,3,5,7,11$. Since $2$ is the only even prime out of the five primes less than $12$, the answer is $\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{20}{100}=\\boxed{20\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's think about prime numbers first. Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. Some examples of prime numbers less than 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nNow, let's look at the prime numbers less than 12 and see if any of them are divisible by 2. Only 2 is divisible by 2 because it is an even number.\n\nSo, out of all the prime numbers less than 12, only 1 out of 5 (which is 20%) is divisible by 2.",
