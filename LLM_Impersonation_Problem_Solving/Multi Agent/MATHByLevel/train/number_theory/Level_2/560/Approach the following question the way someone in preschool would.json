    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99.  The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11, we need to remember that 8 divided by 11 equals 0.7272727272... Each block of numbers that repeats is 72. So, the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11 is 2! Yay for repeating decimals!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: To find the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11, we need to remember that 8 divided by 11 equals 0.7272727272... Each block of numbers that repeats is 72. So, the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11 is 2! Yay for repeating decimals!",
