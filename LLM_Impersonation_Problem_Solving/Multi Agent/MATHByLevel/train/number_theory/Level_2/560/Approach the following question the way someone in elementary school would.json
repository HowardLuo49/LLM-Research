    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99.  The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal of 8/11, you can do long division. When you divide 8 by 11, you get 0.72727272... and so on. This means that the repeating block is \"72\" and it has two digits. So the least number of digits in the repeating block of 8/11 is 2.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 2?: To find the decimal of 8/11, you can do long division. When you divide 8 by 11, you get 0.72727272... and so on. This means that the repeating block is \"72\" and it has two digits. So the least number of digits in the repeating block of 8/11 is 2.",
