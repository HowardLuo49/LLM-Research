    "solution": "The units digit of $31^3$ is the same as the units digit of $1^3$, which is 1.  The units digit of $13^3$ is the same as the units digit of $3^3$, which is 7.  Therefore, the units digit of $31^3+13^3$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $31^3+13^3$, we can first calculate the cubes of 31 and 13. \n\n$31^3 = 31 \\times 31 \\times 31$, which is 29791. So the units digit of $31^3$ is 1. \n\n$13^3 = 13 \\times 13 \\times 13$, which is 2197. So the units digit of $13^3$ is 7. \n\nNow, we add the units digits of $31^3$ and $13^3$: 1 + 7 = 8. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $31^3+13^3$ is 8.",
