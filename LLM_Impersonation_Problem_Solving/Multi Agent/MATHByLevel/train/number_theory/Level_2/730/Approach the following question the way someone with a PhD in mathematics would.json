    "solution": "For a base $b$ representation of $100_{10}$ to have exactly $5$ digits, the largest power of $b$ that is less than $100$ must be $4$. Therefore, we have the requirement that $b^4 \\le 100 < b^5$. We then realize that $b=3$ satisfies this requirement since $3^4 < 100 < 3^5$. We also realize that this is the only possible value of $b$ since if $b$ were equal to $2$, $b^5 = 2^5$ would be less than $100$ and if $b$ were equal to $4$, $b^4 = 4^4$ would be greater than $100$. Thus, our only solution is $b = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of $b$, we first need to understand the concept of converting a number from base 10 to base $b$. \n\nIn base 10, the number $100_{10}$ can be written as $1*10^2 + 0*10^1 + 0*10^0$. \n\nWhen this number is converted to base $b$, it is represented as:\n$100_{10} = a_4*b^4 + a_3*b^3 + a_2*b^2 + a_1*b^1 + a_0*b^0$\n\nSince it is given that $100_{10}$ in base $b$ has exactly 5 digits, we can represent this as $100_{10} = a_4*b^4 + a_3*b^3 + a_2*b^2 + a_1*b^1 + a_0*b^0$ where $a_4$, $a_3$, $a_2$, $a_1$, and $a_0$ are the digits in the base $b$ number system.\n\nNow, since the number has exactly 5 digits in base $b$, we can conclude that $b^4 \\leq 100 < b^5$.
