    "solution": "Keep up with which days are Thursdays by repeatedly adding 7: November 23, November 30, December 7, December 14, and December 21.  Since December 23 is two days after December 21, it falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week on which December 23 falls during a year when Thanksgiving is on Thursday, November 23, we must first consider the number of days between the two dates.\n\nThere are 30 days in November (including the 23rd) and 7 days in December before the 23rd. Therefore, there is a total of 30 + 7 = 37 days between November 23 and December 23.\n\nSince 7 divided by 7 gives a remainder of 2, we can say that 37 days is equivalent to 5 weeks and 2 days. This means that December 23 falls 5 weeks and 2 days after November 23.\n\nAdding 5 weeks to Thursday brings us to the following Thursday. Then adding 2 more days brings us to the final answer: December 23 falls on a Saturday.",
