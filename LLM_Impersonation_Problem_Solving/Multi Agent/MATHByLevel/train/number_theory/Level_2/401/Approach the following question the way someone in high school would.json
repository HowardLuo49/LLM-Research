    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the greatest prime factor of 221?",
    "solution": "Noticing that 221 is close to the perfect square 225, we write 221 as a difference of two squares: $221=225-4=15^2-2^2=(15-2)(15+2)=13\\cdot 17$.  The largest prime factor here is $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest prime factor of 221, we need to start by finding all the factors of 221. The factors of 221 are 1, 13, 17, and 221. \n\nNext, we need to determine which of these factors are prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. In this case, the only prime factors of 221 are 13 and 17.\n\nSince 17 is the larger prime factor of 221, the greatest prime factor of 221 is 17.",
