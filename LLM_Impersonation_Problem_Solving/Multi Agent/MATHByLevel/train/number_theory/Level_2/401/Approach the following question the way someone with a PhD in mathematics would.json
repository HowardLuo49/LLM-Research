    "solution": "Noticing that 221 is close to the perfect square 225, we write 221 as a difference of two squares: $221=225-4=15^2-2^2=(15-2)(15+2)=13\\cdot 17$.  The largest prime factor here is $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest prime factor of 221, we first factorize 221 into its prime factors. We can see that 221 is an odd number and is not divisible by 2.\n\nNext, we can divide 221 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. However, 221 is not divisible by 3.\n\nProceeding to the next prime number, which is 5, we find that 221 is not divisible by 5.\n\nContinuing further, we try dividing 221 by the next prime number, which is 7. In this case, we get that 221 divided by 7 is equal to 31.\n\nSince 31 is a prime number, and we cannot divide it further, we have found that the greatest prime factor of 221 is 31.",
