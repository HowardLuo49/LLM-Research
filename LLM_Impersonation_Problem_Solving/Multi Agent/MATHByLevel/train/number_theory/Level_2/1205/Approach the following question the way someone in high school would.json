    "solution": "There are $13$ cards in the pattern from $A$ to $K$. When you divide $42$ by $13$, you get $3$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, the $42^\\text{nd}$ card is a $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 42nd card in Emily's deck, we first need to figure out how many cards are in each suit. There are 13 cards in each suit (Ace through King).\n\nTo find which suit the 42nd card belongs to, divide 42 by 13. This gives us 3 with a remainder of 3. So, the 42nd card belongs to the third suit, which is clubs.\n\nNow, we need to find the position of the 42nd card within the club suit. We find this by finding the remainder when dividing 42 by 13. The remainder is 3. \n\nThe third card in the clubs suit is the 3 of clubs. Therefore, the 42nd card is the 3 of clubs.\n\nIn conclusion, the 42nd card in Emily's deck is the 3 of clubs.",
