    "solution": "We begin by converting $233_{10}$ into base-4. Since $4^3=64$ is the largest power of 4 that is less than 233, and $3\\cdot64=192$ is the largest multiple of 64 that is less than 233, the coefficient of the $4^3$ term will be 3. From here, we are left with a remainder of $233-192=41$. The largest power of 4 that is less than this number is $4^2=16$, and the largest multiple of 16 that is less than 41 is $2\\cdot16=32$. This leaves us with $41-32=9$, which we can express as $2\\cdot4^1+1\\cdot4^0$. So, we find that $233_{10}=3\\cdot4^3+2\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot{4^1}+1\\cdot4^0=3221_4$, which has $\\boxed{2}$ odd digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of odd digits in the base-4 representation of $233_{10}$, we first convert the decimal number 233 into its equivalent base-4 representation. \n\nTo do this, we repeatedly divide 233 by 4 and record the remainders to find the digits in the base-4 representation. \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n233 \\div 4 &= 58 \\text{ with remainder } 1 \\\\\n58 \\div 4 &= 14 \\text{ with remainder } 2 \\\\\n14 \\div 4 &= 3 \\text{ with remainder } 2 \\\\\n3 \\div 4 &= 0 \\text{ with remainder } 3 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus, the base-4 representation of 233 is $3221_4$. \n\nTo find the number of odd digits in this representation, we count the number of occurrences of the odd digits 1 and 3. In this case, there are 3 odd digits in the base-4 representation of 233, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
