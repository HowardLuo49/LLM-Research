    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. It takes exactly 74 colored beads on a string to make a necklace. The beads are strung in the following order: one red, one orange, two yellow, one green, and one blue. Then the pattern repeats starting again with one red bead. If the first bead of the necklace is red, what is the color of the last bead used to make the necklace?",
    "solution": "The pattern repeats every $1+1+2+1+1=6$ beads. Since $72=6\\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern). The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\\boxed{\\text{orange}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to look for the pattern in the sequence of colors on the necklace. We have one red bead, one orange bead, two yellow beads, one green bead, and one blue bead. This gives us a total of six beads in one cycle of the repeating pattern.\n\nSince there are 74 colored beads in total, we need to find the remainder when dividing 74 by 6. \n74 \u00f7 6 = 12 with a remainder of 2.\n\nTherefore, the 74th bead will be the same color as the 2nd bead in the pattern, which is orange. So the last bead used to make the necklace is orange.",
