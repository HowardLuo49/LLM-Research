    "solution": "To find the first year after $2000$ for which the sum of the digits is $12$, take the greatest possible units digit, $9$. $2+9=11$, so take $1$ as the tens digit and $0$ as the hundreds digit. The answer is therefore $\\boxed{2019}$.",

Let's start counting together: 2 + 0 + 0 + 5 equals 7, which is not 12. Let's try again, 2 + 0 + 0 + 6 equals 8, which is still not 12. Maybe we should try 2 + 0 + 0 + 7 equals 9, which is not it either. Let's keep adding until we find the year with a sum of 12!",
