    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When the set of natural numbers is listed in ascending order, what is the smallest prime number that occurs after a sequence of five consecutive positive integers all of which are nonprime?",
    "solution": "Consider the differences between consecutive prime numbers and look for the first difference of 6 or greater.  The first several prime numbers are \\[\n2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, 37,\\ldots,\n\\] and the differences between consecutive terms of this sequence are  \\[\n1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,\\ldots.\n\\] The first appearance of a difference of 6 or greater occurs between 23 and $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this, we first need to understand what prime numbers and nonprime numbers are. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. Nonprime numbers are numbers that have more than two factors, like 4, 6, 8, 9, and so on.\n\nSo, if we have a sequence of five consecutive positive integers that are all nonprime, the numbers could be something like 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 (just an example).\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest prime number that occurs after this sequence. Starting from the next number after 10, we can list the natural numbers in ascending order: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and so on.\n\nThe smallest prime number that occurs after 10 and the sequence of five nonprime numbers is 11. Therefore, 11 is the answer to the question.",
