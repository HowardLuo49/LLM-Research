When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the total number of dimes Natasha has. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is $0.10x$ dollars. \n\nSince Natasha has more than $1$ but less than $10$ dollars worth of dimes, we know that $1 < 0.10x < 10$. Therefore, Natasha has between 10 and 100 dimes.\n\nWe are given that when she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, 1 is left over. This can be expressed as $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nSimilarly, when she puts the dimes in stacks of 4 or 5, she also has 1 left over.
