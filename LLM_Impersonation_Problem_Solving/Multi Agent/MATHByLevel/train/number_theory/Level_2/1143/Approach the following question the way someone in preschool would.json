    "solution": "We have $1492 = 1500-8 \\equiv -8\\pmod{500}$ and $1999 = 2000-1\\equiv -1\\pmod{500}$.\n\nTherefore, $1492\\cdot 1999\\equiv (-8)\\cdot(-1) \\equiv 8 \\pmod{500}$. The remainder is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's try to solve this problem together! \nWhen we multiply $1492$ by $1999$, we get a really big number. \nBut we don't need to know the exact answer, we just need to find the remainder when we divide that big number by $500$. \nSo let's think about the number $500$. \nIf we take away $500$ from our big number, we might get a smaller number. \nWe want to keep taking away $500$ until we can't take away anymore. \nThe last number we have left is our remainder! \nLet's try to do that and see what we get.",
