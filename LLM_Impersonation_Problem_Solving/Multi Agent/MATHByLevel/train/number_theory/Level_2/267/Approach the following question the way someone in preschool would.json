    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the rows with 8 people in each row. 46 divided by 8 is 5 with a remainder of 6. That means there are 5 rows with exactly 8 people in each row. Yay!",
