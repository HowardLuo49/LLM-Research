    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Each row of a seating arrangement seats 7 or 8 people. Forty-six people are to be seated. How many rows seat exactly 8 people if every seat is occupied?",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the rows one by one! \n\n1st row: 8 people\n2nd row: 8 people\n3rd row: 8 people\n4th row: 8 people\n5th row: 8 people\n\nUh-oh! We've already seated 40 people and we still have 6 more people to seat. That means we can only have one more row of 8 people, because if we had more than that, we wouldn't have enough seats for everyone. \n\nSo, the answer is 5 rows seat exactly 8 people.",
