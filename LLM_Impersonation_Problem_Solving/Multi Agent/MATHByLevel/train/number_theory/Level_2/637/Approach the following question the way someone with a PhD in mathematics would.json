    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Every bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the common number of pieces in each bag of Dummies. We know that $x$ can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, as there are $7$ pieces left over. This can be represented by the congruence equation:\n\n$x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$\n\nThe smallest value of $x$ that satisfies this congruence is $x=7$. Therefore, each bag contains $7$ pieces of Dummies.\n\nWhen three bags of Dummies are divided equally among $9$ kids, the total number of pieces is $3 \\times 7 = 21$. Dividing these $21$ pieces equally among $9$ kids, each kid gets $2$ pieces with $3$ pieces left over. \n\nTherefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over is $\\boxed{3}$.",
