    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. It is now 12:00:00 midnight, as read on a 12-hour digital clock. In 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds the time will be $A:B:C$. What is the value of $A + B + C$?",
    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first convert the given time into seconds. \n\n12:00:00 midnight can be represented in seconds as follows: \n12 hours x 3600 seconds/hour = 43,200 seconds \n\nIn 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds, the total number of seconds that will pass can be calculated as follows: \n122 hours x 3600 seconds/hour + 39 minutes x 60 seconds/minute + 44 seconds = 439,164 seconds \n\nAdding the initial time of midnight to the total time passed, we get the total time in seconds: \n43,200 seconds + 439,164 seconds = 482,364 seconds \n\nNow, we need to convert this total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds. \n482,364 seconds = 133 hours, 25 minutes, and 4 seconds \n\nTherefore, $A = 1$, $B = 3$, and $C = 2$, \n$A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6$\n\nTherefore, the value of $A + B + C$ is 6.",
