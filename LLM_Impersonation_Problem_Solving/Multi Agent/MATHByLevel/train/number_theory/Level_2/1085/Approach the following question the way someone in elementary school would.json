    "solution": "If $n$ has $3$ divisors, since it is divisible by both $1$ and $n$, the only possibility for a third unique divisor is $\\sqrt{n}$, which must be prime. Therefore, $n$ is the square of a prime number. As a result, $n^2$ is the fourth power of a prime. Let $n^2 = p^4$ for the prime $p$. There are $\\boxed{5}$ divisors of $p^4$, namely $p^0$, $p^1$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many divisors $n^2$ has, we can look at how $n^2$ is formed first. We know that if $n$ has $3$ divisors, then $n$ must be a prime number. This is because prime numbers only have $2$ divisors - $1$ and the number itself.\n\nIf $n$ is a prime number, then $n^2$ would be the square of that prime number. So $n^2$ would be a product of that prime number with itself. This means that $n^2$ would have $3 \\times 2 = 6$ divisors.\n\nSo, if $n$ has $3$ divisors, then $n^2$ would have $6$ divisors.",
