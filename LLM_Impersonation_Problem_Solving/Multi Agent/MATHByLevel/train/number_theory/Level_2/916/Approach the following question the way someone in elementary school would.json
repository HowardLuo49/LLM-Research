    "solution": "The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $24$ is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 3)$, as each factor of $24$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the sum of the factors of 24 is $(1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3) = (15)(4)$, or $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the positive factors of 24, first we need to know all the factors of 24. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nTo find the sum, we just add up all the factors together. So, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 60.\n\nSo, the sum of the positive factors of 24 is 60.",
