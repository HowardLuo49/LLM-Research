    "solution": "The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding the smallest and largest possible values of $n$ for two-digit numbers. The smallest two-digit number is 10, which can be written as $2^3$. The largest two-digit number is 99, which can be written as $2^6$. \n\nSo, we need to find how many integers are between 3 and 6. These integers are 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ two-digit numbers that can be written in the form $2^n$.",
