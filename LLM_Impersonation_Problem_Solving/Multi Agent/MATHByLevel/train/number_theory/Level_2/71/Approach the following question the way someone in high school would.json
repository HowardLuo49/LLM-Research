    "solution": "The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many two-digit numbers can be written in the form $2^n$, we need to determine the range of values that $n$ can take. \n\nSince we want two-digit numbers, the smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest is 99. We need to find the values of $n$ that produce numbers within this range when $2^n$ is calculated.\n\nWe know that $2^4 = 16$ and $2^7 = 128$, so $n$ must be between 4 and 6. Therefore, there are 3 values of $n$ (4, 5, 6) that produce two-digit numbers in the form $2^n$.\n\nSo, there are 3 two-digit numbers that can be written in the form $2^n$.",
