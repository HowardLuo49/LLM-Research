    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes?",
    "solution": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's approach this problem by considering the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers.\n\nTo find the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes, we need to consider the smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on. \n\nWe can try to find the smallest integer divisible by three distinct primes by multiplying the smallest primes together. \n\nLet's start with the smallest primes: 2, 3, 5. The smallest integer that is divisible by these three primes is 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes is 30.",
