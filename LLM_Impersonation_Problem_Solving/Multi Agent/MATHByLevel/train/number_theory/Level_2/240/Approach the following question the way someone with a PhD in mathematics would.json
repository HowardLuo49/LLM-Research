    "solution": "When you divide 40 days in a week by 7 days, you get a remainder of 5.  Five days from Tuesday is $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week that is 40 days from Tuesday, we first note that there are seven days in a week. Therefore, after every seven days, the day of the week will repeat. \n\nStarting from Tuesday, after 7 days we have Tuesday + 7 = Tuesday, and after 14 days we have Tuesday + 14 = Tuesday, and so on. \n\nNow, we want to find the day of the week that is 40 days from Tuesday. Since 40 is not a multiple of 7, we need to find the remainder when dividing 40 by 7. \n\n40 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 5. Therefore, after 5 full weeks (35 days), we will have the same day of the week as starting from Tuesday. \n\nAdding the remaining 5 days to Tuesday, we have Tuesday + 5 = Sunday. Therefore, 40 days from Tuesday will be Sunday.",
