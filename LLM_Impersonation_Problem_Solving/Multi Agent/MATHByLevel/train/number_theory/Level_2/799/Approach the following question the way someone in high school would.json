    "solution": "We have $840=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot7=4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The largest of the four integers is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by listing out four consecutive positive integers: \n1, 2, 3, and 4 \n\nNow, let's calculate the product of these integers: \n1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 \n\nSince the product we need to find is 840, we know these integers are not the correct ones. Let's try the next set of consecutive integers: \n2, 3, 4, and 5 \n\nCalculating the product: \n2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120\n\nThis is also not the correct product, so let's try the next set: \n3, 4, 5, and 6 \n\nCalculating the product: \n3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360\n\nThis is still not the correct product, so let's try the next set: \n4, 5, 6, and 7 \n\nCalculating the product: \n4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 840\n\nFinally, we have found the correct product of 840 with the integers 4, 5, 6, and 7.
