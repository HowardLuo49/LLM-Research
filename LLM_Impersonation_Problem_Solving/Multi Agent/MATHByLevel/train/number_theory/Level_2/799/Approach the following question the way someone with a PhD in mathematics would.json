    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Four consecutive positive integers have a product of 840. What is the largest of the four integers?",
    "solution": "We have $840=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot7=4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The largest of the four integers is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four consecutive positive integers be x, x+1, x+2, and x+3. We are given that their product is 840, so we have the equation:\n\nx(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = 840\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\nx(x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6) = 840\nx^4 + 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x - 840 = 0\n\nBy inspection, we can see that x = 5 is a solution to the equation to make the product equal to 840. Therefore, the four consecutive positive integers are 5, 6, 7, and 8. The largest of these integers is 8.\n\nSo, the largest of the four integers is 8.",
