    "solution": "We have $840=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot7=4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The largest of the four integers is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the numbers one by one and see which one is the biggest! The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. We multiply them together and get 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24. Oops, the product is not 840. Let's try again. The numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5. We multiply them together and get 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120. That's not 840 either. Let's keep going. The numbers are 3, 4, 5, 6. We multiply them together and get 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360. That's still not 840. Let's try one more time. The numbers are 4, 5, 6, 7. We multiply them together and get 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 840. Yay, we did it! The largest of the four integers is 7. Good job!",
