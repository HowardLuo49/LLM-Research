    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Use each of the digits 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 exactly once to create the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6. What is that multiple of 6?",
    "solution": "A multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3, and a multiple of 2, which means its units digit is even. We note that 4, 6, and 8 are even and that $3+4+6+8+9=30=3(10)$, so indeed it is possible to create a multiple of 6. Choose the smallest even number on the list, 4, for the units digit and arrange the rest of the digits in decreasing order to maximize the multiple of 6: $\\boxed{98,634}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6 using the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9, we need to start by arranging the digits in descending order to maximize the number.\n\nWith 9 being the highest digit, we place it in the leftmost position to create the largest thousands place digit possible.\n\nNext, we look at the divisibility rule for 6, which states that a number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Since the number ends in an even digit 8, it is already divisible by 2. We just need to ensure it is also divisible by 3 by making the sum of its digits a multiple of 3.\n\nAdding up the remaining digits 3, 4, 6 gives us 13. To make it a multiple of 3, we need to replace the digit 4 with another digit. The next highest available digit is 6. So, the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6 using the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 is 98631.",
