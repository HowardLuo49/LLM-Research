    "gpt_response": "To find the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31, we first need to understand the place value of each digit in base-eight.\n\nIn base-eight, the rightmost digit represents the ones place, the next digit to the left represents the eights place, and the digit to the left of that represents the sixty-fours place, and so on.\n\nSo, the base-eight number 31 can be broken down as follows: \n3 * 8^1 + 1 * 8^0\n= 3 * 8 + 1 * 1\n= 24 + 1\n= 25\n\nTherefore, the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31 is 25.",
