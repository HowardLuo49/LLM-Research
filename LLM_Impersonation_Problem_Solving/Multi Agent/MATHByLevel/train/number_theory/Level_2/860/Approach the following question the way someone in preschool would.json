    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The digits of a two-digit number $AB$ are reversed to form a second two-digit number, and the lesser of the two-digit numbers is subtracted from the greater. What prime number must be a factor of the difference if $A\\neq B$?",
    "solution": "$AB -BA= 10\\cdot A+B - (10\\cdot B+A)= 9\\cdot A-9\\cdot B=3(3\\cdot A-3\\cdot B)$. If $A\\neq B$, then the difference is a (non-zero) multiple of 3. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ must be a factor of $AB -BA$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to pick two numbers for $A$ and $B$. Let's say $A=5$ and $B=3$. That means our two-digit number is 53. Now we need to reverse the digits to get 35.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. So we do $53-35=18$. \n\nNow we need to find a prime number that must be a factor of 18. Let's count and see which number is a factor of 18. Let's see...1, 2, 3...oh! 3 is a factor of 18!\n\nSo our answer is 3. Yay!",
