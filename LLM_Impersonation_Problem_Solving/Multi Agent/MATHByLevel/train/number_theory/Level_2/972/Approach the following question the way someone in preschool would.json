    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Fifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box. One card is randomly selected. What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's count the cards that are both prime and multiples of 7. The prime numbers between 1 and 50 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. \n\nNow let's find the ones that are also multiples of 7. The only prime number that is also a multiple of 7 is 7 itself.\n\nSo, there is 1 card that is both a prime number and a multiple of 7. \n\nSince there are 50 total cards, the probability of picking a card that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 1/50. Yay!",
