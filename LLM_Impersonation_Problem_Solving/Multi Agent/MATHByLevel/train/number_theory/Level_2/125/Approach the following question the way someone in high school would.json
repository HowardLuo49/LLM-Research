    "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110, we first need to list out all the odd numbers between 10 and 110. \n\nThe odd numbers between 10 and 110 are 11, 13, 15, ..., 107, 109. \n\nNext, we multiply all these odd numbers together to find the product. \n\n11 x 13 x 15 x ... x 107 x 109 = some large number\n\nFinally, we look at the units digit of the large number to find the units digit of the product. \n\nSince we are only interested in the units digit, we can simply look at the units digit of each odd number we multiplied together. \n\nThe odd numbers that we multiplied together all have units digit of 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. \n\nWhen we multiply numbers with units digits like 1 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 9, the resulting units digit is always 5. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of the product of all odd positive integers between 10 and 110 is 5.",
