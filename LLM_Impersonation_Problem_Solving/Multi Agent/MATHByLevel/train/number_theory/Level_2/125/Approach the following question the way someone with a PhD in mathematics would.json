    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110?",
    "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the product of all odd positive integers between 10 and 110, we can disregard the odd numbers whose units digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 since their product will contribute a units digit of 0. This leaves us with the odd numbers 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 31, and so on up to 91, 93, 95, 97, 99. \n\nNow, we can see that the product of the units digits of these numbers is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 945. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of the product of all odd positive integers between 10 and 110 is 5.",
