    "solution": "The only numbers that have 11 and 8 as a factor are multiples of 88.  If we list the first few multiples of 88: $$88,176,264,352,...$$ we can see that there are exactly $\\boxed{2}$ between 100 and 300.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the integers between 100 and 300 that have both 11 and 8 as factors, we need to consider the prime factorizations of both 11 and 8.\n\nThe prime factorization of 11 is simply 11 itself, as it is a prime number.\n\nThe prime factorization of 8 is 2^3, as 8 can be expressed as 2 * 2 * 2.\n\nFor an integer to have both 11 and 8 as factors, it must have both 2^3 and 11 in its prime factorization. This means that the integer must be of the form 2^3 * 11 = 88. Therefore, the only integer between 100 and 300 that has both 11 and 8 as factors is 88.",
