    "solution": "The least base 10 number which requires six digits for its binary representation is the one whose binary representation is $100000_2$. $100000_2=1\\cdot2^5=32_{10}$. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of the least positive base ten number that requires six digits for its binary representation, we need to consider the highest possible binary number with 5 digits and add 1 to it.\n\nThe highest 5-digit binary number is 11111, which corresponds to the decimal number 31. Adding 1 to this number, we get 32, which is represented as 100000 in binary.\n\nTherefore, the least positive base ten number which requires six digits for its binary representation is 32.",
