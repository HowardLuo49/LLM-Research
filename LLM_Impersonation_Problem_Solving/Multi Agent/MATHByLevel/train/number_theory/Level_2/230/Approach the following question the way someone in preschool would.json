    "solution": "The least base 10 number which requires six digits for its binary representation is the one whose binary representation is $100000_2$. $100000_2=1\\cdot2^5=32_{10}$. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's think about it together! A base ten number is a number we usually write with digits 0-9, right? And a binary number is a number we write with only 1s and 0s. So, we need to find the smallest base ten number that we have to write with six 1s and 0s in binary. Let's count together....1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32! So, the smallest base ten number that needs six digits in binary is 32! Yay, we did it!",
