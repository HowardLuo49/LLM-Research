    "solution": "The least base 10 number which requires six digits for its binary representation is the one whose binary representation is $100000_2$. $100000_2=1\\cdot2^5=32_{10}$. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find the smallest base ten number that requires six digits in binary form. To do this, let's start by converting a few numbers into binary to see how many digits they require.\n\nFirst, let's try converting the number 1 into binary. In binary, 1 is represented as 000001, which requires 6 digits. So, the smallest base ten number that requires six digits in binary is 1.",
