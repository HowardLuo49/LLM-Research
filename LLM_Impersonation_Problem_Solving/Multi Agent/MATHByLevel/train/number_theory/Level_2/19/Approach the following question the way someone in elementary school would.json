    "gpt_response": "Oh wow, an insect laid 154 base 6 eggs! Let's figure out how many eggs that is in base 10. In base 6, each place value represents a power of 6. The digit in the hundreds place represents how many groups of 6^2 eggs she laid, the digit in the tens place represents how many groups of 6 eggs she laid, and the digit in the ones place represents how many individual eggs she laid. Let's figure it out:\n\n$1 \\times 6^2 + 5 \\times 6^1 + 4 \\times 6^0$\n\n$=1 \\times 36 + 5 \\times 6 + 4 \\times 1$\n\n$=36 + 30 + 4$\n\n$=70$\n\nSo, the insect laid 70 eggs in base 10.
