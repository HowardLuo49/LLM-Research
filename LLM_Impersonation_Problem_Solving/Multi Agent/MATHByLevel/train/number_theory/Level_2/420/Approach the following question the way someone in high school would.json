    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In a certain warehouse, there are $1335$ boxes, each containing $39$ books.\n\nMelvin's boss orders him to unpack all the books and repack them so that there are $40$ books in each box. After packing as many such boxes as possible, Melvin has how many books left over?",
    "solution": "The total number of books in the warehouse is $1335\\cdot 39$. If Melvin packs $b$ boxes of $40$ books each and has $r$ books left over, then $1335\\cdot 39 = 40b+r$. Thus, what we are looking for is the remainder when $1335\\cdot 39$ is divided by $40$.\n\nWe note that $39\\equiv -1\\pmod{40}$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n1335\\cdot 39 &\\equiv 1335\\cdot (-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv -1335\\pmod {40}.\n\\end{align*}Now we note that $-1335 = -1400 + 65$, and $-1400$ is a multiple of $40$. Therefore, $-1335 \\equiv 65 \\equiv 25\\pmod{40}$, which implies that the remainder is $\\boxed{25}$ books.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many books Melvin has left over, we first need to figure out how many books he unpacked in total and then see how many he could pack into boxes of $40$.\n\nMelvin unpacked $1335$ boxes, each containing $39$ books. So he unpacked $1335 \\times 39 = 52065$ books in total.\n\nNow, to pack the books into boxes of $40$, Melvin will need to divide the total number of books by $40$: $52065 \\div 40 = 1301$ boxes.\n\nSo Melvin was able to pack $1301$ boxes, leaving $(52065 - 1301 \\times 40) = 25$ books left over.\n\nTherefore, Melvin has $25$ books left over after packing as many boxes as possible with $40$ books in each.",
