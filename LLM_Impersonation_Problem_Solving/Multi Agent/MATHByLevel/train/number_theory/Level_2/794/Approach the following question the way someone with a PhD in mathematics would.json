    "solution": "The five decimals sum to $0.12345$, which as a fraction is $\\frac{12,\\!345}{100,\\!000}$.  Since $100,\\!000=2^5\\cdot 5^5$, we only have to cancel factors of 2 or 5 from $12,\\!345$.  Since $12,\\!345$ is odd, it has no factors of 2.  Dividing by 5, we find that $\\dfrac{12,\\!345}{100,\\!000}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2469}{20,\\!000}}$.",
