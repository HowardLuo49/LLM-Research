    "solution": "The five decimals sum to $0.12345$, which as a fraction is $\\frac{12,\\!345}{100,\\!000}$.  Since $100,\\!000=2^5\\cdot 5^5$, we only have to cancel factors of 2 or 5 from $12,\\!345$.  Since $12,\\!345$ is odd, it has no factors of 2.  Dividing by 5, we find that $\\dfrac{12,\\!345}{100,\\!000}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2469}{20,\\!000}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's add these numbers together. First, line up the decimal points so they all match up. Then add the numbers: \n$$.1 + .02 + .003 + .0004 + .00005 = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{2}{100} + \\frac{3}{1000} + \\frac{4}{10000} + \\frac{5}{100000}$$\nNow, find a common denominator, which is 100000. Convert each fraction to have this denominator:\n$$\\frac{10000}{100000} + \\frac{2000}{100000} + \\frac{300}{100000} + \\frac{4}{100000} + \\frac{5}{100000} = \\frac{10209}{100000}.$$\n\nSo, the sum of $.1 + .02 + .003 + .0004 + .00005$ as a common fraction is $\\frac{10209}{100000}$.",
