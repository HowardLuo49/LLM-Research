    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count our friends! We have three rows with the same number of friends in each row. Let's say we have 10 friends in each of those rows. Then we have one row with one more friend than the others. So, if we add one more friend to each row, we will have 11 friends in that row!\n\nSo, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class is 10 + 10 + 10 + 11 = 41 friends! Yay, we solved it!",
