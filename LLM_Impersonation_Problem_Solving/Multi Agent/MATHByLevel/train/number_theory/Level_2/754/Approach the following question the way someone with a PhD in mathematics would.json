    "solution": "Terminating decimals can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{10^b}$. So, we try to get our fraction in this form: $$\\frac{11}{125} = \\frac{11}{5^3} = \\frac{11}{5^3} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3} = \\frac{11\\cdot2^3}{10^3} = \\frac{88}{1000} = \\boxed{0.088}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the terminating decimal expansion of $\\frac{11}{125}$, we first must rewrite the fraction in a form where the denominator is a power of 10. We can rewrite $\\frac{11}{125}$ as $\\frac{11}{5^3}$.\n\nNext, we can see that the decimal representation of a fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is of the form $2^n \\cdot 5^m$, where $n$ and $m$ are non-negative integers. In this case, the denominator $5^3$ is of this form, so the decimal expansion of $\\frac{11}{125}$ will terminate.\n\nTo find the decimal expansion, we can simply perform the division $11 \\div 125$.\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{r|l l}\n0.088 & 125 \\\\\n\\cline{1-2}\n& 99 \\\\\n& - \\underline{99} \\\\\n& 26 & 0 \\\\\n& - \\underline{25} \\\\\n& 10 \\\\\n& - \\underline{10} \\\\\n& 0 \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{11}{125} = 0.088$.
