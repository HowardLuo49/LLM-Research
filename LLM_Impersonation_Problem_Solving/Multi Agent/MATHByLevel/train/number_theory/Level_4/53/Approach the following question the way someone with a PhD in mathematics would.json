    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the number of stamps on the last page of the fifth book be denoted by x.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of stamps in each of the first four books:\nTotal stamps in each of the first four books = 42 pages/book * 6 stamps/page = 252 stamps/book\n\nThus, the total number of stamps in the first four books = 4 books * 252 stamps/book = 1008 stamps\n\nFrom the problem, we know that the total number of stamps in the first four books equals the total number of stamps in the first five books minus the number of stamps on the last page of the fifth book:\n1008 = 5 * 42 * 10 - (33 * 10 + x)\n1008 = 210 * 5 - 330 - x\n1008 = 1050 - 330 - x\n1008 = 720 - x\n288 = - x\nx = -288\n\nHowever, since the number of stamps on a page cannot be negative, it is evident that there must be a mistake in the calculations.
