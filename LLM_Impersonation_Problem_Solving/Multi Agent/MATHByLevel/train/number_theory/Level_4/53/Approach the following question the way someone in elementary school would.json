    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Jenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate how many stamps Jenny had in her original stamp books. Each book had 42 pages, and each page had 6 stamps. So, to find the total number of stamps in each book, we multiply 42 by 6. \n\n42 pages x 6 stamps per page = 252 stamps per book\n\nSince Jenny had 8 stamp books, we multiply the number of stamps per book by 8 to find the total number of stamps she originally had.\n\n252 stamps per book x 8 books = 2016 stamps\n\nNext, we need to calculate how many stamps Jenny has in her new system. In her new system, each page contains 10 stamps. She fills up 4 complete books, each with 42 pages. So, the total number of stamps in those 4 books is:\n\n42 pages x 10 stamps per page = 420 stamps per book\n420 stamps per book x 4 books = 1680 stamps\n\nThat means Jenny has 2016 - 1680 = 336 stamps left to fill up her fifth book.\n\nHer fifth book has 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page, which is 33 x 10 = 330 stamps already filled up. That leaves her with 336 - 330 = 6 stamps left to fill up the last page.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 stamps on that last page.",
