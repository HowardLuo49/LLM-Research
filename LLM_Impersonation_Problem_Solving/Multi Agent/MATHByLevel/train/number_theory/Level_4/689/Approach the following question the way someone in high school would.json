    "solution": "An integer that is equivalent to 6 mod 7 can be written in the form $7k+6$.\n\n$1000$ is the smallest four-digit integer, so we want to solve the inequality $7k+6 \\ge 1000$. This inequality has solution $k \\ge 142$, so since $k$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $k$ is $142$. As a result, the smallest four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is $7(142) + 6 = \\boxed{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7, we can start by finding the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 7 and then adding 6 to it.\n\nThe smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 7 is 1001 (7 x 143 = 1001). Adding 6 to this number gives us 1007. Therefore, the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is 1007.",
