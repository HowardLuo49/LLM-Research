    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward. For example, 343 and 1221 are palindromes. What is the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome?",
    "solution": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we should consider the properties of palindromes. Let $x$ be the natural number we need to add to 40,305 to create a palindrome. This means that the resulting number will be of the form $40,305 + x$. \n\nFor the resulting number to be a palindrome, the digits in the resulting number must be symmetric about the center. Considering the digits in the resulting number sequentially, we see that the first digit must be 4 (since we are adding to 40,305), the last digit must be 4 (since palindromes are read the same forwards and backwards), and the second digit must be consistent with the first (i.e., they must be the same). \n\nSo, the digit in the ones place in $x$ must be such that when added to 5 it results in a number ending with 4. This implies that the ones digit in $x$ must be 9. Therefore, the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is 99.",
