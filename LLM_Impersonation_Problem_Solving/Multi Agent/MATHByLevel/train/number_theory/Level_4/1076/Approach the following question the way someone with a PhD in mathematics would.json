    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation, we can first calculate the value of $7^{2005}$ using a calculator or computer software. \n\nAfter computing this value, we would then look at the decimal expression of $7^{2005}$ and determine the digit in the tens place by considering the digits to the right of the decimal point in the number. This can be done by considering the number modulo 100 (dividing by 100 and looking at the remainder).\n\nAlternatively, we could express $7^{2005}$ as a product of powers of 10. For example, $7^{2005} = (10-3)^{2005}$. Using the binomial theorem, we can expand this expression and identify the term that contributes to the tens place digit. \n\nIn general, the approach to finding the tens place digit in a large number involves analyzing the number in terms of its decimal expansion, and using modular arithmetic or algebraic manipulations to isolate the relevant part of the number that corresponds to the desired digit.",
