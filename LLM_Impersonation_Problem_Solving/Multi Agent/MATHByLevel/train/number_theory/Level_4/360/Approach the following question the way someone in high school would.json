    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Eleven girls are standing around a circle. A ball is thrown clockwise around the circle. The first girl, Ami, starts with the ball, skips the next three girls and throws to the fifth girl, who then skips the next three girls and throws the ball to the ninth girl. If the throwing pattern continues, including Ami's initial throw, how many total throws are necessary for the ball to return to Ami?",
    "solution": "If we number the girls 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, so that Ami is number 1, and she passes the ball first to girl number 5, then the numbers of the girls with the ball are 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 1.  Hence, the ball must be thrown $\\boxed{11}$ times before it returns to Ami.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this down. Ami throws to the fifth girl, then the fifth girl throws to the ninth girl. From there, the ninth girl would throw to the second girl, then the second girl would throw to the sixth girl, and so on. To find out how many throws it would take for the ball to return to Ami, we need to keep track of each throw:\n\n1. Ami throws to fifth girl\n2. Fifth girl throws to ninth girl\n3. Ninth girl throws to second girl\n4. Second girl throws to sixth girl\n5. Sixth girl throws to tenth girl\n6. Tenth girl throws to third girl\n7. Third girl throws to seventh girl\n8. Seventh girl throws to eleventh girl\n9. Eleventh girl throws to fourth girl\n10. Fourth girl throws to eighth girl\n11. Eighth girl throws back to Ami\n\nSo, it takes 11 throws for the ball to return to Ami.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 11?: Ok, so let's break this down. Ami throws to the fifth girl, then the fifth girl throws to the ninth girl. From there, the ninth girl would throw to the second girl, then the second girl would throw to the sixth girl, and so on. To find out how many throws it would take for the ball to return to Ami, we need to keep track of each throw:\n\n1. Ami throws to fifth girl\n2. Fifth girl throws to ninth girl\n3.

Seventh girl throws to eleventh girl\n9. Eleventh girl throws to fourth girl\n10. Fourth girl throws to eighth girl\n11. Eighth girl throws back to Ami\n\nSo, it takes 11 throws for the ball to return to Ami.",
