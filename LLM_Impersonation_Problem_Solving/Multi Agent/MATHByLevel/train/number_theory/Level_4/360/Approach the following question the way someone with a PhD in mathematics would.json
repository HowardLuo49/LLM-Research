    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Eleven girls are standing around a circle. A ball is thrown clockwise around the circle. The first girl, Ami, starts with the ball, skips the next three girls and throws to the fifth girl, who then skips the next three girls and throws the ball to the ninth girl. If the throwing pattern continues, including Ami's initial throw, how many total throws are necessary for the ball to return to Ami?",
    "solution": "If we number the girls 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, so that Ami is number 1, and she passes the ball first to girl number 5, then the numbers of the girls with the ball are 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 1.  Hence, the ball must be thrown $\\boxed{11}$ times before it returns to Ami.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of modular arithmetic. Let \\( n = 11 \\) represent the number of girls in the circle. We also note that the pattern of skipping girls (3 skips) forms a cyclic group with a particular generator.\n\nFirst, we need to find the smallest value of \\( k \\) such that \\( 3k \\equiv 1 \\mod 11 \\). This k is the order of the generator in the cyclic group. In this case, it can be found that \\( k = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, after 4 throws, the ball will return to the initial thrower Ami. So in total, there are 4 throws necessary for the ball to return to Ami.",
