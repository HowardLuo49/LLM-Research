    "solution": "Reading all congruences $\\pmod{42}$, we have \\begin{align*}\na-b &\\equiv 18-73 \\\\\n&\\equiv -55 \\\\\n&\\equiv -55+42+42 \\\\\n&\\equiv 29\\pmod{42}.\n\\end{align*}That's great, except we want to find $n$ with $100\\leq n<142$.  Therefore we should add copies of 42 until we get into this range: \\[29\\equiv 29+42\\equiv71\\pmod{42}.\\]That's not large enough. \\[71\\equiv71+42\\equiv113\\pmod{42}.\\]That is in our range, so $n=\\boxed{113}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's see. So first, we need to find out what $a-b$ is. $a\\equiv 18\\pmod{42}$ and $b\\equiv 73\\pmod{42}$, so that means $a-b\\equiv 18-73\\pmod{42}$. \n\nHmm, $18-73$ is $-55$, and we need to find what that is modulo $42$. So if we keep adding $42$ to $-55$ until we get a positive number, we see that $-55+42=-13$. Oh no, it's still negative! Let's add another $42$ to $-13$ and we get $29$. \n\nSo, yay! $a-b\\equiv 29\\pmod{42}$. Now we just need to figure out which integer $n$ in the set $\\{100,101,102,\\ldots,140,141\\}$ is congruent to $29$ modulo $42$. Let's count by 42 and see where we land.\n\n$100$ is $2$ more than $98$, $142$ is $8$ more than $134$... Ah, $140$! $140$ is $28$ more than $112$, so $140$ is our answer!\n\nSo the integer $n$ in the set $\\{100,101,102,\\ldots,140,141\\}$ that satisfies $a-b\\equiv n\\pmod{42}$ is $\\boxed{140}$.
