    "solution": "Reducing each factor modulo 19 first, we see that $2001 \\cdot 2002 \\cdot 2003 \\cdot 2004 \\cdot 2005 \\equiv 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 \\equiv 30240 \\equiv \\boxed{11} \\pmod{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hey, so in order to find the remainder when $2001 \\cdot 2002 \\cdot 2003 \\cdot 2004 \\cdot 2005$ is divided by 19, we can use the property of remainders when multiplying.\n\nBasically, to find the remainder when a product of numbers is divided by a certain number, we can find the remainder of each individual number when divided by that certain number, multiply them together, and then find the remainder of that final product when divided by the certain number. \n\nSo in this case, we need to find the remainder when each of the numbers 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 is divided by 19. Then we multiply those remainders together and find the remainder when that final product is divided by 19.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you need more help understanding this concept.",
