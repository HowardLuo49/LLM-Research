    "solution": "First, we convert $0.\\overline{81}$ to a fraction by the following trick. Let $x=0.\\overline{81}$. Then $100x=81.\\overline{81}$, so we can subtract:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&100x &=& 81&.818181\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.818181\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&99x &=& 81 &\n\\end{array}$$\n\nTherefore, $x=\\frac{81}{99}=\\frac{9}{11}$.\n\nAt this point, we could write $0.81$ as $\\frac{81}{100}$ and subtract this from $\\frac{9}{11}$. However, the following observation will save us some work: \\begin{align*}\n0.\\overline{81} - 0.81 &= 0.818181\\ldots - 0.81 \\\\\n&= 0.008181\\ldots \\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{100}.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $$0.\\overline{81} - 0.81 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{1100}}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let\u2019s see. We have $0.81$ and $0.\\overline{81}$. The numbers are very similar, but there is a repeating pattern in $0.\\overline{81}$! I think we should find the difference between them.\n\nTo find the difference, we can subtract the two numbers. Let\u2019s start with $0.\\overline{81} - 0.81$. \n\n$0.\\overline{81} = 0.818181...$\n$0.818181... - 0.81 = 0.008181...$\n\nSo, $0.\\overline{81}$ exceeds $0.81$ by $0.008181...$. \n\nHmmm, I think we need to write this as a fraction. Let's see, $0.008181...$ is the same as $\\frac{9}{1100}$.\n\nSo, this means that $0.\\overline{81}$ exceeds $0.81$ by $\\frac{9}{1100}$. Yay, we did it!",
