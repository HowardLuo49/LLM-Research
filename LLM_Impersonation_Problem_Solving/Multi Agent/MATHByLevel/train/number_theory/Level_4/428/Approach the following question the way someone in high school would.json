    "solution": "$M=1$, $5$, or $6$ since no other digits have the property that the units digit of $M\\times M$ is $M$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $MM\\times M=NPM$ is $66\\times6=\\boxed{396}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's choose a random two-digit number with the same digits, like 22. When we multiply 22 by the one-digit number M, we get a three-digit number. We know that the result is NPM, so let's say that M is 2. \n\nSo, 22 times 2 is 44. This gives us NPM as 442. \n\nTo find the greatest possible value of NPM, we need to find the largest possible two-digit number with the same digits. The largest two-digit number with the same digits is 99. \n\nSo, 99 times 9 is 891. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of NPM is 891.",
