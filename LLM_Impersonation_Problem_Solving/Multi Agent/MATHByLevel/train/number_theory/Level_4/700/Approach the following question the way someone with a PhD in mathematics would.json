    "solution": "The given congruence has a solution if and only if $a$ is invertible modulo $12$ since the congruence implies that $a,x$ are inverses of each other modulo $12$. In other words, $\\gcd(12,a)=1$. The only such positive $a$ less than $12$ are $1,5,7,11$. So the number of possible values of $a$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integers $a$ less than $12$ such that the congruence $ax\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}$ has a solution in $x$, we must first understand the necessary and sufficient condition for a solution to exist.\n\nFor the congruence $ax\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}$ to have a solution, it is necessary and sufficient that $\\gcd(a, 12) = 1$. This is because if $\\gcd(a,12) \\neq 1$, then $a$ and $12$ share a common factor greater than $1$, and we cannot find a multiplicative inverse of $a\\pmod{12}$.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the number of positive integers less than $12$ that are coprime to $12$. These numbers are $1, 5, 7, 11$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{4}$ such positive integers $a$.",
