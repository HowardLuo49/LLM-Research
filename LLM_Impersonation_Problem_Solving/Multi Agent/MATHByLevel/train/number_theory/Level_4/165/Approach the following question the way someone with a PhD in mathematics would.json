    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The prime factorization of 2007 is $3^{2}\\times223$. How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy the equation $xy=2007$?",
    "solution": "$x$ must be a divisor of 2007. To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor. The total number of divisors is then $3\\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223). Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair. So there are $\\boxed{6}$ ordered pairs.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $xy=2007$, we can first express 2007 as a product of its prime factors: $2007 = 3^{2} \\times 223$.\n\nNow, in general, if we have a number expressed as a product of its prime factors, we can count the number of divisors of that number by considering each prime factor's power individually. \n\nFor 2007, we have 2 choices for the exponent of 3: 0 (if $3^{0}$ is a divisor) or 2 (for $3^{2}$). Similarly, we have 2 choices for the exponent of 223: 0 or 1 (as $223^{1}$ is the only divisor).\n\nThus, the total number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy $xy=2007$ is $(2+1)(1+1) = 6$.",
