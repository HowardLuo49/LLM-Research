    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many prime numbers between 30 and 65 have a prime remainder when divided by 10?",
    "solution": "If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite.  Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\\boxed{4}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we first need to find the prime numbers between 30 and 65. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves, so we need to check each number in this range to see if it is a prime number.\n\nThe prime numbers between 30 and 65 are: 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, and 61.\n\nNext, we need to find the remainder when each prime number is divided by 10. To do this, we divide each prime number by 10 and see if the remainder is also a prime number.\n\n31 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 1, which is a prime number.\n37 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 7, which is not a prime number.\n41 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 1, which is a prime number.\n43 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 3, which is a prime number.\n47 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 7, which is not a prime number.\n53 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 3, which is a prime number.\n59 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 9, which is not a prime number.\n61 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 1, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime numbers between 30 and 65 that have a prime remainder when divided by 10 are 31, 41, 43, and 61. There are a total of 4 prime numbers that meet this criteria.",
