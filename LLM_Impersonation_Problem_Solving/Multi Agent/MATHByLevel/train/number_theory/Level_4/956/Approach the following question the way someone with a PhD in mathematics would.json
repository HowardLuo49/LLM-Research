    "solution": "The value of 121 base $n$ is $1\\cdot n^2+2\\cdot n^1+1\\cdot n^0=n^2+2n+1$.  Since $n^2+2n+1=(n+1)^2$, the digit string 121 is a perfect square in any base except binary (where the digit 2 is not allowed).  There are $10-3+1=\\boxed{8}$ integers between 3 and 10 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all integers $n$ such that $121_n$ is a perfect square, we first need to express $121_n$ in terms of base 10. \n\nSince $121_n = 1 \\cdot n^2 + 2 \\cdot n + 1 = n^2 + 2n + 1$, we need to find all integers $n$ such that $n^2 + 2n + 1$ is a perfect square.\n\nWe can rewrite $n^2 + 2n + 1$ as $(n+1)^2$. Therefore, we need to find all integers $n$ such that $(n+1)^2$ is a perfect square.\n\nIn order for $(n+1)^2$ to be a perfect square, $n+1$ must be a perfect square itself. Since $3 \\leq n \\leq 10$, the possible values for $n+1$ are 4, 9, and 16. \n\nThis means that the possible values for $n$ are 3, 8, and 15. Therefore, there are 3 integers $n$ such that $121_n$ is a perfect square, namely 3, 8, and 15.",
