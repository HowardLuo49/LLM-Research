    "solution": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7, we need to understand what the valid digits are in each base.\n\nIn base-5, the valid digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. So for $AA_5 to be the smallest, A must be the smallest valid digit, which is 0. Therefore, $AA_5 = 00_5 = 0$ in base-10.\n\nIn base-7, the valid digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Similarly, for $BB_7 to be the smallest, B must be the smallest valid digit, which is 0. Therefore, $BB_7 = 00_7 = 0$ in base-10.\n\nSo, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7 is 0.",
