    "solution": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7, we first need to understand how to convert numbers between different bases.\n\nIn base-5, the possible digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. So $AA_5$ can be interpreted as $(A*5 + A*1) = 5A + A = 6A$.\n\nIn base-7, the possible digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So $BB_7$ can be interpreted as $(B*7 + B*1) = 7B + B = 8B$.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest common multiple of 6 and 8 in order to find the smallest integer that can be represented as both $AA_5$ and $BB_7.\n\nThe smallest common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24. Therefore, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7 is 24.",
