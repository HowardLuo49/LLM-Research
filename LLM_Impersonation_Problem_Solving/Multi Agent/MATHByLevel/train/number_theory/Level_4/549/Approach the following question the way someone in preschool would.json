    "solution": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! We need to find four-digit numbers that end in 45 and are divisible by 45. \n\nTo do this, we can think about how 45 is made up of prime factors. 45 is 9 times 5, and 9 is 3 times 3. So, for a number to be divisible by 45, it needs to be divisible by 3 and 5.\n\nSince our number already ends in 45, we know it is divisible by 5. Now we just need to check if it is also divisible by 3. The sum of the digits in our number needs to be divisible by 3 in order for the whole number to be divisible by 3.\n\nSo, we need to find positive four-digit numbers that end in 45, have a sum of digits that is divisible by 3, and are divisible by 5. Let's count them together!\n\nWe can start at 1045 and see if it meets all these conditions:\n1 + 0 + 4 + 5 = 10 (not divisible by 3)\n1055 - Nope, doesn't have a sum divisible by 3\n1065 - doesn't end in 45\n...\n...\n...\nand so on\n\nLet's keep counting and see how many numbers we can find that are positive four-digit integers of the form __45 that are divisible by 45.
