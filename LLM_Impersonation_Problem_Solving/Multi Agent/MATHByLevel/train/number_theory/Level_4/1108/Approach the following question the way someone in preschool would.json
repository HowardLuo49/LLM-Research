    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 5. However, in the next column we see that $6_{b}+3_{b}=11_{b}$. This tells us that $b$ divides into 9 once, with a remainder 1. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find a number that we can add to 161 to get 315 in base $b$. Let's start by writing out the numbers in each base.\n\nIn base $b$, 161 can be written as $1b^2+6b+1$. Similarly, 134 can be written as $1b^2+3b+4$ and 315 can be written as $3b^2+1b+5$. \n\nNow, let's add 161 and 134 together:\n\n$(1b^2+6b+1) + (1b^2+3b+4) = 3b^2+1b+5$\n\nThis means that our value of $b$ must be such that when we add 161 and 134 in base $b$, we get 315 in base $b$.\n\nNow, let's use our knowledge of numbers to figure out the value of $b$ using our counting skills!\n\nHmm... Let's try counting by 1s, 2s, or even 10s and see if we can find a number that works. Keep counting and we'll find the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation!\n\nWe got this!
