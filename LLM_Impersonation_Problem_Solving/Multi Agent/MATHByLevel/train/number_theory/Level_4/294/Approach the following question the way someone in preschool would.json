    "solution": "We find the prime factorization of $4125$. $4125= 11 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3$. Thus, we want $n!$ to have a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and $3$ factors of $5$. The largest prime in the factorization is $11$, so $n \\ge 11$. The exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 11! is only 2, since only the factors 5 and 10 are divisible by 5. Similarly, 12!, 13!, and 14! only have 2 fives in their prime factorizations. Since $15!$ contains a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and three factors of $5$, the least positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$, we can break down $4125$ into its prime factors: $4125 = 3^2 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 11$. \n\nNow we need to find the largest power of each prime factor that appears in $n!$. Let's start with $3$. The highest power of $3$ that divides $n!$ is given by the formula $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots$. Keep increasing $n$ until this value is at least $2$ for the power of $3$ in $4125$. \n\nSimilarly, do this process for $5$ and $11$ as well. The smallest value of $n$ that satisfies these conditions is the least positive integer $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$.",
