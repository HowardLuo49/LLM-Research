    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Eleanor is making chocolate chip cookies for her friends. If she divides the cookies equally among $11$ of her friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over. If she divides the cookies equally among $7$ of her friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over. Assuming that Eleanor made fewer than $100$ cookies, what is the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made?",
    "solution": "If Eleanor made $N$ cookies, we know from the first requirement that $N = 11x + 4$ for some integer $x,$ and from the second requirement we know that $N = 7y+1$ for some integer $y.$ Therefore,  $$11x+4 = 7y+1\\Rightarrow 11x+3 = 7y$$If we list the possible values of $11x+3$ such that $N = 11x+4<100,$ we have $14,$ $25,$ $36,$ $47,$ $58,$ $69,$ $80,$ $91.$ The only members of this list divisible by $7$ are $14$ and $91,$ and so the possible values of $$11x+4 = 7y+1$$are $14+1 = 15$ and $91+1 = 92$, and thus the sum of the possible numbers of cookies is $15+92 =\\boxed{107}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's set up some equations to represent the situation. Let's say that Eleanor made $C$ cookies.\n\nIf she divides the cookies equally among $11$ friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over, so we can write this as:\n\\[C = 11n + 4\\]\nwhere $n$ is an integer representing the number of cookies each friend receives.\n\nIf she divides the cookies equally among $7$ friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over, so we can write this as:\n\\[C = 7m + 1\\]\nwhere $m$ is an integer representing the number of cookies each friend receives.\n\nNow we want to find the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made, so we need to look for values of $C$ that satisfy both equations.\n\nWe can start by trying to solve for $n$ and $m$ in terms of $C$:\n\\[C = 11n + 4 \\implies n = \\frac{C-4}{11}\\]\n\\[C = 7m + 1 \\implies m = \\frac{C-1}{7}\\]\n\nSince $n$ and $m$ need to be integers, $C-4$ must be a multiple of $11$, and $C-1$ must be a multiple of $7$. This means $C$ must be $4$ more than a multiple of $11$ and $1$ more than a multiple of $7$.\n\n\nThe first few values of $C$ that satisfy these conditions are $25$, $46$, $67$, $88$. \n\nSo, the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that Eleanor could have made is $25 + 46 + 67 + 88 = \\boxed{226}$ cookies.",
