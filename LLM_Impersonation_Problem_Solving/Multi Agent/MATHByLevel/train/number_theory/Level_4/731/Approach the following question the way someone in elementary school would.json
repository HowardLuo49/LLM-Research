    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Eleanor is making chocolate chip cookies for her friends. If she divides the cookies equally among $11$ of her friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over. If she divides the cookies equally among $7$ of her friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over. Assuming that Eleanor made fewer than $100$ cookies, what is the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made?",
    "solution": "If Eleanor made $N$ cookies, we know from the first requirement that $N = 11x + 4$ for some integer $x,$ and from the second requirement we know that $N = 7y+1$ for some integer $y.$ Therefore,  $$11x+4 = 7y+1\\Rightarrow 11x+3 = 7y$$If we list the possible values of $11x+3$ such that $N = 11x+4<100,$ we have $14,$ $25,$ $36,$ $47,$ $58,$ $69,$ $80,$ $91.$ The only members of this list divisible by $7$ are $14$ and $91,$ and so the possible values of $$11x+4 = 7y+1$$are $14+1 = 15$ and $91+1 = 92$, and thus the sum of the possible numbers of cookies is $15+92 =\\boxed{107}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so Eleanor made some chocolate chip cookies. She tried to divide them equally among her friends, but had some left over. If she divides them equally among 11 friends, she has 4 left over. If she divides them among 7 friends, she has 1 left over. We need to find out how many cookies she could have made.\n\nLet's start by finding a common multiple of 11 and 7. The first common multiple is 77.\n\nIf Eleanor made 77 cookies, she would have 4 left over when dividing among 11 friends. But when dividing among 7 friends, there wouldn't be any left over. So 77 is not a possible number. \n\nLet's try the next common multiple, which is 154.\n\nIf Eleanor made 154 cookies, she would have 4 left over when dividing among 11 friends and 1 left over when dividing among 7 friends. So, 154 is a possible number of cookies.\n\nThe next common multiple is 231, but that's too big because we need a number less than 100.\n\nSo, the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that Eleanor could have made is $154$. \n\nEleanor could have made $154$ cookies.",
