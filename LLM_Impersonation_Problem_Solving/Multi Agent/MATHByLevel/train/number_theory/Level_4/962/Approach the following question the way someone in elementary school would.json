    "solution": "Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=\\boxed{24}.$\n\nWe can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive numbers, I have to see what is common in all the numbers. Let's take some numbers and see:\n\n1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24,\n2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120,\n3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360,\n4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 840.\n\nI see that in all these products, 4 must divide because it's in all the numbers. So, the largest integer that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive integers is 4.",
