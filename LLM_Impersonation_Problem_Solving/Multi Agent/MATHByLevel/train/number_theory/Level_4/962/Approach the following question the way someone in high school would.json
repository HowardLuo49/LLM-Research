    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the largest integer that must divide the product of any $4$ consecutive integers?",
    "solution": "Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=\\boxed{24}.$\n\nWe can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive integers, we can think about the pattern of multiplying 4 consecutive integers.\n\nWhen we multiply 4 consecutive integers, we get a product that includes each of the 4 integers. For example, the product of 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 24, which includes each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nSince we are looking for the largest integer that must divide the product, we can think about the common factors that all of these products will have. \n\nIn this case, the largest integer that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive integers is 4. This is because any product of 4 consecutive integers will be divisible by 4 since there will always be at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 4 in the product.\n\nSo, the largest integer that must divide the product of any 4 consecutive integers is 4.",
