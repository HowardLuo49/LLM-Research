    "solution": "Suppose that $n$ has $d$ divisors and that $d$ is even. Since the divisors come in pairs whose product is $n$, the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$. For example, if $n=12$ then the product of the divisors is $(1\\cdot 12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot 4)=12^3$. If $d$ is odd, then there are $(d-1)/2$ pairs which give a product of $n$, as well as the divisor $\\sqrt{n}$. So again the product of the divisors is $n^{(d-1)/2}n^{1/2}=n^{d/2}$. For example, if $n=16$, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $(1\\cdot 16)(2\\cdot 8)(4)=16^{5/2}$. To summarize, we have found that the product of the positive integers divisors of a positive integer $n$ is $n^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Writing 729 as $3^6$, then, we have $n^{d/2}=3^6$, which implies $n^d=3^{12}$. So the possible values of $(n,d)$ are $(3,12)$, $(9,6)$, $(27,4)$, $(81,3)$ and $(729,2)$. We find that only in the third case $(n,d)=(27,4)$ is $d$ the number of divisors of $n$, so $n=\\boxed{27}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $n$, we first note that the product of the positive integer divisors of $n$ can be expressed as $n^{d(n)/2}$, where $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive integer divisors of $n$. Thus, in this case, we have $n^{d(n)/2} = 729 = 3^6$. \n\nSince $729 = 3^6$, we can deduce that $n$ must be of the form $3^k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. \n\nNow, we need to find the value of $k$ such that $n^{d(n)/2} = 3^{k\\cdot(d(n)/2)} = 3^6$. Since $d(n)$ must be even in order for $n^{d(n)/2}$ to be an integer, we can express $d(n)$ as $2m$, where $m$ is a positive integer. \n\nThus, we can rewrite the equation as $3^{k\\cdot m} = 3^6$. This implies that $k\\cdot m = 6$, and since $m$ must be a positive integer, we have the solutions $(k,m) = (1,6), (2,3),$ and $(3,2)$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $n$ are $3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9,$ and $3^3 = 27$. Among these options, $n = 27$ is the only value that satisfies the condition that the product of the positive integer divisors of $n$ is 729. \n\nThus, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{27}$.",
