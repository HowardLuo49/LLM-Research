    "solution": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. We know that $5 \\equiv -3 \\pmod{8}$, so we can rewrite $5^{137}$ as $(-3)^{137}$.\n\nWe can then use the property that if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, then $a^k \\equiv b^k \\pmod{m}$. So, we have $(-3)^{137} \\equiv (-3)^{136} \\cdot (-3) \\equiv ((-3)^{4})^{34} \\cdot (-3) \\equiv 1^{34} \\cdot (-3) \\equiv -3 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8 is 5.",
