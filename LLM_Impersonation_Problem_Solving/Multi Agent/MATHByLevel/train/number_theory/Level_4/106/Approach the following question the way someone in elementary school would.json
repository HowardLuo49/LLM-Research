    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Base prime representation of a natural number is defined using the exponents of its prime factorization as follows. Each place in a base prime represents a prime number, and it is occupied by the corresponding exponent of that prime, starting on the right side with the smallest prime number and proceeding to the left with the next largest prime number. For instance, since $84 = 7^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^2$, then $84$ would be written as $1012$ in base prime. What is $225$ written in base prime?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $225$ is $225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. Since $2$ does not divide into $225$, we treat $2$ as having a $0$ exponent; the next two primes are $3$ and $5$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the prime factorization of 225. Let's see, 225 is the same as 15 times 15, which is 3 times 5 times 3 times 5. So the prime factorization of 225 is 3^2 times 5^2. \n\nNow we need to write that in base prime. We start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, but since 225 doesn't have any 2's in its prime factorization, we can skip that. Next is 3, which has an exponent of 2, so we write down a 2. Then we move on to 5, which also has an exponent of 2, so we write down another 2. \n\nPut it all together, and we get 225 written in base prime as 2200.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 220?: Ok, so we need to find the prime factorization of 225.
