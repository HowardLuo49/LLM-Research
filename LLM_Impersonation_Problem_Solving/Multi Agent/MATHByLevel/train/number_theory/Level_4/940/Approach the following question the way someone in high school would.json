    "solution": "First of all, we see that every term has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6.$ Now, we just need to find how many terms there are. The nth term can be given by the expression $6n - 5.$ Therefore, we set $259 = 6n - 5$ to find $n = 44,$ thus there are $44$ terms in our sum. Thus, the remainder of the sum is the same as the remainder of $44$ when divided by $6,$ which is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum $1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + \\cdots + 253 + 259$ is divided by $6$, first we need to look for a pattern in the numbers.\n\nIf we take a closer look, we see that each number in the sequence is $6$ more than the previous number. So we can write the sequence as $1, 7, 13, 19, \\ldots, 259$ or in general form as $6n + 1$, where $n$ starts from $0$ and ends at $43$.\n\nNow we can find the sum of this arithmetic sequence by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum of the series, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n$S = \\frac{44}{2}(1 + 259) = 22 \\times 260 = 5720$\n\nNow, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by $6$, we divide $5720$ by $6$:\n$5720 \\div 6 = 953 \\text{ with a remainder of } 2$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum $1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + \\cdots + 253 + 259$ is divided by $6$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
