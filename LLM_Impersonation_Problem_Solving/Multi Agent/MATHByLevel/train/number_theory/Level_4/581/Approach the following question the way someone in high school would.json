    "solution": "First notice that $5^n\\equiv 2^n\\pmod 3$, which should make our computations easier. For $n=1,2,3,4$, we get $2^n\\equiv 2,1,2,1\\pmod 3$ respectively and $n^5\\equiv 1,2,0,1\\pmod 3$ respectively. Since we have a congruent pair at $n=\\boxed{4}$, we don't need to look any further.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's look at the options we have for $n \\pmod 3$. Since we want $n$ to be positive and we're looking for the smallest positive integer $n$, we should start with $n=1$. \n\nWhen $n=1$, we have $5^1 \\equiv 1^5 \\pmod 3$, which simplifies to $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. \n\nSince $5$ is not congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$, we check the next option, which is $n=2$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, we have $5^2 \\equiv 2^5 \\pmod 3$, simplifying to $4 \\equiv 32 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSince $4$ is congruent to $2$ mod 3, we continue to try the next option, which is $n=3$.\n\nWhen $n=3$, we have $5^3 \\equiv 3^5 \\pmod 3$, simplifying to $125 \\equiv 243 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSince $125$ is congruent to $2$ mod 3, we try the next option, which is $n=4$.\n\nWhen $n=4$, we have $5^4 \\equiv 4^5 \\pmod 3$, simplifying to $625 \\equiv 1024 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSince $625$ is congruent to $2$ mod 3, we try the next option, which is $n=5$.\n\nWhen $n=5$, we have $5^5 \\equiv 5^5 \\pmod 3$, simplifying to $3125 \\equiv 3125 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSince $3125$ is congruent to $1$ mod 3, we have found that the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $5^n \\equiv n^5 \\pmod 3$ is $n=5$.",
