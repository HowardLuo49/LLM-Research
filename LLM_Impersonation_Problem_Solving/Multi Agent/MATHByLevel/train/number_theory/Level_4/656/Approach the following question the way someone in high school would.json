    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many 0's are located to the right of the decimal point and before the first non-zero digit in the terminating decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{2^5\\cdot5^8}$?",
    "solution": "A terminating decimal can be written in the form $\\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. So we try to get a denominator of the form $10^b$: $$\\frac{1}{2^5\\cdot5^8}\\cdot\\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{2^3}{10^8}=\\frac{8}{10^8}.$$The fraction $\\frac{8}{10^8}$ means that there are 8 digits to the right of the decimal point, the last of which is 8. So there are $\\boxed{7}$ zeroes between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{2^5\\cdot5^8}$, we need to simplify the fraction. Since $2^5 = 32$ and $5^8 = 390625$, the fraction becomes $\\frac{1}{32\\cdot390625}$. Simplifying further, we get $\\frac{1}{12500000}$.\n\nNow, to write this as a decimal, we divide 1 by 12500000. The result is 0.00000008, which means there are 7 zeros to the right of the decimal point before the first non-zero digit, 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7 zeros located to the right of the decimal point before the first non-zero digit in the terminating decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{2^5\\cdot5^8}$.",
