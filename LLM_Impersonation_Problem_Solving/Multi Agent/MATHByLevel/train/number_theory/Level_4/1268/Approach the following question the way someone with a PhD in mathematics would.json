    "solution": "Since $2_7 + 2_7 = 4_7$, the units digit is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit (i.e., the digit in the one's place) of the sum $52_7 + 62_7$, we need to add the two numbers together in base 7.\n\nStarting with $52_7$, we have 5 units and 2 sevens. Converting to base 10, we have $52_7 = 5\\cdot7^1 + 2\\cdot7^0 = 35 + 2 = 37$.\n\nSimilarly, for $62_7$, we have 6 units and 2 sevens. Converting to base 10, we have $62_7 = 6\\cdot7^1 + 2\\cdot7^0 = 42 + 2 = 44$.\n\nNow add $52_7$ and $62_7$ in base 10: $37 + 44 = 81$.\n\nTo find the units digit of 81 in base 7, we need to convert it back to base 7. This gives $81 = 11\\cdot7^1 + 4\\cdot7^0 = 114_7$. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $52_7 + 62_7$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
