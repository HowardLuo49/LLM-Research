    "solution": "We know that at least one of our three consecutive positive integers must be a multiple of $2$ since every other integer in a list of consecutive integers is divisible by $2$. Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$. Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers, we can analyze the prime factorization of the product.\n\nLet the three consecutive positive integers be n, n+1, and n+2. The product of these three integers is:\n\nn * (n+1) * (n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2).\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\n= n(n^2 + 3n + 2)\n= n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n.\n\nNow, let's look at the prime factorization of this product. We can see that n, n+1, and n+2 are three consecutive integers, one of which must be divisible by 2 and another by 3. Therefore, the product of any three consecutive integers must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nIt is also important to note that at least one of the three consecutive integers must be divisible by 3^2 = 9. For example, consider the consecutive integers 6, 7, and 8. 7 is not divisible by 3, but the product of 7, 8, and 9 is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is 2 * 3 * 9 = 54.",
