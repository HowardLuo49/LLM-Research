    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers?",
    "solution": "We know that at least one of our three consecutive positive integers must be a multiple of $2$ since every other integer in a list of consecutive integers is divisible by $2$. Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$. Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by looking at some examples to see if we can spot a pattern. \n\nIf we take the three consecutive numbers 1, 2, and 3, their product is 1*2*3 = 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nIf we take the three consecutive numbers 2, 3, and 4, their product is 2*3*4 = 24. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nIf we take the three consecutive numbers 3, 4, and 5, their product is 3*4*5 = 60. The divisors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is always 6.
