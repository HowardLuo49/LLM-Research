    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place are divisible by $15$?",
    "solution": "Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place. Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place. The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\\times7$ to $15\\times 66$. So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15. Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15. There are $\\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us first establish the criteria for a number to be divisible by $15$. A number is divisible by $15$ if it is divisible by both $3$ and $5$. \n\nTo be divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by $3$. In this case, we have a fixed digit in the units place as $5$, which we know is divisible by $5$. Therefore, the sum of the hundreds and tens digits must also be divisible by $3$.\n\nNext, since the number must also be divisible by $5$, the units digit must be $5$.\n\nLet us denote the hundreds digit as $a$ and the tens digit as $b$. We know that $a+b$ must be divisible by $3$, and $5$ must be the units digit. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $a$ and $b$, while satisfying the conditions, are as follows:\n$(a,b) = (1,4), (4,1), (2,2), (2,5), (5,2), (8,1), (8,4)$\n\nFor each of these pairs, we can construct a valid three-digit number where the units digit is $5$ and the number is divisible by $15$.\n\nTherefore, there are $7$ positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$.",
