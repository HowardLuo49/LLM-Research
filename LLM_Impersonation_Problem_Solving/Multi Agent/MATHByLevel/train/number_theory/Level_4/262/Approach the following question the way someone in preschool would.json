    "solution": "Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place. Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place. The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\\times7$ to $15\\times 66$. So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15. Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15. There are $\\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We know that a number is divisible by $15$ if it is divisible by both $3$ and $5$. \n\nFirst, let's find all the three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place. We can have $105, 205, 305, ... 995$.\n\nThen, let's find which of these numbers are divisible by $3$. If we add up the digits in each number and if the sum is divisible by $3$, then the number is divisible by $3$. \n\nFor example, in $105$, $1+0+5=6$ which is divisible by $3$, so $105$ is divisible by $3$. \n\nNow, let's find which of these numbers are divisible by $5$. This is easy because they all have a $5$ in the units place, so all of them are divisible by $5$.\n\nNow, let's find which of these numbers are divisible by $15$ by finding the intersection of the numbers divisible by $3$ and by $5$.\n\nSo, the positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$ are $105, 225, 315, 375, 435, 495, 555, 615, 675, 735, 795, 855, 915, 975$.\n\nLet's count how many there are! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen! \n\nThere are $14$ positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$.
