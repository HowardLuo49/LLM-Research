    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When a positive integer is expressed in base 7, it is $AB_7$, and when it is expressed in base 5, it is $BA_5$.  What is the positive integer in decimal?",
    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, let's first think about what each digit in the base 7 and base 5 numbers represent. In $AB_7$, the digit A represents the number of sevens and the digit B represents the units. In $BA_5$, the digit B represents the number of fives and the digit A represents the units.\n\nLet's write out the equation using this information:  \n$AB_7 = 7A + B$  \n$BA_5 = 5B + A$\n\nSince the numbers are equal, we can set the equations equal to each other:  \n$7A + B = 5B + A$\n\nNow let's solve for A and B by rearranging the equation:  \n$6A = 4B$  \n$A = \\frac{2}{3}B$\n\nSince A and B are both integers, the only solution is when A = 2 and B = 3.  \nTherefore, the positive integer in decimal is 23.",
