    "solution": "We use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's figure this out together! We know that one number is 180 and the greatest common divisor is 18. So we can divide 180 by 18 to find out the other number. When we do that, we get 10. Hooray! The other number is 10! So the two numbers are 180 and 10.",

We know that one number is 180 and the greatest common divisor is 18. So we can divide 180 by 18 to find out the other number. When we do that, we get 10. Hooray! The other number is 10!
