    "solution": "We use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the other number, we can use the formula: \n\nLeast Common Multiple (LCM) = (number A * number B) / Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)\n\nPlug in the given values:\n\n3780 = (180 * B) / 18\n\nNow we can solve for B:\n\n3780 = 10B\n\nB = 378\n\nTherefore, the other number is 378.",
