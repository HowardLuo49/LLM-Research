    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "We can find the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 2006!$ by considering the units digit of each factorial term individually.\n\nFirst, note that for $n \\geq 5$, the units digit of $n!$ will always be $0$, as any number greater than or equal to $5$ multiplied by the numbers before it will always include a factor of $10$. Therefore, we only need to consider the units digit of the sum up to $4!$.\n\nCalculating the units digit of each factorial term individually:\n$1! = 1$, units digit is $1$\n$2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$, units digit is $2$\n$3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$, units digit is $6$\n$4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$, units digit is $4$\n\nAdding up the units digits of $1! + 2! + 3! + 4!$:\n$1 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 13$\n\nSince we are only interested in the units digit of the sum, we can ignore any further digits in the sum.
