    "solution": "The greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer is $777_8$, which is equal to $7 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 7 = 511$.  This number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so we subtract 1, to get $\\boxed{776_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5, we first consider that a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit (in base 8) is either 0 or 5.\n\nSince we are looking for the greatest 3-digit number, we start by trying to maximize the hundreds digit while keeping the number divisible by 5. Since the base 8 system goes from 0 to 7, we try to find the largest number that, when multiplied by 5, results in a number with three digits. The largest number that satisfies this condition is 1, because 1 * 8^2 = 64, which is less than 100 when multiplied by 5.\n\nTherefore, the largest 3-digit base 8 number that is divisible by 5 is 105.",
