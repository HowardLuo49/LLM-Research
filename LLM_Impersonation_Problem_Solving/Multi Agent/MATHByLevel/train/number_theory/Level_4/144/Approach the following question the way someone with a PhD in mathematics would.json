    "solution": "The prime factorization of 240 is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5$. We want $c$ to be as small as possible, so $c=2$. Now we have $a\\cdot b=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=120$. For the maximum $b$, we seek the minimum $a$ while $b<a$. If $b<a$ then $a\\cdot b<a^2$, so $120<a^2$. That means $a$ is at least 11. However, 11 is not a factor of 240. The least factor of 240 greater than 11 is $2^2\\cdot3=12$. So the minimum $a$ is 12 and that makes the maximum $b=\\frac{2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^2\\cdot3}=2\\cdot5=\\boxed{10}$.",
