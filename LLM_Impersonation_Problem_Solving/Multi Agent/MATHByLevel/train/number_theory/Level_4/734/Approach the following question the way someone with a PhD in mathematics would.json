    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$. What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of abundant numbers and how multiples of 6 relate to them. \n\nAn abundant number is a positive integer where the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. In the case of a number that is a multiple of 6, we can observe that the sum of its proper divisors will always be greater than the number itself. This is because a multiple of 6 will always have proper divisors that include 1, 2, 3, and the number itself, which sums up to a value greater than the number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6 would be a number that is abundant while also not being divisible by 6. One such number is 20. The proper divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10, which sum up to 22, making 20 an abundant number. Additionally, since 20 is not a multiple of 6, it satisfies the conditions of the question.",
