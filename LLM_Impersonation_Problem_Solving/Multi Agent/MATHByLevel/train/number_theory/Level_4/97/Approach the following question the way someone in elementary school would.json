    "solution": "Since $256=2^8$ the divisors of $256$ are the powers of 2 up to $2^8$. So the sum of the proper factors of 256 is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7=\\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the proper divisors of 256, we need to first list all the divisors of 256. The divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. The proper divisors are all the divisors except for 256 itself. So we need to add up 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 to get the sum of the proper divisors of 256. Let's add them up: \n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255 \n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 256 is 255.",
