    "solution": "We can split $0.5\\overline{10}$ into $0.5+0.\\overline{01}$.\n\nFirst we convert $0.\\overline{01}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\\overline{01}=x$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x =1.\\overline{01}$. We subtract those two equations to get: \\begin{align*}\n100 \\cdot x - x &= 1.\\overline{01}-0.\\overline{01} \\quad \\implies \\\\\n99 \\cdot x &=1 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nx&= \\frac{1}{99}.\n\\end{align*}We add 1/99 to $0.5=1/2$ to get $0.5\\overline{01}=\\frac12+\\frac{1}{99}=\\boxed{\\frac{101}{198}}$.",
