    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$. Therefore, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.\nThe largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $8^3=512$. Therefore, there are $8$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\nHowever, we cannot simply add those two numbers together because there are numbers that are both a perfect cube and a perfect square. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it needs to be a $2 \\cdot 3 =6$th power. The largest 6th power less than $555$ is $2^6=64$, so there are $2$ 6th powers less than $555$.\nTherefore, there are $23+8-2=\\boxed{29}$ integers that are either a perfect cube or perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many numbers are perfect cubes first. The perfect cubes less than $555$ are $1^3$, $2^3$, $3^3$, $4^3$, $5^3$, $6^3$ and $7^3$. That's $7$ perfect cubes.\n\nNow let's count how many numbers are perfect squares. The perfect squares less than $555$ are $1^2$, $2^2$, $3^2$, $4^2$, $5^2$, $6^2$, $7^2$, $8^2$, $9^2$, $10^2$, $11^2$, $12^2$, $13^2$, $14^2$, $15^2$, $16^2$, $17^2, $18^2$, $19^2 and $20^2$. That's $20$ perfect squares.\n\nBut we have counted some numbers twice, like $1^2$ and $1^3$. So the numbers that are both perfect cubes and perfect squares are $1^2$, $2^2$, $3^2$, $4^2$ and $5^2$. That's $5$ numbers.\n\nSo the total number of positive integers less than $555$ that are either a perfect cube or a perfect square is $7 + 20 - 5 = 22$.",
