The greatest common divisor of two integers is $(x+2)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+2)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 24, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 2) \\cdot x(x + 2)}{24} = \\frac{x(x + 2)^2}{24}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, or 3, but when $x = 4$, this expression is $4 \\cdot 6^2/24 = 6$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 6 and 24 is 6, and $x + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$.  The least common multiple is 24, and $x(x + 2) = 4 \\cdot (4 + 2) = 24$, so $x = 4$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of the other integer, we need to first find the value of $x$. \n\nSince the greatest common divisor is $(x+2)$, this means that $x+2$ is a factor of both integers. So, if one of the integers is 24, then $x+2$ must be a factor of 24. \n\nLet's list out the factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n\nWe see that $x+2$ must be one of these factors. If we let $x+2 = 2$, then $x = 0$. But since $x$ is a positive integer, we can't have $x = 0$. \n\nNext, let's try $x+2 = 3$, then $x = 1$. This means $x$ is a positive integer and is the smallest possible value.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer is $x(x+2) = 1(1+2) = 3$. So, the other integer is 3.",
