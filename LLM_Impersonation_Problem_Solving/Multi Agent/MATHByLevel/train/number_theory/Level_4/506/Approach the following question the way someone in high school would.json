    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The base-10 numbers 217 and 45 are multiplied. The product is then written in base-6. What is the units digit of the base-6 representation?",
    "solution": "The units digit of a positive integer when expressed in base 6 is the same as the remainder when the integer is divided by 6.  For example, the number $1502_6$ is equal to $1\\cdot 6^3+5\\cdot 6^2+0\\cdot 6+2$, and 6 divides every term except the units digit, 2.  When 217 is divided by 6, the remainder is 1.  When 45 is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.  Therefore, the product of 217 and 45 has a remainder of $1\\cdot 3=\\boxed{3}$ when divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the base-6 representation of the product of 217 and 45, we first need to multiply the two numbers in base-10.\n\n217 * 45 = 9765\n\nNext, we convert 9765 to base-6. To do this, we divide 9765 by 6 to get the quotient and the remainder.\n\n9765 \u00f7 6 = 1627 with a remainder of 3\n\nSo, the base-6 representation of 9765 is 16273. Therefore, the units digit of the base-6 representation is 3.",
