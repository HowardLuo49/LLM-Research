    "solution": "We can tell that the integer is a multiple of $9$ if the sum of its digits is a multiple of $9$. For the largest integer with even digits that is less than $10,\\!000$, it must have the largest even digit, $8$, in the thousands place. So we have $8\\_\\_\\_$. Notice that the maximum integer with even digits is $8888$. However, the digits must add up to a multiple of $9$, and more specifically, an even multiple of $9$ since all of the digits are even. The closest even multiples of $9$ are $18$ and $36$, but the sum of the maximum integer $8888$ is only $32$. So the sum of the digits must be $18$. We maximize the integer with $88\\_\\_$, with a sum of $16$, which leaves a sum of $2$ for the remaining digits. For the digits to be even and to maximize the integer, the tens digit must be $2$ and the units digit must be $0$. The largest integer is $\\boxed{8820}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the biggest number with only even digits that is less than 10,000 and a multiple of 9, we need to think about the even digits we can use: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. \n\nThe biggest number we can make with only even digits is 8888, which is less than 10,000. Is this number a multiple of 9? Let's add up the digits: 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32. Since 32 is not a multiple of 9, we need to find a smaller number.\n\nThe next biggest number we can make is 8886. Let's check if this number is a multiple of 9: 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 = 30. Since 30 is not a multiple of 9, we need to keep looking.\n\nThe next biggest number we can make is 8884. Let's check if this number is a multiple of 9: 8 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 28. Since 28 is not a multiple of 9, we keep going.\n\nThe next biggest number we can make is 8882. Let's check if this number is a multiple of 9: 8 + 8 + 8 + 2 = 26. Since 26 is not a multiple of 9, we keep looking.\n\nThe next biggest number we can make is 8880. Let's check if this number is a multiple of 9: 8 + 8 + 8 + 0 = 24. Since 24 is not a multiple of 9, we need to keep going.\n\nFinally, the biggest number with only even digits that is less than 10,000 and is a multiple of 9 is 888. The sum of the digits is 8 + 8 + 8 = 24, which is a multiple of 9. So, the largest positive integer that meets all the conditions is 888. Yay, we did it!",
