    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the largest positive integer with only even digits that is less than $10,000$ and is a multiple of $9$?",
    "solution": "We can tell that the integer is a multiple of $9$ if the sum of its digits is a multiple of $9$. For the largest integer with even digits that is less than $10,\\!000$, it must have the largest even digit, $8$, in the thousands place. So we have $8\\_\\_\\_$. Notice that the maximum integer with even digits is $8888$. However, the digits must add up to a multiple of $9$, and more specifically, an even multiple of $9$ since all of the digits are even. The closest even multiples of $9$ are $18$ and $36$, but the sum of the maximum integer $8888$ is only $32$. So the sum of the digits must be $18$. We maximize the integer with $88\\_\\_$, with a sum of $16$, which leaves a sum of $2$ for the remaining digits. For the digits to be even and to maximize the integer, the tens digit must be $2$ and the units digit must be $0$. The largest integer is $\\boxed{8820}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest positive integer with only even digits that is less than $10,000$ and is a multiple of $9, we need to look at the possible numbers that fit these criteria.\n\nSince the number has only even digits, the digits that can be used are $2, 4, 6, 8$.\n\nWe know that for a number to be a multiple of $9$, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of $9$. Since all the digits in our number are even, the sum of the digits will also be even.\n\nThe largest sum of even digits less than $36$ ($9*4$) that is a multiple of $9$ is $34$ ($8+8+8+8$). Therefore, the largest possible number that fits all the criteria is $\\boxed{8888}$.",
