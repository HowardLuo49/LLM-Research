    "solution": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "In this problem, we need to find the smallest number greater than 3 that makes the number $23_b$ a perfect square! To solve this, let's start by figuring out what $23_b$ means. \n\nThe number $23_b$ means that we have 2 groups of b (the base number) and 3 groups of 1. So in standard numbers, $23_b$ is equal to $2b + 3$. \n\nNow we want to find a number that makes $2b + 3$ a perfect square. Let's start trying some numbers greater than 3 and see if they make $2b + 3$ a perfect square. \n\nWhen $b=4$, $2b + 3$ is equal to $2(4) + 3 = 11$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nWhen $b=5$, $2b + 3$ is equal to $2(5) + 3 = 13$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nWhen $b=6$, $2b + 3$ is equal to $2(6) + 3 = 15$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nWhen $b=7$, $2b + 3$ is equal to $2(7) + 3 = 17$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nWhen $b=8$, $2b + 3$ is equal to $2(8) + 3 = 19$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nFinally, when $b=9$, $2b + 3$ is equal to $2(9) + 3 = 21$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nSo the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square is $b=4$. \n\nLet's do one more check to make sure: when $b=4$, $2b + 3$ is equal to $2(4) + 3 = 11$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nOops! Sorry, it looks like I made a mistake. The smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square is actually $b=9$. \n\nThank you for your patience!",
