    "solution": "Write $3^{2004}$ as $(3^{4})^{501}$.  Since the units digit of $3^4=81$ is 1, the units digit of any power of $3^4$ is $\\boxed{1}$ as well.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $3^{2004$, we can think about the pattern that the units digits of powers of 3 follow. \n\nWhen we raise 3 to different powers, the units digits cycle through the numbers 3, 9, 7, and 1. So we can start by finding where 2004 falls in this cycle. \n\n2004 is even, so it falls in the cycle as follows:\n- $3^1$ has a units digit of 3\n- $3^2$ has a units digit of 9\n- $3^3$ has a units digit of 7\n- $3^4$ has a units digit of 1\n\nSince 2004 falls at the fourth position in the cycle, the units digit of $3^{2004}$ will be the same as the units digit of $3^4$, which is 1.\n\nSo the units digit of $3^{2004}$ is 1! Yay!",
