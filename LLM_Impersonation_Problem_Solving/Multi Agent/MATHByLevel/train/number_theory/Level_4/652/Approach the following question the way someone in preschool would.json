    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The product of the base seven numbers $24_7$ and $30_7$ is expressed in base seven. What is the base seven sum of the digits of this product?",
    "solution": "We can ignore the $0$ digit for now, and find the product of $24_7 \\times 3_7$. First, we need to multiply the units digit: $4_7 \\times 3_7 = 12_{10} = 15_7$. Hence, we write down a $5$ and carry-over the $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $2_7 \\times 3_7 + 1_7 = 7_{10} = 10_{7}$. Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and $1$ is carried over. Writing this out:  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & & \\stackrel{1}{2} & \\stackrel{}{4}_7 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 3_7 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & & 1 & 0 & 5_7 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$ We can ignore the $0$ in $30_7$, since it does not contribute to the sum. Thus, the answer is $1+0+5 = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nNotice that the base seven sum of the digits of a number leaves the same remainder upon division by $6$ as the number itself.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of $24_7$ and $30_7$, we need to multiply them together. \n\nFirst, we multiply the units place of $24_7$ and $30_7$, which gives us $4 * 0 = 0$. \n\nNext, we multiply the tens place of $24_7$ and $30_7$, which gives us $2 * 0 = 0$. \n\nFinally, we multiply the hundreds place of $24_7$ and $30_7$, which gives us $2 * 3 = 6$. \n\nPutting it all together, the product is $060_7$, which means the sum of the digits is $0 + 6 + 0 = 6$. \n\nSo, the base seven sum of the digits of the product is $6$.
