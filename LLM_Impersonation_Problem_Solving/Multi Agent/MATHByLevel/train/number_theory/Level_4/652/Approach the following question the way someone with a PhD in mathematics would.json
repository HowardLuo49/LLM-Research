    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The product of the base seven numbers $24_7$ and $30_7$ is expressed in base seven. What is the base seven sum of the digits of this product?",
    "solution": "We can ignore the $0$ digit for now, and find the product of $24_7 \\times 3_7$. First, we need to multiply the units digit: $4_7 \\times 3_7 = 12_{10} = 15_7$. Hence, we write down a $5$ and carry-over the $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $2_7 \\times 3_7 + 1_7 = 7_{10} = 10_{7}$. Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and $1$ is carried over. Writing this out:  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & & \\stackrel{1}{2} & \\stackrel{}{4}_7 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 3_7 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & & 1 & 0 & 5_7 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$ We can ignore the $0$ in $30_7$, since it does not contribute to the sum. Thus, the answer is $1+0+5 = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nNotice that the base seven sum of the digits of a number leaves the same remainder upon division by $6$ as the number itself.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of these two numbers in base seven, we first need to convert them to base ten. \n\n$24_7 = 2*7^1 + 4*7^0 = 14$\n$30_7 = 3*7^1 + 0*7^0 = 21$\n\nSo, the product in base ten is $14 * 21 = 294$.\n\nNow, we need to convert 294 back to base seven. \n$294 = 4*7^2 + 2*7^1 + 0*7^0 = 402_7$\n\nTherefore, the base seven sum of the digits of this product is $4 + 0 + 2 = 6$.",
