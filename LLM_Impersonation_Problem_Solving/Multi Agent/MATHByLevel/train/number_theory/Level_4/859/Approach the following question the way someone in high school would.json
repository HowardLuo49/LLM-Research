    "solution": "If the prime factorization of an integer is given as $p_1^{a_1}\\cdot p_2^{a_2}\\cdot p_3^{a_3}\\cdot...$ the number of divisors will be: $$(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)...$$ So, we need to factor 14 in a similar manner to the expression above.  We can write: $$14=(13+1)=(1+1)(6+1)$$ The smallest integer in the first case will be $2^{13}$, and the smallest in the second case will be $2^6\\cdot 3^1=192$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{192}$ is clearly the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors, we need to understand that the number of divisors of a positive integer is related to its prime factorization. \n\nFirst, let's break down the number 14 into its prime factors. 14 can be written as 2 * 7.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many divisors a number has when expressed in terms of its prime factors. If we have the prime factorization of a number as p^a * q^b * r^c, where p, q, r are prime numbers and a, b, c are their respective powers, the number of divisors is given by (a+1)(b+1)(c+1).\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors, we need to think of 14 as the product of two numbers. The possible combinations are 14 * 1 and 7 * 2, which means we need a number with the prime factorization of p^13 or p^6 * q.\n\nThe smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors is 2^6 * 3 = 192.",
