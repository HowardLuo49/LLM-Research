    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Alicia has $n$ candies, where $n$ is a positive integer with three digits. If she buys $5$ more, she will have a multiple of $8$. If she loses $8$, she will have a multiple of $5$. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by the congruences \\begin{align*}n+5\\equiv 0\\pmod 8 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 8,\\\\n-8\\equiv 0\\pmod 5 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.\\end{align*}Since $\\gcd(5,8)=1$, the above congruences imply $n\\equiv 3\\pmod{40}$. This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$. The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$. Thus $\\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we know that if Alicia buys $5$ more candies, she will have a multiple of $8$. This means that after buying $5$ candies, the total number of candies she has will be divisible by $8.\n\nSecond, if Alicia loses $8$ candies, she will have a multiple of $5. This means that after losing $8$ candies, the total number of candies she has will be divisible by $5.\n\nSo, we need to find a number with three digits that satisfies both conditions. The smallest number that satisfies both conditions is $128$, because when Alicia buys $5$ more candies, she will have a total of $133$, which is divisible by $8. And if she loses $8$ candies, she will have a total of $120$, which is divisible by $5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $128$.",
