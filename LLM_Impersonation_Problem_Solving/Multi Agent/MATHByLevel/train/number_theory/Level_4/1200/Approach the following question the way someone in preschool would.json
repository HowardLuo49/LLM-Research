    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. How many of its positive integer factors are perfect squares?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the perfect square factors of 2160, we need to look at the exponents in its prime factorization. We see that the exponents of 2 and 3 are even, which means that any factor that we make by combining these prime factors will be a perfect square.\n\nTo find the total number of perfect square factors, we can add 1 to each of the exponents (4 + 1 = 5 and 3 + 1 = 4) and then multiply these numbers together (5 * 4 = 20). So, there are 20 perfect square factors of 2160. Yay!",
