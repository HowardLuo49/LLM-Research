    "solution": "We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\\leq b \\leq 5.$ So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.",
    "gpt_response": "In high school, we should start by understanding what it means to convert a number into a different base. When we convert a number to a different base, we are essentially expressing that number using a different set of digits.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the number 197, when converted to base $b$, has 4 digits. This means that the largest possible value we can have in base $b$ is $b^4 - 1$, and the smallest possible value is $b^3$, because we need to have 4 digits for the number 197.\n\nWe know that $b$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, so we can set up the inequality $b^3 \\leq 197 \\leq b^4 - 1$.\n\nLet's solve this inequality step by step:\n\nFirst, $b^3 \\leq 197$. We find that $b = 5$ is the smallest possible value that satisfies this inequality.\n\nNext, $197 \\leq b^4 - 1$. We find that $b = 6$ is the smallest possible value that satisfies this inequality.\n\nTherefore, we have found that $5 \\leq b \\leq 6$.
