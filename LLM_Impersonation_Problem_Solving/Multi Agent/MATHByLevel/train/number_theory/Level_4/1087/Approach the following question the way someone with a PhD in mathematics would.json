    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal, we first need to perform the long division.\n\nThe decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be found by performing division as follows:\n$0.\\overline{115384}$\n\nSince the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{26}$ is a repeating decimal with a period of $6$, we can determine the $100$th digit after the decimal point by finding the remainder when $100$ is divided by $6$.\n\n$100 \\div 6 = 16$ with a remainder of $4$.\n\nTherefore, the $100$th digit after the decimal point is the $4$th digit in the repeating block, which is $3$. \n\nHence, the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal is $3$.",
