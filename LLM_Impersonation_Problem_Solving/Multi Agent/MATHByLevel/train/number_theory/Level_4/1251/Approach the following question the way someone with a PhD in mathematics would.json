    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10. What is the largest possible value of $m$?",
    "solution": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the value of $m$, we need to find the largest possible values for $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10, the largest possible value for $x$ is 7 (since 8 and 9 are not prime numbers) and the largest possible value for $y$ is also 7.\n\nThus, we have $x=7$ and $y=7$. The largest three-digit number that can be formed from these values is $777$, which is the largest possible value of $m$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 795?: To maximize the value of $m$, we need to find the largest possible values for $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10, the largest possible value for $x$ is 7 (since 8 and 9 are not prime numbers) and the largest possible value for $y$ is also 7.\n\nThus, we have $x=7$ and $y=7$.
