    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \\gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 4).\n\\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see what happens when we try some numbers for $n$. If we start with $n = 1$, then we have $3(1) + 4 = 7$ and the greatest common divisor of 7 and 1 is 1. \n\nLet's keep trying some more numbers. If we try $n = 2$, then we have $3(2) + 4 = 10$ and the greatest common divisor of 10 and 2 is 2. \n\nHmm, let's try a few more numbers. If we try $n = 3$, then we have $3(3) + 4 = 13$ and the greatest common divisor of 13 and 3 is 1. \n\nOh, I see a pattern! Whenever $n$ is even, the greatest common divisor is 2, and whenever $n$ is odd, the greatest common divisor is 1.\n\nSo the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ would be 1 + 2 = 3. Yay, we did it!",
