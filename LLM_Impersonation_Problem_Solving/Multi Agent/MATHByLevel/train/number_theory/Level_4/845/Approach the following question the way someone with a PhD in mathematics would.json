    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive two-digit integers have an odd number of positive factors?",
    "solution": "Only square numbers have an odd number of factors. The $\\boxed{6}$ two-digit squares are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive two-digit integers that have an odd number of positive factors, we must first understand the concept of factors and their relationships with perfect squares. \n\nFor any positive integer n, we know that the total number of factors of n is equal to the product of the exponents of its prime factors increased by 1. This is due to the fact that every factor of n can be uniquely represented as the product of powers of its prime factors. \n\nFurthermore, we also know that the number of factors of a perfect square is odd, as each factor can be paired with another to form the perfect square. \n\nTherefore, in order for a positive two-digit integer to have an odd number of factors, it must be a perfect square. We can quickly determine that there are 6 two-digit perfect squares: 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. \n\nTherefore, there are 6 positive two-digit integers that have an odd number of positive factors.",
