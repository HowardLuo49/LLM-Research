    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. An $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the numbers that are abundant numbers less than 25, we need to see if the sum of the factors of each number is greater than the number itself.\n\nLet's start with the number 12. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12. So 12 is an abundant number.\n\nNext, let's look at the number 18. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21, which is greater than 18. So 18 is also an abundant number.\n\nNow, let's check the number 20. The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22, which is greater than 20. So 20 is an abundant number as well.\n\nLastly, let's see if the number 24 is an abundant number. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36, which is greater than 24. So 24 is an abundant number.\n\nTherefore, the abundant numbers less than 25 are 12, 18, 20, and 24. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 that are abundant numbers.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 4?: To find the numbers that are abundant numbers less than 25, we need to see if the sum of the factors of each number is greater than the number itself.\n\nLet's start with the number 12. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12. So 12 is an abundant number.\n\nNext, let's look at the number 18.

The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36, which is greater than 24. So 24 is an abundant number.\n\nTherefore, the abundant numbers less than 25 are 12, 18, 20, and 24.
