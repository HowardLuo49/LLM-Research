    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$.  Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$.  Since $1000 = 8\\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples.  Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit.  Altogether, $9 \\cdot 125 = \\boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many positive four-digit numbers are divisible by 8, we can first find how many numbers between 1000 and 9999 are divisible by 8.\n\nNow let's think about what it means for a number to be divisible by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8.\n\nTo find the number of three-digit numbers that are divisible by 8, we can list out all the possible 3 digits numbers 000 to 999 and see which ones are divisible by 8.\n\nBy looking at the list, we see that every 8th three-digit number is divisible by 8. To find how many such numbers there are, we can take 1000/8 = 125.\n\nTherefore, there are 125 positive four-digit integers that are divisible by 8.",
