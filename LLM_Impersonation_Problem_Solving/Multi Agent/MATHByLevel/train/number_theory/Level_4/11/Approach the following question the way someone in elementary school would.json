    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by thinking about the biggest digit we could have in the number. We want the digits to add up to $11$, so we can't have all $3$'s because the largest sum would be $9$. That leaves us with a mix of $3$'s and $2$'s.\n\nLet's start by trying to see if we can make a three-digit number that fits these rules. We could have two $3$'s and one $2$, which would be $332$. But that only adds up to $8$, not $11$. \n\nSo, let's try a four-digit number. We could try three $3$'s and one $2$, which would be $3332$. That adds up to $11$, but we can still do better!\n\nLet's add another digit to our number. Four $3$'s would add up to $12$, so that won't work. But if we add one more $2$, we get $3322$. And that adds up to $11$! \n\nSo, the largest number, all of whose digits are $3$ or $2$, and whose digits add up to $11$ is $3322$. Yay, we did it!",
