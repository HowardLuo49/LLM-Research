    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, the biggest number with digits of 3 and 2 that add up to 11 would be 332, right? Because 3 + 3 + 2 = 8, which is less than 11. And 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 11, which is exactly what we want. So 332 is the biggest number that fits all the rules! Yay!",
