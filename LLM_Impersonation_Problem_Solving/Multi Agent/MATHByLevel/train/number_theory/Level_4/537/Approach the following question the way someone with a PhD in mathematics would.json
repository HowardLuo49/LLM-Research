    "solution": "Factoring out the highest power of 2 that divides 180, we get $180=2^2\\cdot45$. Thus, the odd factors of 180 are all the factors of $45=3^2\\cdot5^1$, which has $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of odd whole number factors of 180, we first need to find the prime factorization of 180. \n\nThe prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^1. \n\nIn order for a factor of 180 to be odd, it cannot contain any powers of 2. Therefore, the only possibilities for the powers of 2 are 0 and 1. \n\nFor the powers of 3 and 5, they can each take on values from 0 to their respective powers in the prime factorization.\n\nTherefore, for the powers of 3, there are 3 choices (0, 1, 2), and for the powers of 5, there are 2 choices (0, 1).\n\nThus, the number of odd whole number factors of 180 can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each prime factor: \n\n(3 choices for 3) * (2 choices for 5) = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 odd whole number factors of 180.",
