    "solution": "We have that \\begin{align*} 249_{11} &= 2(11^2)+ 4(11^1) +9(11^0) \\\\\n&= 2(121)+4(11)+9(1)\\\\\n&= 242 + 44 + 9\\\\\n&= 295\\\\\n3AB_{12} &= 3(12^2)+ 10(12^1) +11(12^0) \\\\\n&= 3(144)+10(12)+11(1)\\\\\n&= 432 + 120 + 11\\\\\n&= 563\n\\end{align*}So, $249_{11}+3AB_{12}=295+563=\\boxed{858}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have $249_{11}+3AB_{12}$. Let's start by converting $249_{11}$ to base 10.\n\nTo do that, we can use the place value of each digit and multiply by 11 raised to the power of the place value. So,\n$249_{11} = 2*11^2 + 4*11^1 + 9*11^0 = 2*121 + 4*11 + 9*1 = 242 + 44 + 9 = 295$ in base 10.\n\nNow let's look at $3AB_{12}$. Since $A$ represents 10 in base 12 and $B$ represents 11, we can rewrite $3AB_{12}$ in base 10 as:\n$3AB_{12} = 3*12^2 + 10*12^1 + 11*12^0 = 3*144 + 10*12 + 11*1 = 432 + 120 + 11= 563$ in base 10.\n\nAdd the two base 10 numbers together:\n$295 + 563 = 858$.\n\nSo, $249_{11}+3AB_{12} = 858$ in base 10.",
