    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When $x$ is divided by each of $4$, $5$, and $6$, remainders of $3$, $4$, and $5$ (respectively) are obtained. What is the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$?",
    "solution": "Note that $x+1$ is divisible by $4$, $5$, and $6$. Therefore, it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is $60$. Therefore, the smallest value for $x+1$ is $60$ and the smallest possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start with the first number, $4$. If $x$ divided by $4$ leaves a remainder of $3$, that means $x$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $4$. So the possible values for $x$ could be $4+3$, $8+3$, $12+3$, and so on.\n\nNext, let's look at the second number, $5$. If $x$ divided by $5$ leaves a remainder of $4$, that means $x$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $5$. So the possible values for $x$ could be $5+4$, $10+4$, $15+4$, and so on.\n\nLastly, let's think about when $x$ is divided by $6$ and leaves a remainder of $5$. That means $x$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $6$. So the possible values for $x$ could be $6+5$, $12+5$, $18+5$, and so on.\n\nNow, let's try to find a number that satisfies all three conditions (leaving a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$, $4$ when divided by $5$, and $5$ when divided by $6$). After checking a few values, we find that $59$ is the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three conditions.\n\nSo the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
