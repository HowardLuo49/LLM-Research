A two-digit integer $AB$ equals $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the three-digit integer $AAB$, where $A$ and $B$ represent distinct digits from 1 to 9. What is the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer $AAB$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite $AB$ as $10A+B$ and $AAB$ as $100A+10A+B$. Now we set $AAB=9\\cdot AB$ since $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of $AAB$. \\begin{align*}\n100A+10A+B&=9(10A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=90A+9B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5A&=2B\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ such that $5A=2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$. So $AAB=\\boxed{225}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have two numbers: a two-digit number AB and a three-digit number AAB. The two-digit number AB is equal to 1/9 of the three-digit number AAB. This means that AAB is 9 times bigger than AB.\n\nSince A and B are distinct digits from 1 to 9, let's start with the smallest possible value for AB, which is 12. To find AAB, we need to multiply 12 by 9, which equals 108. So the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer AAB is 108.",
