A two-digit integer $AB$ equals $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the three-digit integer $AAB$, where $A$ and $B$ represent distinct digits from 1 to 9. What is the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer $AAB$?",
    "solution": "We rewrite $AB$ as $10A+B$ and $AAB$ as $100A+10A+B$. Now we set $AAB=9\\cdot AB$ since $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of $AAB$. \\begin{align*}\n100A+10A+B&=9(10A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=90A+9B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5A&=2B\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ such that $5A=2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$. So $AAB=\\boxed{225}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have a two-digit integer $AB$ that equals $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the three-digit integer $AAB$. We want to find the smallest possible value of $AAB$.\n\nLet's first write out what we know. Since $AB$ is a two-digit number, we can write it as $10A+B$. And since $AAB$ is a three-digit number, we can write it as $100A+10A+B=110A+B$.\n\nNow we can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{9}(110A+B)=10A+B$ and solve for $A$ and $B$. Multiplying both sides by 9 gives us $110A + B = 90A + 9B$. Simplifying this equation gives us $20A = 8B$, which means $5A = 2B$.\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits from 1 to 9, the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ that satisfy $5A = 2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for the three-digit integer $AAB$ is $110A + B = 110(2) + 5 = \\boxed{225}$.",
