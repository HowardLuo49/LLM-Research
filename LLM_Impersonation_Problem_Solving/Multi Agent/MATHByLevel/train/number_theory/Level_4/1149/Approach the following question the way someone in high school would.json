    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The digits of a four-digit positive integer add up to 14. The sum of the two middle digits is nine, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one. If the integer is divisible by 11, what is the integer?",
    "solution": "Let the integer be $abcd$.  We know that \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d&=14,\\\\\nb+c&=9,\\\\\na-d&=1.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$.  Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.\n\nNow, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.  Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$.  If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$.  With the second equation above, we now have \\begin{align*}\nc-b&=-1,\\\\\nc+b&=9.\n\\end{align*} Adding these equations, we get $2c=8$, or $c=4$.  Substituting this back in, we get $b=5$.  Thus the integer is $\\boxed{3542}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find a four-digit number where the digits add up to 14, the middle two digits add up to 9, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is 1. \n\nSince the sum of the digits is 14, let's try different combinations of digits to see if we can find the right one. We can start by trying different numbers for the thousands and units digits.\n\nLet's say the thousands digit is 5, then the units digit would be 4 (since 5 - 4 = 1). That leaves us with 5 + _ + _ + 4 = 14, where the two middle digits add up to 9. If we try different combinations, we find that the middle two digits must be 3 and 6. So, our number is 5364.\n\nTo see if this number is divisible by 11, we subtract the sum of the even-placed digits from the odd-placed digits: (5 + 6) - (3 + 4) = 11 - 7 = 4, which is not divisible by 11. So, our number is not 5364.\n\nLet's keep trying different combinations until we find a number that meets all the conditions and is also divisible by 11.",
