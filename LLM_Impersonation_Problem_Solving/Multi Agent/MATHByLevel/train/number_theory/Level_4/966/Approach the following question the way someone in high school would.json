    "solution": "To express the number $0.42\\overline{153}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $1000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&1000x &=& 421&.53153153153\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.42153153153\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&999x &=& 421&.11\n\\end{array}$$This shows that $0.42\\overline{153} = \\frac{421.11}{999} = \\frac{42111}{99900}$.\n\nSo, $x=\\boxed{42111}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$, we first need to understand what the decimal $0.42\\overline{153}$ means. The line above the last three digits tells us that the number $153$ repeats infinitely. \n\nTo convert this decimal to a fraction, let $y = 0.42\\overline{153}$. Multiply both sides of the equation by $1000$ to get $1000y = 421.\\overline{153}$.\n\nSubtract the original equation $y = 0.42\\overline{153}$ from the equation above: $1000y - y = 421.\\overline{153} - 0.42\\overline{153}$. Simplifying gives $999y = 421$. \n\nNow, to get $y$ alone, divide both sides by $999$: $\\frac{999y}{999} = \\frac{421}{999}$. Thus, $y = \\frac{421}{999}$.\n\nSince the decimal $0.42\\overline{153}$ can be expressed as the fraction $\\frac{421}{999}$, the value of $x$ in the fraction $\\frac{x}{99900}$ is $\\boxed{421}$.",
