    "solution": "To express the number $0.42\\overline{153}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $1000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&1000x &=& 421&.53153153153\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.42153153153\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&999x &=& 421&.11\n\\end{array}$$This shows that $0.42\\overline{153} = \\frac{421.11}{999} = \\frac{42111}{99900}$.\n\nSo, $x=\\boxed{42111}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step! First, we need to understand that when a number has a bar over it, like $0.42\\overline{153}$, it means that the digits repeat indefinitely. So, we can write this number as $0.4215315315315...$.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many decimal places are in the repeating part. In this case, the repeating part is $153$, which has 3 digits. \n\nTo convert this repeating decimal to a fraction, we can use the formula for repeating decimals: \n$0.\\overline{a} = \\frac{a}{9}$\n\nSince we have 3 repeating digits, we can write $0.153\\overline{153}$ as $\\frac{153}{999}$.\n\nFinally, since $0.42$ is a part of our original number $0.42\\overline{153}$, we need to add it to our fraction. \n\n$0.42 = \\frac{42}{100}$.\n\nNow, we can add $\\frac{42}{100}$ to $\\frac{153}{999}$:\n\n$\\frac{42}{100} + \\frac{153}{999} = \\frac{42*999 + 153*100}{100*999} = \\frac{41958 + 15300}{99900} = \\frac{57258}{99900}$.\n\nSo, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{57258}$.",
