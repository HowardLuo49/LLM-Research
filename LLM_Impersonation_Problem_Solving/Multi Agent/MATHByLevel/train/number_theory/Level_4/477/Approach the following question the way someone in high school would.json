A magic square is an array of numbers in which the sum of the numbers in each row, in each column, and along the two main diagonals are equal. The numbers in the magic square shown are not written in base 10. For what base will this be a magic square?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.75cm);\nfor (int i=0; i<4; ++i) {\ndraw((0,i)--(3,i),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((i,0)--(i,3),linewidth(0.7));\n}\nlabel(\"1\",(1.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(2.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(0.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"4\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"10\",(1.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"11\",(2.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"12\",(2.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"13\",(0.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"14\",(1.5,0),N);\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "Let $b$ be the base in which the numbers in the square are expressed. The first row and the first column must have the same sum, which implies that $1+11_b = 4+3$. Writing $11_b$ as $b+1$, we find that $1+b+1 = 7$, which implies $b=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out in what base this magic square works, we need to figure out the sum of each row, column, and diagonal.\n\nLet's start with the rows. The sum of the first row is 1 + 10 + 14 = sum. The sum of the second row is 3 + 11 + x = sum. The sum of the third row is 4 + 12 + 13 = sum. \n\nNow let's move on to the columns. The sum of the first column is 1 + 3 + 4 = sum. The sum of the second column is 10 + 11 + 12 = sum. The sum of the third column is 14 + x + 13 = sum.\n\nFinally, let's consider the main diagonals. The sum of the first diagonal is 1 + 11 + 13 = sum. The sum of the second diagonal is 14 + 11 + 4 = sum.\n\nFor this magic square to work in a base other than base 10, the sum of each row, column, and diagonal should be the same. Based on the equations we set up, it seems like the sum we need is not a whole number in base 10, making it hard for us to determine the exact base this magic square will work in using high school level math.",
