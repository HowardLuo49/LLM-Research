    "solution": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits, we need to consider the largest digit that can be used in base $b$. Since we are limited to three digits, the largest possible digit is $(b-1)$.\n\nNow, we can express 62 in base $b$ by considering the place values of each digit. Let $x$, $y$, and $z$ be the three digits used to represent 62 in base $b$, we have:\n\n$62 = x(b^2) + y(b) + z$\n\nSince $b$ is the base, we have $x, y, z < b$. By considering the largest possible digit, we have $x, y, z < (b-1)$. Hence, we can write the equation as:\n\n$62 = (b-1)(b^2) + (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^3 - b^2 + b^2 - b + b - 1 = b^3 - 1$\n\nTo find the smallest whole number $b$ that satisfies this equation, we need to solve for $b$:\n\n$b^3 - 1 = 62$\n\n$b^3 = 63$\n\n$b = \\sqrt[3]{63} \\approx 3.91$\n\nTherefore, the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits is 4.",
