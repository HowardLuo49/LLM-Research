    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many perfect squares less than 1000 have a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4?",
    "solution": "Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8.  Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find perfect squares with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4, we can start by looking at the possible values for the ones digit of a square number. \n\nLet's think about the possible ones digits of perfect squares:\n- If the ones digit is 0, the square root can end in 0 or 5.\n- If the ones digit is 1, the square root can end in 1 or 9.\n- If the ones digit is 2, the square root can end in 4 or 6.\n- If the ones digit is 3, the square root can end in 3 or 7.\n- If the ones digit is 4, the square root can end in 2, 8, 4, or 6.\n- If the ones digit is 5, the square root must end in 5.\n- If the ones digit is 6, the square root can end in 4 or 6.\n- If the ones digit is 7, the square root can end in 3 or 7.\n- If the ones digit is 8, the square root can end in 2, 8, 4, or 6.\n- If the ones digit is 9, the square root can end in 1 or 9.\n\nNow, let's focus on the ones digits 2, 3, and 4. We can see that the square roots that give a perfect square with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4, are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nSo, the perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4 are:\n- 4^2 = 16\n- 6^2 = 36\n- 8^2 = 64\n\nThere are 3 perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4.",
