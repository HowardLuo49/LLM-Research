    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The integer $x$ has 12 positive factors. The numbers 12 and 15 are factors of $x$. What is $x$?",
    "solution": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$, we first note that if $x$ has 12 positive factors, then $x$ can be expressed as $x=p_1^{m_1}p_2^{m_2}\\cdots p_n^{m_n}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ are distinct prime numbers and $m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_n$ are positive integers.\n\nGiven that 12 and 15 are factors of $x$, we can express 12 as $2^2\\times 3$ and 15 as $3\\times5$. Since 12 and 15 are factors of $x$, the prime factorization of $x$ should include both $2, 3,$ and $5$, and the powers of these prime numbers should be at least as large as found in the factorization of 12 and 15.\n\nTherefore, we can write $x=2^2\\times 3^1\\times 5^1=60$.\n\nHence, the value of $x$ is 60.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 60?: To find the value of $x$, we first note that if $x$ has 12 positive factors, then $x$ can be expressed as $x=p_1^{m_1}p_2^{m_2}\\cdots p_n^{m_n}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ are distinct prime numbers and $m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_n$ are positive integers.\n\nGiven that 12 and 15 are factors of $x$, we can express 12 as $2^2\\times 3$ and 15 as $3\\times5$.
