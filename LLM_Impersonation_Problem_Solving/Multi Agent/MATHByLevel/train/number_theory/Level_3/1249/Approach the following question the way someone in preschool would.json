    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's see what happens with smaller numbers. Let's start by finding the last three digits of $3^2$. \n$3^2 = 9$, so the last 3 digits of $3^2$ is 009. \n\nNow, let's find the last three digits of $3^{20}$. \n$3^{20}=(3^2)^{10}=9^{10}$. Since the last three digits of $9^{10}$ is 001, then the last three digits of $3^{20}$ is also 001.\n\nNow that we found the pattern, let's find the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ using the pattern we found. \n$3^{12000}=(3^{20})^{600}$. \nSince the last three digits of $3^{20}$ is 001, then the last digits of $3^{12000}$ is also 001. \n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ is 001.",
