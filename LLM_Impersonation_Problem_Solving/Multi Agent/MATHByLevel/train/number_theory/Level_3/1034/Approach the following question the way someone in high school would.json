    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many different positive values of $x$ will make this statement true: there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$.",
    "solution": "If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$.  Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$ (or else there would be $3$, not $2$ multiples in the two-digit range).\n\nIt may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nThe largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.  Every value of $x$ from $34$ to $49$ works.\n\nNow, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.  This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!  Suppose we subtract $33$ from each number.  Then we are counting the numbers from $1$ to $16,$ and so there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break this down. We know that a multiple of a number is a product of that number and another whole number. So for positive two-digit multiples of $x$, we are looking for numbers that are greater than $9x$ but less than $100x$.\n\nSince we want exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, we need to consider the possibilities:\n\n1. $9x < 10x$: This means $x$ must be greater than $1$ for there to be two-digit multiples of $x$.\n\n2. $99x < 100x$: This means $x$ must be less than $100$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can see that $x$ must be a two-digit number between $1$ and $99$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{98}$ different positive values of $x$ that will make the statement true.",
