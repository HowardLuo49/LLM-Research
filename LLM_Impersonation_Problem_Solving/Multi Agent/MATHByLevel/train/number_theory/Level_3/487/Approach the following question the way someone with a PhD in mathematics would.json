    "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 4x - 3x \\\\\n&\\equiv 8-16 \\\\\n&\\equiv -8\\quad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $$x^2\\equiv (-8)^2 = 64\\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{20}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To start, we can simplify the two congruence equations given by dividing both sides by the GCD of the coefficients and the modulus.\n\nFor the first congruence $4x\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$, we divide by the GCD of 4 and 20, which is 4. This gives $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\nFor the second congruence $3x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, we divide by the GCD of 3 and 20, which is 1. This gives $x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$.\n\nNow, since we have two congruence equations for $x$, we can find the intersection to find a unique solution for $x$.\n\n$x\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$ can be written as $x=5k+2$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstitute this into $x\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$, we get $5k+2\\equiv 16\\pmod{20}$.\nThis simplifies to $5k\\equiv 14\\pmod{20}$.\nDividing by 5, we get $k\\equiv 8\\pmod{20}$.\n\nSo, the solution for $x$ is $x=5(8)+2=42$.\n\nNow, to find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20, we calculate $x^2\\equiv 42^2\\equiv 1764\\equiv 4\\pmod{20}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20 is 4.",
