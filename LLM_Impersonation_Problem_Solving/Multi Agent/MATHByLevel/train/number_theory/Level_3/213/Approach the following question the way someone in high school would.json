    "solution": "Since $a$ is its own inverse modulo $n$, $a\\equiv a^{-1}\\pmod n$. Then \\[a^2\\equiv a\\cdot a\\equiv a\\cdot a^{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{1}\\pmod n.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so let's break this down. First of all, if $a$ is its own inverse modulo $n$, that means $a \\cdot a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. In other words, $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.\n\nSo when we divide $a^2$ by $n$, the remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.",
