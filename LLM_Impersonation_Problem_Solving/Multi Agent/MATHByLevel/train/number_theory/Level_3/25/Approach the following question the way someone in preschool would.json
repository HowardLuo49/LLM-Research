    "solution": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the factors of some numbers! The number $6$ has $4$ factors: $1, 2, 3,$ and $6$. The number $16$ has $5$ factors: $1, 2, 4, 8,$ and $16$.\n\nNow let's find the greatest number less than $100$ that has an odd number of factors. The number $81$ has $5$ factors: $1, 3, 9, 27,$ and $81$. Since $5$ is an odd number, $81$ is the greatest whole number less than $100$ that has an odd number of positive factors. Yay!",
