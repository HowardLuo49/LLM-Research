    "solution": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! So the greatest whole number less than 100 is 96. Let's check how many positive factors it has. The factors of 96 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. Counting these up, we have 12 factors. Since 12 is an even number, 96 doesn't have an odd number of positive factors. Let's try the next number, 90. The factors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. Counting these up, we have 12 factors again, which is not an odd number. Let's keep going! The number 81 has the factors 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81. That's only 5 factors, which is an odd number. So, the greatest whole number less than 100 with an odd number of positive factors is 81.",
