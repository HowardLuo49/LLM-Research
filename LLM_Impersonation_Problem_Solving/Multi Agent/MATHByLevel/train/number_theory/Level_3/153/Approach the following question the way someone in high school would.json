    "solution": "Since $77=7\\cdot11$, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77. Their sum is $1+7+11+7\\cdot11=\\boxed{96}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all the positive integer divisors of 77, we first need to list out all of the divisors of 77. These include 1, 7, 11, and 77. \n\nThen, we simply add them all together: \n1 + 7 + 11 + 77 = 96\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77 is 96.",
