    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $a$ has $3$ factors and $b$ has $a$ factors. If $b$ is divisible by $a$, then what is the least possible value of $b?$",
    "solution": "Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime. The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors. The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4. It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's determine the possible values of $a$. Since $a$ has $3$ factors, it must be a prime number, since the only factors of a prime number are $1$, the number itself, and the prime number. \n\nThe first prime number is $2$, which has $3$ factors: $1, 2,$ and itself. Therefore, $a$ could be $2$. \n\nNow, we need to find a number $b$ that has $2$ factors (since $a=2$) and is divisible by $2$. The smallest such number is $4$, which has factors $1$ and $4$.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
