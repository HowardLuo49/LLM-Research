    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many numbers from $1$ to $150$ are not perfect squares or perfect cubes?",
    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find all the perfect squares and cubes from $1$ to $150$. \n\nPerfect squares: $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$, $5^2 = 25$, $6^2 = 36$, $7^2 = 49$, $8^2 = 64$, $9^2 = 81$, $10^2 = 100$, $11^2 = 121$, $12^2 = 144$\n\nSo, there are $12$ perfect squares from $1$ to $150$.\n\nPerfect cubes: $1^3 = 1$, $2^3 = 8$, $3^3 = 27$, $4^3 = 64$, $5^3 = 125$\n\nSo, there are $5$ perfect cubes from $1$ to $150$. \n\nNow, let's find the numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. \n\nWe see that $1$ is the only number that is both a perfect square and perfect cube. \n\nTherefore, there are $150$ total numbers from $1$ to $150$, $12$ perfect squares, $5$ perfect cubes, and $1$ number that is both a perfect square and perfect cube.\n\nTo find the numbers that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes, we subtract the total number of perfect squares, perfect cubes, and the number that is both from the total number of numbers. \n\n$150 - 12 - 5 + 1 = 134$\n\nTherefore, there are $134$ numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes.",
