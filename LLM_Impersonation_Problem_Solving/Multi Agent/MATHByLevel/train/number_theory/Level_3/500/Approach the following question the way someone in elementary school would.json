    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A roll of quarters contains $40$ quarters and a roll of dimes contains $50$ dimes. James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.  Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes. James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible. In dollars, how much are the leftover quarters and dimes worth?",
    "solution": "We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's see how many complete rolls of quarters and dimes James and Lindsay can make. Since a roll of quarters has 40 quarters and a roll of dimes has 50 dimes, James can make 2 rolls of quarters and 3 rolls of dimes. Lindsay can make 3 rolls of quarters and 5 rolls of dimes.\n\nNow let's see how many quarters and dimes are leftover. James has 3 quarters left ($83 - 2\\cdot40$) and 9 dimes left ($159 - 3\\cdot50$). Lindsay has 9 quarters left ($129 - 3\\cdot40$) and 16 dimes left ($266 - 5\\cdot50$).\n\nNow let's find the value of the leftover quarters and dimes. Each quarter is worth $0.25$ dollars and each dime is worth $0.10$ dollars. James' leftover quarters are worth $3\\cdot0.25 = 0.75$ dollars and his leftover dimes are worth $9\\cdot0.10 = 0.90$ dollars. Lindsay's leftover quarters are worth $9\\cdot0.25 = 2.25$ dollars and her leftover dimes are worth $16\\cdot0.10 = 1.60$ dollars.\n\nIn total, the leftover quarters and dimes are worth $0.75 + 0.90 + 2.25 + 1.60 = 5.50$ dollars.",
