James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.  Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes. James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible. In dollars, how much are the leftover quarters and dimes worth?",
    "solution": "We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count the quarters! James has $83$ quarters and Lindsay has $129$ quarters, so together they have $83 + 129 = 212$ quarters. \n\nA roll of quarters has $40$ quarters, so James and Lindsay can make $212 \\div 40 = 5$ complete rolls with their quarters. This means there are $212 - 5 \\cdot 40 = 12$ quarters left over.\n\nNow let's count the dimes! James has $159$ dimes and Lindsay has $266$ dimes, so together they have $159 + 266 = 425$ dimes.\n\nA roll of dimes has $50$ dimes, so James and Lindsay can make $425 \\div 50 = 8$ complete rolls with their dimes. This means there are $425 - 8 \\cdot 50 = 25$ dimes left over.\n\nNow let's find out how much the leftover quarters and dimes are worth! Each quarter is worth $0.25$ dollars, so $12$ quarters are worth $12 \\cdot 0.25 = $3 dollars. Each dime is worth $0.10$ dollars, so $25$ dimes are worth $25 \\cdot 0.10 = $2.50 dollars. \n\nTherefore, the leftover quarters and dimes are worth $3 + 2.50 = $5.50 dollars!",
