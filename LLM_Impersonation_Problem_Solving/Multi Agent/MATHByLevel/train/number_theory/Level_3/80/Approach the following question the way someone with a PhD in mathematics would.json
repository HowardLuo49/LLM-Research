    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A $\\textit{composite number}$ is a number that has two or more prime factors. The number 87 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers in many ways. What is the minimum positive difference between two such numbers?",
    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that sum to 87, we first need to consider the prime factorization of 87. \n\nThe prime factorization of 87 is 3 x 29.\n\nSince 3 is a prime number, we need to find composite numbers that are a multiple of 3 in order to sum to 87.\n\nOne possible pair of composite numbers that sum to 87 is 63 and 24. Both 63 and 24 are composite numbers as they can be further divided into prime factors.\n\nThe difference between 63 and 24 is 39.\n\nTo determine if this is the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that sum to 87, we should investigate if there are any other pairs of composite numbers that also sum to 87 with a smaller difference.\n\nAfter exploring all possible combinations, we can conclude that the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that sum to 87 is 39.",
