    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest whole number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. The given system of congruences is \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na\\equiv 1\\pmod 4\\\\\na\\equiv 2\\pmod 5\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=1$, $(1)$ and $(2)$ together imply that $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {12}$. So there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+12n$. Substituting this into $(3)$ yields $$1+12n\\equiv 2\\pmod 5,$$ $$\\implies n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.$$ So $n$ has a lower bound of $3$. Then $$n\\ge 3,$$ $$\\implies a=1+12n\\ge 37.$$ Since $37$ satisfies all three congruences, $a=\\boxed{37}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let n be the smallest whole number that satisfies the given conditions. We can express n in terms of the remainders when divided by 4, 3, and 5 as follows:\n\nn \u2261 1 (mod 4)\nn \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nn \u2261 2 (mod 5)\n\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find a unique solution for n modulo 4*3*5 = 60. This involves finding integers x, y, and z such that:\n\nn = 1 + 4x = 1 + 3y = 2 + 5z\n\nFrom the first two equations, we can deduce that n = 1 + 4x = 1 + 3y => 4x = 3y. By solving this equivalence modulo 3, we obtain x \u2261 0 (mod 3) and y \u2261 0 (mod 4).\n\nTherefore, n = 1 + 60x, where x is an integer. Since we are looking for the smallest whole number n, we must set x = 0. Thus, n = 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest whole number that satisfies the given conditions is n = 1.",
