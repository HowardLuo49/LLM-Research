    "solution": "Summing the two numbers, you are left with a residue of $2$ when adding $7$ and $3$. Carrying over $1$, you once again have a residue of $2$ and carry over $1$. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & &_{1} & _{1}& \\\\ & & 3& 2 & 7_8 \\\\ &+ & & 7 & 3_8 \\\\ \\cline{2-5} && 4& 2 & 2_8 \\\\ \\end{array}$$Therefore, the sum is $\\boxed{422_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of $327_8$ and $73_8, we first add the last digits, which are 7 and 3. \n7 + 3 = 10 in base 10, but in base 8, 10 is written as 12. So we write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNext, we add the second digits from the right, which are 2 and 7. With the carryover, we have 2 + 7 + 1 = 10 in base 10, which is written as 12 in base 8. So we write down 2 and carry over 1 again.\n\nFinally, we add the first digits on the left, which are 3 and 0 (since we already did the carryover). 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nSo the sum of $327_8$ and $73_8$ in base 8 is $332_8$.",
