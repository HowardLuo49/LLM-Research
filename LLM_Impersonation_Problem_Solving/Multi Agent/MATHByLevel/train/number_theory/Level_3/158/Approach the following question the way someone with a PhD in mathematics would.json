    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$. Using this fact, we find that the greatest multiple of $9$ that is less than $-1111$ is $-1116$.\n\nWe have $-1111 = -1116+5$. That is, $-1111$ is equal to a multiple of $9$ plus $5$. Therefore, $$-1111\\equiv \\boxed{5}\\pmod 9.$$To verify this answer, we can check that $9$ divides $(-1111)-5 = -1116$; it does, so our answer is correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ that satisfies the given congruence $-1111 \\equiv n \\pmod 9$, we must first simplify the left-hand side of the congruence.\n\nTo simplify $-1111$ modulo 9, we note that $-1111 = -123 \\times 9 + 6$. Therefore, $-1111 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$.\n\nSo, we have $6 \\equiv n \\pmod 9$. This implies that $n$ is an integer that has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9. Since $0 \\leq n < 9$, the only integer $n$ that satisfies this condition is $n = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies $-1111 \\equiv n \\pmod 9$ is $n = 6$.",
