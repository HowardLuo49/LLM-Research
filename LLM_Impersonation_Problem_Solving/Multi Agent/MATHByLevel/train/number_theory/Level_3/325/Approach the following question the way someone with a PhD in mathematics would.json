    "solution": "Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$.  Then $n^2 \\equiv d^2 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$.  Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number, we consider the possible values that the units digit can take on. \n\nA perfect square number is of the form \\(n^2\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer. The units digit of a perfect square number is determined by the units digit of the square of the units digit of \\(n\\). \n\nThe units digit of the square of an integer can only be one of the following: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. This is because the square of any integer ending in 2, 3, 7, or 8 will have a units digit of 4, and the square of any integer ending in 4 or 6 will have a units digit of 6.\n\nTherefore, the distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.",
