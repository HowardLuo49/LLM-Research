    "solution": "Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$.  Then $n^2 \\equiv d^2 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$.  Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we can look at the squares of all the single-digit numbers from 0 to 9. When we do this, we see that the units digit of a perfect square can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. So there are a total of 6 distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 6?: To figure this out, we can look at the squares of all the single-digit numbers from 0 to 9. When we do this, we see that the units digit of a perfect square can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. So there are a total of 6 distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number.",
