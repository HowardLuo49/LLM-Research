    "solution": "The binary number $b_k b_{k - 1} \\dots b_2 b_1 b_0$ is equal to $2^k b_k + 2^{k - 1} b_{k - 1} + \\dots + 4b_2 + 2b_1 + b_0$, so when this number is divided by 4, the remainder is $2b_1 + b_0$.  Hence, when the number $100101110010_2$ is divided by 4, the remainder is $2 \\cdot 1 + 0 = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of a binary number when divided by 4, we just need to look at the last two digits of the binary number. In this case, the last two digits are 10. \n\nConverting 10 from binary to decimal, we have 2. So, the remainder when $100101110010_2$ is divided by 4 is 2 in base 10.",
