    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many natural-number factors does $\\textit{N}$ have if $\\textit{N} = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1$?",
    "solution": "Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$ where $0 \\le a \\le 3$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$ and $0 \\le c \\le 1$. In other words, there are 4 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and 2 choices for $c$. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{24}$ natural-number factors of $N$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of natural number factors of N, we first observe that a factor of N must take the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 3$, $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$, and $0 \\leq c \\leq 1$.\n\nFor each prime factor of N, we have one more option for the exponent than the actual exponent in the prime factorization. This is because the exponents can range from 0 to the actual exponent inclusive.\n\nTherefore, for the prime factor 2, we have 4 choices for the exponent (0, 1, 2, 3). For the prime factor 3, we have 3 choices for the exponent (0, 1, 2). For the prime factor 5, we have 2 choices for the exponent (0, 1).\n\nTo find the total number of factors, we multiply these choices together: 4 choices for 2, 3 choices for 3, and 2 choices for 5 gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ natural number factors of N.",
