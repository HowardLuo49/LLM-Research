    "solution": "Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$ where $0 \\le a \\le 3$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$ and $0 \\le c \\le 1$. In other words, there are 4 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and 2 choices for $c$. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{24}$ natural-number factors of $N$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of a number, we need to look at the exponents in the prime factorization. \n\nFor the number $N = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1$, we can find the number of factors by adding 1 to each exponent and then multiplying those results together. \n\nSo, to find the number of factors for $N$, we do: \n$(3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$ \n\nSo, the number $N$ has 24 factors.",
