    "solution": "The prime factorization of 135 is $3^3 \\cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{7020}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least common multiple of 135 and 468, we first need to list out the prime factors of each number.\n\nFor 135:\n135 = 3 x 3 x 3 x 5 = 3^3 x 5\n\nFor 468:\n468 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 13 = 2^2 x 3^2 x 13\n\nNext, we need to identify the common factors between the two numbers. The common factors are 3^2.\n\nTo find the least common multiple, we multiply the common factors and the remaining factors of each number:\nLeast common multiple = 3^2 x 5 x 2^2 x 13 = 9 x 5 x 4 x 13 = 2340\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is 2340.",
