    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The sum of all the positive factors of integer $x$ is 24. If one of the factors is 3, what is the value of $x$?",
    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's first list out all the factors of 3: 1 and 3. Since one of the factors of $x$ is 3, that means $x$ must be a multiple of 3. \n\nNext, let's find the other factors of $x$ that add up to 24. Since we know that $x$ is a multiple of 3, the other factors must also be multiples of 3. The factors of 3 that are less than 24 are: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12. \n\nSince the sum of all the factors is 24, this means that $x$ must be $3 + 6 + 9 + 12 = 30$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is 30.",
