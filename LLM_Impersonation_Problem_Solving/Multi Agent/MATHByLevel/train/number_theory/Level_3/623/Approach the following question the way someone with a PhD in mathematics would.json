    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The sum of all the positive factors of integer $x$ is 24. If one of the factors is 3, what is the value of $x$?",
    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be a positive integer and suppose that its factors are $1 = d_1 < d_2 < d_3 < \\cdots < d_k = x$. We are told that the sum of all the positive factors of $x$ is 24, so we have \n\n$$(1 + d_2 + d_3 + \\cdots + d_k) = 24.$$\n\nSince we are given that $3$ is a factor of $x$, we have $3 = d_i$ for some $i$. Hence, the sum of all the factors of $x$ can be rewritten as \n\n$$1 + 3 + (d_2 + d_3 + \\cdots + d_k) = 24,$$\n\nwhich simplifies to \n\n$$4 + (d_2 + d_3 + \\cdots + d_k) = 24.$$\n\nTherefore, \n\n$$d_2 + d_3 + \\cdots + d_k = 20.$$\n\nThe factors of $x$ form a strictly increasing sequence, so the sum of consecutive terms is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since $1,3, x$ are in the ratio $1:3:x$, we have \n\n$$d_k = 3x$$\n$$d_2 = \\frac{x}{3}.$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the factors of $x$ can be expressed as \n\n$$d_2 + d_3 + \\cdots + d_k = \\frac{1}{2}(k-2)(d_2 + d_k) = \\frac{1}{2}(k-2)\\left(\\frac{x}{3}+3x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(k-2)\\left(\\frac{10x}{3}\\right).$$\n\nWe know that this sum is equal to 20, so we have \n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(k-2)\\left(\\frac{10x}{3}\\right) = 20.$$\n\nTherefore, \n\n$$(k-2)\\left(\\frac{10x}{3}\\right) = 40.$$\n\nSince $k$ is the number of factors of $x$, it must be at least 3. To minimize the number of factors $x$ has, we take $k=3$.
