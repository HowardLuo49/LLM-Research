    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Find the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer.",
    "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer, we can first simplify the expression. \n\n$\\frac{n+6}{n} = 1 + \\frac{6}{n}$\n\nFor this expression to be an integer, $\\frac{6}{n}$ must also be an integer. This means that $n$ must be a factor of 6 for the expression to be an integer. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nSo the positive integral values of $n$ are 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n\nAdding these together, we get $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer is 12.",
