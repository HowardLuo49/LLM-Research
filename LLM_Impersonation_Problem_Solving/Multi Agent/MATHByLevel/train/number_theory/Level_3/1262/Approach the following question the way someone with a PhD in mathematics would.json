    "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer. This means that $n+6$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, we can write $n+6 = kn$ for some positive integer $k$. Rearranging, we get $n(k-1) = 6$.\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, we know that $(k-1)$ and $n$ are both positive factors of 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n\nFor $k-1 = 1 \\Rightarrow k = 2$, we have $n = 6$. \nFor $k-1 = 2 \\Rightarrow k = 3$, we have $n = 3$. \nFor $k-1 = 3 \\Rightarrow k = 4$, we have $n = 2$. \nFor $k-1 = 6 \\Rightarrow k = 7$, we have $n = 1$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer is $6 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 12$.",
