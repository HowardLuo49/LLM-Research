    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A band has 72 members who will all be marching during halftime. They need to march in rows with the same number of students per row. If there must be between 5 and 20 students per row, in how many possible row-lengths can the band be arranged?",
    "solution": "If $x$ members march in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=72=2^3\\cdot3^2$. Given that $5\\le x\\le20$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^3=8$, $2^2\\cdot3=12$, $2\\cdot3=6$, $2\\cdot3^2=18$ and $3^2=9$, for a total of $ \\boxed{5}$ row-lengths.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by finding all the factors of 72. The factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\nNext, we need to find the factors that fall within the range of 5 to 20. These factors are 6, 8, 9, 12, and 18.\n\nTherefore, the band can be arranged into rows with 6, 8, 9, 12, or 18 students. So, there are 5 possible row-lengths in which the band can be arranged.",
