    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A box contains gold coins. If the coins are equally divided among six people, four coins are left over. If the coins are equally divided among five people, three coins are left over. If the box holds the smallest number of coins that meets these two conditions, how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people?",
    "solution": "The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \\[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \\ldots.\\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \\[3, 8, 13,\n18, 23, 28, 33, \\ldots.\\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions. Because $4 \\times 7 = 28$, there are $\\boxed{0}$ coins left when they are divided among seven people. \\[ \\text{OR} \\] If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible by both 6 and 5. The smallest number that is divisible by 6 and 5 is 30, so the smallest possible number of coins in the box is 28, and our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count the coins in the box! \n\nFirst, we know that when we divide the coins among six people, there are 4 coins left over. So, let's put 4 coins aside. \n\nNow, when we divide the remaining coins among five people, there are 3 coins left over. So, let's put 3 coins aside with the other ones we already set aside. \n\nNow, let's count how many coins we have left after putting aside those extra coins. We have 4 + 3 = 7 coins in total. \n\nIf we divide those 7 coins equally among 7 people, there will be 0 coins left over because each person will get one coin. So, the answer is 0! Yay, we solved it!",
