    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A box contains gold coins. If the coins are equally divided among six people, four coins are left over. If the coins are equally divided among five people, three coins are left over. If the box holds the smallest number of coins that meets these two conditions, how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people?",
    "solution": "The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \\[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \\ldots.\\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \\[3, 8, 13,\n18, 23, 28, 33, \\ldots.\\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions. Because $4 \\times 7 = 28$, there are $\\boxed{0}$ coins left when they are divided among seven people. \\[ \\text{OR} \\] If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible by both 6 and 5. The smallest number that is divisible by 6 and 5 is 30, so the smallest possible number of coins in the box is 28, and our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we know that the number of coins is a multiple of 6 since when divided by 6 there are 4 coins left over. Similarly, it is also a multiple of 5 since when divided by 5 there are 3 coins left over. \n\nTo find the smallest number of coins that meets both conditions, we need to find the least common multiple of 6 and 5, which is 30. \n\nSo, the box holds 30 coins. \n\nNow we need to find out how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people. \n\nWhen 30 coins are divided by 7, there are 2 coins left over. \n\nTherefore, when equally divided among seven people, there are 2 coins left over.",
