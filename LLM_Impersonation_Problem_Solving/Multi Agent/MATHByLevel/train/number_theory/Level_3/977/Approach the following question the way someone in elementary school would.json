    "solution": "Let $n$ be the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.  In order for a number to be a perfect cube and a perfect square, it must be a perfect sixth power. Now we choose the smallest $a$ such that $n$ is four-digit: $2^6=64$, $3^6=729$, $4^6=4096$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{4096}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we need to think about numbers that can be both. A perfect square is a number that can be made by multiplying a number by itself, like 4 * 4 = 16. A perfect cube is a number that can be made by multiplying a number by itself three times, like 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nSo, we need to find a number that can be made by multiplying a number by itself twice and three times. The smallest number that can do this is 64, because 64 = 8 * 8 (perfect square) and 64 = 4 * 4 * 4 (perfect cube). And 64 is a four-digit whole number, so that is the answer!",
