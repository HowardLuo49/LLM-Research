    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Alex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many jellybeans Alex should buy, we can break it down step by step like this:\n\nStep 1: Alex wants to buy the least amount of jellybeans such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing them evenly among $13$ people.\nStep 2: Let's start by figuring out how many jellybeans each person would get if he divides them evenly among $13$ people. That means we need to divide the total number of jellybeans by $13$.\nStep 3: We need to find a number that, when we divide it by $13$, gives us a remainder of $11$.\nStep 4: If we keep trying numbers, we see that $111$ is a number that when divided by $13$, gives us a remainder of $11$. So Alex should buy $111$ jellybeans in order to have $11$ leftover after dividing them evenly among $13$ people.",
