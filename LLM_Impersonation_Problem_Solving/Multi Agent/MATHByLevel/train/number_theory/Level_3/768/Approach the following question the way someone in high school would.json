    "solution": "Let $n$ be any integer that has its square between 4000 and 7000. Then $63 < n < 84$, because $63^2 < 4000<64^2$ and $83^2< 7000<84^2$. Between 63 and 84, the only primes are 67, 71, 73, 79, and 83. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the prime numbers with squares between 4000 and 7000, we first need to find the square roots of the two numbers. The square root of 4000 is 63.25 and the square root of 7000 is 83.66. \n\nNext, we need to find all the prime numbers between these two square roots. The prime numbers between 64 (the next whole number after the square root of 4000) and 83 (the whole number before the square root of 7000) are: 67, 71, 73, and 79.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 prime numbers whose squares fall between 4000 and 7000.",
