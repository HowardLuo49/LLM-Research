    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many prime numbers have squares between 4000 and 7000?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be any integer that has its square between 4000 and 7000. Then $63 < n < 84$, because $63^2 < 4000<64^2$ and $83^2< 7000<84^2$. Between 63 and 84, the only primes are 67, 71, 73, 79, and 83. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of prime numbers with squares between 4000 and 7000, we first need to consider the range of integers whose squares fall within this interval. The square roots of the endpoints of the interval are approximately 63.25 and 83.67, respectively. Therefore, the integers that have squares between 4000 and 7000 are in the range [64, 83].\n\nNext, we need to identify the prime numbers within this range. By applying the Sieve of Eratosthenes or another primality testing method, we can quickly identify the prime numbers in this range as follows: 67, 71, 73, 79. \n\nTherefore, there are 4 prime numbers with squares between 4000 and 7000: \n\n67 (67^2 = 4489),\n71 (71^2 = 5041),\n73 (73^2 = 5329),\n79 (79^2 = 6241). \n\nAs a result, there are 4 prime numbers with squares falling within the specified interval.",
