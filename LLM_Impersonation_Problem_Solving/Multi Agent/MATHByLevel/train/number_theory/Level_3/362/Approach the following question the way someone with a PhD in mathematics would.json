    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The operation $\\star$ is defined as $a \\star b = a^2 \\div b$. For how many integer values of $x$ will the value of $10 \\star x$ be a positive integer?",
    "solution": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the integer values of $x$ for which $10 \\star x$ is a positive integer, we need to consider the expression $10 \\star x$. \n\nSubstitute $a=10$ into the definition of the $\\star$ operation:\n$10 \\star x = 10^2 \\div x = 100 \\div x$\n\nFor $100 \\div x$ to be a positive integer, $x$ must be a divisor of 100. In other words, $x$ must be an integer such that $x$ divides 100 without remainder. The divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.\n\nTherefore, there are nine integer values of $x$ for which the value of $10 \\star x$ is a positive integer.",
