    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's sing the divisibility rule song for 11: \"1, 10, 100, 1000, subtract, bring down, and try it!\" \n\nLet's follow the steps:\n1. Start from the right and add all the digits in the odd places (5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16).\n2. Start from the second right and add all the digits in the even places (6 + n + 8).\n3. Subtract the two sums (16 - (6 + n + 8) = 16 - (14 + n) = 16 - 14 - n = 2 - n). This difference should be divisible by 11.\n4. Since 2 - n = 2 - 5 = -3 is not divisible by 11, we try a different number.\n\nSo, $n$ cannot be 5 for the number $854n526$ to be divisible by 11.",
