    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The seven digits in Sam's phone number and the four digits in his house number have the same sum.  The four digits in his house number are distinct, and his phone number is 271-3147.  What is the largest possible value of Sam's house number?",
    "solution": "First, we need to add up the digits in his phone number to see what the digits in his address add up to.  $2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25$.\n\nFor his address, we want to find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to $25$.  Because we want a large number, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible, so the first digit should be $9$.  The next three digits, therefore, must add up to $25-9=16$.  Since the digits must be unique, the next digit cannot be $9$, so we will go for the next largest number, $8$.  The final two digits must add up to $16-8=8$, and since neither can be $8$, the next largest possibility for those numbers is $7$ and $1$.  Therefore, Sam's address is $\\boxed{9871}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. Sam's phone number is 271-3147. That's a big number! Now we need to find a number with four digits that has the same sum as 2+7+1+3+1+4+7. Let's add up those numbers: 2+7+1+3+1+4+7 = 25. \n\nNow we need to find a four-digit number where all the digits are different and add up to 25. We want to find the biggest number possible, so let's start with the biggest digit possible, which is 9. Then we can subtract that from 25 to find our other digits.\n\n25 - 9 = 16. So, our other three digits need to add up to 16. Let's try to make the next digit 8, which is also a big number. 16 - 8 = 8.\n\nThen we can try 7, because it's the next biggest number. 8 - 7 = 1.\n\nThen we can try the last digit, 1. 1 is the last digit in the sum, so we have successfully found a four-digit number with all different digits that adds up to the same sum as Sam's phone number. \n\nThat number is 9871. So, 9871 is the largest possible value of Sam's house number. Yay, we did it!",
