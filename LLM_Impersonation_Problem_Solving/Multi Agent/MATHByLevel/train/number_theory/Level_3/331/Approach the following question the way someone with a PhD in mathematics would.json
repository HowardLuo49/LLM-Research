    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The seven digits in Sam's phone number and the four digits in his house number have the same sum.  The four digits in his house number are distinct, and his phone number is 271-3147.  What is the largest possible value of Sam's house number?",
    "solution": "First, we need to add up the digits in his phone number to see what the digits in his address add up to.  $2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25$.\n\nFor his address, we want to find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to $25$.  Because we want a large number, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible, so the first digit should be $9$.  The next three digits, therefore, must add up to $25-9=16$.  Since the digits must be unique, the next digit cannot be $9$, so we will go for the next largest number, $8$.  The final two digits must add up to $16-8=8$, and since neither can be $8$, the next largest possibility for those numbers is $7$ and $1$.  Therefore, Sam's address is $\\boxed{9871}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible sum of four distinct digits that is equal to the sum of the digits in Sam's phone number (2+7+1+3+1+4+7 = 25). Since the sum of four distinct digits should be as large as possible, we should start with the largest possible digits.\n\nOne possible strategy is to start with the largest three digits (9,8, and 7) and then find the largest digit to add to these three to get a sum of 25. Adding these three digits gives us 9+8+7 = 24, so we need to find a digit that, when added to 24, equals 25. This digit is 1.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value for Sam's house number is 9871.",
