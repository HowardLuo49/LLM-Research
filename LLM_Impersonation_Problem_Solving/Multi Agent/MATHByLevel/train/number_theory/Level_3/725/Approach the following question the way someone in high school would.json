    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Josef and Timothy play a game in which Josef picks an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and Timothy divides 1000 by that integer and states whether or not the quotient is an integer.  How many integers could Josef pick such that Timothy's quotient is an integer?",
    "solution": "Timothy's quotient is an integer if and only if Josef's number is a divisor of 1000.  Our goal is to count the positive divisors of $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. We see that 1000 has $(3 + 1)(3+1) = 16$ positive divisors, hence there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers Josef could pick to make Timothy's number an integer.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to think about what it means for a number to be an integer when dividing 1000 by another number. An integer result means that there is no remainder left over after dividing.\n\nFirst, let's identify the factors of 1000: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, and 1000.\n\nNow, let's think about the factors that will give us an integer result when dividing 1000 by them.
