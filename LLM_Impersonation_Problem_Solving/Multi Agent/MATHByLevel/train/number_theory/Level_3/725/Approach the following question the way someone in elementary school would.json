    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Josef and Timothy play a game in which Josef picks an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and Timothy divides 1000 by that integer and states whether or not the quotient is an integer.  How many integers could Josef pick such that Timothy's quotient is an integer?",
    "solution": "Timothy's quotient is an integer if and only if Josef's number is a divisor of 1000.  Our goal is to count the positive divisors of $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. We see that 1000 has $(3 + 1)(3+1) = 16$ positive divisors, hence there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers Josef could pick to make Timothy's number an integer.",
    "gpt_response": "In order for Timothy's quotient to be an integer, Josef must pick a number that divides evenly into 1000. This means that the number must be a factor of 1000. We know that there are 16 factors of 1000, so Josef can pick from those 16 numbers to ensure Timothy's quotient is an integer.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 16?: In order for Timothy's quotient to be an integer, Josef must pick a number that divides evenly into 1000. This means that the number must be a factor of 1000. We know that there are 16 factors of 1000, so Josef can pick from those 16 numbers to ensure Timothy's quotient is an integer.",
