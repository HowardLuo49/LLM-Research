    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many benches the shop has, we need to think about how many people can sit on each bench. The problem says that 2 people are supposed to sit on one bench. So if we have 204 people, we can divide that by 2 to find out how many benches we need.\n\nSo, we can do the math like this:\n\n$204 \\div 2 = 102$\n\nSo, the bagel shop has 102 benches.",
