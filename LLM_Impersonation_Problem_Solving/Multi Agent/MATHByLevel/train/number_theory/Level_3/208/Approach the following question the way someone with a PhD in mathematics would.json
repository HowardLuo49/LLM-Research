    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The bagel shop has enough benches to sit $204_6$ people. If $2$ people are supposed to sit on one bench, how many benches does the shop have?",
    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches",
    "gpt_response": "We can first convert the number of people the benches can accommodate into base 10. \n\n$204_6 = 2 \\times 6^0 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 4 \\times 6^2 = 2 + 0 + 144 = 146$.\n\nSince each bench can seat 2 people, we can divide the total number of people by 2 to find the number of benches: \n\nNumber of benches = $\\frac{146}{2} = 73$.\n\nTherefore, the bagel shop has 73 benches.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 38?: We can first convert the number of people the benches can accommodate into base 10. \n\n$204_6 = 2 \\times 6^0 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 4 \\times 6^2 = 2 + 0 + 144 = 146$.\n\nSince each bench can seat 2 people, we can divide the total number of people by 2 to find the number of benches: \n\nNumber of benches = $\\frac{146}{2} = 73$.\n\nTherefore, the bagel shop has 73 benches.",
