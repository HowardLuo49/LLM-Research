    "solution": "The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \\cdot 64 = 448$. Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$, we need to divide $473$ by the highest power of $8$ that is less than or equal to $473$. In this case, $8^2 = 64$ is the highest power of $8$ less than $473$. \n\nFirst, we divide $473$ by $64$ to determine how many $64$s fit into $473$:\n\n$473 \\div 64 = 7$ with a remainder of $57$.\n\nNext, we divide the remainder, $57$, by the next highest power of $8$, which is $8^1 = 8$:\n\n$57 \\div 8 = 7$ with a remainder of $1$.\n\nTherefore, the first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $7$.",
