    "solution": "The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \\cdot 64 = 448$. Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the first digit (from left to right) of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$, we need to convert the decimal number $473$ to base $8$.\n\nTo do this, we divide $473$ by $8$ and we get a quotient of $59$ with a remainder of $1$. This means that the rightmost digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $1$. \n\nNext, we divide the quotient $59$ by $8$ and we get a quotient of $7$ with a remainder of $3$. This means that the next digit to the left is $3$.\n\nFinally, since the quotient is $7$, the first digit (from left to right) of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. \n\nSo, the first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $7$.",
