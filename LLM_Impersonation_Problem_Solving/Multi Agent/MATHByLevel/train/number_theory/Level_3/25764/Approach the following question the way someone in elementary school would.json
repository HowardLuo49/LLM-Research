    "solution": "First, we find $150=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2.$ The prime factorization of a divisor of 150 must take the form $2^m3^n5^p$ for nonnegative integers $m\\leq 1$, $n\\leq 1$, and $p\\leq 2$. The requirement that the divisor is not divisible by 5 means that we must have $p=0$. Therefore, there are $2$ possibilities for $m$ (namely, 0 or 1) and the same for $n$ for a total of $2\\cdot 2=\\boxed{4}$ such factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive divisors of $150$ that are not divisible by $5$, we first need to find all the divisors of $150$. The divisors of $150$ are $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75,$ and $150$.\n\nOut of these divisors, only $1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 15, 30,$ and $75$ are not divisible by $5$. So, there are $\\boxed{8}$ positive divisors of $150$ that are not divisible by $5$.",
