    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! We want to find a number that when we double it, we get a perfect square. And also when we triple it, we get a perfect cube. Let's start with the smallest positive integer, which is 1.\n\nIf we double 1, we get 2. But 2 is not a perfect square.\n\nIf we double 2, we get 4. Yay! 4 is a perfect square. But when we triple 2, we get 6, which is not a perfect cube.\n\nIf we double 3, we get 6. Not a perfect square.\n\nIf we double 4, we get 8. Not a perfect square.\n\nIf we double 5, we get 10. Not a perfect square.\n\nIf we double 6, we get 12. Not a perfect square.\n\nIf we double 7, we get 14. Not a perfect square.\n\nIf we double 8, we get 16. Yay! 16 is a perfect square! And when we triple 8, we get 24, which is not a perfect cube.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $n = 8$. Yay, we did it!",
