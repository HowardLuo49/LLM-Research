    "solution": "Since $182$ is divisible by 14, the first term does not affect the residue of the whole expression, modulo 14. Since $15\\cdot 7$ is divisible by 7 but not by 14 (since it isn't even), it has a residue of 7. So the residue of the sum is  $$\n182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\equiv 0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv \\boxed{10} \\pmod{14}.\n$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$, we first compute the individual residues of each term mod 14.\n\nFirst, we have $182\\cdot 12 = 2184 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nNext, we have $15\\cdot 7 = 105 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nLastly, we have $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nTherefore, the expression $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3$ reduces to $0 - 7 + 3 \\equiv -4 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{14}$.\n\nThus, the residue of $182\\cdot 12 - 15\\cdot 7 + 3 \\pmod{14}$ is 10.",
