    "solution": "Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=4k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 4 are relatively prime. Recalling the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[A,B]\\cdot\\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $120k=(3k)(4k),$ which implies $k=120/12=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find two numbers whose ratio is 3:4. Let's say $A$ is 3x and $B$ is 4x. Since their least common multiple is 120, we know that $A$ and $B$ have to be multiples of 120. This means 3x and 4x have to be factors of 120. \n\nThe factors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. Since 3 and 4 aren't factors of 120, we need to find the factors of 3 and 4 instead. \n\nThe factors of 3 are 1 and 3, and the factors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. The greatest common factor of 3 and 4 is 1.\n\nSo the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$ is 1.",
