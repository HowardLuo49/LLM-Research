    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we need to consider the pattern of units digit of powers of 13. We notice that the units digits of $13^1$, $13^2$, $13^3$, $13^4$, $13^5$, ... follow a pattern: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, ... \n\nNow, since the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we can reduce 2003 modulo 4 to find the power in the cycle that corresponds to our exponent. \n\n2003 mod 4 = 3\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ will be the third digit in the cycle, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 7.",
