    "solution": "If $k$ is a positive even integer, then $$9^{k} = 81^{k/2}=\\overbrace{(81)(81)\\cdots (81)}^{k/2\\text{ times}},$$so $9^k$ has a units digit of 1. Since 8 is even, $8^7$ is even.  Therefore, $9^{8^7}$ has a units digit of $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $9^{8^7$, let's first look at the units digits of powers of 9.\n\n$9^1 = 9$ (units digit is 9)\n$9^2 = 81$ (units digit is 1)\n$9^3 = 729$ (units digit is 9)\n$9^4 = 6561$ (units digit is 1)\n\nAnd this pattern repeats every 4th power. So we need to find the remainder when $8^7$ is divided by 4.\n\n$8^1 = 8$ (units digit is 8)\n$8^2 = 64$ (units digit is 4)\n$8^3 = 512$ (units digit is 2)\n$8^4 = 4096$ (units digit is 6)\n\nSo $8^7$ has the same units digit as $8^3$, which is 2.
