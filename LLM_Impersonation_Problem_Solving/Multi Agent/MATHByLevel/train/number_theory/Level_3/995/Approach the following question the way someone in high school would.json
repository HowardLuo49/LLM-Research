    "solution": "The second condition tells us that the integer must be between $25^2 = 625$ and $(25.3)^2 \\approx 640$. The only multiple of 14 in this range is $\\boxed{630}.$  (One easy way to find a multiple of 14 is to find a number that is both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 7.)",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the square root of 25 and 25.3. \n\nThe square root of 25 is 5, and the square root of 25.3 is approximately 5.03.\n\nNext, let's find a positive integer that is divisible by 14. The first positive integer that is divisible by 14 is 14 itself.\n\nNow, let's check if 14 is between 5 and 5.03. Since 14 is greater than 5 but less than 5.03, it meets the condition.\n\nTherefore, the positive integer that is divisible by 14 and has a square root between 25 and 25.3 is 14.",
