    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. Let's denote the five prime numbers as p, p+6, p+12, p+18, and p+24. Since all these numbers are prime, they must be greater than 0.\n\nBy definition, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We can start by testing potential values for p to see if they satisfy the conditions. For example, if we start with p=2, then the sequence would be 2, 8, 14, 20, 26. However, 26 is not a prime number, so this does not work.\n\nWe can continue testing different values for p until we find a valid set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. It turns out that starting with p=5 gives us the sequence 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, which are all prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the five prime numbers is 5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85. So, the sum of those five prime numbers is 85.",
