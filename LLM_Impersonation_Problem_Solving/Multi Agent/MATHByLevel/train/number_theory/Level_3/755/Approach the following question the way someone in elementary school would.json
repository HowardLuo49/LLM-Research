    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. There is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.  What is the sum of those five prime numbers?",
    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, we can start with the first prime number and add 6 to find the next prime number, and so on. \n\nLet's start with the first prime number, which is 5. \nThe next prime number would be 5 + 6 = 11\nThe next prime number would be 11 + 6 = 17\nThe next prime number would be 17 + 6 = 23\nThe next prime number would be 23 + 6 = 29\n\nSo, the five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6 are 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29.\n\nTo find the sum of those five prime numbers, we add them all together: \n5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85\n\nTherefore, the sum of the five prime numbers is 85.",
