    "solution": "First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$. Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})$, we need to first look at the pattern of the ones digits of powers of 2. The ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, ...$ cycle through 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, and so on.\n\nNow, we need to focus on finding the ones digit of $11^{11}$. The ones digit of powers of 1 always remains 1. Therefore, $11^{11}$ has a ones digit of 1.\n\nSo, the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is the same as the ones digit of $22^{22}$. As we saw before, the ones digit of powers of 2 cycle through 2, 4, 8, 6, so $22^{22}$ has a ones digit of 6.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is 6.",
