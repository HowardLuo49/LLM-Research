    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Two distinct positive integers $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36. If $x\\cdot y$ is not a factor of 36, what is the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$?",
    "solution": "We begin by listing all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8... 8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4. We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36. $\\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know that $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36. That means they divide evenly into 36. But, if their product $x\\cdot y$ is not a factor of 36, that means it doesn't divide evenly into 36. \n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$, we need to think about the factors of 36. The factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. Since $x$ and $y$ must be distinct positive integers, we can't just choose the same factor twice.\n\nThe smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$ that is not a factor of 36 is when $x$ and $y$ are the two smallest factors that are not perfect squares. That would be 2 and 3. Let's check if their product, $2\\cdot 3 = 6$, is a factor of 36. \n\nSince 6 is a factor of 36, we need to keep looking for a smaller product. The next smallest product would be $2\\cdot 4 = 8$. \n\n$8$ is not a factor of 36, so the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$ is $8$.",
