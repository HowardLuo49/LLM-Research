    "solution": "The largest power of 2 that divides $199$ is $2^7$, which equals 128. Since $(1\\cdot 2^7)=128<199<(2\\cdot 2^7)=256$, the digit in the $2^7$ place is $1$. We know that $199-128=71$, and that $71$ can be expressed as $64+4+2+1$, or $(1\\cdot 2^6)+(1\\cdot 2^2)+(1\\cdot 2^1)+(1\\cdot 2^0)$. This means that $199_{10}=11000111_2$. Therefore, $x=3$ and $y=5$; and $y-x=5-3=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $199_{10}$ to base 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 199, subtract it from 199, and repeat the process with the result until we reach 0.\n\nStarting with 199, the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 199 is $2^7 = 128$, which leaves us with $199-128 = 71$. Continuing on, we find that $2^6 = 64$ is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 71, leaving us with $71-64 = 7$.\n\nProceeding in this manner, we find the binary representation of 199 to be $11000111_{2}$.\n\nCounting the number of zeros and ones in this representation, we find that there are 5 zeros and 4 ones. Therefore, $y-x = 4-5 = -1$.\n\nThus, the value of $y-x$ for the binary representation of 199 is $-1$.",
