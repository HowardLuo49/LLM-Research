    "solution": "The prime factorization of 50 is $2\\cdot5^2$ and the prime factorization of 5005 is $5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13$. The greatest common divisor is 5 and the least common multiple is $2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13=2\\cdot5\\cdot5005=50050$. The sum of the GCD and LCM is $\\boxed{50055}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of 50 and 5005, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. That's where we keep dividing the larger number by the smaller number until we get a remainder of 0. We can start by dividing 5005 by 50 which gives us a quotient of 100 and a remainder of 5. Then we divide 50 by 5 which gives us a quotient of 10 and a remainder of 0. So, our greatest common divisor is 5.\n\nTo find the least common multiple of 50 and 5005, we can use the fact that the product of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. That means the least common multiple can be found by dividing the product of the two numbers by their greatest common divisor. So, the least common multiple of 50 and 5005 is $\\frac{50*5005}{5} = 50050$.\n\nFinally, the sum of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple is $5 + 50050 = 50055$. So, the answer is 50055.",
