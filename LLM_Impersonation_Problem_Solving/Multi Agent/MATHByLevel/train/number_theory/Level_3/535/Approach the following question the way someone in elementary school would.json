    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $115_{10}$ to base 11, we need to find out how many times 11 can go into 115.\n\nFirst, we see that 11 goes into 115 ten times, because $11 \\times 10 = 110$.\n\nThen we subtract $110$ from $115$ to get the remainder, which is $5$.\n\nSo, $115_{10}$ is equal to $A5_{11}$ in base 11.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\text{A5?: To convert $115_{10}$ to base 11, we need to find out how many times 11 can go into 115.\n\nFirst, we see that 11 goes into 115 ten times, because $11 \\times 10 = 110$.\n\nThen we subtract $110$ from $115$ to get the remainder, which is $5$.\n\nSo, $115_{10}$ is equal to $A5_{11}$ in base 11.",
