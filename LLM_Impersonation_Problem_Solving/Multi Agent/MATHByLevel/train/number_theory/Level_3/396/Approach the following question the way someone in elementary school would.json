    "solution": "We first find that the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84$ is $2^6 = 64$. Our next step is to find the largest power of $2$ that is less than $84 - 64 = 20$ which is $2^4=16$. This leaves us left with $20 - 16 = 4$, but $4 = 2 ^2$, so we have $$84 = 1 \\cdot 2^6 + 0 \\cdot 2^5 + 1 \\cdot 2^4 + 0 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 0 \\cdot 2^0.$$Thus, our base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1010100_2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$, we need to see how many groups of $2$ we can fit inside $84$.\n\nLet's start with the largest power of $2$ that fits into $84$, which is $64$ because $2^6 = 64$. So we know that $64$ can fit into $84$ once, with a remainder of $20$.\n\nNext, we continue with the next largest power of $2$, which is $32$ because $2^5 = 32$. We can fit $32$ into the remainder of $20$ zero times, so our binary representation so far is $10$.\n\nMoving on to the next power of $2$, we have $16$ because $2^4 = 16$. We can fit $16$ into the remainder of $20$ once, with a remainder of $4$. So our binary representation is now $101$.\n\nFinally, we have $4$ because $2^2 = 4$. We can fit $4$ into the remainder of $4$ once, with no remainder. Adding this to our binary representation, we get $1010100$.\n\nSo, the base $2$ representation of $84_{10}$ is $1010100_{2}$.",
