    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{076923}$. Since the first six digits repeat, we know that after every 6th digit the pattern will restart. Since $43\\div 6 = 7 r 1$, the first 42 digits will be seven repetitions of the same pattern followed by the first digit of the pattern. Since the first digit is $\\boxed{0}$, this is our final answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$, we can simply perform long division to find the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{13}$. \n\nAfter performing long division, we see that the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.076923076923...$. Since this pattern repeats every 6 digits, we can determine that the 43rd digit after the decimal point is the same as the 1st digit after the decimal point, which is 0. \n\nTherefore, the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is 0.",
