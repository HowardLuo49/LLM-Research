    "solution": "We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s. Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1. We can only vary the tens digit. Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime, we must first understand what a palindromic prime is. A palindromic prime is a prime number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In this case, the number is a three-digit number, so it will have the form $ABA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits.\n\nSince $101$ is already the smallest three-digit palindromic prime, we need to consider the next palindromic number in order. This number would be $111$, but it is not prime since $111 = 3 \\times 37$. The next candidate is $121$, but again, it is not prime as $121 = 11^2$.\n\nThe next palindromic number is $131$, and indeed, it is a prime number. Therefore, the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime is $131$.",
