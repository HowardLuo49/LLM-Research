    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ such that $n \\equiv 10389 \\pmod{12}$, we can start by dividing 10389 by 12. \n\n10389 divided by 12 is 865 with a remainder of 9. So, we know that $n$ must be 9 because it is the remainder when 10389 is divided by 12.\n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies $n \\equiv 10389 \\pmod{12}$ is $\\boxed{9}$.",
