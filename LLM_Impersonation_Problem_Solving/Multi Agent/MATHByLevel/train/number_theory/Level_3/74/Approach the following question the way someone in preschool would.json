    "solution": "The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. They can be paired off into four pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 42:  \\begin{align*}\n\\{1&,42\\}, \\\\\n\\{2&, 21\\},\\\\\n\\{3&, 14\\}, \\text{and}\\\\\n\\{6&, 7\\}.\n\\end{align*}Thus $A=42^4=(2\\cdot3\\cdot7)^4=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4$ has $\\boxed{3}$ prime divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the divisors of 42. We have 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. That's 8 divisors!\n\nNow let's find the product of all these divisors. 1 x 2 x 3 x 6 x 7 x 14 x 21 x 42 = 311,424.\n\nNow we need to find how many distinct prime factors 311,424 has. Let's see... the prime factors of 311,424 are 2, 3, and 7. So 311,424 has 3 distinct prime factors!\n\nGreat job, we figured it out!",
