We know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.  $Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.  $Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square, we need to consider the factors of $Z$ based on the second statement.\n\nSince $Z = K \\times K^2 = K^3$, $Z$ must be a perfect cube of an integer. We can rewrite $Z$ as $(K^2)^{3/2}$, which means $K^2$ must be a perfect cube in order for $Z$ to be a perfect square.\n\nSince $500 < Z < 1000$, we can look for perfect cubes between $500$ and $1000$. The perfect cubes within this range are $512 = 8^3$, $729 = 9^3$, and $1000 = 10^3$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{9}$.",
