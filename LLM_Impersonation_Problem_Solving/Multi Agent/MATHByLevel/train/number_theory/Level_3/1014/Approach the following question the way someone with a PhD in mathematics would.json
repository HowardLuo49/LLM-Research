We know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.  $Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.  $Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square, we start by substituting the expression for $Z$ into the condition for $Z$ to be a perfect square. Since $Z$ is a perfect square, we can write $Z$ as $M^2$ where $M$ is some integer. \n\nSubstituting $Z = K \\times K^2$ into $Z = M^2$, we get $K \\times K^2 = M^2$, which simplifies to $K^3 = M^2$. \n\nFrom this, we see that $K$ must be a perfect cube for $Z$ to be a perfect square. To find the valid values of $K$, we look at the integers in the range $500 < Z < 1000$ that are perfect cubes. These are $K = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$. \n\nThus, the valid value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square is $K = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12$.",
