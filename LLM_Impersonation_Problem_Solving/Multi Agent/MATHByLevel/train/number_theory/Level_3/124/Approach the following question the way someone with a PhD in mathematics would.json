    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n$ is a perfect square and $2n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "Since $3n$ is a perfect square, that means that $n$ has to be a multiple of $3$. Since $2n$ is a perfect cube, then $n$ has to be divisible by $2^2=4$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $n$ also has to be divisible by $3^3=27$. Therefore, the smallest value for $n$ is $4 \\cdot 27 =\\boxed{108}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $3n = p^2$ and $2n = q^3$ for some positive integers $p$ and $q$. From the given equations, we can express $n$ in terms of $p$ and $q$ as $n = p^2/3 = q^3/2$. \n\nBecause $p$ is a perfect square, we can write $p = m^2$ for some positive integer $m$. Substituting into the equation $n = p^2/3$, we get $n = m^4/3$. By the same logic, we can express $q$ as $q = k^3$ for some positive integer $k$, leading to $n = k^6/2$. \n\nSetting these expressions for $n$ equal to each other, we have $m^4/3 = k^6/2$. Multiplying both sides by 6, we get $2m^4 = 3k^6$. This suggests that $m$ is a multiple of 3 and $k$ is a multiple of 2. \n\nTaking this into account, let $m = 3x$ and $k = 2y$ for positive integers $x$ and $y$. Substituting these expressions into the equation gives $2(3x)^4 = 3(2y)^6$, which simplifies to $2*81x^4 = 3*64y^6$, or $162x^4 = 192y^6$. \n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get $27x^4 = 32y^6$. This implies that $x$ must be a multiple of 32 and $y$ must be a multiple of 27, which suggests that the smallest positive integers $x$ and $y$ satisfying the equation are $x=32$ and $y=27$. \n\nTherefore, $m = 3*32 = 96$ and $k = 2*27 = 54$. Substituting back, we have $n = m^4/3 = 96^4/3 = 2^{12}*3^{2}$, which is the smallest positive integer $n$ satisfying the given conditions. \n\nThus, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n$ is a perfect square and $2n$ is a perfect cube is $2^{12}*3^{2}$.",
