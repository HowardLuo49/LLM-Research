    "solution": "The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$. Therefore, we only need to consider these squares. Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$. Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$. No square begins and ends with $5$. One square begins and ends with $6: 676$. No square begins and ends with $9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many $3$-digit squares are palindromes, we first need to figure out the range of $3$-digit squares. The smallest $3$-digit number is $100$, which has a square of $100^2 = 10,000$. The largest $3$-digit number is $999$, which has a square of $999^2 = 998,001$.\n\nNext, we need to identify the palindromic squares within this range. A palindromic number is the same forwards and backwards, so the hundreds digit must be equal to the units digit. Since $100^2 = 10,000$ is not a palindrome, we can start looking at $110^2 = 12,100$ and continue checking all the squares up to $300^2 = 90,000$ to see if they are palindromes.\n\nAfter checking all the squares within the range, we find that the palindromic squares are $121$ ($11^2$), $484$ ($22^2$), $676$ ($26^2$) and $900$ ($30^2$).\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ $3$-digit squares that are palindromes.",
