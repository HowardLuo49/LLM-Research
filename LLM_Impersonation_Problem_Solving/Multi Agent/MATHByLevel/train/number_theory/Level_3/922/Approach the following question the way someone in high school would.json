    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of ones digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of ones digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 7, 9, 3, 1. Thus, to find the ones digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the ones digit 7, $R=2$ corresponds to the ones digit 9, etc.) Since $35\\div4=8R3$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $7^{35}$, we can first look for a pattern. Let's start by finding the ones digits of the powers of 7:\n\n$7^1 = 7$\n\n$7^2 = 49$\n\n$7^3 = 343$\n\n$7^4 = 2401$\n\n$7^5 = 16807$\n\nWe can see that the ones digit of the powers of 7 repeats in the pattern: 7, 9, 3, 1. Since 35 is a multiple of 4 (35 \u00f7 4 = 8 with a remainder of 3), we can determine that the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is the same as the third power in the pattern, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is 3.",
