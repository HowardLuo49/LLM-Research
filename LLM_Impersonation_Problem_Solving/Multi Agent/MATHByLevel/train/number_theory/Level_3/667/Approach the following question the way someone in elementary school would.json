    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors, we need to think about the different ways we can make a number by multiplying factors together. \n\nOne way to have five factors is if the number is a prime number multiplied by another prime number. For example, if we take the smallest prime numbers, 2 and 3, and multiply them together, we get 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n\nSo, the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors is 6.",
