    "solution": "An even number has a units digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, so the smallest digit not in that list of possible units digits is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number, we can start by listing out all the possible digits that can appear in the units place of an even number. Since even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, we can see that the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number is 1. So, the answer is 1.",
