    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $15 \\pmod{22}$ is of the form $22n+15$.\n\nTherefore, we make the equation $22n+15<10000$, and find the largest possible $n$. \\begin{align*}\n22n+15&<10000 \\\\\n22n&<9985 \\\\\nn&<\\frac{9985}{22} \\approx 453.85\n\\end{align*}The largest possible integer $n$ is $453$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $22 \\cdot 453 +15 =\\boxed{9981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's first find a number that is close to 15 and also a multiple of 22. The closest multiple of 22 to 15 is 22. So let's add 22 to 15 to get 37. Then let's keep adding 22 until we get a 4-digit number. \n\n15 + 22 = 37\n37 + 22 = 59\n59 + 22 = 81\n81 + 22 = 103\n\nSo, the largest 4-digit number that is congruent to 15 mod 22 is 103. Yay, we did it!",
