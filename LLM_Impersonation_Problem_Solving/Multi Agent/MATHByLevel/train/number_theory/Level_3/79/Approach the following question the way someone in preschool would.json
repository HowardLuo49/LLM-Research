    "solution": "The sum of the whole-number factors of 24 is $1+24+2+12+3+8+4+6=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the whole-number factors of 24, we need to think about what numbers can multiply together to make 24. Let's see... 1 and 24 can multiply to make 24, and 2 and 12 can too, and 3 and 8, and 4 and 6. So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 as factors of 24. \n\nNow, to find the sum, we just add them all together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 60. So, the sum of the whole-number factors of 24 is 60. Yay, we did it!",
