    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. When the base-12 integer $1531_{12}$ is divided by $8$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We have $$1531_{12} = 12^3 + 5\\cdot 12^2 + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Note that $12^2$ is divisible by $8$, so $$1531_{12} = (\\text{a multiple of 8}) + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Therefore, the remainder upon dividing $1531_{12}$ by $8$ is the same as the remainder upon dividing $3\\cdot 12+1$ by $8$. This remainder is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have the number 1531 in base-12. To find the remainder when we divide it by 8, let's break it down. \n\nFirst, let's convert 1531 base-12 into our normal base-10 number system. \n\n1*12^3 + 5*12^2 + 3*12^1 + 1*12^0 = 1*1728 + 5*144 + 3*12 + 1*1 = 1728 + 720 + 36 + 1 = 2485\n\nSo, 1531 base-12 is equal to 2485 in base-10.\n\nNow, let's divide 2485 by 8 to find the remainder. \n\n2485 \u00f7 8 = 310 R 5\n\nSo, the remainder when 1531 base-12 is divided by 8 is 5.",
