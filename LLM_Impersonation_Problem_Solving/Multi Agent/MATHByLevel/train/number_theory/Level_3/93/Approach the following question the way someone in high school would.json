    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. When the base-12 integer $1531_{12}$ is divided by $8$, what is the remainder?",
    "solution": "We have $$1531_{12} = 12^3 + 5\\cdot 12^2 + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Note that $12^2$ is divisible by $8$, so $$1531_{12} = (\\text{a multiple of 8}) + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Therefore, the remainder upon dividing $1531_{12}$ by $8$ is the same as the remainder upon dividing $3\\cdot 12+1$ by $8$. This remainder is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to convert the base-12 number $1531_{12}$ to base-10. \n\n$1531_{12} = (1 \\cdot 12^3) + (5 \\cdot 12^2) + (3 \\cdot 12^1) + (1 \\cdot 12^0) = 1728 + 720 + 36 + 1 = 2485$\n\nNow that we have $2485$ in base-10, we can divide it by $8$ to find the remainder.\n\n$2485 \\div 8 = 310$ remainder $5$\n\nSo, the remainder when $1531_{12}$ is divided by $8$ is $5$.",
