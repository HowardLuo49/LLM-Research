    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's think about the numbers that can be the prime numbers. We know that prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. So let's make a list of possible prime numbers that could be $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, ...\n\nSince $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers, that means they can't be even numbers because the only even prime number is 2. That also means they can't be divisible by 3 because then they wouldn't be prime. They can't be divisible by 5 or 7 for the same reason. \n\nNow let's add up some prime numbers from our list and see if the sum is even, divisible by 3, divisible by 5, divisible by 7, or prime. Taking a few examples:\n\n$3 + 5 + 11 + 13 = 32$, which is even (answer A)\n$7 + 11 + 13 + 17 = 48$, which is divisible by 3 (answer B)\n$11 + 13 + 17 + 19 = 60$, which is divisible by 5 (answer C)\n$17 + 19 + 23 + 29 = 88$, which is not divisible by 7 but is even (answer A)\n$29 + 31 + 37 + 41 = 138$, which is not even, divisible by 3, divisible by 5, or divisible by 7, so it is prime (answer E)\n\nSo from our examples, it seems like answers A, B, C, and E could be possible. But if we try more examples, we can see that only answer E is correct, because the sum of four prime numbers will always result in a prime number. So our final answer is E.",
