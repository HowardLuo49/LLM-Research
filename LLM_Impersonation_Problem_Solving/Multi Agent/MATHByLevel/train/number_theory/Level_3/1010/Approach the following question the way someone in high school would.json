    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$.  Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$.  Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the value of $a^b$ while keeping it less than 399, we need to find the largest possible values for $a$ and $b$.\n\nWe can start by trying different values of $b > 1$ to see what happens. If we let $b = 2$, then $a^b = a^2$. The largest perfect square less than 399 is $20^2 = 400$, so $a$ must be less than 20.\n\nNext, if we let $b = 3$, then $a^b = a^3$. Now we need to find the largest integer value for $a$ such that $a^3 < 399$. By testing, we find that $7^3 = 343 < 399$ and $8^3 = 512 > 399$, so $a = 7$ when $b = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $7 + 3 = \\boxed{10}$.",
