    "solution": "Recall that the number of whole number divisors of a positive integer can be determined by prime factorizing the integer, adding 1 to each of the exponents, and multiplying the results.  If a positive integer has 10 factors, then the set of exponents in the prime factorization is $\\{1,4\\}$ or $\\{9\\}$.  For each set of exponents, the smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has the given set of exponents is achieved by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes 2, 3, 5, etc.  The smallest positive integer with an exponent of 9 in the prime factorization is $2^9=512$.  The smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 1 and 4 is $2^4\\cdot 3^1=48$.  Since $48<512$, $\\boxed{48}$ is the smallest positive integer with 10 positive integer divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive integer divisors, we should first understand the relationship between the number of divisors of a positive integer and its prime factorization.\n\nLet's first consider the prime factorization of a positive integer n:\n\nn = p\u2081^a\u2081 * p\u2082^a\u2082 * ... * p\u2096^a\u2096\n\nwhere p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2096 are distinct prime numbers and a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2096 are positive integers.\n\nThe number of divisors of n can be calculated as (a\u2081 + 1)(a\u2082 + 1)...(a\u2096 + 1).\n\nFor a positive integer to have exactly 10 positive integer divisors, we must have the product of the exponents in the prime factorization equal to 9. This can be achieved in various ways, such as:\n\n1. n = 2^4 * 3^2\n   Number of divisors = (4+1)(2+1) = 15\n\n2. n = 2^2 * 3^4\n   Number of divisors = (2+1)(4+1) = 15\n\n3. n = 2^8\n   Number of divisors = (8+1) = 9\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive integer divisors is 2^8 = 256.",
