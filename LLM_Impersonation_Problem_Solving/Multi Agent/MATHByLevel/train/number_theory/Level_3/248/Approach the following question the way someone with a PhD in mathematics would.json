    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Donna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts. Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.\n\nAfter eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
    "solution": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first express the number of doughnuts in each box in terms of the number of bags that can be created. \n\nIf each box contains 13 doughnuts and we eat one, there are a total of 12 doughnuts left in the box. Since each bag contains 9 doughnuts, the number of bags that can be created from one box is given by $\\frac{12}{9} = \\frac{4}{3} = 1\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest possible value of $n$ such that we can create an integer number of bags from all $n$ boxes. This means that $n$ needs to be a multiple of $3$ to ensure that the number of bags created from each box is a whole number.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $3$. In this case, we have a total of $3$ boxes, each containing $13$ doughnuts, for a total of $39$ doughnuts. After eating one and rearranging, we can create $4$ bags, each containing $9$ doughnuts.",
