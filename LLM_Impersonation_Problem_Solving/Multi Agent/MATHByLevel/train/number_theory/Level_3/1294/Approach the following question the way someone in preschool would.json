    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\\cdot189=2^3\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$. The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$. Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\\cdot3^2=(2\\cdot3)^2=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together and see what the biggest square number is! \n1x1=1, 2x2=4, 3x3=9, 4x4=16, 5x5=25, 6x6=36, 7x7=49, 8x8=64, 9x9=81, 10x10=100, 11x11=121, 12x12=144. \nSo the biggest square number that we can make with 1512 is 36. So the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is 36. Yay, we did it!",
