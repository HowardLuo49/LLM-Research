    "solution": "We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it. The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678.  The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678.  Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive value of $x$ that makes $x + 5678$ a palindrome, we can start adding numbers to see if we get a palindrome. \n\nLet's start by adding 1 to 5678 which gives us 5679. It's not a palindrome. \n\nNext, let's add 2 to 5678 which gives us 5680. It's also not a palindrome. \n\nNow, if we add 3 to 5678 we get 5681, which is also not a palindrome. \n\nLet's try adding 4 to 5678. That gives us 5682, which is still not a palindrome. \n\nIf we add 5 to 5678, we get 5683. This is also not a palindrome. \n\nNow, if we add 6 to 5678, we get 5684. Still not a palindrome. \n\nLet's try adding 7 to 5678. We get 5685, which is still not a palindrome. \n\nFinally, if we add 8 to 5678, we get 5686. And 5686 is a palindrome!\n\nSo the smallest positive value of $x$ that makes $x + 5678$ a palindrome is $x = 8$.",
