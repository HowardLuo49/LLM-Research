    "solution": "To be divisible by both 5 and 11, an integer must be a multiple of 55.  The smallest three-digit multiple of 55 is $2 \\cdot 55 = 110,$ and the largest three-digit multiple of 55 is $18 \\cdot 55 = 990$. So we can count the number of integers by the number of multiples, $2, 3, \\ldots , 17 , 18$, of which there are $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the numbers together! First, we need to find the smallest three-digit number that is divisible by both 11 and 5. Do you know what that number is? Let's figure it out! Once we find that number, we can keep adding 55 to it because 55 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 11 and 5. Let's count together and see how many numbers we can find!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 17?: Let's count the numbers together! First, we need to find the smallest three-digit number that is divisible by both 11 and 5. Do you know what that number is? Let's figure it out!

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "Yes. \n\nThe smallest three-digit number that is divisible by both 11 and 5 is 110. Adding 55 to 110 four times gives us 110 + 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 330. Thus, the final solution obtained is 330 which is equal to 17.",
