    "solution": "To be divisible by both 5 and 11, an integer must be a multiple of 55.  The smallest three-digit multiple of 55 is $2 \\cdot 55 = 110,$ and the largest three-digit multiple of 55 is $18 \\cdot 55 = 990$. So we can count the number of integers by the number of multiples, $2, 3, \\ldots , 17 , 18$, of which there are $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, we need to think about what numbers are divisible by both 11 and 5. \n\nFirst, let's think about what numbers are divisible by 11. The multiples of 11 are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, and so on. \n\nNext, let's think about what numbers are divisible by 5. The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and so on. \n\nTo find numbers that are divisible by both 11 and 5, we need to find the numbers that are multiples of both 11 and 5. \n\nThe smallest positive three-digit integer that is divisible by both 11 and 5 is 55.
