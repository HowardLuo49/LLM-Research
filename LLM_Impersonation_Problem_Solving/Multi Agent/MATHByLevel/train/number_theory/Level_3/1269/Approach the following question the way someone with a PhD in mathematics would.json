    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Divide the product of the first five positive composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers. Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The first ten positive composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18. The desired quotient is $\\frac{4\\cdot6\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{12\\cdot14\\cdot15\\cdot16\\cdot18}$. After cancellation, we get $\\frac{1}{14\\cdot3}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{42}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to identify the first five positive composite integers. These are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nThe product of these numbers is 4 * 6 * 8 * 9 * 10 = 17280.\n\nNext, we need to identify the next five composite integers. These are 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18.\n\nThe product of these numbers is 12 * 14 * 15 * 16 * 18 = 725760.\n\nFinally, we divide the product of the first five composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers:\n\n17280 / 725760 = 3 / 128\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3/128.",
