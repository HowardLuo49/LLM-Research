    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Divide the product of the first five positive composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers. Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The first ten positive composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18. The desired quotient is $\\frac{4\\cdot6\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{12\\cdot14\\cdot15\\cdot16\\cdot18}$. After cancellation, we get $\\frac{1}{14\\cdot3}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{42}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, first we need to find the first five positive composite numbers. They are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Let's multiply them together: 4 x 6 x 8 x 9 x 10 = 17280.\n\nNext, we need to find the next five composite numbers. They are 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. Let's multiply them together: 12 x 14 x 15 x 16 x 18 = 725760.\n\nNow, we divide the product of the first five composite numbers by the product of the next five composite numbers: 17280 / 725760 = 1/42.\n\nSo, the answer is 1/42.",
