    "solution": "We have $n = 50a-1$ for some integer $a$, so $n\\equiv -1\\pmod{50}$. Therefore, \\begin{align*}\nn^2+2n+3 &\\equiv (-1)^2+2(-1)+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1-2+3 \\\\\n&\\equiv 2\\quad\\pmod{50}.\n\\end{align*}The remainder when $n^2+2n+3$ is divided by $50$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding a number that is $1$ less than a multiple of $50$. Since $50$ times $1$ is $50$, we can start there and subtract $1$ to get $49$.
