    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $10,\\!000$ divided by 15 yields a quotient of 666 with a remainder of 10. Thus $10,\\!005$ is a multiple of 15, and $\\boxed{10,\\!010}$ is the least five-digit integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15). For confirmation, note that $10,\\!010-15=9,\\!995$ is the next-highest integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least five-digit positive integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15), we need to find the smallest multiple of 15 that is greater than 5000 and is 5 more than a multiple of 15.\n\nLet x be the least five-digit positive integer that satisfies the given congruence. We can write this as:\nx = 15k + 5\n\nwhere k is an integer. To find the smallest k such that x is a five-digit number, we can set x = 10000 and solve for k:\n10000 = 15k + 5\n9995 = 15k\nk = 666.3333...\n\nSince k must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 666.3333 is 667. Therefore, the smallest five-digit positive integer that is congruent to 5 (mod 15) is:\nx = 15(667) + 5 = 10010\n\nThus, the least five-digit positive integer that is congruent to 5 (mod 15) is 10010.",
