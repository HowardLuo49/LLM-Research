    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $10,\\!000$ divided by 15 yields a quotient of 666 with a remainder of 10. Thus $10,\\!005$ is a multiple of 15, and $\\boxed{10,\\!010}$ is the least five-digit integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15). For confirmation, note that $10,\\!010-15=9,\\!995$ is the next-highest integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least five-digit positive integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15), we need to find the smallest number that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 15.\n\nSince 5 is our target remainder, we can start by adding 5 to multiples of 15 until we reach a five-digit number. \n\nLet's start with the smallest multiple of 15, which is 15 itself. Adding 5 to 15 gives us 20, which is not a five-digit number. \n\nThe next multiple of 15 is 30. Adding 5 to 30 gives us 35, still not a five-digit number. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we eventually reach 10005, which is a five-digit number and leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 15. \n\nTherefore, the least five-digit positive integer congruent to 5 (mod 15) is 10005.",
