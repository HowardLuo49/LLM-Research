    "solution": "According to the problem statement, we have the system of linear congruences \\begin{align*}\nm &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*} It follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{40}$. The only number that satisfies this criterion for $30 \\le m \\le 80$ is $m = \\boxed{42}$, which is indeed divisible by $6$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by counting by 6 and seeing which number is between 30 and 80! So we have 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, and 78. Now let's try dividing each of these numbers by 8. We see that only 72 gives a remainder of 2! Yay! Now let's check if 72 gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. It does! So the value of $m$ is $\\boxed{72}$.",
