    "solution": "If we remember that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, then we know that $.\\overline{2}=\\frac29$. The reciprocal is $\\boxed{\\frac92}$.\n\nIf we didn't know that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, we let $x=.\\overline{2}$. That means $10x=2.\\overline{2}$ and $9x=2.\\overline{2}-.\\overline{2}=2$. So $x=\\frac29$ and the reciprocal is $\\frac92$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the reciprocal of a fraction, we simply flip it upside down. \n\nThe common fraction form of $.\\overline{2}$ is $\\frac{2}{9}$.\n\nSo, the reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{9}$ is $\\frac{9}{2}$.",
