    "solution": "The greatest product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number is $(10^4-1)(10^3-1)=10^7-10^4-10^3+1=10^7-(10^4+10^3-1)$. $10^7$ has 8 digits and $10^4+10^3-1=11,000-1=10,999$ has 5 digits. Clearly, their difference (10,000,000-10,999) has $8-1=\\boxed{7}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see! We need to find the biggest number we can get when we multiply a 4-digit number with a 3-digit number. So, let's pretend we have the biggest 4-digit number which is 9999 and the biggest 3-digit number which is 999. When we multiply them together, we get:\n\n9999 x 999 = 9989001\n\nWow! We got a 7-digit number! So, the greatest possible number of digits in the product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number is 7 digits. Yay!",
