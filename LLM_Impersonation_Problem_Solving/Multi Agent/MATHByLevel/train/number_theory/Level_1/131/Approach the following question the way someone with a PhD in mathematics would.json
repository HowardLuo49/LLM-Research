What is the least number of pieces he should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally?",
    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can approach it by finding the remainder when $20$ is divided by $3$. This can be done by using the division algorithm from basic modular arithmetic.\n\nLet $A$ be the total number of pieces of candy that Daniel takes away.\n\nWe know that $20 \\equiv A \\pmod{3}$.\n\nSince $20$ is congruent to $2 \\pmod{3}$, the least number of pieces he should take away should be $2$ in order to distribute the candy equally among his $3$ sisters.",
