    "solution": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3, we first need to determine the remainder when 412 is divided by 3. This can be done by finding the remainder of the division using modular arithmetic:\n\n412 mod 3 = 1\n\nSince the remainder is 1, we need to find the smallest integer that, when added to 412, will result in a multiple of 3. In other words, we need to find the smallest integer n such that (412 + n) mod 3 = 0.\n\nSince the remainder when divided by 3 is 1, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that (412 + n) mod 3 = 0, or equivalently n mod 3 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3 is 2.",
