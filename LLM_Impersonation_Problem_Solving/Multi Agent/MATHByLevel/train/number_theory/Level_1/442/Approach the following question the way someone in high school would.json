    "solution": "Since $100=33\\cdot3+1$, the first $100$ letters are $33$ copies of the $3$ letters $ABC$ followed by an $A$.  The $100$th letter is $\\boxed{A}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th letter in the pattern ABCABCABC..., we can think of the pattern as repeating every 3 letters. So if we divide 100 by 3, we get a remainder of 1. This means that the 100th letter will be the same as the 1st letter, which is A. So the 100th letter in the pattern is A.",
