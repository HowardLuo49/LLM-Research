To find out what $N$ is, we need to think about what numbers can be divided by 3 to get a value between 7.5 and 8.\n\nLet's see, if we multiply 3 by 7.5, we get 22.5, and if we multiply 3 by 8, we get 24. So, the number we're looking for must be between 22.5 and 24.\n\nHmm, let's try some numbers in between. If we try to divide 23 by 3, we get 7.66666667. That's between 7.5 and 8, so $N$ could be 23!\n\nSo, the value of $N$ is 23.",
