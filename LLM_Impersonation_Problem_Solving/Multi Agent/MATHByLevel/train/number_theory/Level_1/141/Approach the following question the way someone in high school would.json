    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A math class has fewer than $40$ students. When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. How many students are in this class?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know that there are fewer than $40$ students in this class. Let's start by trying to figure out how many students there are by looking at the first condition - when trying to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students are left over. This means that the total number of students in the class is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$.\n\nLet's list out the first few multiples of $7$: $7, 14, 21, 28, 35$...\n\nIf we add $3$ to each of these numbers, we get: $10, 17, 24, 31, 38$...\n\nNext, let's look at the second condition - when trying to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left over. This means that the total number of students in the class is $1$ more than a multiple of $5$.\n\nNow let's list out the first few multiples of $5$: $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35$...\n\nIf we add $1$ to each of these numbers, we get: $6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36$...\n\nFrom here, we can see that the only number that satisfies both conditions is $31$. Therefore, there are $31$ students in this math class.",
