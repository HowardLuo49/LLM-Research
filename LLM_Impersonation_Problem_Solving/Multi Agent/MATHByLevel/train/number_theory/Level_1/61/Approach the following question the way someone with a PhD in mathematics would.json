    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When $n$ is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. What is the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3?",
    "solution": "Since $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we can first express $n$ in terms of the division by 3. Let $n = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$. This means that $n$ can be written as $n = 3k + 2$ where $k$ is an integer. \n\nNext, we are asked to find the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3. We can express $5n$ as $5(3k + 2) = 15k + 10$. Since 15 is divisible by 3, $15k$ is divisible by 3 so the remainder will come from the term 10.\n\nWhen 10 is divided by 3, we find that the remainder is 1. Hence, the remainder when 5n is divided by 3 is 1 as well. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $5n$ is divided by 3 is 1.",
