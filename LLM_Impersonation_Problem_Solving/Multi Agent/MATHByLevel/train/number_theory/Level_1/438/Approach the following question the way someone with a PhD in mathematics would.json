    "solution": "Let $a$ be the least number of pennies that Joyce could have in the bank. Then \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1\\pmod 5\\\\\na & \\equiv 2\\pmod 3\n\\end{align*} The first few positive solutions to $a\\equiv 1\\pmod 5$ are $1,6,11$. Luckily, while the first two do not satisfy $a\\equiv 2\\pmod 3$, $\\boxed{11}$ does!",
