    "solution": "Between 1 and 25, the smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. Thus the sum is $2+23=\\boxed{25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so a prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1. Let's see, the smallest prime number between 1 and 25 is 2 because it can only be divided by 1 and 2. And the largest prime number between 1 and 25 is 23 because it can only be divided by 1 and 23. To find the sum of these two numbers, we can count them on our fingers. So, 2 plus 23 equals 25! Yay, we did it!",
