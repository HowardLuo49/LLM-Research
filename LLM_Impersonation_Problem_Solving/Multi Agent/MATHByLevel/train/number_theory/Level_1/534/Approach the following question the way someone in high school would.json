    "solution": "Between 1 and 25, the smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. Thus the sum is $2+23=\\boxed{25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the prime numbers between 1 and 25 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. The smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. If we add them together, we get 25. So, the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on Cory's list is 25.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 25?: Okay, so the prime numbers between 1 and 25 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. The smallest prime number is 2 and the largest prime number is 23. If we add them together, we get 25. So, the sum of the smallest prime number and the largest prime number on Cory's list is 25.",
