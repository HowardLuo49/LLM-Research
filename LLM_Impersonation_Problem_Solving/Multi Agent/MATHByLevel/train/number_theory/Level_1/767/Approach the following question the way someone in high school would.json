    "solution": "49 days is seven full weeks, so there are always $\\boxed{7}$ Sundays.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so to find the greatest number of Sundays that can occur in the first 49 days of a year, we need to figure out how many full weeks are in 49 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 49 by 7 to get 7 weeks. \n\nSo, if we have 7 full weeks, that means we will have 7 Sundays in those weeks. But since we are looking for the greatest number of Sundays, we also need to consider the possibility of having an additional Sunday outside of those 7 weeks. \n\nIf the year starts on a Sunday, then the 49th day will also be a Sunday, giving us a total of 8 Sundays in the first 49 days of the year. \n\nTherefore, the greatest number of Sundays that can occur in the first 49 days of a year is 8.",
