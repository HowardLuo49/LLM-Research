    "solution": "If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3. Clearly, 369,963 is not divisible by 2. However, it is divisible by 3. Thus, the remainder after dividing by 6 is an odd, non-negative multiple of 3 that is less than 6. The only number such number is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6, we can use the Division Algorithm which states that for integers a and b with b not equal to 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that\n\na = bq + r, where 0 \u2264 r < |b|.\n\nIn this case, 369,963 divided by 6 can be written as:\n\n369,963 = 6q + r.\n\nTo find q and r, we divide 369,963 by 6:\n\n369,963 \u00f7 6 = 61,660 with a remainder of 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6 is 3.",
