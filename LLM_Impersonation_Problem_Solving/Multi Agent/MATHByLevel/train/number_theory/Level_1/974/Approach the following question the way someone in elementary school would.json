    "solution": "The least common multiple of these integers is $4\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$. Thus, a positive integer that is one more than a multiple of all the given integers is $60+1=\\boxed{61}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The least common multiple is 60 because it is the smallest number that all those numbers can go into evenly. \n\nTo find the number that is one more than a multiple of these numbers, we just add 1 to 60. So, the number we are looking for is 61. \n\nTherefore, the two-digit positive integer that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 61.",
