    "solution": "$n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{1000} \\implies n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ and $n^3 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125}$. $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$ due to the last digit of $n^3$. Let $n = 5a + 2$. By expanding, $125a^3 + 150a^2 + 60a + 8 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{125} \\implies 5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$.\nBy looking at the last digit again, we see $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod5$, so we let $a = 5a_1 + 3$ where $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$. Plugging this in to $5a^2 + 12a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ gives $10a_1 + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. Obviously, $a_1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5$, so we let $a_1 = 5a_2 + 2$ where $a_2$ can be any non-negative integer.\nTherefore, $n = 2 + 5(3+ 5(2+5a_2)) = 125a_2 + 67$. $n^3$ must also be a multiple of $8$, so $n$ must be even. $125a_2 + 67 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\implies a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Therefore, $a_2 = 2a_3 + 1$, where $a_3$ is any non-negative integer. The number $n$ has form $125(2a_3+1)+67 = 250a_3+192$. So the minimum $n = \\boxed{192}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer such that $n^3 \\equiv 888 \\pmod{10}$. This condition implies that $n^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nWe know that $n$ must end in the digit $2$, as the only possible cubes of numbers ending in $2$ are $8$, $48$, and $128$, which all end in $8$. \n\nThus, we can write $n$ as $10a + 2$ for some integer $a$. Expanding $(10a + 2)^3$ using the binomial theorem and simplifying, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(10a + 2)^3 &= 1000a^3 + 600a^2 + 120a + 8 \\\\\n&\\equiv 8 \\pmod{10}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying further, we get $600a^2 + 120a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$. Dividing by $10$, we have $60a^2 + 12a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$, which simplifies to $6a^2 + 2a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$.\n\nHence, $6a(a+1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$. This implies that either $a$ or $a + 1$ is divisible by $5$. Since $a$ represents the tens digit of $n$, $a$ must be $5$. \n\nTherefore, $n = 10 \\times 5 + 2 = \\boxed{52}$ is the smallest positive integer whose cube ends in $888$.",
