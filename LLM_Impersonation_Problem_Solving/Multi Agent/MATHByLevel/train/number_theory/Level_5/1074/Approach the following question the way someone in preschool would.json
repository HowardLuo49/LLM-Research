    "solution": "Note that $60$ is divisible by $3$, but $20$ is not divisible by $3$. Therefore, if $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$, then $\\nu$ must be divisible by 3 and we may write $\\nu=3n$ (where $n$ is a positive integer).\n\nThus we have $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]=60$, and since the $3n$ contributes the factor of $3$ to $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]$, it follows that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,20]=\\frac{60}{3}=20$. This is true if and only if $n$ is a divisor of $20$. Therefore, the possible values of $\\nu$ are $3$ times the positive divisors of $20$: $$\\nu = 3,6,12,15,30,\\,\\text{or}\\,60.$$The sum of these values is $\\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember what all the words mean. The sum means we add them all up, positive integers are just regular numbers that are greater than zero, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}$ means the least common multiple. \n\nWe want to find all the positive numbers that, when we find the least common multiple with 20, the answer is 60. So, we're looking for numbers that have 20 as a factor but don't have any other factors in common with 20.\n\nWe can start by listing all the multiples of 20: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and so on.\n\nTo find the numbers that only have 20 as a factor, we can divide by 20 and simplify. For example, 40 divided by 20 is 2. That only has one factor, 20. So, 40 doesn't work.\n\nBut when we divide 60 by 20, we get 3. That only has 20 as a factor. So, 60 works!\n\nSo, the sum of all positive integers that satisfy $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$ is just 60.",
