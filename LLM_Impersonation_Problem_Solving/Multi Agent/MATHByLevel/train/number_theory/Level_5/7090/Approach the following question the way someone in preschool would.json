    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $a_{10} = 10$, and for each positive integer $n >10$ let $a_n = 100a_{n - 1} + n$. Find the least positive $n > 10$ such that $a_n$ is a multiple of $99$.\n",
    "solution": "Writing out the recursive statement for $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_{10}$ and summing them gives\\[a_n+\\dots+a_{10}=100(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+n+\\dots+10\\]Which simplifies to\\[a_n=99(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)\\]Therefore, $a_n$ is divisible by 99 if and only if $\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)$ is divisible by 99, so $(n+10)(n-9)$ needs to be divisible by 9 and 11. Assume that $n+10$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=12, 23, 34, 45$, we see that $n=45$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. Next, assume that $n-9$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=20, 31, 42, 53$, we see that $n=53$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. The smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\nNote that we can also construct the solution using CRT by assuming either $11$ divides $n+10$ and $9$ divides $n-9$, or $9$ divides $n+10$ and $11$ divides $n-9$, and taking the smaller solution.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's start with $a_{10} = 10$. Then we can find $a_{11}$ by plugging in $n=11$ into the formula: $a_{11} = 100a_{11-1} + 11 = 100a_{10} + 11$. Since $a_{10} = 10$, we have $a_{11} = 100(10) + 11 = 1011$. Now we can keep going and find $a_{12}$, $a_{13}$, and so on. We want to find the least positive $n > 10$ such that $a_n$ is a multiple of $99$. To check if a number is a multiple of 99, we can add up its digits to see if that sum is a multiple of 9. If the sum is a multiple of 9, then the whole number is a multiple of 9, and thus a multiple of 99. So let's calculate the sum of the digits of $a_{11}$: $1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3$, which is not a multiple of 9. Therefore, $a_{11}$ is not a multiple of 99. Let's keep calculating the sums of the digits for $a_{12}$, $a_{13}$, and so on until we find the least positive $n > 10$ such that $a_n$ is a multiple of $99.",
