    "solution": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the different prime numbers that can multiply together to make the number 400. \nFirst, we find the positive divisors of 400 which are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 200, and 400. \nThen, we add them all up to get 946. \nNext, we find the prime factors of 946 which are 2, 11, and 43. \nSo, the sum of the positive divisors of 400 has 3 distinct prime factors: 2, 11, and 43. Yay!",
