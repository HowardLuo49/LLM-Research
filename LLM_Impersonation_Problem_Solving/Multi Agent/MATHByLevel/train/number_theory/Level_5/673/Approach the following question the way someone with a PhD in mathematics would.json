    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct prime factors does the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ have?",
    "solution": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct prime factors of the sum of divisors of a number, we must first find the sum of divisors of the number. \n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\times 5^2$. The sum of divisors of a number $n$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\ldots + p_1^{a_1}) \\times (1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \\times \\ldots \\times (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\ldots + p_k^{a_k}),\n$$\nwhere $p_i$ are the distinct prime factors of $n$, and $a_i$ are their corresponding multiplicities. \n\nFor $400$, the formula gives:\n$$\n\\sigma(400) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4) \\times (1 + 5 + 5^2) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) \\times (1 + 5 + 25) = 31 \\times 31 = 961.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the sum of divisors of $400$ is $961$. To find the distinct prime factors of $961$, we prime factorize $961$:\n$$961 = 31^2.$$\n\nSo, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ has only one distinct prime factor, which is $31$.",
