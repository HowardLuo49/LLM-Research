    "solution": "Write $n^2 = (m + 1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$, or equivalently, $(2n + 1)(2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 12m^2 + 12m + 3 = 3(2m + 1)^2$.\nSince $2n + 1$ and $2n - 1$ are both odd and their difference is $2$, they are relatively prime. But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square. We cannot have $2n - 1$ be three times a square, for then $2n + 1$ would be a square congruent to $2$ modulo $3$, which is impossible.\nThus $2n - 1$ is a square, say $b^2$. But $2n + 79$ is also a square, say $a^2$. Then $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80$. Since $a + b$ and $a - b$ have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even. To maximize $n$, it suffices to maximize $2b = (a + b) - (a - b)$ and check that this yields an integral value for $m$. This occurs when $a + b = 40$ and $a - b = 2$, that is, when $a = 21$ and $b = 19$. This yields $n = 181$ and $m = 104$, so the answer is $\\boxed{181}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's break this down. \nFor condition (i), we want to find an integer $n$ such that $n^2 = (m+1)^3 - m^3$ for some integer $m$. Well, that simplifies to $n^2 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$. This means $n$ must be odd, as an odd squared number is always $1$ more than a multiple of $4$. \nFor condition (ii), we have $2n + 79 = k^2$. This means $2n = k^2 - 79$, or $n = \\frac{k^2 - 79}{2}$. \nSo, we need to find the largest odd integer $k$ such that $\\frac{k^2 - 79}{2}$ is an integer. We can start from $k=1$ and keep increasing $k$ until $\\frac{k^2 - 79}{2}$ is no longer an integer. \nUsing a bit of guess and check, we find that $k=9$ is the largest odd integer that satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the largest integer $n$ is $\\frac{9^2 - 79}{2} = \\boxed{20}$.",
