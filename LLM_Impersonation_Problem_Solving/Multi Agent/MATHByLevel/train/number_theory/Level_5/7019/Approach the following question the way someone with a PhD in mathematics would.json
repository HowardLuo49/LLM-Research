    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $n$ be the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of $75$ and has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, including $1$ and itself. Find $\\frac{n}{75}$.\n",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \\cdot 5^2} = 16 \\cdot 27 = \\boxed{432}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n = 75k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Since $n$ has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, we know that $n$ is of the form $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\dots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_k$ are positive integers.\n\nSince $n = 75k = 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot k$ has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, we know that $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, and $a_k = 1$.\n\nThe number of divisors of $n$ is equal to $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\dots(a_k+1)$, so in this case, we have $(1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 12$ factors. \n\nSince we want $n$ to have exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, we must have $p_1 = 3$, $p_2 = 5$ and $k = 3^3$.
