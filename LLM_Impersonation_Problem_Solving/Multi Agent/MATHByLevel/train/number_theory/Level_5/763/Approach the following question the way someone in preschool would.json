    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A particular fortune cookie lists four two-digit positive integers as your lucky numbers. The first three are 57, 13, and 72, but you got sauce on the last one and can't read it. If the sum of the digits of all four numbers equals $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, what is the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number?",
    "solution": "The sum of the first three numbers is $57+13+72=142$. If we let $10a+b$ represent the last number, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively, then the sum of the four numbers is $142+10a+b$. The sum of the digits of the first three numbers is $5+7+1+3+7+2=25$, so the total sum of the digits is $25+a+b$. If we multiply the sum of the digits by 5, we should get the sum of the four numbers. \\begin{align*}\n142+10a+b&=5(25+a+b)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=125+5a+5b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n17+5a&=4b\n\\end{align*} We notice that if we add a multiple of 5 to 17, the ones digit will either be 2 or 7. The next multiple of 4 that is greater than 17 and ends with a 2 or 7 is 32. That means $b=8$, while $17+5a=32$, so $5a=15$ and $a=3$. So the last number is $\\boxed{38}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yum, fortune cookies are yummy! I had one that told me four numbers were lucky. The first three are 57, 13, and 72. But oh no, I got sauce on the last one and can't read it! Oopsie!\n\nNow, the fortune cookie also said that if you add up all the digits in all four numbers, it will be $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers.\n\nLet's try to figure out what the fourth lucky number could be. We know that 57 has 5 + 7 = 12, 13 has 1 + 3 = 4, and 72 has 7 + 2 = 9. So, the sum of the digits in the first three numbers is 12 + 4 + 9 = 25.\n\nNow, since the sum of the digits is $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, we can write the equation: 25 = $\\frac{1}{5}$(57 + 13 + 72 + fourth number)\n\nNow, we just need to solve for the fourth number! Let's try the smallest possible two-digit number, 10. If the fourth number was 10, the sum of all four numbers would be 57 + 13 + 72 + 10 = 152. If we add up the digits in this sum, we get 1 + 5 + 2 = 8, which is not equal to 25.\n\nSo, let's try the next smallest possible two-digit number, 11. If the fourth number was 11, the sum of all four numbers would be 57 + 13 + 72 + 11 = 153. If we add up the digits in this sum, we get 1 + 5 + 3 = 9, which is not equal to 25.\n\nHmm, it seems like 10 and 11 are too small. Let's try the next smallest two-digit number, 12. If the fourth number was 12, the sum of all four numbers would be 57 + 13 + 72 + 12 = 154. If we add up the digits in this sum, we get 1 + 5 + 4 = 10, which is not equal to 25.\n\nWell, it looks like 10, 11, and 12 are too small. I think we need to try a bigger number! Let's keep trying until we find the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number.",
