    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A particular fortune cookie lists four two-digit positive integers as your lucky numbers. The first three are 57, 13, and 72, but you got sauce on the last one and can't read it. If the sum of the digits of all four numbers equals $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, what is the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number?",
    "solution": "The sum of the first three numbers is $57+13+72=142$. If we let $10a+b$ represent the last number, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively, then the sum of the four numbers is $142+10a+b$. The sum of the digits of the first three numbers is $5+7+1+3+7+2=25$, so the total sum of the digits is $25+a+b$. If we multiply the sum of the digits by 5, we should get the sum of the four numbers. \\begin{align*}\n142+10a+b&=5(25+a+b)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=125+5a+5b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n17+5a&=4b\n\\end{align*} We notice that if we add a multiple of 5 to 17, the ones digit will either be 2 or 7. The next multiple of 4 that is greater than 17 and ends with a 2 or 7 is 32. That means $b=8$, while $17+5a=32$, so $5a=15$ and $a=3$. So the last number is $\\boxed{38}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So, we know the first three lucky numbers are 57, 13, and 72. We have to find the fourth one. Let's call it xy, where x and y are the digits of the number.\n\nThe sum of the digits of all four numbers is 5+7+1+3+7+2+x+y = 25+x+y. The sum of all four numbers is 57+13+72+10x+y = 142+10x+y.\n\nAccording to the information given in the fortune cookie, the sum of the digits of all four numbers is equal to 1/5 of the sum of all four numbers. So, we have the equation:\n\n25+x+y = 1/5 * (142+10x+y).\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 5 to get rid of the fraction gives:\n\n125+5x+5y = 142+10x+y.\n\nRearranging:\n\n3x-4y = -17.\n\nSince we're looking for the smallest possible number for the fourth lucky number, we want to minimize x and maximize y. The smallest positive two-digit number is 10, so let's try x=1 and y=3:\n\n3(1) - 4(3) = - 9 which is not equal to -17.\n\nLet's try the next smallest number, which is 11:\n\n3(1) - 4(4) = -12 which is also not equal to -17.\n\nNow we try x=2 and y=3:\n\n3(2) - 4(3) = -6 which is once again not equal to -17.\n\nLet's try x=2 and y=4 now:\n\n3(2) - 4(4) = -6-16 = -22 which is less than -17.\n\nSo, the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number is 23.",
