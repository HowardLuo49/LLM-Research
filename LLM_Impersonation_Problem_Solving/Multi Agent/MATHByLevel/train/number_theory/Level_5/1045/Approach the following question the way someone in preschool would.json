    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. What is the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6?",
    "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmmmm...let's see. I know that if we divide a number by 7, there will be no remainder. And if we divide that same number by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, there will be a remainder of 1. So the number we are looking for needs to be a multiple of 7 plus 1. Let's count by 7s and find the one that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Okay, let's count...7, 14, 21, 28, 35. Ah-ha! 35 is the number we are looking for. It is divisible by 7 and leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Yay, we did it!",
