    "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least whole number that satisfies the given conditions, we can approach this problem using modular arithmetic. Let the unknown number be represented as x.\n\nWe know that x is divisible by 7, so we can express this as x \u2261 0 (mod 7).\n\nWe are also given that x leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6. This can be expressed as:\nx \u2261 1 (mod 2)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 4)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 5)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 6)\n\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can combine these congruences to find a unique solution for x modulo the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 60.\n\nNow, we can write the system of congruences as:\nx \u2261 0 (mod 7)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 60)\n\nBy solving this system of congruences, we can find the least whole number that satisfies all the given conditions. The solution will be the smallest integer x that satisfies both of these congruences.\n\nTherefore, the least whole number that is divisible by 7 and leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6 is the solution of the system of congruences x \u2261 1 (mod 60) and x \u2261 0 (mod 7).",
