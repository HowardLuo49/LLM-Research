    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. What is the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6?",
    "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find a number that is divisible by 7, but when divided by any number from 2 to 6, it leaves a remainder of 1. \n\nLet's start by listing out the multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, ...\n\nNow, let's check which of these numbers leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. \n\nAfter checking, we find that 49 is the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer from 2 to 6. \n\nSo, the answer is 49.",
