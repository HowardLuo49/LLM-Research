    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",
    "solution": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by counting how many sets $S_i$ do contain a perfect square. First, let's find the largest integer $n$ in each set such that $n$ is a perfect square. \n\nThe largest integer in $S_0$ that is a perfect square is $100$, which is $10^2$.\n\nThe largest integer in $S_1$ that is a perfect square is $121$, which is $11^2$.\n\nThe largest integer in $S_2$ that is a perfect square is $144$, which is $12^2$.\n\nWe notice a pattern here - the largest integer in $S_i$ that is a perfect square is $(i+10)^2$. \n\nNow we can count how many sets $S_i$ contain a perfect square. The largest square less than $1000$ is $31^2=961$, so the largest $i$ satisfying $(i+10)^2\\leq 999$ is $i=21$. This means there are $21$ sets $S_i$ that contain a perfect square. \n\nSince there are $1000$ total sets $S_i$ from $S_0$ to $S_{999}$, the number of sets that do not contain a perfect square is $1000 - 21 = 979$. \n\nTherefore, there are $979$ sets $S_i$ that do not contain a perfect square.",
