    "solution": "We must have that $p^3+7+3p^2+6+p^2+p+3+p^2+2p+5+6=p^2+4p+2+2p^2+7p+1+3p^2+6p$, meaning that $p^3-p^2-14p+24=0$. But the only prime solutions of this can be factors of $24$, i.e. $2$ and $3$. But $7$ is not a digit in base $2$ or $3$, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ possible $p$!\n\nRemark: $2$ and $3$ are, in fact, roots of this polynomial.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to remember some things about adding numbers in different bases. Let's start by adding the numbers on the left side of the equation. \n\nIn the ones place, we have 7+6+3+5+6 = 27 in base $p$. Since $p$ is prime, the largest digit it can have is $p-1$. This means that 27 must be equal to $2p+7$ in base $p$. We can set up an equation to solve for $p$: \n\n$2p+7 = 27$\n\nSubtracting 7 from both sides gives us: \n\n$2p = 20$\n\nDividing by 2 gives us $p=10$. But wait! $10$ is not a prime number, so this means that our initial assumption was not correct. Let's try adding the numbers on the right side of the equation. \n\nIn the ones place, we have 2+1+0 = 3 in base $p$. This means that 3 must be equal to $3$ in base $p$. Since $p$ is prime, the only possible value for $p$ that satisfies this equation is $p=3$. \n\nTherefore, there is only one possible value of $p$, which is 3.",
