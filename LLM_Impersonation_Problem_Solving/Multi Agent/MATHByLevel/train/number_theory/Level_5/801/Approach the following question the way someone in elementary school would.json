    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. An eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "So, we have to find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit numbers where a positive four-digit number is repeated twice. Like 25,632,563 or 60,786,078. So, let's take an example of a four-digit number, let's say 1234. \n\nWhen we repeat this number twice, we get an eight-digit number 12341234. \n\nNow, to find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit numbers of this form, we need to find the common factors of the repeated four-digit number. \n\nThe factors of 1234 are 1, 2, 617, and 1234. \n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit numbers of this form is 1, because 1 is the only common factor in all the repeated four-digit numbers.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit numbers formed by repeating a positive four-digit number is 1.",
