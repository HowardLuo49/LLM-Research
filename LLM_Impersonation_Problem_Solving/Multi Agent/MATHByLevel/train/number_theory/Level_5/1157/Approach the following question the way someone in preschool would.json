    "solution": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If we think about the factors of 18, we have 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. We want $n^2$ to be divisible by 18, so $n$ must be at least 3. But we also want $n^3$ to be divisible by 640, so we need to figure out the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies both conditions. Let's try 3 first and see if it works. If $n=3$, we have $n^3 = 27$ which is not divisible by 640. Let's try 6 next. If $n=6$, we have $n^2 = 36$ which is divisible by 18, and $n^3 = 216$ which is also divisible by 640. So 6 is the smallest positive integer $n$ that works! Yay, we did it!",
