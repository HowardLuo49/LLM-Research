Each of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is $25.$ One marble is taken out of each box randomly. The probability that both marbles are black is $27/50,$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n$?\n",
    "solution": "If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.\nLet $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$. Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$. It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.\nCase 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second. Then, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.\nCase 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both. Thus, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{1}{25}$. $m + n = 26$.\nThus, $m + n = \\boxed{26}$.",
