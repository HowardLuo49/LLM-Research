    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1356 \\pmod{22}$ to $1356 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$. Therefore, we have $$3n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$$This means that $3n$ can be written in the form $22a+14$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $3n=22a+14$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{22a+14}{3}=n$ is an integer, which we can easily find to be $1$. Therefore, $n=\\frac{22+14}{3}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$, we can start by finding a number that is equivalent to $1356$ when multiplied by $3$. \n\nFirst, we can multiply $3$ by different numbers until we find one that leaves a remainder of $1356$ when divided by $22$. \n\n$3 \\times 1 = 3$, with a remainder of $3$ when divided by $22$.\n$3 \\times 2 = 6$, with a remainder of $6$ when divided by $22$.\n$3 \\times 3 = 9$, with a remainder of $9$ when divided by $22$.\n$\\dots$\n$3 \\times 452 = 1356$, with a remainder of $0$ when divided by $22$.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$ is $452$.",
