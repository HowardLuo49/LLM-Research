    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The harmonic mean of two positive integers is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of their reciprocals. For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ with $x<y$ is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ equal to $6^{20}$?\n",
    "solution": "The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}}2} = \\frac{2xy}{x+y}$, so we have $xy=(x+y)(3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})$, and by SFFT, $(x-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})(y-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})=3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$. Now, $3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$ has $41\\cdot39=1599$ factors, one of which is the square root ($3^{20}2^{19}$). Since $x<y$, the answer is half of the remaining number of factors, which is $\\frac{1599-1}{2}= \\boxed{799}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's review what the harmonic mean and arithmetic mean are. The harmonic mean of two numbers is found by taking the reciprocal of the average of their reciprocals. The arithmetic mean is just the average of the two numbers.\n\nSo we want to find the number of pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ where $x < y$ and the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $6^{20}$.\n\nLet's write out the equations we need to solve:\n\nThe harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is: $2/(1/x + 1/y)$.\nWe want this to equal $6^{20}$: $2/(1/x + 1/y) = 6^{20}$.\n\nTo simplify, we can rewrite this as: $2xy/(x+y) = 6^{20}$.\n\nWe can then rewrite this as: $2xy = 6^{20}(x+y)$.\n\nNow let's try some values for $x$ and $y$ to see if they satisfy this equation.
