    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The four consecutive digits $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are used to form the four-digit numbers $abcd$ and $dcba$. What is the greatest common divisor of all numbers of the form $abcd+dcba$?",
    "solution": "We have  \\begin{align*}\nabcd &= 1000a + 100b + 10c + d,\\text { and }\\\\\ndcba &= 1000d + 100c + 10b + a\\end{align*} Adding these gives \\begin{align*}\nabcd + dcba &= (1000 + 1)d + (100 + 10)c \\\\\n&\\qquad + (10 + 100)b + (1 + 1000)a \\\\\n&= 1001(a+d) + 110(b+c).\n\\end{align*} Furthermore, since $a,b,c,d$ are consecutive, we have $b = a+1$, $c = a+2$, and $d = a+3$, so that $$a+d = 2a + 3 = b+c.$$ Hence, $$abcd + dcba = 1001(2a+3) + 110(2a+3) = 1111(2a+3).$$ It follows that $\\boxed{1111}$ must divide any number of the given form. To see that no higher number must divide it, if we take $a = 1$ and $a=2$, we get the numbers $5555$ and $7777$, whose greatest common factor is indeed $1111$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's look at an example to make it easier. Let's use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. We can form the numbers 1234 and 4321. When we add them together, we get 1234 + 4321 = 5555.\n\nNow let's think about what happens when we use different numbers. No matter what numbers we choose for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, when we add $abcd$ and $dcba$ together, we will always get a number in the form 1111, 2222, 3333, ..., or 9999.\n\nSince all of these numbers are divisible by 1111, the greatest common divisor of all numbers of the form $abcd+dcba$ is 1111. So the answer to the question is 1111.",
