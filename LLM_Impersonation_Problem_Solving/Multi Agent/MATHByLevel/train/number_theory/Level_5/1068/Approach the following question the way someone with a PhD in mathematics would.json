    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's express $11^4$ in base $b$. \n\n$11^4 = (b+1)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} b^4 + \\binom{4}{1} b^3 + \\binom{4}{2} b^2 + \\binom{4}{3} b + 1$\n\nExpanding this out, we get \n\n$11^4 = b^4 + 4b^3 + 6b^2 + 4b + 1$\n\nNow, we want to find the largest base $b$ such that the sum of the digits in base $b$ representation of $11^4$ is not equal to $2^4 = 16$. \n\nThe sum of the digits can be found by adding up the coefficients of $b^4, b^3, b^2, b$, and 1. \n\nIn base $b$, the sum can be expressed as \n\n$1 + 4b + 6b^2 + 4b^3 + b^4$\n\nThis sum must not equal to 16.
