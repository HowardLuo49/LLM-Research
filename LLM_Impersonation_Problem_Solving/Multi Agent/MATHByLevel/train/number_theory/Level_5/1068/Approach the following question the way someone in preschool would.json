    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. When $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay! Let's count the sum of the digits of $11^4$ in base $b$! First, we know the sum in base 10 is $16=2^4$. Let's start by writing out $11^4$ in base $b$ and then add up all the digits. We want to find the largest base $b$ where the sum of the digits is not $2^4$.\n\nHmm...I think that base $b$ will be larger than 10 because $11$ is greater than 10. Let's try different bases and see what happens! Let's start with base 11 since our number is $11^4$. \n\nIn base $11$, $11^4$ is written as $14641$. When we add up the digits, we get $1+4+6+4+1=16=2^4$. That's not what we want!\n\nLet's try base 12! In base $12$, $11^4$ is written as $11*12^3+1=15841$. When we add up the digits, we get $1+5+8+4+1=19 \\neq 2^4$. \n\nSo, base 12 did not work! We should keep trying different bases until we find the largest one where the sum of the digits of $11^4$ is not $2^4$. Let's keep going and see what happens!",
