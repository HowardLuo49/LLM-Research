    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates. Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates. Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, while Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour. Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.\n",
    "solution": "Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.\nWe have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$. Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$. Mod 4, we need $s\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$.",

Similarly, let $a, b,$ and $c$ be the rates at which Sue bikes, jogs, and swims, respectively. \n\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following equations:\n\n$2x + 3y + 4z = 74$\n\n$4a + 2b + 3c = 91$\n\nSince Ed and Sue bike, jog, and swim at equal and constant rates, we know that $x = a, y = b,$ and $z = c$. \n\nSubstituting these equalities into the above equations, we get:\n\n$2a + 3b + 4c = 74$\n\n$4a + 2b + 3c = 91$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that $a = 7, b = 17,$ and $c = 5$. Therefore, Ed's rates are $7$ km/hr for biking, $17$ km/hr for jogging, and $5$ km/hr for swimming.\n\nTo find the sum of the squares of his rates, we calculate $7^2 + 17^2 + 5^2 = 49 + 289 + 25 = \\boxed{363}$.",
