    "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first notice that the series $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ is a geometric series. The sum of a finite geometric series is given by the formula:\n\n$$S_n = a\\left(\\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\\right)$$\n\nwhere $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, we have $a = 1$, $r = 7$, and $n = 2005$. Plugging these values into the formula, we obtain:\n\n$$1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = 1\\left(\\frac{7^{2005} - 1}{7 - 1}\\right) = \\frac{7^{2005} - 1}{6}$$\n\nNext, we want to find the remainder when this sum is divided by $1000$. We can use the modulo operator to simplify this calculation. Note that $7^{2005} \\equiv 7^{5} \\pmod{1000}$. This is a result of the fact that the residue of a number modulo $1000$ only depends on the last $3$ digits of the number. This is a well-known result in elementary number theory.\n\nTherefore, we need to calculate $7^5 \\pmod{1000}$:\n\n$$7^5 = 16807 \\equiv 807 \\pmod{1000}$$\n\nSubstitute this back into our original expression:\n\n$$\\frac{7^{2005} - 1}{6} = \\frac{807 - 1}{6} = \\frac{806}{6} \\equiv 134 \\pmod{1000}$$\n\nSo, the value of $N$ is $\\boxed{134}$.",
