    "solution": "Let us investigate the first few powers of 19: \\begin{align*}\n19^1 &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^2 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^3 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^4 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^5 &\\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}.\n\\end{align*} At this point, we see that $19^5 \\equiv 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ hence $19^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}.$ That means that $19^{1999} = 19^9 \\cdot (19^{10})^{199} \\equiv 19^9 \\pmod {25}.$\n\nSince $19^4 \\equiv 21 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ then $19^{1999} \\equiv 19^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{4}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by 25, we can use Euler's theorem which states that for any integer $a$ that is coprime to $n$, we have $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$, where $\\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function, which represents the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are coprime to $n$.\n\nSince 25 is coprime to 19, we have $\\phi(25) = (5-1) \\times (5) = 20$.
