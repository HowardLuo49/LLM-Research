In other words,\n$2008 = 2 \\cdot 3^{6} + 2 \\cdot 3^{5} + 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 1 \\cdot 3^0$\nIn order to rewrite as a sum of perfect powers of $3$, we can use the fact that $2 \\cdot 3^k = 3^{k+1} - 3^k$:\n$2008 = (3^7 - 3^6) + (3^6-3^5) + (3^4 - 3^3) + 3^2 + 3^0 = 3^7 - 3^5 + 3^4 - 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^0$\nThe answer is $7+5+4+3+2+0 = \\boxed{21}$.\nNote: Solution by bounding is also possible, namely using the fact that $1+3+3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{n} = \\displaystyle\\frac{3^{n+1}-1}{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find some numbers that when multiplied by 3 raised to various exponents (like 3, 9, 27, etc.) will give us 2008.

Let's see if we can get closer to 2008 by adding more terms.\n\nNext, let's try $a_2 = -1$ and $n_2 = 5$. This gives us $-1 \\cdot 3^5 = -243$.
