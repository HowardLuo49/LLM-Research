    "solution": "If we move the $x^2$ term to the left side, it is factorable:\n\\[(3x^2 + 1)(y^2 - 10) = 517 - 10\\]\n$507$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 13^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $3x^2 + 1$ cannot equal a multiple of three. $169$ doesn't work either, so $3x^2 + 1 = 13$, and $x^2 = 4$. This leaves $y^2 - 10 = 39$, so $y^2 = 49$. Thus, $3x^2 y^2 = 3 \\times 4 \\times 49 = \\boxed{588}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's simplify the given equation. We have $y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517$. \n\nBy factoring out $y^2$ from the left side, we get $y^2(1 + 3x^2) = 30x^2 + 517$. \n\nDividing both sides by $(1 + 3x^2)$, we have $y^2 = \\frac{30x^2 + 517}{1 + 3x^2}$. \n\nNow we need to find $3x^2 y^2$. \n\nSubstitute $y^2 = \\frac{30x^2 + 517}{1 + 3x^2}$ into the expression $3x^2 y^2$, we get \n\n$3x^2 \\cdot \\frac{30x^2 + 517}{1 + 3x^2} = 90x^4 + 1551x^2$.\n\nSo, $3x^2 y^2 = 90x^4 + 1551x^2$.",
