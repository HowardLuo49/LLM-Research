The repeating decimals $0.abab\\overline{ab}$ and $0.abcabc\\overline{abc}$ satisfy\n\\[0.abab\\overline{ab}+0.abcabc\\overline{abc}=\\frac{33}{37},\\]\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits. Find the three digit number $abc$.\n",
    "solution": "Notice repeating decimals can be written as the following:\n$0.\\overline{ab}=\\frac{10a+b}{99}$\n$0.\\overline{abc}=\\frac{100a+10b+c}{999}$\nwhere a,b,c are the digits. Now we plug this back into the original fraction:\n$\\frac{10a+b}{99}+\\frac{100a+10b+c}{999}=\\frac{33}{37}$\nMultiply both sides by $999*99.$ This helps simplify the right side as well because $999=111*9=37*3*9$:\n$9990a+999b+9900a+990b+99c=33/37*37*3*9*99=33*3*9*99$\nDividing both sides by $9$ and simplifying gives:\n$2210a+221b+11c=99^2=9801$\nAt this point, seeing the $221$ factor common to both a and b is crucial to simplify. This is because taking $mod 221$ to both sides results in:\n$2210a+221b+11c  \\equiv 9801 \\mod 221 \\iff 11c  \\equiv 77 \\mod 221$\nNotice that we arrived to the result $9801 \\equiv 77 \\mod 221$ by simply dividing $9801$ by $221$ and seeing $9801=44*221+77.$ Okay, now it's pretty clear to divide both sides by $11$ in the modular equation but we have to worry about $221$ being multiple of $11.$ Well, $220$ is a multiple of $11$ so clearly, $221$ couldn't be. Also, $221=13*17.$ Now finally we simplify and get:\n$c \\equiv 7 \\mod 221$\nBut we know $c$ is between $0$ and $9$ because it is a digit, so $c$ must be $7.$ Now it is straightforward from here to find $a$ and $b$:\n$2210a+221b+11(7)=9801 \\iff 221(10a+b)=9724 \\iff 10a+b=44$\nand since a and b are both between $0$ and $9$, we have $a=b=4$. Finally we have the $3$ digit integer $\\boxed{447}$.",
