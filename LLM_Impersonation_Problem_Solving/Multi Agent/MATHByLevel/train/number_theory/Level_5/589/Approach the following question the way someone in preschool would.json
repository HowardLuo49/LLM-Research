    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Use each of the five digits $2, 4, 6, 7$ and $9$ only once to form a three-digit integer and a two-digit integer which will be multiplied together. What is the three-digit integer that results in the greatest product?",
    "solution": "Let $\\underline{a}\\,\\underline{b}\\,\\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{d}\\,\\underline{e}$ be the two numbers.  The product of the numbers is  \\[\n(100a+10b+c)(10d+e) = 1000ad + 100(ae+bd) + 10 (cd+be) + ce\n\\] Clearly $ad$ should be as large as possible, so $a$ and $d$ should be 9 and 7 or vice versa.  Also, $c$ should be the smallest digit, since it only appears in the terms $10cd$ and $ce$.  Trying $a=9$ and $d=7$, we have a product of  \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(9e+7b) + 10 (14+be) + 2e = 63,\\!140+902e + 700b + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $e$ term is larger than that of the $b$ term, $e=6$ and $b=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $942\\times 76=71,\\!592$.  If $a=7$ and $d=9$, then the sum is \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(7e+9b) + 10 (18+be) + 2e = 63,\\!180+900b + 702e + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $b$ term is larger than that of the $e$ term, $b=6$ and $e=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $762\\times 94=71,\\!628$.  Since $71,\\!628>71,\\!592$, the three-digit integer yielding the maximum product is $\\boxed{762}$.",

Let's see how we can combine them to make the biggest product.\n\nFirst, let's make a three-digit number. We want it to be as big as possible, so let's start with the biggest number, which is 9. Then we can use the next biggest number, which is 7. And finally, we can use the next biggest number, which is 6. So our three-digit number is 976.\n\nNow, let's make a two-digit number. We want it to be as big as possible too. Let's use the next biggest number, which is 4. And then the smallest number left, which is 2. So our two-digit number is 42.\n\nNow, let's multiply our three-digit number by our two-digit number: \n\n976 x 42 = 41016\n\nSo, the biggest product we can make is 41016!
