Given that\n\\begin{eqnarray*}&(1)& x\\text{ and }y\\text{ are both integers between 100 and 999, inclusive;}\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\\\     &(2)& y\\text{ is the number formed by reversing the digits of }x\\text{; and}\\\\     &(3)& z=|x-y|. \\end{eqnarray*}\nHow many distinct values of $z$ are possible?\n",
    "solution": "We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$. From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).",
    "gpt_response": "First, we know that $x$ and $y$ are both integers between 100 and 999. This means that $x$ could be any number between 100 and 999, such as 101, 102, 103, and so on. \n\nNext, we know that $y$ is the number formed by reversing the digits of $x$, so if $x$ is 123, then $y$ would be 321. \n\nTo find $z=|x-y|$, we subtract $y$ from $x$ and take the absolute value. For example, if $x=123$ and $y=321$, then $z=|123-321|=|198|=198$. \n\nSince $z$ is the absolute value of the difference between x and y, the value of $z$ will always be positive. This means that even if we switch the values of x and y, we will still get the same value of z. \n\nTherefore, there is only one distinct value of $z$ possible.",
