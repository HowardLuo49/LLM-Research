    "solution": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out the smallest integer $n$ greater than $1$ such that $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ is defined, we need to find a number that is coprime with $1050$. This means that the greatest common factor (GCF) of $n$ and $1050$ is $1$.\n\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of $1050$. We can break down $1050$ into $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 7$. \n\nTo be coprime with $1050$, the number has to not have any of these prime factors. So we can start testing numbers greater than $1$ that don't have $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$ as factors.\n\nThe smallest integer that fits this description is $11$. So $n=11$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ such that $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ is defined.",
