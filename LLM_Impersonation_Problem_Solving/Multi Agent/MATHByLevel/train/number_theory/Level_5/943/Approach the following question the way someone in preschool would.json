    "solution": "Let $m = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $n = 2^{1989}-1$. Then, $2^9n = 2^9(2^{1989}-1) = 2^{1998} - 2^9 = m - (2^9 - 1)$. By the Euclidean algorithm, it follows that \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(m,n) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,m-2^9n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,2^9-1). \\\\\n\\end{align*}Since $9$ divides $1998$, by the difference of odd powers factorization, it follows that $2^{1989}-1$ is divisible by $2^9 - 1$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is $2^9 - 1 = \\boxed{511}$.",

Let's try dividing both numbers by 2. Do you notice anything special? We can keep dividing until we can't divide any more. Let's keep going until we can't divide any more. And the answer is... the greatest common divisor of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$ is 511! Great job!",
