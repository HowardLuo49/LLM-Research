There are positive integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations\\begin{align*} \\log_{10} x + 2 \\log_{10} (\\text{gcd}(x,y)) &= 60\\\\ \\log_{10} y + 2 \\log_{10} (\\text{lcm}(x,y)) &= 570. \\end{align*}Let $m$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $x$, and let $n$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $y$. Find $3m+2n$.\n",
    "solution": "Add the two equations to get that $\\log x+\\log y+2(\\log(\\gcd(x,y))+\\log(\\text{lcm}(x,y)))=630$. Then, we use the theorem $\\log a+\\log b=\\log ab$ to get the equation, $\\log (xy)+2(\\log(\\gcd(x,y))+\\log(\\text{lcm}(x,y)))=630$. Using the theorem that $\\gcd(x,y) \\cdot \\text{lcm}(x,y)=x\\cdot y$, along with the previously mentioned theorem, we can get the equation $3\\log(xy)=630$. This can easily be simplified to $\\log(xy)=210$, or $xy = 10^{210}$.\n$10^{210}$ can be factored into $2^{210} \\cdot 5^{210}$, and $m+n$ equals to the sum of the exponents of $2$ and $5$, which is $210+210 = 420$. Multiply by two to get $2m +2n$, which is $840$. Then, use the first equation ($\\log x + 2\\log(\\gcd(x,y)) = 60$) to show that $x$ has to have lower degrees of $2$ and $5$ than $y$ (you can also test when $x>y$, which is a contradiction to the restrains you set before). Therefore, $\\gcd(x,y)=x$. Then, turn the equation into $3\\log x = 60$, which yields $\\log x = 20$, or $x = 10^{20}$. Factor this into $2^{20} \\cdot 5^{20}$, and add the two 20's, resulting in $m$, which is $40$. Add $m$ to $2m + 2n$ (which is $840$) to get $40+840 = \\boxed{880}$.",
