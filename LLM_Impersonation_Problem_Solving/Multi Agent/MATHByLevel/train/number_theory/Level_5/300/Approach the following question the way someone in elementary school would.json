    "solution": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many zeros are at the end of 236!, you have to think about how zeros are made in big numbers. Zeros are made when you multiply numbers by 10 because 10 has a 0 at the end. But, 10 is made by multiplying 2 and 5 together.\n\nSo to see how many zeros are at the end of 236!, we need to figure out how many times we can multiply numbers by 10 (or 2 and 5 together) in 236!. \n\nTo do that, let's first think about how many times we can multiply by 5 and 2 separately in 236!.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many times 5 goes into 236!:\n- 236 \u00f7 5 = 47\n- 47 \u00f7 5 = 9\n- 9 \u00f7 5 = 1\n- 1 \u00f7 5 = 0\n\nSo, we can multiply by 5 a total of 47 + 9 + 1 = 57 times in 236!.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many times 2 goes into 236!:\n- 236 \u00f7 2 = 118\n- 118 \u00f7 2 = 59\n- 59 \u00f7 2 = 29\n- 29 \u00f7 2 = 14\n- 14 \u00f7 2 = 7\n- 7 \u00f7 2 = 3\n- 3 \u00f7 2 = 1\n- 1 \u00f7 2 = 0\n\nSo, we can multiply by 2 a total of 118 + 59 + 29 + 14 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 231 times in 236!.\n\nSince there are fewer 5s (57) than 2s (231), the number of zeros at the end of 236! is determined by the number of 5s, which is 57.\n\nTherefore, the number 236! ends in 57 zeros when expressed as an integer.",
