    "solution": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$.",

When $n=1$, $n^2 - n = 1^2 - 1 = 0$. This means that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by all values of $k$ from 1 to 1.\n\n2. When $n=2$, $n^2 - n = 2^2 - 2 = 2$. This means that $n^2 - n$ is not divisible by any values of $k$ from 1 to 2.\n\n3. When $n=3$, $n^2 - n = 3^2 - 3 = 6$. This means that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some values of $k$ from 1 to 3 (like 2 and 3) but not all (like 1).\n\nSo, the least positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
