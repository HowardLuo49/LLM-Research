    "solution": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's test out some values of $n$ to see if we can find the least positive integer that satisfies the condition in the question. \n\nLet's start with $n=1$: $1^2 - 1 = 0$, which is divisible by all $k$ from $1$ to $n$. \n\nNext, let's try $n=2$: $2^2 - 2 = 2$, which is divisible by $k=1$ and $k=2$, but not by any other values of $k$ from $1$ to $2$. \n\nSo, the least positive integer $n$ that satisfies the condition is $n=2$.",
