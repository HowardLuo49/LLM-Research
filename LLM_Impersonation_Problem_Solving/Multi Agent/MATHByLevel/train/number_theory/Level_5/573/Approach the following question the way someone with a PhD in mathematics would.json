    "solution": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. \n\nWhen a number leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 47, we can express this relationship as:\n\nx \u2261 5 (mod 47)\n\nThis implies that x is of the form:\n\nx = 47k + 5, where k is an integer\n\nSince we are looking for counting numbers, we need to find values of k that result in different counting numbers. \n\nTo do this, we can start by finding the smallest positive value of x:\n\nx = 47(1) + 5 = 52\n\nThen, we continue adding multiples of 47 to find other solutions:\n\nx = 47(2) + 5 = 99\nx = 47(3) + 5 = 146\nx = 47(4) + 5 = 193\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that the counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 47 are: 52, 99, 146, 193, ...\n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 47.",
