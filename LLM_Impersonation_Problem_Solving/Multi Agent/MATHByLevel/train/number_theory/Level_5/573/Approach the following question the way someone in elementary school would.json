    "solution": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many counting numbers leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, we can start counting and see which numbers work!\n\nLet's start with 1 - if we divide 47 by 1, we get a remainder of 0, not 5. So 1 doesn't work.\n\nNext, let's try 2 - if we divide 47 by 2, we get a remainder of 1, not 5. So 2 doesn't work.\n\nWe keep going like this and eventually we find that 12 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided into 47!\n\nSo the answer is just 1 counting number - 12.",
