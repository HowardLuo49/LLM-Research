Let $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's pretend we are little detectives trying to find the smallest number $n$ that makes $f(n)$ bigger than 15! So first, we know that $n$ has to be a multiple of 15. That means $n$ can be 15, 30, 45, and so on. \n\nLet's start with 15. We know that $15! = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 10 \\times 11 \\times 12 \\times 13 \\times 14 \\times 15$. \n\nSo the smallest number $n$ that makes $f(n)$ bigger than 15 is 16! Because $16! = 16 \\times 15!$ which means $16!$ is divisible by 15. \n\nYay, we found it! The smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$ is 16. Good job, little detectives!",
