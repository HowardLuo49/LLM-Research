    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A book has 136 pages. Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it. The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203. How many words are on each page?",
    "solution": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we can set up the following equation:\n\nLet x be the number of words on each page. Since each page has the same number of words and there are 136 pages, the total number of words in the book is 136x.\n\nWe are given that the number of words in the book is congruent to 184 modulo 203. This means that 136x is equivalent to 184 modulo 203, which can be written as:\n\n136x \u2261 184 (mod 203)\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to find an integer k such that:\n\n136x = 203k + 184\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n\n136x - 203k = 184\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or modular arithmetic principles to find the solution. The final answer will give us the number of words on each page.",
