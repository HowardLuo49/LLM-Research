    "solution": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$, we need to break down each factor into its prime factors and see how many perfect squares we can make.\n\nLet's start with $2^{10}$. $2^{10}$ can be broken down as $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2$. We can pair up these factors to make perfect squares. So we have $2^2$, $2^2$, $2^2$, $2^2$, which are all perfect squares. So, in total, we have 4 perfect square factors from  $2^{10}$.\n\nNext, let's look at $3^{12}$. In this case, we don't have pairs that can make perfect squares since all the factors are raised to an odd power. So we can't make any perfect squares from $3^{12}$.\n\nFinally, for $5^{15}$, the same thing happens. We don't have pairs that can make perfect squares. So we can't make any perfect squares from $5^{15}$.\n\nAdding up all the perfect squares we found from each factor, we have a total of 4 perfect square integers that are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4.",
