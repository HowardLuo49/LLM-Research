    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's find the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5. Since the prompt asks for an integer greater than 5, we can start by trying 6. \n\nIn base 2, 6 is written as 110. However, this is not a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nNext, let's try 7. In base 2, 7 is written as 111 which is a palindrome. \n\nNow, we need to check if 7 is also a palindrome in base 4. In base 4, 7 is written as 13. This is also a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nTherefore, the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4 is 7.",
