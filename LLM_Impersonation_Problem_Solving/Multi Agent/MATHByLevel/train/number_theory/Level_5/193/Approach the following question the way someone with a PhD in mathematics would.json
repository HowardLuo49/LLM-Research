    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first understand what a palindrome is in different bases. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. In base 2 (binary), a palindrome is a number that is the same when read from left to right as when read from right to left. In base 4, a palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, taking into account the different digits available in base 4.\n\nNow, we must analyze the conditions for a number to be a palindrome in base 2 and base 4. In binary, a number is a palindrome if its binary representation is the same when reversed. In base 4, a number is a palindrome if its base 4 representation is the same when read from left to right as when read from right to left.\n\nLet's denote the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4 as N. To find N, we can start by checking numbers greater than 5 to see if they are palindromes in both base 2 and base 4.\n\nStarting from 6, let's convert each number to binary and base 4 and check if it is a palindrome in both cases:\n\n- For 6, the binary representation is 110 and the base 4 representation is 12. Neither of these is a palindrome, so we move to the next number.\n\n- For 7, the binary representation is 111 and the base 4 representation is 13. Neither of these is a palindrome, so we move to the next number.\n\n- For 8, the binary representation is 1000 and the base 4 representation is 20. Neither of these is a palindrome, so we move to the next number.\n\n- For 9, the binary representation is 1001 and the base 4 representation is 21. Neither of these is a palindrome, so we move to the next number.\n\n- For 10, the binary representation is 1010 and the base 4 representation is 22. Neither of these is a palindrome, so we move to the next number.\n\nContinuing this process, we eventually find that the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4 is 18. In binary, 18 is 10010 and in base 4, 18 is 102. Both of these representations are palindromes, so N=18.",
