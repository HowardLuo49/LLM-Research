    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest number, we can start with the smallest numbers and check if their inverses are undefined. Let's start with 2. \n\nFor modular arithmetic, the inverse of $a$ is the number $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. If $a^{-1}$ is undefined, that means there is no number $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$.\n\nLet's check if $2^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$. We find that $2 \\times 28 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{55}$, so $2^{-1}$ is defined.\n\nNow let's check if $2^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{66}$. We find that $2 \\times 33 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{66}$, so $2^{-1}$ is defined.\n\nSince $2$ is not the smallest number whose inverse is undefined, we need to try a smaller number. Let's try $3$. \n\nFor $3^{-1}$ to be undefined $\\pmod{55}$, there can be no integer $b$ such that $3b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{55}$. Similarly for $3^{-1}$ to be undefined $\\pmod{66}$, there can be no integer $b$ such that $3b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{66}$.\n\nBy checking, we find that $3^{-1}$ is undefined for both moduli. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$ and $a^{-1}$ is also undefined $\\pmod{66}$ is $3$.",
