    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total number of factors for $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we can first find the total number of factors for each number $x$, $y$, and $z$ separately.\n\nFor a natural number with three factors, it means that the number can be factored into the product of three different numbers. For example, the number 6 has the factors 1, 2, 3 (1*2*3=6).\n\nNow, for $x^{2}$, there are 2 factors (1 and $x^{2}$).\n\nFor $y^{3}$, there are 3 factors (1, $y$, and $y^{2}$).\n\nFor $z^{4}$, there are 4 factors (1, $z$, $z^{2}$, and $z^{3}$).\n\nTo find the total number of factors for $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we can multiply the number of factors for each number together. So, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ will have 2 * 3 * 4 factors, which is 24.\n\nTherefore, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ has 24 factors.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 315?: To find the total number of factors for $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we can first find the total number of factors for each number $x$, $y$, and $z$ separately.\n\nFor a natural number with three factors, it means that the number can be factored into the product of three different numbers.
