    "solution": "Rewrite the expression as\\[4(5x + 1)(5x + 3)(5x+5)\\]Since $x$ is odd, let $x = 2n-1$. The expression becomes\\[4(10n-4)(10n-2)(10n)=32(5n-2)(5n-1)(5n)\\]Consider just the product of the last three terms, $5n-2,5n-1,5n$, which are consecutive. At least one term must be divisible by $2$ and one term must be divisible by $3$ then. Also, since there is the $5n$ term, the expression must be divisible by $5$. Therefore, the minimum integer that always divides the expression must be $32 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{960}$.\nTo prove that the number is the largest integer to work, consider when $x=1$ and $x = 5$. These respectively evaluate to be $1920,\\ 87360$; their greatest common factor is indeed $960$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer that always divides the expression, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the expression. Since $x$ is an odd number, we can let $x = 2a + 1$, where $a$ is an integer.\n\nPlugging in $x = 2a + 1$, we have:\n\\[(10(2a+1)+2)(10(2a+1)+6)(5(2a+1)+5)\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[(20a+12)(20a+16)(10a+5)\\]\nThis is equivalent to:\n\\[4(5a+3)4(5a+4)5(2a+1)\\]\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that always divides the expression is $\\boxed{20}$.",
