    "solution": "Looking at the $d$'s place, we see that $A_d + A_d = 16_d = d + 6$ or $A_d + A_d + 1 = 16_d = d + 6$ (if there is carry-over). Re-arranging and solving for $A_d$, we find that $A_d = \\frac{d + 6}2$ or $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. In either case, since $d > 6$, it follows that $A_d > 2$. Thus, when we add the units digits $B_d + A_d$, there must be carry-over, so $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. It follows that $$B_d + A_d = d + 2 \\Longrightarrow B_d = d+2 - \\frac{d + 5}2 = \\frac d2 - \\frac 12.$$Thus, $A_d - B_d = \\frac{d + 5}2 - \\frac{d-1}{2} = \\boxed{3}_d$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have two numbers: $\\overline{AB}_d$ and $\\overline{AA}_d$. That means the first number is made up of two digits $A$ and $B$, while the second number is made up of two digits that are the same, $A$ and $A$.\n\nWhen we add them together, we get $162_d$. We need to find out the value of $A_d - B_d$ in base $d$.\n\nLet's figure it out step by step. \nFirst, we know that $A$ and $B$ are digits in base $d$ that are greater than 6. Since our base is greater than 6, our digits can go up to that number, but not higher.\n\nLet's look at the units digit first. $B + A = 2$, which means $B$ must be less than $A$ so that when we add them together, we get 2. Since $A$ and $B$ are digits greater than 6, that means $A$ must be 7 and $B$ must be 6.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens digit. We have $A + A = 6 + 1$, which means $A$ must be 3 in base $d$. \n\nTherefore, $A_d = 33$ and $B_d = 26$. \nTo find $A_d - B_d$, we subtract the two values in base $d$: \n$33_d - 26_d = 3d + 3 - 2d - 6 = 1d - 3$.\n\nSo, $A_d - B_d = 1d - 3$ in base $d$.",
