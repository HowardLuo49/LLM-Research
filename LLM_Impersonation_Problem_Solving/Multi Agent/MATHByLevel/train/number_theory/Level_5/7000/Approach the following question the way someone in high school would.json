    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when dividing $a_{83}$ by 49, we can use the property of remainders when multiplying and adding numbers. We know that $a_1 = 6^1 + 8^1 = 6 + 8 = 14$. \n\nThen, we can look for a pattern by calculating $a_2, a_3, a_4,$ and so on until we find a pattern. It turns out that the remainders follow the pattern: $14, 36, 9, 7, \\ldots$\n\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 terms, we need to find the remainder when dividing 83 by 4, which is 3. Therefore, the remainder when dividing $a_{83}$ ($\\text{a multiple of 4} + 3$) by 49 is the third term in the pattern, which is 9.\n\nSo, the remainder when dividing $a_{83}$ by 49 is 9.",
