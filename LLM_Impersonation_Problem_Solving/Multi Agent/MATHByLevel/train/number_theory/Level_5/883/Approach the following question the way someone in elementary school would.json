    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 1000 make $\\frac{n}{1400}$ have a terminating decimal, we need to see if the denominator, 1400, can be written as a product of only 2's and 5's.\n\nWe can break 1400 down into its prime factors:\n\n$1400 = 2^{3} \\cdot 5^{2} \\cdot 7$\n\nSince 1400 can be written as $2^{3} \\cdot 5^{2}$, the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ will terminate for any factor of 1400 that does not have any other prime factors than 2 and 5.\n\nThis means $n$ must be divisible by $2^{3} \\cdot 5^{2} = 8 \\cdot 25 = 200$, so the values of $n$ between 1 and 1000 that make $\\frac{n}{1400}$ have a terminating decimal are multiples of 200. \n\nSo, there are 1000 divided by 200, which is 5, integer values of $n$ between 1 and 1000 inclusive that make the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminate.",
