    "solution": "We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits. Every one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \\cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits. Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\\cdots+9)(72) \\times 100 = 45 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 100 = 324000$.\nEvery one of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it. Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$). Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 10 = 28800$.\nThe same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 1 = 2880$. Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\\boxed{680}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's list out all the three digit positive integers with three distinct digits. We have numbers like 123, 124, 125, etc. and so on up to 987. \n\nTo find the sum $S$, we can think about each digit's place value. For the hundreds place, each digit appears in that place 120 times (10 choices for the hundreds digit, 9 choices for the tens digit, and 8 choices for the ones digit). So the sum in the hundreds place is $1(120) + 2(120) + 3(120) + \\ldots + 9(120)$, which is just $120(1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 9)$. \n\nSimilarly, we can find the sum in the tens place and the ones place. By adding up these three sums, we can find $S$. \n\nAfter finding $S$, we can then divide it by $1000$ and find the remainder. Let's try this out!",
