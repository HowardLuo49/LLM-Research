    "solution": "We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^4$. A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4. There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$. In total, there are $9\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{135}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors, we need to look at the prime factorization of the number given. \n$4^3 = 2^6$\n$5^4 = 5^4$\n$6^2 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2$\n\nSo, if we multiply them together: \n$2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4$\n\nTo find the number of factors, we add 1 to the powers of the prime factors and multiply them together: \n(8+1) x (2+1) x (4+1) = 9 x 3 x 5 = 135\n\nTherefore, $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ has 135 distinct, natural-number factors.",
