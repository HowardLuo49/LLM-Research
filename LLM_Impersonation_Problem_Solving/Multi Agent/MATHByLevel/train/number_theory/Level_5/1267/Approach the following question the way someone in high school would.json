    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many distinct, natural-number factors does $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ have?",
    "solution": "We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^4$. A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4. There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$. In total, there are $9\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{135}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct natural-number factors of $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$, we first need to prime factorize each term. \n\n$4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^6$\n\n$5^4 = 5^4$\n\n$6^2 = (2\\cdot 3)^2 = 2^2\\cdot 3^2$\n\nSo, we can rewrite $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ as $2^6\\cdot 5^4\\cdot 2^2\\cdot 3^2$. \n\nNow, we add the exponents by multiplication: $(6+2+1)(4+1)(2+1) = 9\\cdot 5\\cdot 3 = 135$\n\nTherefore, $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ has 135 distinct natural-number factors.",
