    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. A right rectangular prism $P$ (i.e., a rectangular parallelpiped) has sides of integral length $a, b, c,$ with $a\\le b\\le c.$ A plane parallel to one of the faces of $P$ cuts $P$ into two prisms, one of which is similar to $P,$ and both of which have nonzero volume. Given that $b=1995,$ for how many ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ does such a plane exist?\n",
    "solution": "Let $P'$ be the prism similar to $P$, and let the sides of $P'$ be of length $x,y,z$, such that $x \\le y \\le z$. Then\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{y}{b} = \\frac zc < 1.\\]\nNote that if the ratio of similarity was equal to $1$, we would have a prism with zero volume. As one face of $P'$ is a face of $P$, it follows that $P$ and $P'$ share at least two side lengths in common. Since $x < a, y < b, z < c$, it follows that the only possibility is $y=a,z=b=1995$. Then,\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{a}{1995} = \\frac{1995}{c} \\Longrightarrow ac = 1995^2 = 3^25^27^219^2.\\]\nThe number of factors of $3^25^27^219^2$ is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 81$. Only in $\\left\\lfloor \\frac {81}2 \\right\\rfloor = 40$ of these cases is $a < c$ (for $a=c$, we end with a prism of zero volume). We can easily verify that these will yield nondegenerate prisms, so the answer is $\\boxed{40}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Wow! Okay, so we have this big block shape thing called a rectangular prism. It has sides of different lengths, but we want to find ones where the middle side is 1995. \n\nNow, there's a special way we can cut this block into two smaller blocks that are kind of the same shape as the big one. But we have to make sure both smaller blocks have some space inside them.\n\nSo, let's think about all the different ways we can make this happen. We want to find all the different sets of numbers for the sides of the big block where we can cut it like this. \n\nI think we should start by seeing if we can find any patterns or rules that help us figure it out. Maybe we can start by trying some different numbers and see what happens. Let's try our best and have fun with it!",
