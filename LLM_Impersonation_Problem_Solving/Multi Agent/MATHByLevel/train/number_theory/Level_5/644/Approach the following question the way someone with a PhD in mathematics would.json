    "solution": "Let $a$ be the inverse of $201$ modulo $299$. Then, by the definition of the inverse, $201\\cdot a \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}$. We are looking for an integer $a$ that satisfies this congruence.\n\nTo make our task easier, we note that $603\\equiv 5\\pmod{299}$, and so \\begin{align*}\n603\\cdot 60 &\\equiv 5\\cdot 60 \\\\\n&= 300 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.\n\\end{align*}Now we write $603$ as $201\\cdot 3$: $$201\\cdot 3\\cdot 60 \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.$$Thus, the inverse we seek is $a = 3\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{180}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the multiplicative inverse of $201$ modulo $299$, we need to solve the equation $201x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{299}$ for $x$.\n\nWe can approach this by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. We start by representing $299$ as $299 = 1 \\cdot 201 + 98$. Next, we divide $201$ by $98$ to get $201 = 2 \\cdot 98 + 5$. Continuing this process, we have $98 = 19 \\cdot 5 + 3$, and $5 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 2$. Finally, $3 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1$.\n\nNow, we work our way back substituting to express $1$ in terms of $299$ and $201$:\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= 3 - 1 \\cdot 2 \\\\\n&= 3 - 1 \\cdot (5 - 1 \\cdot 3) \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 3 - 1 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot (98 - 19 \\cdot 5) - 1 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 98 - 39 \\cdot 5 - 1 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 98 - 40 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 98 - 40 \\cdot (201 - 2 \\cdot 98) \\\\\n&= 82 \\cdot 98 - 40 \\cdot 201 \\\\\n&= 82 \\cdot (299 - 201) - 40 \\cdot 201 \\\\\n&= 82 \\cdot 299 - 122 \\cdot 201.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom this, we see that the multiplicative inverse of $201$ modulo $299$ is $-122 \\equiv 177 \\pmod{299}$.
