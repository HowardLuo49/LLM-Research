Let $f(n)$ return the number of distinct ordered pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ such that for each ordered pair, $a^2 + b^2 = n$. Note that when $a \\neq b$, $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are distinct. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f(n) = 3$?",
    "solution": "If $f(n) = 3$, this implies that $n = 2m^2$ for some positive integer $m$ since the only time $f(n)$ can be odd is when there is an ordered pair $(m, m)$ that cannot be reversed. We start testing values of $m$. The values $m = 1$, $m=2$, $m=3$, and $m=4$ do not give $f(n)=3$. However, when $m=5$, we get $50 = 5^2 + 5^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 7^2 + 1^2$. Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which $f(n)=3$ is $\\boxed{50}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f(n) = 3$, we need to consider all possible ways in which $n$ can be expressed as the sum of two squares.

Therefore, $n$ should be a squared number or a sum of two squared numbers. \n\nIn general, for any positive integer $n$, we can express it as a sum of two squares in the following ways:\n- If $n = p$ where $p$ is a prime number of the form $4k+1$, then $n$ can be expressed as $n = p^2 + 1^2$. This is due to Fermat's theorem on the sum of two squares which states that every prime number of the form $4k+1$ can be expressed uniquely as the sum of two squares.\n- If $n$ is an even number, then it can be expressed as the sum of two squares in multiple ways. For example, $n = 2^2 + (n-2)^2$, $n = 4^2 + (n-4)^2$, etc.\n- If $n$ is an odd number, then it cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares unless it is a squared number itself.\n\nThus, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ for which there are exactly 3 distinct ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = n$.\n\nFor $n = 50$, we have the following ordered pairs: \n- $(1,7)$, $(7,1)$\n- $(5,5)$\n- $(7,1)$, $(1,7)$\n\nIn this case, $f(50) = 3$, and $n = 50$ is the smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition.
