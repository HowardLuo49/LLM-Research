    "solution": "We can simplify as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n13(3x-2)&\\equiv 26 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x-2&\\equiv 2 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n9x&\\equiv 4\\cdot 3 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 12 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\n\\end{align*}So $x=4+8n$ is a solution for all $n$ and all solutions are of this form. The solutions in the range $0<x\\le 20$ are $4,12,20$, so their sum is $4+12+20=\\boxed{36}$.",
