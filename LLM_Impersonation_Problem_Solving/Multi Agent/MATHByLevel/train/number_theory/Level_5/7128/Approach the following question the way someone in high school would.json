    "solution": "Let $\\omega$ and $\\zeta$ be the two complex third-roots of 1. Then let\n$S = (1 + \\omega)^{2007} + (1 + \\zeta)^{2007} + (1 + 1)^{2007} = \\sum_{i = 0}^{2007} {2007 \\choose i}(\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1)$.\nNow, if $i$ is a multiple of 3, $\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$. If $i$ is one more than a multiple of 3, $\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1 = \\omega + \\zeta + 1 = 0$. If $i$ is two more than a multiple of 3, $\\omega^i + \\zeta^i + 1 = \\omega^2 + \\zeta^2 + 1= \\zeta + \\omega + 1 = 0$. Thus\n$S = \\sum_{i = 0}^{669} 3 {2007 \\choose 3i}$, which is exactly three times our desired expression.\nWe also have an alternative method for calculating $S$: we know that $\\{\\omega, \\zeta\\} = \\{-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i, -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i\\}$, so $\\{1 + \\omega, 1 + \\zeta\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i, \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}i\\}$. Note that these two numbers are both cube roots of -1, so $S = (1 + \\omega)^{2007} + (1 + \\zeta)^{2007} + (1 + 1)^{2007} = (-1)^{669} + (-1)^{669} + 2^{2007} = 2^{2007} - 2$.\nThus, the problem is reduced to calculating $2^{2007} - 2 \\pmod{1000}$. $2^{2007} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$, so we need to find $2^{2007} \\pmod{125}$ and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since $\\phi (125) = 100$, by Euler's Totient Theorem $2^{20 \\cdot 100 + 7} \\equiv 2^7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{125}$. Combining, we have $2^{2007} \\equiv 128 \\pmod{1000}$, and so $3S \\equiv 128-2 \\pmod{1000} \\Rightarrow S\\equiv \\boxed{42}\\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, we need to find the remainder when we add up all the binomial coefficients, starting from ${2007 \\choose 0}$ up to ${2007 \\choose 2007}$. \n\nFirst, let's think about what Pascal's triangle looks like in modulo 1000.

Since we're adding up an odd number of 2007's and an even number of 1's, the sum will be congruent to $2007-1 = 2006 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{1000}$. \n\nSo, the remainder when ${2007 \\choose 0} + {2007 \\choose 3} + \\cdots + {2007 \\choose 2007}$ is divided by 1000 is 6.",
