    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A certain integer has $4$ digits when written in base $8$. The same integer has $d$ digits when written in base $2$. What is the sum of all possible values of $d$?",
    "solution": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to remember that in base $8$, each digit can be any number from $0$ to $7$. So since the integer has $4$ digits in base $8, the largest possible number it can be is $7777$ in base $8$. Now we need to find out how many digits this number has in base $2. \n\nTo do this, we need to convert $7777$ from base $8$ to base $2$. This gives us $111111111111$ in base $2$, which has $12$ digits. \n\nBut wait! We can also have smaller numbers in base $8. The smallest possible number in base $8$ with $4$ digits is $1000$, which equals $1000000000$ in base $2, which has $10$ digits. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of $d$ are $10$ and $12$. To find the sum, we add $10$ and $12$ to get $22$. So, the sum of all possible values of $d$ is $22$. Yay!",
