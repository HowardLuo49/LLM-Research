Ten identical crates each of dimensions $3\\mathrm{ft}\\times 4\\mathrm{ft}\\times 6\\mathrm{ft}$. The first crate is placed flat on the floor. Each of the remaining nine crates is placed, in turn, flat on top of the previous crate, and the orientation of each crate is chosen at random. Let $\\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that the stack of crates is exactly $41\\mathrm{ft}$ tall, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m$.\n",
    "solution": "Only the heights matter, and each crate is either 3, 4, or 6 feet tall with equal probability. We have the following:\n\\begin{align*}3a + 4b + 6c &= 41\\\\ a + b + c &= 10\\end{align*}\nSubtracting 3 times the second from the first gives $b + 3c = 11$, or $(b,c) = (2,3),(5,2),(8,1),(11,0)$. The last doesn't work, obviously. This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$. In terms of choosing which goes where, the first two solutions are analogous.\nFor $(5,2,3),(3,5,2)$, we see that there are $2\\cdot\\dfrac{10!}{5!2!3!} = 10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7$ ways to stack the crates. For $(1,8,1)$, there are $2\\dbinom{10}{2} = 90$. Also, there are $3^{10}$ total ways to stack the crates to any height.\nThus, our probability is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 90}{3^{10}} = \\dfrac{10\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 10}{3^{8}} = \\dfrac{570}{3^8} = \\dfrac{190}{3^{7}}$. Our answer is the numerator, $\\boxed{190}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the stack of crates is exactly 41 feet tall, we need to consider the possible ways that the crates can be stacked to achieve this height. Since each crate is 6 feet tall, the height of the stack after placing $n$ crates will be $6n$ feet. Thus, we need to find the number of ways we can stack the crates to get a height of 41 feet.\n\nThe height can be achieved with 7 crates stacked (total of 42 feet) and then removing the top 6 inches from the stack. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of ways to stack 7 crates to a height of 42 feet and then remove the top 6 inches from the stack.\n\nTo calculate this, we can use generating functions. We can represent each crate as a generating function $1 + x^6$, representing the base (1) and height (6) of the crate. Then, we want to find the coefficient of $x^{41}$ in the expansion of $(1+x^6)^7$.\n\nExpanding this out, we get:\n$(1+x^6)^7 = 1 + 7x^6 + 21x^{12} + 35x^{18} + 35x^{24} + 21x^{30} + 7x^{36} + x^{42}$\n\nThe coefficient of $x^{41}$ is 0, which means there is no way to stack the crates to get a height of 41 feet.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the stack of crates is exactly 41 feet tall is 0, and $m = 0$.",
