    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. For all composite integers $n$, what is the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$?",
    "solution": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer that always divides into the difference between a number and its cube, we can start by looking at a few examples.\n\nLet's start with the number 4. The cube of 4 is 64. The difference between 4 and 64 is 60. We can see that 4 is a factor of 60.\n\nLet's try another number, 6. The cube of 6 is 216. The difference between 6 and 216 is 210. We can see that 6 is also a factor of 210.\n\nIf we continue this pattern with other composite numbers, we will see that the largest factor that always divides into the difference between a number and its cube is the number itself.\n\nSo, to answer the question, the largest integer that always divides into the difference between a composite number $n$ and the cube of $n$ is $n$.",
