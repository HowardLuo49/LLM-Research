    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. For all composite integers $n$, what is the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$?",
    "solution": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$, we can first simplify the expression.\n\nThe difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$ is $n - n^3$. Factoring out an $n$ from both terms, we get $n(1 - n^2)$.\n\nSince $n$ is a composite integer, it can be factored into prime factors. The expression $1 - n^2$ can be factored into $(1-n)(1+n)$. Since $n$ is composite, it must contain factors besides $1$ and $n$. So, the factor $(1-n)$ or $(1+n)$ must be able to cancel out these factors to be the greatest common factor.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
