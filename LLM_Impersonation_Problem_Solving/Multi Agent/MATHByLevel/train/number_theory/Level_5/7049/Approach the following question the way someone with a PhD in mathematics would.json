    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $N$ be the greatest integer multiple of 8, no two of whose digits are the same. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000?\n",
    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest integer multiple of 8 with no repeated digits, we need to consider the various restrictions imposed by the question. Since 8 is divisible by 8, the last three digits of $N$ must be a multiple of 8. Additionally, the largest digit that can appear in the hundreds place is 7, as any larger digit would result in a multiple of 8 with repeated digits.\n\nThus, we need to systematically determine the largest possible number that fits these criteria. Starting from the largest possible hundreds digit of 7, we can work backwards by considering the possible tens and units digits. \n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n- If we choose 7, the remaining digits can be 6 and 5 (in descending order) to form 756.\n- If we choose 6, the remaining digits can be 7 and 5 to form 657.\n\nBoth 756 and 657 are multiples of 8, but 756 is greater. So, $N = 756$.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 756 is divided by 1000, we simply find 756 mod 1000, which is equal to 756. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when N is divided by 1000 is 756.",
