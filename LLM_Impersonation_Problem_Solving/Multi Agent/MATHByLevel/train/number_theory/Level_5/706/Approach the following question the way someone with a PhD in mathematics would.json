    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ are multiples of 24?",
    "solution": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24, we must first determine the prime factorization of 24. \n\n$24 = 2^3 * 3$\n\nA perfect square will have an even exponent for each prime factor in its prime factorization. Since 24 has an odd exponent for its prime factor 3, any perfect square multiple of 24 must have at least one factor of 3^2 = 9. \n\nLet us consider the maximum power of 24 less than $10^6$. \n\n$10^6 < 24^4 = 2^{12} * 3^4 = 2^8 * 2^4 * 3^2 * 3^2 = 2^8 * 3^2$\n\nTherefore, the maximum power of 24 less than $10^6$ is $24^3 = 2^6*3$. \n\nThese are the possible prime factors for the perfect square multiple of 24, where the exponents of 2 must be even: (0, 2, 4, 6), and the exponent of 3 must be even: (0, 2). \n\nSo, the number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24 equals the number of possibilities for the exponents of 2 and 3, which is 4 possibilities for 2 and 2 possibilities for 3, resulting in a total of 4 * 2 = 8. \n\nTherefore, there are 8 positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24.",
