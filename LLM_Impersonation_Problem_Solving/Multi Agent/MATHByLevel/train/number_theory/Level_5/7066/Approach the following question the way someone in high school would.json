    "solution": "Note that the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers can be written as $1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdots 195\\cdot 197\\cdot 199=\\frac{1\\cdot 2\\cdots200}{2\\cdot4\\cdots200} = \\frac{200!}{2^{100}\\cdot 100!}$\nHence, we seek the number of threes in $200!$ decreased by the number of threes in $100!.$\nThere are\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{9}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{81}\\right\\rfloor =66+22+7+2=97$\nthrees in $200!$ and\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{9}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{27}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{81}\\right\\rfloor=33+11+3+1=48$\nthrees in $100!$\nTherefore, we have a total of $97-48=\\boxed{49}$ threes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$, we need to look at the powers of 3 that are present in the prime factorization of each of the first 100 positive odd integers.\n\nSince 3 is a prime number, it will not be a factor of any odd number, unless it is an odd number itself. Only odd numbers are being multiplied here, so each of those numbers will not contain any 3's in their prime factorization, and hence $P$ will not be divisible by any power of 3.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",
