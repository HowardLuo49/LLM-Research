To do this, we need to find the coordinates of point G. \n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral and inscribed in a circle of radius 2, we know that each side length is 4. We can use these side lengths to find the coordinates of points D and E. \n\nSince AD = 13, we can use the ratios of sides in a 30-60-90 triangle to find the coordinates of D.
