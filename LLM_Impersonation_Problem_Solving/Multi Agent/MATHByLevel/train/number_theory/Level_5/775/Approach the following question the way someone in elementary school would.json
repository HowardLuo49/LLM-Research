    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. The closest multiple of $2a+9$ that we can spot to $6a^2 + 49a + 108$ is $6a^2 + 49a + 99 = (2a+9)(3a+11),$ so we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108,2a+9)\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(2a+9)(3a+11),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(6a^2+49a+99),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(9,2a+9).\n\\end{align*}Since $7767$ is a multiple of 9, both $2a$ and $9$ are multiples of $9$, $2a+9$ is also a multiple of $9$ so the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find out what an odd multiple of 7767 is. Since 7767 is odd and a multiple of 7767, any odd multiple would be an odd number that can be divided by 7767.\n\nNow, let's find the greatest common divisor of $6a^2+49a+108$ and $2a+9$. We know that $a$ is an odd multiple of 7767, so we can plug that in to get:\n$6(7767)^2+49(7767)+108$ and $2(7767)+9$\n\nAfter finding these values, we can calculate the greatest common divisor by finding the factors of both expressions and comparing them. The greatest common divisor will be the largest number that divides both expressions evenly.\n\nRemember to show your work and simplify any fractions if needed. Good luck!",
