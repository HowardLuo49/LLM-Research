    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's break down the problem. When the band is arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied, and when they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. This means that the number of members in the band must be a multiple of both 8 and 9.\n\nTo find the smallest number that meets this criteria, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9. The LCM of 8 and 9 is 72.\n\nNow we need to find a number between 100 and 200 that is a multiple of 72. The closest multiple of 72 within this range is 144 (72 * 2).\n\nSo, the band must have 144 members.",
