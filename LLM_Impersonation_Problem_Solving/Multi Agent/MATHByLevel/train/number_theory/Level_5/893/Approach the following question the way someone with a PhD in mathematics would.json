    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Every 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator. He changed them the first time in May. In what month will they be changed the 25th time?",
    "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the month when Hal will change the batteries for the 25th time, we need to calculate 5 months multiplied by 25 (the number of times the batteries have been changed) from the starting point in May.\n\n5 months x 25 = 125 months\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, we need to divide 125 by 12 to find out how many full years have passed:\n\n125 \u00f7 12 = 10 years with a remainder of 5 months\n\nTherefore, Hal will change the batteries for the 25th time in May of the 11th year.",
