    "solution": "$150=2^13^15^2$.  Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$.  So the number of possible factors is\n\n$$(10)(14)(7)=\\boxed{980}$$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see how many natural number factors of n are multiples of 150. \n\nFirst, let's see what 150 is made up of. 150 can be written as 2 x 3 x 5 x 5. It's made up of two 2's, one 3, and two 5's.\n\nNow, let's look at the prime factorization of n. n is equal to 2^10 x 3^14 x 5^8.\n\nTo make a number that is a multiple of 150, we need to include at least the same number of 2's, 3's, and 5's in a factor of n as we have in 150.\n\nFor 2's, we can choose between 0 to 10, because we have 10 2's in n and only 2 in 150. \nFor 3's, we can choose between 0 to 1, because we have 1 3 in 150 and 14 in n.\nFor 5's, we can choose between 0 to 2, because we have 2 5's in 150 and 8 in n.\n\nSo the number of natural-number factors of n that are multiples of 150 can be calculated by taking the product of the number of choices for each prime:\n(10+1)*(1+1)*(2+1) = 33\n\nTherefore, there are 33 factors of n that are multiples of 150.",
