    "solution": "Let our answer be $n$. Write $n = 42a + b$, where $a, b$ are positive integers and $0 \\leq b < 42$. Then note that $b, b + 42, ... , b + 42(a-1)$ are all primes.\nIf $b$ is $0\\mod{5}$, then $b = 5$ because $5$ is the only prime divisible by $5$. We get $n = 215$ as our largest possibility in this case.\nIf $b$ is $1\\mod{5}$, then $b + 2 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 2$. Thus, $n \\leq 3 \\times 42 = 126 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $2\\mod{5}$, then $b + 4 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 4$. Thus, $n \\leq 5 \\times 42 = 210 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $3\\mod{5}$, then $b + 1 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a = 1$. Thus, $n \\leq 2 \\times 42 = 84 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $4\\mod{5}$, then $b + 3 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 3$. Thus, $n \\leq 4 \\times 42 = 168 < 215$.\nOur answer is $\\boxed{215}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, to find the biggest number that is not the answer to the question, let's first think about what numbers we can make by adding a multiple of $42$ and a composite number. Let's start by finding some composite numbers - those are numbers that have more than just 1 and themselves as factors. Let's see, we have $4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16,$ and so on. Now, let's try adding them to multiples of $42$ and see if we can find a pattern. Hmm, it seems like the numbers are getting really big really fast. So, our job is to find the biggest positive integer that we can't make by adding a composite number and a multiple of $42$. The biggest numbers we've tried so far are $168$ and $170$. The next big number is $210$, but that is a multiple of $42$, so we can't use that. Let's keep going and see if we can find a bigger number that we can't make!",
