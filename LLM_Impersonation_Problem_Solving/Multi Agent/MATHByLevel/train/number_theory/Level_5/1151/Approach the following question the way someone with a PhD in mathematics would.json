    "solution": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$, we first need to find the prime factorization of $8!$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $8!$ is $2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. \n\nNow, let's consider the divisors of $8!$. Any divisor that is larger than $7!$ must contain at least one prime factor not present in $7!$. \n\nThe divisors of $8!$ can be expressed in the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c \\cdot 7^d$, where $0 \\le a \\le 7$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$, $0 \\le c \\le 1$, and $0 \\le d \\le 1$. \n\nTherefore, there are $(8-1)(2-0)(1-0)(1-0) = 7 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 14$ divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$. \n\nThus, the answer is 14 divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$.",
