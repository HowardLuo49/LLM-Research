    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In a parlor game, the magician asks one of the participants to think of a three digit number $(abc)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent digits in base $10$ in the order indicated. The magician then asks this person to form the numbers $(acb)$, $(bca)$, $(bac)$, $(cab)$, and $(cba)$, to add these five numbers, and to reveal their sum, $N$. If told the value of $N$, the magician can identify the original number, $(abc)$. Play the role of the magician and determine $(abc)$ if $N= 3194$.\n",
    "solution": "Let $m$ be the number $100a+10b+c$. Observe that $3194+m=222(a+b+c)$ so\n\\[m\\equiv -3194\\equiv -86\\equiv 136\\pmod{222}\\]\nThis reduces $m$ to one of $136, 358, 580, 802$. But also $a+b+c=\\frac{3194+m}{222}>\\frac{3194}{222}>14$ so $a+b+c\\geq 15$. Of the four options, only $m = \\boxed{358}$ satisfies this inequality.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so let's start by writing out the expressions for the five numbers formed by rearranging the digits of $(abc)$: \n\n$(acb) = 100a + 10c + b$\n$(bca) = 100b + 10c + a$\n$(bac) = 100b + 10a + c$\n$(cab) = 100c + 10a + b$\n$(cba) = 100c + 10b + a$\n\nNow, let's add these five expressions:\n\n$(acb) + (bca) + (bac) + (cab) + (cba) = 3194$\n\nPlugging in the expressions for each rearranged number, we get:\n\n$222(a + b + c) = 3194$\n\nSolving for $a + b + c$, we get $a + b + c = \\frac{3194}{222} = 14.4$\n\nSince $a,b,c$ are digits, they must sum to a whole number. The only way this is possible is if $a + b + c = 14$.\n\nNow we need to find the original number $(abc)$ given that $a + b + c = 14$. By trial and error, we find that the only possible solution is $(abc) = 491$. \n\nTherefore, as the magician, I can confidently say that the original number $(abc)$ is 491.",
