Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27, we first need to determine the total number of clever integers and then find the number of clever integers that are also divisible by 27.\n\nLet's denote the clever integers as $E$, where $20 < E < 120$ and the sum of its digits is 9. \n\nWe can first find the number of possible values for the tens digit and ones digit that satisfy the condition. Since the integer is even, the ones digit must be one of the following: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. If we fix the ones digit, the tens digit must be such that the sum of the digits is 9.\n\nIf the ones digit is 0, then the tens digit is 9.\nIf the ones digit is 2, then the tens digit is 7.\nIf the ones digit is 4, then the tens digit is 5.\nIf the ones digit is 6, then the tens digit is 3.\nIf the ones digit is 8, then the tens digit is 1.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 clever integers that satisfy the condition: 90, 72, 54, 36, and 18.\n\nSince there are a total of 50 clever integers (from 22 to 118, inclusive), the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\frac{1}{10}$. \n\nThus, the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
