For some positive integer $n$, the number $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, including $1$ and the number $110n^3$. How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?\n$\\textbf{(A) }110\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }191\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }261\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }325\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }425$\n",
    "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that $110n^3$ has 110 divisors. That means it can be written as $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. Since $110n^3$ has 110 divisors, it must be in the form $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot p_3^{a_3} \\cdot n^{a_4}$ where $p_1, p_2, p_3$ are different prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ are positive integers. We also know that there are 110 total divisors, so $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)(a_4+1) = 110$. \n\nNow we need to find the number of divisors of $81n^4$. We know $81n^4$ can be written as $3^4 \\cdot n^4$. This means it can be written as $p_1^{b_1} \\cdot p_2^{b_2} \\cdot n^{b_3}$ where $b_1, b_2, b_3$ are positive integers. The number of positive integer divisors for $81n^4$ is then $(b_1+1)(b_2+1)(b_3+1)$. \n\nTo find the number of divisors for $81n^4$, we can write $81n^4$ in terms of $p_1, p_2, n$ as well. So we have $(b_1+1)(b_2+1)(b_3+1) = (4+1)(4+1)(1+1) = 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = 50$. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive integer divisors that $81n^4$ has is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }191}$.",
