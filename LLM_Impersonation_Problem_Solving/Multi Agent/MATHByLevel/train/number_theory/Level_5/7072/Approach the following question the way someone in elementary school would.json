    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the odd integers $1,3,5,\\ldots,99$ in increasing order. Each row below the first has one fewer entry than the row above it, and the bottom row has a single entry. Each entry in any row after the top row equals the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the row immediately above it. How many entries in the array are multiples of $67$?\n",
    "solution": "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, this problem seems a little tricky but let's break it down step by step. We have to find out how many numbers in this array are multiples of 67.\n\nFirst, we notice that the first row consists of odd integers from 1 to 99. So let's find out which of these numbers are multiples of 67.\n\n67 is not in the sequence 1,3,5,...,99. So, we will have to find out if any of the numbers in the rows below are multiples of 67.\n\nLet's start by finding the numbers in the second row. Each number in the second row is the sum of two numbers diagonally above it in the first row. So, the numbers in the second row will be 1+3, 3+5, 5+7,...,97+99.\n\nNow, let's test each of these numbers to see if they are multiples of 67. If they are, we will count them.\n\nFinally, we repeat this process for the rest of the rows until we reach the bottom row which has only one number.\n\nAfter adding up all the multiples of 67, we will have our answer!",
