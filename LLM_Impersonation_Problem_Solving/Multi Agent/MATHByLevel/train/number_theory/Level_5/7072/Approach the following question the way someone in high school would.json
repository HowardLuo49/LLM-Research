    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the odd integers $1,3,5,\\ldots,99$ in increasing order. Each row below the first has one fewer entry than the row above it, and the bottom row has a single entry. Each entry in any row after the top row equals the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the row immediately above it. How many entries in the array are multiples of $67$?\n",
    "solution": "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To start, let's find the second row of the array. Each entry in the second row is the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the first row. So, we have $1+3=4, 3+5=8, 5+7=12, \\ldots, 95+97=192$.\n\nNext, we find the entries of the third row by summing the numbers diagonally above them in the second row. This gives us $4+8=12, 8+12=20, \\ldots, 184+188=372$.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can find the entries of the fourth row: $12+20=32, 20+32=52, \\ldots, 344+348=692$.\n\nThe process continues until we reach the bottom row, where there is only one entry: $2016$.\n\nNow, we need to identify how many of these entries are multiples of $67$. We can do this by dividing each entry by $67$ and checking if the result is an integer.\n\nCalculating the division for each entry, we find that the only entries that are multiples of $67$ are $67, 67\\cdot3=201, 67\\cdot5=335, \\ldots, 67\\cdot30=2010$.
