    "solution": "First, we note that $55$, $165$, and $260$ all have a common factor of $5$: \\begin{align*}\n55 &= 5\\cdot 11\\\\\n165 &= 5\\cdot 33\\\\\n260 &= 5\\cdot 52\n\\end{align*}An integer $n$ satisfies $55n\\equiv 165\\pmod{260}$ if and only if it satisfies $11n\\equiv 33\\pmod{52}$. (Make sure you see why!)\n\nNow it is clear that $n=3$ is a solution. Moreover, since $11$ and $52$ are relatively prime, the solution is unique $\\pmod{52}$. If you don't already know why this is the case, consider that we are looking for $n$ such that $11n-33=11(n-3)$ is divisible by $52$; this is true if and only if $n-3$ is divisible by $52$.\n\nHence all solutions are of the form $3+52k$, where $k$ is an integer. One such solution which is easy to compute is $3+52(20) = 1043$. The next-largest solution is $1043-52 = 991$, so the largest three-digit solution is $\\boxed{991}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit integer that satisfies the given congruence, we can first simplify the congruence equation. \n\nFirst, we can simplify $55n \\equiv 165 \\pmod{260}$ by dividing both sides by 5 to get $11n \\equiv 33 \\pmod{52}$. \n\nNext, we can find the modular inverse of 11 modulo 52. To find the modular inverse, we need to find an integer $a$ such that $11a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{52}$. This is equivalent to solving the linear Diophantine equation $11a - 52b = 1$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. \n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that the inverse of 11 modulo 52 is $a = 19$. \n\nMultiplying both sides of the congruence $11n \\equiv 33 \\pmod{52}$ by 19, we get $n \\equiv 627 \\equiv 17 \\pmod{52}$. \n\nTherefore, the general form of the solution to the congruence is $n = 17 + 52k$, where $k$ is an integer. \n\nTo find the largest three-digit integer that satisfies this congruence, we substitute $n = 17 + 52k$ into the condition that $n$ is a three-digit integer. \n\nSolving for the largest possible value of $k$ such that $17 + 52k$ is a three-digit integer, we find that the largest three-digit integer $n$ that satisfies the given congruence is $n = 949$.",
