    "solution": "First, we note that $55$, $165$, and $260$ all have a common factor of $5$: \\begin{align*}\n55 &= 5\\cdot 11\\\\\n165 &= 5\\cdot 33\\\\\n260 &= 5\\cdot 52\n\\end{align*}An integer $n$ satisfies $55n\\equiv 165\\pmod{260}$ if and only if it satisfies $11n\\equiv 33\\pmod{52}$. (Make sure you see why!)\n\nNow it is clear that $n=3$ is a solution. Moreover, since $11$ and $52$ are relatively prime, the solution is unique $\\pmod{52}$. If you don't already know why this is the case, consider that we are looking for $n$ such that $11n-33=11(n-3)$ is divisible by $52$; this is true if and only if $n-3$ is divisible by $52$.\n\nHence all solutions are of the form $3+52k$, where $k$ is an integer. One such solution which is easy to compute is $3+52(20) = 1043$. The next-largest solution is $1043-52 = 991$, so the largest three-digit solution is $\\boxed{991}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Um... Let's see... I think we need to find a number that when multiplied by 55, gives us 165 when we divide by 260. So we need to find a number that is close to 165 when we multiply by 55. \n\nLet's try 3! So, 55 x 3 = 165. Now we check if 165 divided by 260 gives us a whole number... Um, 260 goes into 165 zero times with a remainder of 165. So that doesn't work.\n\nMaybe we try 294! So, 55 x 294 = 16170. Now we check if 16170 divided by 260 gives us a whole number.... Um, 260 goes into 16170 62 times with a remainder of 10. So that also doesn't work.\n\nI'm not sure what number we need to find. Maybe we need to try different numbers until we find the largest three-digit number that works. Um, I think we need to find 5! So, 55 x 5 = 275. Now we check if 275 divided by 260 gives us a whole number... Um, 260 goes into 275 once with a remainder of 15. Woohoo! That works! \n\nSo the largest three-digit number $n$ that satisfies the equation is $n = 5$. Yay!",
