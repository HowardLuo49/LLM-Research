A subset of the integers $1,2,\\cdots,100$ has the property that none of its members is 3 times another. What is the largest number of members such a subset can have?\n$\\text{(A) } 50\\quad \\text{(B) } 66\\quad \\text{(C) } 67\\quad \\text{(D) } 76\\quad \\text{(E) } 78$\n",
    "solution": "Notice that inclusion of the integers from $34$ to $100$ is allowed as long as no integer between $11$ and $33$ inclusive is within the set. This provides a total of $100 - 34 + 1$ = 67 solutions.\nFurther analyzation of the remaining integers between $1$ and $10$, we notice that we can include all the numbers except $3$ (as including $3$ would force us to remove both $9$ and $1$) to obtain the maximum number of $9$ solutions.\nThus, $67 + 9 = \\boxed{76}$.",

We want to pick numbers 1 through 100 for our subset, but we can't have a number that is 3 times another number. That means if we pick 1, we can't pick 3 since 3 is 3 times 1. \n\nLet's try to find a pattern. If we pick 1, then we can't pick 3. But we can pick 2 because 2 is not 3 times any number. So we can pick 1 and 2. \n\nIf we pick 4, then we can't pick 12 because 12 is 3 times 4. \n\nLet's try another example. If we pick 5, we can't pick 15 because 15 is 3 times 5. \n\nIt seems like we can keep picking every third number after we pick a number. That means we can pick 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and so on. \n\nLet's count how many numbers we can pick this way.
