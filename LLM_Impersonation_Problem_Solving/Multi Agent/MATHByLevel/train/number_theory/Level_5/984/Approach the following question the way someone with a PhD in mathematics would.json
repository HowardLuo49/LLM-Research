    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we first need to find a pattern in the units digits of the Fermat numbers as $n$ increases. \n\nWe start by looking at the first few Fermat numbers:\n\n$F_0 = 2^{2^0} + 1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3$ (units digit = 3)\n\n$F_1 = 2^{2^1} + 1 = 2^2 + 1 = 5$ (units digit = 5)\n\n$F_2 = 2^{2^2} + 1 = 2^4 + 1 = 17$ (units digit = 7)\n\n$F_3 = 2^{2^3} + 1 = 2^8 + 1 = 257$ (units digit = 7)\n\nFrom the examples above, we see that the first Fermat number with units digit 1 is $F_6 = 2^{2^6} + 1 = 2^{64} + 1$. \n\nSince $2^{64}$ ends in 6 and when 1 is added to it, the units digit becomes 7, we see that the units digit of $F_{1000}$ will be the same as $F_6$, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is 7.",
