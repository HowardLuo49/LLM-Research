    "solution": "Note that $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$. We focus on the large prime $167$ as the powers of $2$ and $3$ in the prime factorization of $2004!$ are going to be much higher. The largest power of $167$ that divides $2004!$ is $\\tfrac{2004}{167} = \\boxed{12}$, the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer $k$ such that $2004^k$ divides $2004!$, we need to consider the prime factorization of both sides.\n\nThe prime factorization of $2004$ is $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 167$. So the prime factorization of $2004!$ will include multiple factors of $2$, $3$, and $167$.\n\nTo find the largest integer $k$, we need to determine how many factors of $2004$ are present in the prime factorization of $2004!$. It is clear that there will be more factors of $2$ than $3$ or $167$, so we need to focus on finding the largest power of $2$ that divides $2004!$.\n\nBy considering the prime factorization of $2004$, we can see that the largest power of $2$ that divides $2004!$ is equal to the power of $2$ in the prime factorization of $2004$ itself, which is $2^2$.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer $k$ such that $2004^k$ divides $2004!$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
