    "solution": "Note that $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$. We focus on the large prime $167$ as the powers of $2$ and $3$ in the prime factorization of $2004!$ are going to be much higher. The largest power of $167$ that divides $2004!$ is $\\tfrac{2004}{167} = \\boxed{12}$, the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We want to find the biggest number $k$ that makes $2004^k$ go into $2004!$. That means we need to see how many times we can put $2004$ in $2004!$ evenly. So let's start by dividing $2004!$ by $2004$, then by $2004$ again, and keep going until we can't anymore. \n\nAfter doing some dividing, we find that the largest number $k$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
