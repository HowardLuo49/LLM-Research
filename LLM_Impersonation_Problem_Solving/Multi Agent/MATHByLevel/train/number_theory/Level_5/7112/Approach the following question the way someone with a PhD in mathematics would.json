Let $N(k)$ be the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$. What is the maximum value of $N(k)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 9\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 10$\n",
    "solution": "The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.\nFor $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \\left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \\right)$. The first value in the parentheses is odd, the second one is even, hence their sum is odd and we have $N(k)=k+2\\leq 5$.\nFor $k>4$ we have $I_k=2^6 \\left( 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k-4} + 1 \\right)$. For $k>4$ the value in the parentheses is odd, hence $N(k)=6$.\nThis leaves the case $k=4$. We have $I_4 = 2^6 \\left( 5^6 + 1 \\right)$. The value $5^6 + 1$ is obviously even. And as $5\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and therefore $5^6 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$, we need to maximize the number of factors of $2$ that contribute. This is done by selecting as many of the zeros as possible to be a multiple of $2$. In other words, we want to maximize the power of $2$ that divides $5^k$. Since a factor of $2$ is being contributed by each multiple of $2$ in the prime factorization, the maximum value of $N(k)$ will be achieved when $5^k$ is divisible by $2^{10}$.\n\nIt's clear that the largest power of $2$ that can divide $5^k$ occurs for $k=10$, where $5^{10}$ is equal to $2^8(390625)$. Therefore, the maximum value of $N(k)$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 8}$.",
