Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers satisfying the conditions\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ \\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ and\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m$ is not a multiple of $n.$\nFind the least possible value of $m+n.$\n",
    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least possible value of $m+n$, we need to consider the given conditions and how they relate to each other. \n\nFirst, let's consider the condition $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$. This means that $m+n$ and 210 are coprime, or relatively prime. Since 210 factors as $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$, this condition implies that $m+n$ cannot have any common factors with these prime numbers.\n\nNext, we have the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$. This means that $m^n$ must be divisible by $n^n$, which implies that $m$ must be divisible by $n$. However, the third condition states that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this condition cannot be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only way to satisfy all the conditions is if $n=1$. In this case, $m^m$ is a multiple of $1$ for any positive integer $m$, and $m$ is not a multiple of $1$. Thus, the least possible value of $m+n$ is when $m=2$ and $n=1$, giving $m+n = 2 + 1 = 3$. \n\nSo, the least possible value of $m+n$ is 3.",
