Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers satisfying the conditions\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ \\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ and\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m$ is not a multiple of $n.$\nFind the least possible value of $m+n.$\n",
    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's play a game with numbers! We have two numbers, $m$ and $n$, and they have some rules to follow. We want to find the smallest possible sum of $m$ and $n$.\n\nFirst, we know that when we add $m$ and $n$ together, their greatest common divisor is 1. That means they don't have any common factors other than 1.\n\nNext, we know that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$. This means that if we raise $m$ to the power of itself (like $m \\cdot m \\cdot m$), the result is a number that can be divided evenly by $n$ raised to the power of itself. \n\nFinally, we know that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$. This means that $m$ cannot be evenly divided by $n.\n\nTo find the smallest possible sum of $m$ and $n, we need to think about how we can make these rules work. One way to do this is to find two numbers that have no common factors, where one is a multiple of the other, and they can be made by multiplying themselves. \n\nThe numbers 7 and 5 fit all of these rules. When we add them together, their greatest common divisor is 1. If we raise 7 to the power of 7, it is a multiple of $n$ raised to the power of itself. And 7 is not a multiple of 5. \n\nSo, the smallest possible sum of $m$ and $n$ is $7+5=12$! Yay, we did it!",
