    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Mady has an infinite number of balls and empty boxes available to her. The empty boxes, each capable of holding four balls, are arranged in a row from left to right. At the first step, she places a ball in the first box (the leftmost box) of the row. At each subsequent step, she places a ball in the first box of the row that still has room for a ball and empties any boxes to its left. How many balls in total are in the boxes as a result of Mady's $2010$th step?",
    "solution": "After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$). In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth. An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \\le k \\le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.\n\nWe need to verify that this is true. On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$. For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full. The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$. Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box. Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$. Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can start by finding a pattern in the number of balls in each box after each step. Let $a_n$ represent the number of balls in the $n$th box after step $2010$. We can then derive a recursive formula for $a_n$:\n\n$a_1 = 1$ (after the first step)\n$a_2 = 0$ (first box is full, second box is empty)\n$a_3 = 1$ (first box emptied, second box filled)\n$a_4 = 0$ (first and third boxes are full, second and fourth boxes are empty)\n\nFrom the pattern observed, we can see that $a_n = 1$ when $n$ is odd, and $a_n = 0$ when $n$ is even. Therefore, after step $2010$, the boxes with odd indices (i.e., boxes $1, 3, 5, ...$) will have one ball each, and the boxes with even indices (i.e., boxes $2, 4, 6, ...$) will be empty.\n\nSince we have an infinite number of boxes, the number of boxes with balls after step $2010$ is equivalent to the number of positive odd integers up to $2010$. This can be found by dividing $2010$ by $2$ and rounding up, resulting in $\\left\\lceil \\frac{2010}{2} \\right\\rceil = 1005$.\n\nTherefore, after Mady's $2010$th step, there are $\\boxed{1005}$ balls in total.",
