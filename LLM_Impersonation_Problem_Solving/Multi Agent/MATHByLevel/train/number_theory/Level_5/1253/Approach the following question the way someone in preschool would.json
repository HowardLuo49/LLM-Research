    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we can try to find the biggest number using all different digits that add up to 16. Hmm, let's see... We can start with the digit 9 because it's the biggest digit. Then we can try to add more digits to make 16. Let's see... 9 plus 6 is 15, so we just need one more digit. How about 1? So the biggest number with all different digits that add up to 16 is 961. Yay, we did it!",
