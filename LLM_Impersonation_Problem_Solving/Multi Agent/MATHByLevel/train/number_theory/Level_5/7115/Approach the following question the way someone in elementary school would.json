For any integer $n>1$, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is:\n$\\text{(A) } 0\\quad\\qquad \\text{(B) } 1\\quad\\\\ \\text{(C) } \\frac{n}{2} \\text{ for n even, } \\frac{n+1}{2} \\text{ for n odd}\\quad\\\\ \\text{(D) } n-1\\quad \\text{(E) } n$\n",
    "solution": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the number of prime numbers between $n!+1$ and $n!+n$. First, let's look at an example. Let's say $n=3$. Then we have to find the number of prime numbers between $3!+1$ and $3!+3$ which is between $7$ and $9$. The only prime number between $7$ and $9$ is $7$. So the answer is $1$, which means the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B) } 1}$.",
