For any integer $n>1$, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is:\n$\\text{(A) } 0\\quad\\qquad \\text{(B) } 1\\quad\\\\ \\text{(C) } \\frac{n}{2} \\text{ for n even, } \\frac{n+1}{2} \\text{ for n odd}\\quad\\\\ \\text{(D) } n-1\\quad \\text{(E) } n$\n",
    "solution": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's figure out what $n!$ means. It's just the product of all the integers from 1 to n. So, $n!=1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot...\\cdot n$. And $n!+1$ is just adding 1 to that whole product. \n\nNow, let's think about the numbers between $n!+1$ and $n!+n$. Since $n!+2 > n!+1$, we can see that none of the prime numbers smaller than $n!+1$ can be in this range. \n\nNow, we have to think about what kind of numbers $n!+1$ and $n!+n$ are. Both of them will definitely be composite numbers because $n!+1$ is greater than 1 and $n!+n$ can be factored to $n(n-1)...(n-1)+1$ which will definitely have more than just the prime $n$ in its factors. So, the numbers between $n!+1$ and $n!+n$ will also be composite.\n\nTherefore, the number of prime numbers between $n!+1$ and $n!+n$ is $\\boxed{\\text{(A) } 0}$.",
