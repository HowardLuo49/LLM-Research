    "solution": "For a number $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ to be divisible by $11$, we need $(a+c)-(b+d)$ to be divisible by $11$. If the digits of $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ add up to $9$, then $(a+c)-(b+d)$ must be $0$, because $(a+c)-(b+d)$ cannot be as large as 11 or as small as $-11$ without having $a+c+b+d\\geq 11$.\n\nNow $(a+c)-(b+d)=0$ implies that $a+c=b+d$, which in turn implies that $a+c$ and $b+d$ have the same parity (that is, they are either both odd or both even). Therefore, $a+b+c+d = (a+c)+(b+d)$ is even and therefore cannot be equal to $9$. So there are $\\boxed{0}$ possible numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see, to find out how many four-digit numbers add up to $9, we can think about the combinations of numbers that add up to $9! So there are numbers like 1356, 2346, 1353, and so on. \n\nNow to see which of these numbers are divisible by 11, we need to check if the alternating sum of the digits is divisible by 11. So for example, in the number 1356, we add 1 and 5, and subtract 3 and 6. If the result is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11!\n\nSo now let's go ahead and find all the combinations of numbers that add up to 9 and check if they are divisible by 11. We might need some help from a teacher or a grown-up to check our work, but it'll be fun to figure out together!",
