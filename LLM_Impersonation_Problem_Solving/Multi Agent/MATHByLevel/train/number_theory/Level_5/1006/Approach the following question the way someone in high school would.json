    "solution": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{230769},$ which has a repeating block of 6 digits. So the repetend is $\\boxed{230769}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we want to find the 6-digit repetend in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{13}$. To do this, we can perform long division. When we divide $3$ by $13$, we get a repeating decimal. Let's start with the long division:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|llllll}\n13 & 3.000000\\ldots \\\\\n\\cline{2-7} \n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSince $3$ is less than $13$, we need to add a decimal point and bring down a zero to continue the division. \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|llllll}\n13 & 3.000000\\ldots \\\\\n\\cline{2-7} \n& -26 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-3}\n& 4 & 0 \\\\\n& -39 \\\\\n\\cline{2-7}\n& 7 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n& -65 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 350 \\\\\n& -26 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n& 240 \\\\\n& -234 \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\n& 60 \\\\\n& -26 \\\\\n\\cline{2-3}\n& 34 \\\\\n& -26 \\\\\n\\cline{2-3}\n& 80 \\\\\n& -78 \\\\\n\\cline{2-3}\n& 20 \\\\\n& -13 \\\\\n\\cline{2-3}\n& 7 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSo, the 6-digit repetend in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{13}$ is $\\boxed{230769}$.",
