    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. If $A,B$ and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits in base $6$ such that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = \\overline{AAA0}_6$, find $B+C$ in base $6$.",
    "solution": "By definition of a base, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 = 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot B + C$. Noting that every digit appears in every possible slot once, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = (6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C).$ The value is equal to the sum, $\\overline{AAA0}_6 = 6^3 \\cdot A + 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot A = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A)$. Setting them equal, $$(6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C) = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A) \\Longrightarrow B+C = 5 \\cdot A.$$Since $B,C < 6$, then $B+C < 2 \\cdot 6$, so $A = 1,2$. However, there do not exist distinct base $6$ digits such that $B + C = 2 \\cdot 5$, so it follows that $A = 1_6$, and $B+C = \\boxed{5}_6$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have to find non-zero distinct digits $A,B,$ and $C$ where $A,B,$ and $C$ are non-zero digits and they are distinct in base $6$. We need to find the values of $B$ and $C$ such that when we add them up in a certain way, we get $\\overline{AAA0}_6$. Once we find the values of $B$ and $C$, we can sum them to get $B+C$ in base $6$. Let's start by writing out the expressions for $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = \\overline{AAA0}_6$.\n\nSo we have $6^2A + 6B + C + 6^2B + 6C + A + 6^2C + 6A + B = 6^3A + 6^2A + 6A$. Simplifying this, we get $252A + 8B + 8C = 252A + 36A$ which simplifies to $8B + 8C = 36A$. Solving for $B+C$ we have $B+C = 4.5A = 13.5$. \n\nHowever, since the digits must be in base $6$, we must convert $13.5$ to base $6$. We rewrite $13.5$ as $13 + 0.5 = 20.3_6$. Therefore, $B+C = \\boxed{03}_6$.",
