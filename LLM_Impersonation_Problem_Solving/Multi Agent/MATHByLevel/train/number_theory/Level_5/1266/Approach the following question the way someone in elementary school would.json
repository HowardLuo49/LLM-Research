    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. If $A,B$ and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits in base $6$ such that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = \\overline{AAA0}_6$, find $B+C$ in base $6$.",
    "solution": "By definition of a base, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 = 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot B + C$. Noting that every digit appears in every possible slot once, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = (6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C).$ The value is equal to the sum, $\\overline{AAA0}_6 = 6^3 \\cdot A + 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot A = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A)$. Setting them equal, $$(6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C) = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A) \\Longrightarrow B+C = 5 \\cdot A.$$Since $B,C < 6$, then $B+C < 2 \\cdot 6$, so $A = 1,2$. However, there do not exist distinct base $6$ digits such that $B + C = 2 \\cdot 5$, so it follows that $A = 1_6$, and $B+C = \\boxed{5}_6$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's write down what we know. We have three numbers: $\\overline{ABC}_6$, $\\overline{BCA}_6$, $\\overline{CAB}_6$ and $\\overline{AAA0}_6$. We want to find the value of $B+C$.\n\nLet's start by writing these numbers out:\n\n$\\overline{ABC}_6 = 6^2A + 6^1B + 6^0C = 36A + 6B + C$\n$\\overline{BCA}_6 = 6^2B + 6^1C + 6^0A = 36B + 6C + A$\n$\\overline{CAB}_6 = 6^2C + 6^1A + 6^0B = 36C + 6A + B$\n$\\overline{AAA0}_6 = 6^3A + 6^2A + 6^1A = 216A + 36A + 6A = 252A$\n\nNow we can write the equation given to us:\n\n$36A + 6B + C + 36B + 6C + A + 36C + 6A + B = 252A$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives:\n\n$43A + 43B + 43C = 252A$\n\nSubtracting $43A$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$43B + 43C = 209A$\n\nSince $A,B,$ and $C$ are distinct digits in base $6$, we can see that $A$ must equal $4$ (since it's the only digit that satisfies this equation). So now we have:\n\n$43B + 43C = 836$\n\nDivide both sides by $43$ gives us:\n\n$B + C = 19$\n\nTherefore, the value of $B + C$ in base $6$ is $\\boxed{31_6}$.",
