    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. If $A,B$ and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits in base $6$ such that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = \\overline{AAA0}_6$, find $B+C$ in base $6$.",
    "solution": "By definition of a base, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 = 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot B + C$. Noting that every digit appears in every possible slot once, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = (6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C).$ The value is equal to the sum, $\\overline{AAA0}_6 = 6^3 \\cdot A + 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot A = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A)$. Setting them equal, $$(6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C) = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A) \\Longrightarrow B+C = 5 \\cdot A.$$Since $B,C < 6$, then $B+C < 2 \\cdot 6$, so $A = 1,2$. However, there do not exist distinct base $6$ digits such that $B + C = 2 \\cdot 5$, so it follows that $A = 1_6$, and $B+C = \\boxed{5}_6$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's start by looking at the numbers we have. We have $\\overline{ABC}_6$, $\\overline{BCA}_6$, and $\\overline{CAB}_6$ that add up to $\\overline{AAA0}_6$. So that means we need to add up the numbers in the ones place, the sixes place, and the thirtysixes place (that's just a fancy way of saying the leftmost digit).\n\nLet's start with the ones place. We have $C+B+A = A+0$. Since $A,B,$ and $C$ are all different digits, we know that $A$ must be $1$, $B$ must be $2$, and $C$ must be $3$. So, $C = 3$ and $B = 2$.\n\nNow let's look at the sixes place. We have $B+A = A$. Since $B = 2$ and $A = 1$, this works out.\n\nFinally, let's look at the thirtysixes place. We have $A+C = A$. Since $A = 1$ and $C = 3$, this also works out.\n\nSo, we have found that $C = 3$ and $B = 2$. Adding them together in base $6$, we get $3+2 = 5$. Therefore, $B+C = \\boxed{5}_6$.",
