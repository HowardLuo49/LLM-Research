    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 25 + \\frac{8}{11} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 5}{55} \\equiv \\frac{62}{-1} \\equiv -62 \\equiv \\boxed{50} \\pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows. Suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \\equiv 55n \\equiv 22 + 40 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break it down into little pieces. We have $2 \\cdot 5^{-1}$ and $8 \\cdot 11^{-1}$. \n\nNow, let's figure out what $5^{-1}$ is. In preschool, we know that $5$ times $11$ equals $55$. So $5$ is like a buddy with $11$. That means $5^{-1}$ is like a magical number that when you multiply it by $5$, you get $1$. So $5^{-1}$ is $11$!\n\nNext, let's figure out what $11^{-1}$ is. In preschool, we know that $11$ times $5$ equals $55$. So $11$ is also like a buddy with $5$. That means $11^{-1}$ is also $11$!\n\nSo now we have $2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 11$.\n\nThat's $22 + 88 = 110$. \n\nBut we only want the answer up to $56$, so we have to find what the remainder is when we divide $110$ by $56$.\n\n$110 \\div 56 = 1$ with a remainder of $54$.\n\nSo the answer is $54$!\n\nYay, we did it!",
