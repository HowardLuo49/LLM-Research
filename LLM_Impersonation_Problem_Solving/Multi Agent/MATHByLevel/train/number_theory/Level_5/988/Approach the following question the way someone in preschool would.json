    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The number $1000!$ has a long tail of zeroes. How many zeroes are there?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
    "solution": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nTo count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.\n\nNext, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.\n\nNext, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.\n\nFinally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.\n\nThis gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We have to count how many times we can divide the number by 5 and still get a whole number. Let's start with 5! 5 divides 1000, and 5 divides 1000 again when we have 10, 15, 20, 25, and so on. Let's keep counting by 5s: 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100... oh no, we reached 100 but we can still divide by 5 again! Let's keep going until we reach 1000. By counting all the times we divided by 5, we find that the number $1000!$ has 249 zeroes at the end. Woah, that's a lot of zeroes!",
