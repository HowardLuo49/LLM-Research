    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. If $n$ is a positive integer, then let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10$?",
    "solution": "The sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is the sum of the digits of the integer $\\frac{10^n}{5^{{}^n}} = 2^n$, since multiplying by $10^n$ simply shifts all the digits $n$ places to the left. As a result, we start computing powers of 2, looking for an integer which has digits summing to a number greater than 10. \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n2^3 &= 8 \\\\\n2^4 &= 16 \\\\\n2^5 &= 32 \\\\\n2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n2^7 &= 128\n\\end{align*}The sum of the digits in 128 is 11. The smallest positive integer $n$ such that the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is greater than 10 is $n = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, if we take the fraction $\\frac{1}{5^n}$, we can find the decimal by dividing 1 by 5 n times. Then, we can add up all the digits after the decimal point to find $f(n)$. We want to keep going until $f(n)$ is greater than 10. Let's start with $n=1$.\n\nWhen we divide 1 by 5 once, we get 0.2. The sum of the digits after the decimal point is 2. $f(1)$ is 2, which is not greater than 10.\n\nLet's try $n=2$. When we divide 1 by 5 twice, we get 0.04. The sum of the digits after the decimal point is 4. $f(2)$ is 4, which is still not greater than 10.\n\nLet's try $n=3$. When we divide 1 by 5 three times, we get 0.008. The sum of the digits after the decimal point is 8. $f(3)$ is 8, which is still not greater than 10.\n\nLet's try $n=4$. When we divide 1 by 5 four times, we get 0.0016. The sum of the digits after the decimal point is 7. $f(4)$ is 7, which is still not greater than 10.\n\nLet's try $n=5$. When we divide 1 by 5 five times, we get 0.00032. The sum of the digits after the decimal point is 5. $f(5)$ is 5, which is still not greater than 10.\n\nLet's try $n=6$. When we divide 1 by 5 six times, we get 0.000064. The sum of the digits after the decimal point is 10. $f(6)$ is 10, which is finally greater than 10.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
