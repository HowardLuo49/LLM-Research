    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Find the smallest positive integer $N$ with the following property: of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$, one of them is divisible by $2^2$, one of them is divisible by $3^2$, one is divisible by $5^2$, and one is divisible by $7^2$.",
    "solution": "The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$.  The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$.  But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98.  To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100.  Hence we should take $N=\\boxed{98}$.",

One of them must be divisible by $2^2 = 4$, which means that $N$, $N+1$, or $N+2$ must be a multiple of 4. Similarly, one of them must be divisible by $3^2 = 9$, one must be divisible by $5^2 = 25$, and one must be divisible by $7^2 = 49$. \n\nFrom this, we can conclude that for $N$ to be the smallest possible integer with the given property, it must be $N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, $N \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, $N \\equiv 23 \\pmod{25}$, and $N \\equiv 47 \\pmod{49}$.\n\nTo solve this system of congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
