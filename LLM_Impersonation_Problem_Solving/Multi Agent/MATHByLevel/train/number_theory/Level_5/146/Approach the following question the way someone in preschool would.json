    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we skip all the numbers that don't have a 1 in them. So that means we skip 12, 15, and 18. Then we start counting with 21, which has a 1 in it. So the sequence goes like this: 21, 51, 81, 111. Let's keep counting with numbers that have a 1 in them, like 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, and 81. Hmm, let's see... The $50^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is 111.",
