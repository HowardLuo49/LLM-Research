    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The positive integers $N$ and $N^2$ both end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$, where digit a is not zero. Find the three-digit number $abc$.\n",
    "solution": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing out $N$ and $N^2$:\n\n$N = 1000m + abcd$\n$N^2 = (1000m + abcd)^2 = 1000^2m^2 + 2\\cdot1000abcdm + abcd^2$\n\nSince $N$ and $N^2$ end in the same four digits $abcd$, we have:\n\n$1000m + abcd \\equiv abcd \\pmod{10000}$\n$1000^2m^2 + 2\\cdot1000abcdm + abcd^2 \\equiv abcd \\pmod{10000}$\n\nSimplifying the above congruences, we get:\n\n$1000m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$\n$0 \\equiv 2\\cdot1000abcdm + abcd^2 \\pmod{10000}$\n\nSo $m$ must be an integer multiple of 10, and $abcd$ must be the last four digits of a perfect square.

However, since a is not zero, we can eliminate the 0000, and the one that ends with 01. \n\nTherefore, the three-digit number $abc$ is actually $\\boxed{960}$.",
