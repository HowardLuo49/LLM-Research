    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of even perfect square factors of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$, we must first consider the powers of each prime number in the factorization.\n\nFor the prime number 2, we have 4 as the exponent. To create an even perfect square factor, we need to choose an even power of 2. Since 4 is already even, the possible choices are $2^0$, $2^2$, and $2^4$. Therefore, we have 3 choices for the power of 2.\n\nFor the prime number 7, we have 9 as the exponent. In order to create an even perfect square factor, we need to choose an even power of 7. Since 9 is odd, there are no possible choices for the power of 7 that would result in an even perfect square factor.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of choices for each prime number. Since there are 3 choices for the power of 2 and 1 choice for the power of 7, the total number of even perfect square factors of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ is $3 \\cdot 1 = 3$. \n\nTherefore, $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ has 3 even perfect square factors.",
