    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the even perfect square factors in $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$!\n\nFirst, let's look at the even factors of 2. We have 2^2 and 2^4, which are perfect squares.\n\nNext, let's look at the even factors of 7. Since 7 is an odd number, there are no even perfect square factors for 7.\n\nSo, we have 2 even perfect square factors in $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$.\n\nYay! We found it!",
