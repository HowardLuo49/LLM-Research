    "solution": "To find the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we can look at the first few power of 17 modulo 100: \\begin{align*}\n17^0 &\\equiv 1, \\\\\n17^1 &\\equiv 17, \\\\\n17^2 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 17 \\equiv 289 \\equiv 89, \\\\\n17^3 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 89 \\equiv 1513 \\equiv 13, \\\\\n17^4 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 13 \\equiv 221 \\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe know that if we find a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, then the last two digits in the power of 17 become periodic at that point.  We don't have that in $17^4$, but the units digit in $17^4$ is 1.  We have matched the units digit, so let's use powers of $17^4$: \\begin{align*}\n17^4 &\\equiv 21, \\\\\n17^8 &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 21 \\equiv 441 \\equiv 41, \\\\\n17^{12} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 41 \\equiv 861 \\equiv 61, \\\\\n17^{16} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 61 \\equiv 1281 \\equiv 81, \\\\\n17^{20} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 81 \\equiv 1701 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*} We found a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, so the last two digits are periodic, with period 20.\n\nSince $1993 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{20}$, \\[17^{1993} \\equiv 17^{13} \\pmod{100}.\\] Then \\begin{align*}\n17^{13} &\\equiv 17^{12} \\cdot 17 \\\\\n&\\equiv 61 \\cdot 17 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1037 \\\\\n&\\equiv 37 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we need to first look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 17. \n\nWhen we look at the units digits of $17^1, 17^2, 17^3, 17^4$, and so on, we see that the pattern repeats every 4 powers. The units digits are as follows: 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1, and so on.\n\nSince 1993 is 1 more than a multiple of 4, we know that the units digit of $17^{1993}$ is 7.\n\nNow, to find the tens digit, we need to look at the pattern of the tens digits of powers of 17. However, this pattern is more difficult to identify and calculate by hand. \n\nSo, instead of calculating each term, we can use a shortcut. We can see that the tens digit will be the same for powers of 17 that have the same units digit. Since we already know that the units digit of $17^{1993}$ is 7, we can look at the tens digit of powers of 17 with a units digit of 7. \n\nThe tens digits of powers of 17 with a units digit of 7 are: 1, 8, 7, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1, and so on.\n\nSince 1993 is 1 less than a multiple of 8, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ will be 8.\n\nTherefore, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is 8.",
