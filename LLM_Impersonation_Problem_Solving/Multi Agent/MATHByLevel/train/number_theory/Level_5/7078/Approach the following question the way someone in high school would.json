    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Call a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence. Find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers.\n",
    "solution": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest and smallest geometric numbers, we need to consider all possible combinations of distinct digits forming a geometric sequence. \n\nFirst, let's find the largest geometric number. This number will have the largest possible digits in a decreasing geometric sequence, such as $987$. \n\nNow, let's find the smallest geometric number. This number will have the smallest possible digits in an increasing geometric sequence, such as $123$. \n\nThe difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers is $987 - 123 = \\boxed{864}$.",
