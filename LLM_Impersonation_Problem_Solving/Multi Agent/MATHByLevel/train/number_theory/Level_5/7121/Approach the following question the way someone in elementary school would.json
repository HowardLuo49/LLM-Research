    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $n$ represent the smallest integer that satisfies the following conditions:\n$\\frac n2$ is a perfect square.\n$\\frac n3$ is a perfect cube.\n$\\frac n5$ is a perfect fifth.\nHow many divisors does $n$ have that are not multiples of 10?\n",
    "solution": "The first condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be an even power (excluding $2$, which must be an odd power). The second condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $3$ (excluding $3$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $3$). The third condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $5$ (excluding $5$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $5$).\nClearly, to minimize $n$, we want to just use the prime factors $2,3,5$. The power of $2$ must be divisible by $3,5$, and $2^{15}$ works. Similarly, the powers of $3$ and $5$ must be $10$ and $6$, respectively, both of which leave a residue of $1$ upon division. Thus, we need the number of factors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ which are not multiples of $10$.\nApplying the complement principle, there are a total of $(15+1)(10+1)(6+1) = 1232$ factors. We can draw a bijection between the number of divisors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ that are divisible by $10$ and the number of divisors of $2^{14} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{5}$ (as each of these divisors, when multiplied by 10, will provide a factor of the original number that is divisible by 10). There are $(14+1)(10+1)(5+1) = 990$. The answer is $1232-990 = \\boxed{242}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest number that is a perfect square when divided by 2, a perfect cube when divided by 3, and a perfect fifth when divided by 5, we can start by listing the first few perfect squares, cubes, and fifth powers:\nPerfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...\nPerfect cubes: 1, 8, 27, 64, ...\nPerfect fifths: 1, 32, 243, ...\n\nWe can find the smallest number that satisfies all three conditions by looking at the smallest numbers that are multiples of 2, 3, and 5, and combining them in the smallest possible way.
