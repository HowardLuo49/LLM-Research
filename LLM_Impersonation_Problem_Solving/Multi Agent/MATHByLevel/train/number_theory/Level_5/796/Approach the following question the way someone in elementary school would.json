    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we're looking for the biggest number that, when you square it, has exactly 3 digits when you write it in base 9. That means we want the biggest number that, when you square it, is between 100 and 999 in base 10. So let's start by finding the biggest number that, when squared, is less than 1000. \n\nThe biggest number we can use is 9 because 9 squared is 81 in base 10, and that's less than 100. When we write 81 in base 9, it's just 100. So $N$ is 9 in base 10, which is written as 10 in base 9. So the biggest integer $N$ whose square has exactly 3 digits when written in base 9 is 10.",
