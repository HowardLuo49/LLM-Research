    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Tom's graduating class has 288 students. At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
    "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the possible values of $x$, we need to find all the factors of 288 that are greater than or equal to 15. \n\nLet's list out all the factors of 288: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288.\n\nThen we eliminate the factors that are less than 15: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12.\n\nSo the possible values of $x$ are 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288.\n\nTo find the sum of all possible values of $x$, we add them up:\n$16 + 18 + 24 + 32 + 36 + 48 + 72 + 96 + 144 + 288 = 706$\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is 706.",
