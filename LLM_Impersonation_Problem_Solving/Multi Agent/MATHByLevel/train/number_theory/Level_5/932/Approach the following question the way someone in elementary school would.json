    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}?$",
    "solution": "Recall that, by definition,  $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ means that $531n-1067n$ is divisible by 24. In other words,  $$\\frac{1067n-531n}{24} = \\frac{536n}{24}=\\frac{67n}{3}$$must be an integer. Since $67$ and $3$ are relatively prime, $n$ must be a multiple of $3$, the smallest of which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$, we need to see when the two sides of the equation are equivalent. We can start by simplifying both sides of the equation: $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ becomes $3n \\equiv 19n \\pmod{24}$. \n\nTo make the numbers smaller, we can subtract $3n$ from both sides to get $0 \\equiv 16n \\pmod{24}$. So the smallest positive integer $n$ would be $24$, because $16*24 = 384$ and $384$ is divisible by $24$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{24}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 3?: To find the smallest positive integer $n$, we need to see when the two sides of the equation are equivalent.
