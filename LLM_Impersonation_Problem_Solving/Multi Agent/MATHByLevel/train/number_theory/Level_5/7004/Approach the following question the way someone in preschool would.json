    "solution": "It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\\boxed{757}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! Let's see what we know. We have $a^5 = b^4$ and $c^3 = d^2$. That means that $b$ must be the fifth root of $a$ and $d$ must be the cube root of $c$. \n\nWe also know that $c - a = 19$. Hmm... well, let's try to find the values for $a$ and $c$. \n\nLet's start with $a^5 = b^4$. Since $b$ is the fifth root of $a$, we know that $b$ must be a positive integer. If $b=1$, then $a=1$ too. But that means $c=20$, which doesn't work because it's not a perfect cube. So let's try $b=2$. This means $a=32$. And if $a=32$, then $c=51$ (since $c-a=19$).\n\nNow we have $a=32$, $b=2$, $c=51$, and $d=\\sqrt[3]{51}$. \n\nFinally, we want to find $d-b$. So $d=3$ and $b=2$, which means $d-b = 3-2 = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $d-b = 1$. Yay, we did it! \ud83c\udf1f",
