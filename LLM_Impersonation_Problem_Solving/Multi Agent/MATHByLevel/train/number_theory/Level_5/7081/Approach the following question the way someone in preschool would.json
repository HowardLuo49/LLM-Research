Define $n!!$ to be $n(n-2)(n-4)\\cdots 3\\cdot 1$ for $n$ odd and $n(n-2)(n-4)\\cdots 4\\cdot 2$ for $n$ even. When $\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\frac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, its denominator is $2^ab$ with $b$ odd. Find $\\dfrac{ab}{10}$.\n",
    "solution": "First, note that $(2n)!! = 2^n \\cdot n!$, and that $(2n)!! \\cdot (2n-1)!! = (2n)!$.\nWe can now take the fraction $\\dfrac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ and multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $(2i)!!$. We get that this fraction is equal to $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(2i)!!^2} = \\dfrac{(2i)!}{2^{2i}(i!)^2}$.\nNow we can recognize that $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(i!)^2}$ is simply ${2i \\choose i}$, hence this fraction is $\\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$, and our sum turns into $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$.\nLet $c = \\sum_{i=1}^{2009} {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i}$. Obviously $c$ is an integer, and $S$ can be written as $\\dfrac{c}{2^{2\\cdot 2009}}$. Hence if $S$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, its denominator will be of the form $2^a$ for some $a\\leq 2\\cdot 2009$.\nIn other words, we just showed that $b=1$. To determine $a$, we need to determine the largest power of $2$ that divides $c$.\nLet $p(i)$ be the largest $x$ such that $2^x$ that divides $i$.\nWe can now return to the observation that $(2i)! = (2i)!! \\cdot (2i-1)!! = 2^i \\cdot i! \\cdot (2i-1)!!$. Together with the obvious fact that $(2i-1)!!$ is odd, we get that $p((2i)!)=p(i!)+i$.\nIt immediately follows that $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\right) = p((2i)!) - 2p(i!) = i - p(i!)$, and hence $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i} \\right) = 2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$.\nObviously, for $i\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,2009\\}$ the function $f(i)=2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$ is is a strictly decreasing function. Therefore $p(c) = p\\left( {2\\cdot 2009\\choose 2009} \\right) = 2009 - p(2009!)$.\nWe can now compute $p(2009!) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{2009}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = 1004 + 502 + \\cdots + 3 + 1 = 2001$. Hence $p(c)=2009-2001=8$.\nAnd thus we have $a=2\\cdot 2009 - p(c) = 4010$, and the answer is $\\dfrac{ab}{10} = \\dfrac{4010\\cdot 1}{10} = \\boxed{401}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, $n!!$ is when we have to skip every other number and multiply them together. For odd numbers, we start with that number and go down by 2 until we reach 1. So for example, 5!! = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15. For even numbers, we start with that number and go down by 2 until we reach 2. So 4!! = 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nNow let's look at the sum of $\\frac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ from $i=1$ to $i=2009$. This means we plug in $i=1$ to get $\\frac{1!!}{2!!}$, then $i=2$ to get $\\frac{3!!}{4!!}$, and so on up to $i=2009$. \n\nWe want to find the value of this sum and express it as a fraction in lowest terms.
