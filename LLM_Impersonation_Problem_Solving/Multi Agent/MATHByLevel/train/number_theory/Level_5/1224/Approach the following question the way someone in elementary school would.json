    "solution": "Note firstly that $f(i)$ must be an integer, so this means that $i$ must be a perfect square in order for $\\sqrt{i}$ to be an integer. Out of the perfect squares, we claim that $i$ must be the square of some prime $p$. For if $\\sqrt{i}$ is composite, then it can be written as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$ and we find $f(i) \\ge 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i + a + b > 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. Moreover, if $\\sqrt{i}$ is prime, then the only factors of $i$ are 1, $\\sqrt{i}$, and $i$, so $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ as desired. It follows that we only need to calculate the number of primes less than $\\sqrt{2010}$. Since $\\sqrt{2010} < 45$, the desired set of primes is $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\\}$. The set has $\\boxed{14}$ elements.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of integers $i$ that satisfy the equation $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$, we need to understand what $f(n)$ means. \n\n$f(n)$ is the sum of all the positive divisors of the integer $n$. So for example, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, $f(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$. \n\nNow we need to find how many integers $i$ between 1 and 2010 satisfy $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. \n\nLet's start by trying some numbers and see if we can find a pattern. \n\nIf we plug in $i=1$, we get $f(1) = 1$ but $1 + \\sqrt{1} + 1 = 3$, so 1 is not a solution. \n\nIf we plug in $i=2$, we get $f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3$ and $1 + \\sqrt{2} + 2 = 3$, so 2 is a solution. \n\nIf we continue this pattern for more numbers, we will eventually find that the only solutions are perfect squares. \n\nSo the number of integers $i$ such that $1 \\le i \\le 2010$ and $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ is the number of perfect squares between 1 and 2010. \n\nCan you figure out how many perfect squares are between 1 and 2010?",
