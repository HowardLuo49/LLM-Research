Define a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\n",
    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers less than 1992 that are not factorial tails, we can start by finding which integers are factorial tails. \n\nFirst, let's look at how many twos and fives there are in the prime factorization of a factorial number.
