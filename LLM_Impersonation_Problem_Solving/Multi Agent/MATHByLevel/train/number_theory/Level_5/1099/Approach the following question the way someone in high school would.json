    "solution": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $4,1,6$, and $9$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$. Therefore, we want to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,((3x+4)(7x+1)(13x+6)(2x+9),x) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9, x)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(216,x)\n\\end{align*}Since $15336$ is a multiple of $216$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{216}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$. Since $x$ is given to be a multiple of $15336$, we can write $x = 15336n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nNext, we substitute $x = 15336n$ into $f(x) = (3x+4)(7x+1)(13x+6)(2x+9)$. This gives us:\n$$f(15336n) = (3(15336n)+4)(7(15336n)+1)(13(15336n)+6)(2(15336n)+9)$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$f(15336n) = (46008n+4)(107352n+1)(199008n+6)(30672n+9)$$\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor of $f(15336n)$ and $15336n$. Since $15336n$ is a common factor of both $f(15336n)$ and $15336n$, the greatest common divisor is $15336n$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{15336}$.",
