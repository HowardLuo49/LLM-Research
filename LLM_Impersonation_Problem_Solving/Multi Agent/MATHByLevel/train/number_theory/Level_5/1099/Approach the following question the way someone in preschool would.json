    "solution": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $4,1,6$, and $9$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$. Therefore, we want to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,((3x+4)(7x+1)(13x+6)(2x+9),x) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9, x)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(216,x)\n\\end{align*}Since $15336$ is a multiple of $216$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{216}$.",

First, let's find out what number $x$ is since it is a multiple of $15336. \n\nTo find that, we divide $15336$ by some numbers until we can't divide anymore. \n\n$15336 \\div 2 = 7668$\n\n$7668 \\div 2 = 3834$\n\n$3834 \\div 2 = 1917$\n\n$1917 \\div 3 = 639$\n\n$639 \\div 3 = 213$\n\n$213 \\div 3 = 71$\n\n$71 \\div 71 = 1$\n\nSo, $15336$ can be expressed as $2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 71$. \n\nNow, we have to find the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$. The easiest way to do this would be to plug in the value we found for $x$ into $f(x)$ and then find the greatest common factor between that result and $x$. \n\nCan we help find the greatest common factor of those two numbers?",
