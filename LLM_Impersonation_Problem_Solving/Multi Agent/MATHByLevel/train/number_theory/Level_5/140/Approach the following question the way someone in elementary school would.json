    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out the number $b$, we have to know that there are $b$ different digits we can use for each place in the three-digit number. Since the digits must be distinct, we can't repeat any of the digits in the number.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, we have $b$ options, then for the tens place we have $b-1$ options (because we can't use the same digit as the hundreds place), and for the ones place we have $b-2$ options (because we can't use the same digits as the hundreds or tens place).\n\nTo find the total number of three-digit numbers with distinct digits, we just need to multiply these options together: $b \\times (b-1) \\times (b-2) = 100$. \n\nNow we have to find a number $b$ that when multiplied by $b-1$ and then by $b-2$ equals $100$. \n\nIf we think about the factors of 100, we can try some different values for $b$ to see if they work. We can start by trying $b=5$, since $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60$, which is close to 100. Let's try the next number, $b=6$, now we have $6 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 120$, which is too big. So $b$ must be less than 6. \n\nNext let's try $b=4$, then $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$, which is too small. So $b$ must be greater than 4. \n\nAfter trying some more numbers, we find that $b=5$ is the correct answer. \n\nSo in base 5, there are exactly one hundred three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct.
