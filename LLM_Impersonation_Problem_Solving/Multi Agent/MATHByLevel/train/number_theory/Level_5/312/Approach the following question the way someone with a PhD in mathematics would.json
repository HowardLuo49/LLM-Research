Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list?",
    "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square as \\(20n^2\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Similarly, let's denote the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube as \\(20m^3\\), where \\(m\\) is a positive integer. We need to find the smallest values of \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) such that both expressions result in whole numbers.\n\nTo find the smallest value of \\(n\\), we solve for \\(n\\) in the equation \\(20n^2 = x^2\\), where \\(x\\) is an integer. This simplifies to \\(n^2 = \\frac{x^2}{20}\\). Since \\(n\\) is an integer, \\(x^2\\) must be a multiple of 20. The smallest possible value of \\(x\\) for which this is true is 20, and therefore the smallest integer value of \\(n\\) is 1.\n\nFollowing the same procedure, we need to find the smallest value of \\(m\\) such that \\(20m^3 = y^3\\) results in a whole number. The smallest possible value of \\(y\\) for which this is true is 20, so the smallest integer value of \\(m\\) is 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square is \\(20 \\times 1^2 = 20\\), and the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube is \\(20 \\times 1^3 = 20\\). The integers between 20 and 20 are simply 20 itself. \n\nTherefore, Cameron's list consists of only one integer which is 20.",
