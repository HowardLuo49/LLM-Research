Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list?",
    "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, we can find the smallest perfect square greater than 20 which is 25. So, 5 * 5 = 25. Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square is 20 * 5 = 100.\n\nTo find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, we can find the smallest perfect cube greater than 20 which is 27. So, 3 * 3 * 3 = 27. Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube is 20 * 3 = 60.\n\nNow, we need to find all the multiples of 20 between 60 and 100. The multiples of 20 between 60 and 100 are 80 and 100.\n\nSo, Cameron's list includes the numbers 60, 80, and 100. The total number of integers in Cameron's list is 3.",
