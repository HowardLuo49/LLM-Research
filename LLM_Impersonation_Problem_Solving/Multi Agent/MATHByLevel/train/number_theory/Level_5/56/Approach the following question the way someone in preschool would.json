    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! To find out how many perfect squares less than 10,000 can be made by subtracting two consecutive perfect squares, we should start by finding some examples. Let's think of some perfect squares less than 10,000. One we know is 9, because 3 times 3 equals 9. And the next perfect square is 16, because 4 times 4 equals 16. When we subtract 9 from 16, we get 7, which is not a perfect square. So let's try another pair. The next perfect square after 16 is 25, because 5 times 5 equals 25. When we subtract 16 from 25, we get 9, which is a perfect square! Yay! Let's keep trying more pairs of consecutive perfect squares to see how many we can find that work. It might take some time, but we will have fun figuring it out together!",
