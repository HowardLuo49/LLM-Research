By a proper divisor of a natural number we mean a positive integral divisor other than 1 and the number itself. A natural number greater than 1 will be called nice if it is equal to the product of its distinct proper divisors. What is the sum of the first ten nice numbers?\n",
    "solution": "Let $p(n)$ denote the product of the distinct proper divisors of $n$. A number $n$ is nice in one of two instances:\nIt has exactly two distinct prime divisors.\nIf we let $n = pq$, where $p,q$ are the prime factors, then its proper divisors are $p$ and $q$, and $p(n) = p \\cdot q = n$.\nIt is the cube of a prime number.\nIf we let $n=p^3$ with $p$ prime, then its proper divisors are $p$ and $p^2$, and $p(n) = p \\cdot p^2 =n$.\nWe now show that the above are the only two cases. Suppose that another nice number existed that does not fall into one of these two categories. Then we can either express it in the form $n = pqr$ (with $p,q$ prime and $r > 1$) or $n = p^e$ (with $e \\neq 3$). In the former case, it suffices to note that $p(n) \\ge (pr) \\cdot (qr) = pqr^2 > pqr = n$.\nIn the latter case, then $p(n) = p \\cdot p^2 \\cdots p^{(e-1)} = p^{(e-1)e/2}$.\nFor $p(n) = n$, we need $p^{(e-1)e/2} = p^e \\Longrightarrow e^2 - e = 2e \\Longrightarrow$ $e = 0 or e = 3$.\nSince $e \\neq 3$, in the case $e = 0 \\Longrightarrow n = 1$ does not work.\nThus, listing out the first ten numbers to fit this form, $2 \\cdot 3 = 6,\\ 2^3 = 8,\\ 2 \\cdot 5 = 10,$ $\\ 2 \\cdot 7 = 14,\\ 3 \\cdot 5 = 15,\\ 3 \\cdot 7 = 21,$ $\\ 2 \\cdot 11 = 22,\\ 2 \\cdot 13 = 26,$ $\\ 3^3 = 27,\\ 3 \\cdot 11 = 33$. Summing these yields $\\boxed{182}$.",
