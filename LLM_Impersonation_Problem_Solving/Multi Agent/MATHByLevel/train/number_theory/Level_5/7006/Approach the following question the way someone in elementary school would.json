    "solution": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's think about this problem. We want to find the largest positive integer $n$ such that $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$. That means that if we divide $n^3+100$ by $n+10$, we should get a whole number with no remainder.\n\nLet's start by trying some different values of $n$ to see which one works. Let's start with $n=1$:\n$1^3 + 100 = 101$\nLet's try dividing $101$ by $1+10=11$:\n$101 \\div 11 = 9$ with a remainder of $2$\n\nLet's try $n=2$:\n$2^3 + 100 = 108$\n$108 \\div 12 = 9$ with a remainder of $0$\n\nHmm, it looks like $n=2$ works because when we divide $108$ by $12$, we get a whole number without a remainder.\n\nLet's keep trying larger values of $n$ and see if we can find a larger positive integer that works. Let me try $n=3$:\n$3^3 + 100 = 127$\n$127 \\div 13 = 9$ with a remainder of $10$\n\nUh oh, it looks like $n=2$ was the largest positive integer for which $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10.
