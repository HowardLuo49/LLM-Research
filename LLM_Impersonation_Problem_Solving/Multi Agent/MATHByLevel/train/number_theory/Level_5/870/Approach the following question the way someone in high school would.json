Suppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. How many different denominators are possible?",
    "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's write out the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$ as a fraction. We can represent this as $\\frac{ab}{99}$ since the decimal repeats every two digits and there are two digits in the decimal.\n\nTo find the lowest terms of this fraction, we need to simplify $\\frac{ab}{99}$. We can see that $ab$ is a two-digit number, so let's consider all possible values for $ab$ that are not both nine and not both zero.\n\nIf $ab=10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93,$ or $94$, then we can simplify $\\frac{ab}{99}$ to lowest terms.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{92}$ different denominators that are possible.",
