    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $S$ be the set of integers between $1$ and $2^{40}$ whose binary expansions have exactly two $1$'s. If a number is chosen at random from $S,$ the probability that it is divisible by $9$ is $p/q,$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.$\n",
    "solution": "A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \\neq k$ nonnegative integers. Thus, the set $S$ is equal to the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n = 2^j + 2^k \\,\\mathrm{ and }\\, 0 \\leq j < k \\leq 39\\}$. (The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \\neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.\nNow, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \\equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \\equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \\equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\nIt's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like. If one is of the form $6n$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 3$ (7 choices). If one is of the form $6n + 1$ (7 choices) the other must be of the form $6n + 4$ (6 choices). And if one is of the form $6n + 2$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 5$ (6 choices). This means that there are $7\\cdot 7 + 7\\cdot 6 + 7\\cdot 6 = 49 + 42 +42 = 133$ total \"good\" numbers.\nThe probability is $\\frac{133}{780}$, and the answer is $133 + 780 = \\boxed{913}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many numbers in $S$ are divisible by $9$. \n\nTo be divisible by $9$, a number must be divisible by both $3$ and $3$. Since a number is divisible by $3$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, and since the binary expansion of numbers in $S$ have exactly two $1$'s, the sum of the digits must be $2$. \n\nSo, to count the numbers in $S$ that are divisible by $9$, we need to count the number of ways to pick two positions out of $40$ for the $1$'s. This can be done in $\\binom{40}{2} = 780$ ways. \n\nThere are a total of $2^{40}$ numbers in $S$, so the probability that a randomly chosen number in $S$ is divisible by $9$ is $\\frac{780}{2^{40}} = \\frac{195}{2^{38}}$. \n\nTherefore, $p = 195$ and $q = 2^{38}$, so $p+q = 195 + 2^{38}$.",
