    "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the numbers in the problem - 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. If we add all those numbers together, we get 25. Since all of those numbers are odd, when we multiply them by an even number, the result will be even. This means the largest integer that is a divisor of $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ for all positive even integers $n$ is 25. Yay for big numbers!",
