    "solution": "Call the two integers $a$ and $b$. Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$. We also know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.\n\nTherefore, $$\\gcd(a,b) < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\\boxed{3}$ digits.\n\n(We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits. There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of two 6-digit integers. Since the LCM has 10 digits, it means that the two 6-digit integers are pretty big.\n\nTo find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers, we can use the fact that the product of the GCD and the LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves. So, if the LCM has 10 digits, then the product of the two 6-digit numbers must also have 10 digits.\n\nThis means that the GCD cannot have more than 4 digits, because if it did, then the product of the GCD and the LCM would have more than 10 digits.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of two 6-digit integers has at most 4 digits.",
