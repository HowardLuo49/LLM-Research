    "solution": "Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.\nAny multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.\nThe sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3. If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive. Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.\nThe smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880. Thus the answer is $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the largest positive multiple of $15$ that only contains the digits $0$ and $8$. Since $15$ is divisible by $5$, the last digit of our number must be $0$. We want the largest number possible, so the second-to-last digit should be $8$. Continuing this pattern, we can see that the largest number that fits this pattern is $8880$.\n\nNow, we need to compute $\\frac{8880}{15}$. We can do this by dividing $8880$ by $15$ to get $592$. Therefore, $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",
