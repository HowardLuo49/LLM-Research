    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Let $m$ and $n$ be any two odd numbers, with $n$ less than $m$. The largest integer which divides all possible numbers of the form $m^2-n^2$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 16$\n",
    "solution": "First, factor the difference of squares.\\[(m+n)(m-n)\\]Since $m$ and $n$ are odd numbers, let $m=2a+1$ and $n=2b+1$, where $a$ and $b$ can be any integer.\\[(2a+2b+2)(2a-2b)\\]Factor the resulting expression.\\[4(a+b+1)(a-b)\\]If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a-b$ is even. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a-b$ is even as well. If $a$ is odd and $b$ is even (or vise versa), then $a+b+1$ is even. Therefore, in all cases, $8$ can be divided into all numbers with the form $m^2-n^2$.\nThis can be confirmed by setting $m=3$ and $n=1$, making $m^2-n^2=9-1=8$. Since $8$ is not a multiple of $3$ and is less than $16$, we can confirm that the answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd, $m^2$ and $n^2$ will both be odd as well. When we subtract two odd numbers, the result is always even. Therefore, $m^2 - n^2$ will always be divisible by $2$. \n\nTo check if it is divisible by any larger even numbers, we can see that $m^2-n^2 = (m+n)(m-n)$. Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd, $m+n$ will be even and $m-n$ will also be even. This means that $m^2 - n^2$ will be divisible by at least $2 \\times 2 = 4$. \n\nHowever, since $m$ and $n$ are both odd, one of them must be congruent to $+1 \\pmod{4}$ and the other must be congruent to $-1 \\pmod{4}$. This means that either $m+n$ or $m-n$ will be divisible by $4$, making $m^2-n^2$ divisible by $8$ as well. \n\nTherefore, the largest integer which divides all possible numbers of the form $m^2-n^2$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 8}$.",
