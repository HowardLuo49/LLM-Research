    "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to know what \"1001\" means in base $n$. That means the first digit is worth $n^3$, the second digit is worth $n^2$, the third digit is worth $n^1$, and the last digit is worth $n^0$.\n\nLet's start by trying $n=2$. Then $1001_2 = 1\\cdot2^3 + 0\\cdot2^2 + 0\\cdot2^1 + 1\\cdot2^0 = 8 + 1 = 9$. But 9 is not a prime number, so $1001_2$ is not prime.\n\nNow let's try $n=3$. Then $1001_3 = 1\\cdot3^3 + 0\\cdot3^2 + 0\\cdot3^1 + 1\\cdot3^0 = 27 + 1 = 28$. But 28 is not a prime number, so $1001_3$ is not prime.\n\nWe can keep trying different values of $n$ to see if $1001_n$ is prime, but we won't find any. So, there are no positive integers $n\\geq 2$ such that $1001_n$ is a prime number.",
