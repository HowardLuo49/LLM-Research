    "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by understanding what $1001_n$ means. In base-$n$ notation, $1001_n$ represents a number where the digits are separated by powers of $n$. So, $1001_n$ means $1*n^3 + 0*n^2 + 0*n^1 + 1*n^0$, which simplifies to $n^3 + 1$.\n\nTo determine if $1001_n$ is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. Let's try to find the factors of $n^3 + 1$ by factoring it using the sum of cubes formula, which is $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$.\n\nIn this case, $a = n$ and $b = 1$. So, we have:\n$n^3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)$\n\nSince $n\\geq 2$, we know that both $n+1$ and $n^2 - n + 1$ are greater than 1. Therefore, $1001_n$ is not prime for any positive integer $n\\geq 2$.\n\nSo, the number of positive integers $n\\geq 2$ for which $1001_n$ is a prime number is 0.",
