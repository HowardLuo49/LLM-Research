    "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem because some numbers on the die have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with either of two other numbers (for example, $3$ with either $1$ or $5$) while other numbers will only have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with one particular number (for example, $2$ with $4$).\n\nIf the first roll is a $1,$ $2,$ $5,$ or $6,$ there is only one second roll in each case that will satisfy the given condition, so there are $4$ combinations of rolls that result in two integers with a positive difference of $2$ in this case. If, however, the first roll is a $3$ or a $4,$ in each case there will be two rolls that satisfy the given condition- $1$ or $5$ and $2$ or $6,$ respectively. This gives us another $4$ successful combinations for a total of $8.$\n\nSince there are $6$ possible outcomes when a die is rolled, there are a total of $6\\cdot6=36$ possible combinations for two rolls, which means our probability is $\\dfrac{8}{36}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}}.$\n\nOR\n\nWe can also solve this problem by listing all the ways in which the two rolls have a positive difference of $2:$ $$(6,4), (5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3).$$  So, we have $8$ successful outcomes out of $6\\cdot 6 = 36$ possibilities, which produces a probability of $8/36 = 2/9.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must analyze all the possible outcomes when two dice are rolled and determine the number of outcomes where the integers differ by $2$. \n\nEach die has $6$ possible outcomes: $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. \n\nThe pairs of integers that differ by $2$ are: $(1,3)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,5)$, $(4,6)$, $(3,1)$, $(4,2)$, $(5,3)$, $(6,4)$.\n\nThere are $8$ favorable outcomes out of a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes when rolling the die twice.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling integers that differ by $2$ on the first two rolls is $\\frac{8}{36}=\\frac{2}{9}$.",
