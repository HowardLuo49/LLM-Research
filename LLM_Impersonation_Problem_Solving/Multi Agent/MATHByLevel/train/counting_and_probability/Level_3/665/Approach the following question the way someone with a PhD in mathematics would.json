What is the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days, we need to find the probability of the complement event, which is that it will snow at least once in the next three days.\n\nThe probability of snow for each day is $\\frac{3}{4}$, which means the probability of no snow on a particular day is $1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince the events of snow on each day are independent, the probability of no snow on any given day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability of no snow at all in the next three days is $(\\frac{1}{4})^3 = \\frac{1}{64}$.\n\nSo, the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
