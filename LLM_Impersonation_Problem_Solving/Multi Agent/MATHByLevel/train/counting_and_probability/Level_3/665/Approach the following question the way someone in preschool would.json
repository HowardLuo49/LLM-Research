    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If it snows 3 out of 4 days, that means it won't snow 1 out of 4 days. So if the probability of snow for each of the next three days is $\\frac{3}{4}$, then the probability that it won't snow for each of the next three days is $\\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nTo find the probability that it won't snow at all during the next three days, we multiply the probability of each day not snowing together: $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$. \n\nSo the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",

So if the probability of snow for each of the next three days is $\\frac{3}{4}$, then the probability that it won't snow for each of the next three days is $\\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nTo find the probability that it won't snow at all during the next three days, we multiply the probability of each day not snowing together: $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}$. \n\nSo the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
