    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days, we need to consider the probability that it will not snow on each individual day. \n\nSince the probability of snow for each day is $\\frac{3}{4}$, the probability of no snow on each day is $1-\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is the product of the probabilities that it will not snow on each individual day: $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{64}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
