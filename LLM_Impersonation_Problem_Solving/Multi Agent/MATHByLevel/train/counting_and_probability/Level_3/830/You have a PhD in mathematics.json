    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
