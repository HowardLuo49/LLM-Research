    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. You have $5$ red shirts, $5$ green shirts, $6$ pairs of pants, $8$ green hats and $8$ red hats, all of which are distinct. How many outfits can you make consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat without having the same color of shirts and hats?",
    "solution": "Consider two cases:\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: the person wears a red shirt and a green hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: the person wears a green shirt and a red hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\nSumming up the two cases, we have a total possibility of $240+240 = \\boxed{480}$ outfits.\n\nNotice that we can tackle this without considering cases. The person has $10$ choices for shirts. After a shirt is chosen, the person has $6$ choices for pants, but only $8$ choices of hat, since the hat color cannot match the shirt color, and no matter what shirt color is chosen, there are $8$ hats of the other color to choose from. So, there are $10\\times 6\\times 8 =\\boxed{480}$ outfits.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many outfits we can make, let's break it down step by step like this:\n\nStep 1: Choose a shirt. \nWe have 5 red shirts and 5 green shirts, but we don't want to have the same color of shirt and hat. So we can choose one of the 5 red shirts, which leaves us with 4 green shirts to choose from.\n\nStep 2: Choose a pair of pants. \nWe have 6 pairs of pants to choose from.\n\nStep 3: Choose a hat.\nSince we chose a red shirt, we can't choose a red hat. We have 8 green hats left to choose from.\n\nNow, we can figure out the total number of outfits by multiplying the number of choices at each step:\n\n$5$ (choices for shirt) $\\times 6$ (choices for pants) $\\times 4$ (choices for hat) = $\\boxed{120}$ outfits.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 480?: To figure out how many outfits we can make, let's break it down step by step like this:\n\nStep 1: Choose a shirt. \nWe have 5 red shirts and 5 green shirts, but we don't want to have the same color of shirt and hat.
