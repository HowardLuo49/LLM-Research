    "solution": "We could have either two greens or two reds. The probability of drawing two greens is $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{9}{25}$. The probability of drawing two reds is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{4}{25}$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{9}{25} + \\dfrac{4}{25} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{25}}$.",
