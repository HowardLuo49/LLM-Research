    "solution": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many combinations of coins we can use to make 25 cents, let's start by thinking about the biggest coin we can use - a dime. Since a dime is worth 10 cents, we can use at most 2 dimes in our combination to make 25 cents.\n\nNow let's think about nickel. A nickel is worth 5 cents, so we can use at most 5 nickels in our combination. That would make 25 cents.\n\nFinally, let's think about pennies. We can use up to 25 pennies to make 25 cents.\n\nNow let's try out all the combinations!\n\n- 2 dimes and 1 nickel\n- 2 dimes and 5 pennies\n- 1 dime, 2 nickels, and 5 pennies\n- 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 10 pennies\n- 1 dime and 15 pennies\n- 3 nickels and 10 pennies\n- 2 nickels and 15 pennies\n- 1 nickel and 20 pennies\n- 25 pennies\n\nSo, there are 9 different combinations of pennies, nickels, and dimes that we can use to make 25 cents. Yay!",
