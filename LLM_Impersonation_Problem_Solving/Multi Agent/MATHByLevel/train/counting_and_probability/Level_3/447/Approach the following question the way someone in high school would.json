    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from the box, we can use combinations. \n\nSince the order in which he selects the crayons does not matter, we can use the combination formula: \n\nnCr = n! / r!(n - r)!\n\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons in the box) and r = 4 (number of crayons Karl selects). \n\nTherefore, the number of ways Karl can select four crayons from a box of 12 differently colored crayons is:\n\n12C4 = 12! / 4!(12 - 4)!\n12C4 = 495\n\nSo there are 495 ways Karl can select four crayons from the box.",
