    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. There are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! Karl can pick any of the 12 crayons for his first choice. After that, he will have 11 different crayons left to choose from for his second choice. Then, he will have 10 crayons left for his third choice and finally, 9 crayons left for his fourth choice. So, to find out how many ways Karl can choose four crayons, we need to multiply 12 by 11 by 10 by 9. \n\nLet's count: 12 crayons for the first choice, 11 crayons for the second choice, 10 crayons for the third choice, 9 crayons for the fourth choice. \n\nNow let's multiply: 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 = **11,880 ways!** Wow, that's a lot of ways Karl can choose his crayons!",
