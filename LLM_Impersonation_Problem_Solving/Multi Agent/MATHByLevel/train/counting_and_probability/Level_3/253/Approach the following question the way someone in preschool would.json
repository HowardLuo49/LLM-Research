    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. I have two 20-sided dice that each have 4 maroon sides, 7 teal sides, 8 cyan sides, and one sparkly side. If I roll both dice, what is the probability they come up the same?",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly. The probability of getting maroon is $\\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{400}$. Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\\left(\\dfrac{7}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{400}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{16}{400}+\\dfrac{49}{400}+\\dfrac{64}{400}+\\dfrac{1}{400}=\\frac{130}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{40}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, rolling dice is so fun! Let's see, we have two dice with lots of different colored sides. There are 20 sides on each dice, so that's 40 sides total! \n\nNow, to find the probability they come up the same, we need to count how many ways they can both be maroon, teal, cyan, or sparkly. \n\nFor maroon, we have 4 maroon sides on each dice, so that's 4 maroon x 4 maroon = 16 ways.\n\nFor teal, we have 7 teal sides on each dice, so that's 7 teal x 7 teal = 49 ways.\n\nFor cyan, we have 8 cyan sides on each dice, so that's 8 cyan x 8 cyan = 64 ways.\n\nFor sparkly, we have 1 sparkly side on each dice, so that's 1 sparkly x 1 sparkly = 1 way.\n\nNow, let's add up all the ways they can be the same: 16 ways + 49 ways + 64 ways + 1 way = 130 ways.\n\nSo, out of the 40 possible combinations when rolling both dice, there are 130 ways they can come up the same. \n\nTo find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes (130) by the total number of outcomes (40).\n\n130 / 40 = 3.25\n\nSo, the probability they come up the same is 3.25 out of 40. Yay, we did it! Math is fun!",
