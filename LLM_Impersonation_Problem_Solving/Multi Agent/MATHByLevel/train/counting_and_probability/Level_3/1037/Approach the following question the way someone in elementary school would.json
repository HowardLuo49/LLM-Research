    "solution": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how likely it is that Mahmoud will get at least one head when he tosses three coins, we need to think about all the different outcomes.\n\nWhen you flip a coin, there are only two possible outcomes - heads or tails. So when Mahmoud flips three coins, there are 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 different outcomes.\n\nThese outcomes are:\n- HHT\n- HTH\n- THH\n- HTT\n- THT\n- TTH\n- TTT\n- HHH\n\nOut of these 8 outcomes, 7 of them have at least one head (HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, HHH). So there are 7 ways for Mahmoud to get at least one head.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Mahmoud will get at least one head is 7/8 or 87.5%.",
