(Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break this problem down into smaller subproblems to make it more manageable. We can first consider the arrangements of the chickens, dogs, and cats separately.\n\nFor the chickens, we have 4 chickens that need to be placed in a row of 4 cages. There are 4! ways to arrange the chickens in these cages.\n\nFor the dogs, we have 2 dogs that need to be placed in a row of 2 cages. There are 2! ways to arrange the dogs in these cages.\n\nFor the cats, we have 5 cats that need to be placed in a row of 5 cages. There are 5! ways to arrange the cats in these cages.\n\nNow, we can consider the different possible arrangements of the chickens, dogs, and cats together. Since these animals are of different species, we can simply multiply the number of ways to arrange each group of animals to find the total number of ways of arranging all 11 animals. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways all the animals can be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all animals of each type are in adjacent cages, is given by:\n\n4! * 2! * 5! = 2880 ways.",
