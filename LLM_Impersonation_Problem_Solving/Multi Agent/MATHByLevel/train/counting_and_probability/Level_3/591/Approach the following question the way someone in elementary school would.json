    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A club has $5$ members from each of $3$ different schools, for a total of $15$ members. How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
    "solution": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have 3 different schools with 5 members each, making a total of 15 members in the club. First, we need to choose which school will host the meeting. There are 3 options for this.\n\nNext, the host school will send 2 representatives to the meeting. Since the host school has 5 members, this means there are \n\n$\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 representatives from that school.\n\nThen, each of the other two schools will send 1 representative. Each of those schools has 5 members, so there are $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways to choose the representative from each of those schools.\n\nFinally, we need to multiply all these possibilities together to find the total number of ways to arrange the presidency meeting:\n\n$3 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 750$\n\nSo, there are 750 possible ways to arrange the presidency meeting with these conditions.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 750?: Ok, so we have 3 different schools with 5 members each, making a total of 15 members in the club.
