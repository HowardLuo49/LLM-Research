There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
