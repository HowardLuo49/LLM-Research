If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question using the concept of combinations and the fundamental principle of counting.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants from the final 5. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\nnCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of possibilities and r is the number of choices. In this case, n = 5 and r = 2:\n\n5C2 = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 total ways to choose 2 contestants from the final 5.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 female contestants from the 3 female contestants. This can also be calculated using combinations:\n\n3C2 = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3\n\nTherefore, there are 3 ways to choose 2 female contestants from the 3 female contestants.\n\nFinally, the probability of choosing 2 female contestants can be calculated by dividing the number of ways to choose 2 female contestants by the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants:\n\nP(both are female) = Number of ways to choose 2 female contestants / Total number of ways to choose 2 contestants\n                             = 3 / 10\n                             = 3/10\n\nTherefore, the probability that both chosen contestants are female is 3/10, expressed as a common fraction.",
