    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Of the final five contestants in a television show, three are female and two are male. If two are chosen randomly to be the final contestants, what is the probability that both are female? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of contestants.  Exactly ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ of these are female pairs.  The probability that both of the final contestants are female is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that both final contestants are female, we first need to find how many ways we can choose 2 contestants from the 5 total contestants.\n\nThere are 5 contestants total, so there are 5 choices for the first contestant and 4 choices for the second contestant. This means there are 5 x 4 = 20 ways to choose 2 contestants from the 5 total contestants.\n\nNext, we need to find how many ways we can choose 2 female contestants from the 3 female contestants. There are 3 female contestants, so there are 3 choices for the first female contestant and 2 choices for the second female contestant. This means there are 3 x 2 = 6 ways to choose 2 female contestants from the 3 female contestants.\n\nFinally, to find the probability that both final contestants are female, we divide the number of ways to choose 2 female contestants by the total number of ways to choose 2 contestants.\n\n6 ways to choose 2 female contestants / 20 total ways to choose 2 contestants = 6/20 = 3/10\n\nSo, the probability that both final contestants are female is 3/10.",
