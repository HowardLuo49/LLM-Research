    "solution": "We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1. A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$. There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\\frac{1}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Yay! Let's play with dice! We need to see what numbers we can get when we roll the dice. We can get numbers from 1 to 6 on each die. \n\nNow, we need to think about what numbers we can get when we add the numbers on the two dice. We want the sum to be greater than three. That means we need to look at all possible combinations that give us a sum greater than three.\n\nLet's count them together! We can get a sum greater than three when we roll a 2 and a 2, a 2 and a 3, a 3 and a 2, a 1 and a 3, a 3 and a 1, and a 1 and a 4, or a 2 and a 4, or a 4 and a 2, or a 1 and a 5, or a 2 and a 5, or a 5 and a 1, or a 1 and a 6, or a 2 and a 6, or a 6 and a 2, or a 3 and a 4, or a 4 and a 3, or a 3 and a 5, or a 5 and a 3, or a 4 and a 5, or a 5 and a 4, or a 6 and a 3, or a 3 and a 6, or a 6 and a 4, or a 4 and a 6. \n\nThat's a lot of combinations! So, the probability that the sum is greater than three is the number of ways we can get a sum greater than three divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count how many total possible outcomes we can get when we roll two dice. We can get a total of 36 different outcomes because each die has 6 sides and there are 6 possible numbers on the second die for each number on the first die.\n\nSo, the probability of getting a sum greater than three is the number of ways we can get a sum greater than three (which is 25) divided by the total possible outcomes (which is 36). \n\nSo, the probability is 25/36.
