    "solution": "We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1. A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$. There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\\frac{1}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the sum of two dice is greater than three, we first need to determine all the possible outcomes when two dice are tossed. There are 36 possible outcomes when two dice are thrown, as each die has 6 faces and there are 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die.\n\nNext, we need to determine the outcomes where the sum is greater than three. We can do this by listing all the possible outcomes where the sum is greater than three: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6).\n\nThere are a total of 30 outcomes where the sum is greater than three. Therefore, the probability that the sum is greater than three is:\n\nP(sum > 3) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes\n\nP(sum > 3) = 30 / 36\n\nP(sum > 3) = 5 / 6\n\nThus, the probability that the sum of two dice is greater than three is 5/6.",
