In four of the twelve, the product is odd: $1\\times 1$, $1\\times 3$, $3\\times 1$, $3\\times 3$.

The probability of odd is $\\frac{1}{2}$ on Spinner $A$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ on Spinner $B$. So the probability of an odd product is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of an even product, then, is $1-\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
