    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we need to see how many ways we can arrange the tiles to make XOXOX and then divide that by the total number of possible arrangements.\n\nFirst, let's see how many ways we can arrange the 5 tiles. There are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 5x4x3x2x1 = 120.\n\nNext, let's see how many ways we can arrange the X tiles among themselves. There are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 3x2x1 = 6.\n\nThen, let's see how many ways we can arrange the O tiles among themselves. There are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 2x1 = 2.\n\nSo, the number of ways we can arrange the tiles to make XOXOX is 6x2 = 12.\n\nNow, we divide the number of ways to arrange XOXOX by the total number of possible arrangements: 12 / 120 = 1/10.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting the arrangement XOXOX is 1/10.",
