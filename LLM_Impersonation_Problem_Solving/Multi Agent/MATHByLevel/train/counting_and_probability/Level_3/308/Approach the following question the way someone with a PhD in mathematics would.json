    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of the desired arrangement XOXOX, we first need to determine the total number of possible arrangements that can be made with the five tiles. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations of a set of objects, which is n!/(n-k)!, where n is the total number of objects and k is the number of objects being arranged.\n\nIn this case, there are 5 tiles in total (3 X's and 2 O's), so n=5. We want to arrange all 5 tiles, so k=5. Therefore, the total number of possible arrangements is 5!/(5-5)! = 5! = 120.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways the desired arrangement XOXOX can occur. There are 3 ways to choose the position of the first X, 2 ways to choose the position of the O, 2 ways to choose the position of the second X, 1 way to choose the position of the final O, and 1 way to choose the position of the third X. Therefore, the number of ways the desired arrangement can occur is 3*2*2*1*1 = 12.\n\nFinally, the probability of the desired arrangement XOXOX occurring is the number of ways it can occur divided by the total number of possible arrangements, which is 12/120 = 1/10 = 0.1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the arrangement reading XOXOX is 0.1.",
