    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the tiles first. We have 3 X tiles and 2 O tiles. Now let's look at the arrangement XOXOX. We see that the first tile can be an X, the second a O, the third a X, the fourth a O and the fifth a X.\n\nNow let's see how many different ways we can arrange the tiles. We can use the formula for permutations to calculate this. The number of permutations of n things taken r at a time is given by nPr = n! / (n-r)!. In this case, we have 5 tiles taken 5 at a time, so the number of permutations is 5! / (5-5)! = 5! / 0! = 5!.\n\nNext, let's count the number of ways we can arrange the X and O tiles to match the XOXOX arrangement. There is only 1 way to arrange them in the desired order.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting the arrangement XOXOX is 1/5. Yay! We did it!",
