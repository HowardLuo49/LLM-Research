    "solution": "By Pascal's Identity, we have $\\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{8}{4} = \\binom{9}{4}$.  However, we also have $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{9-4} = \\binom{9}{5}$.  There are no other values of $n$ such that $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{n}$, so the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest integer $n$ for which $\\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{8}{4} = \\binom{9}{n}$, we can start by simplifying the expressions on both sides.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\binom{8}{3}$ and $\\binom{8}{4}$:\n$$\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8\\times7\\times6}{3\\times2\\times1} = 56$$\n$$\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = \\frac{8\\times7\\times6\\times5}{4\\times3\\times2\\times1} = 70$$\n\nNext, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n$$\\binom{9}{n} = \\frac{9!}{n!(9-n)!} = \\frac{9\\times8\\times7}{n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values we calculated for $\\binom{8}{3}$ and $\\binom{8}{4}$ into the expression for $\\binom{9}{n}$:\n$$56 + 70 = \\frac{9\\times8\\times7}{n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)}$$\n$$126 = \\frac{9\\times8\\times7}{n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)}$$\n$$126 = \\frac{504}{n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)}$$\n\nTo find the largest integer $n$ that satisfies this equation, we can start plugging in values for $n$ and see where the equality holds.
