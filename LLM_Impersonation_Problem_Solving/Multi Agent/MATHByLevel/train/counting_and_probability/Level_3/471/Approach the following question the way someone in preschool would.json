    "solution": "By Pascal's Identity, we have $\\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{8}{4} = \\binom{9}{4}$.  However, we also have $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{9-4} = \\binom{9}{5}$.  There are no other values of $n$ such that $\\binom{9}{4} = \\binom{9}{n}$, so the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",

Now, let's find out how many ways we can choose some number of things out of 9 things. Hmm, to find the largest number for $n$, let's try adding up our 56 and 70 to see if we can make another number. We add them up to get 126. But you know what? We can also write 126 as $\\binom{9}{3}$! So the largest integer $n$ is 3. Yay, we did it!",
