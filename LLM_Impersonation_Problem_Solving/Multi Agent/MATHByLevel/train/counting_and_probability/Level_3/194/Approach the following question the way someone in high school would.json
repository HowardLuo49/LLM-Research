    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. In how many ways can 6 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet? (Note that two arrangements are the same if one can be rotated or reflected to produce the other.)",
    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways that 6 distinct beads can be placed on a bracelet, we need to consider the rotations and reflections of the bracelet. \n\nFirst, let's count the total number of ways to arrange the beads without considering rotations or reflections. We have 6 choices for the first bead, 5 choices for the second bead, 4 choices for the third bead, and so on until 1 choice for the last bead. This gives us a total of 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720 ways to arrange the beads.\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that rotations and reflections of the bracelet should be considered the same. To do this, we divide the total number of ways by the number of ways the bracelet can be rotated or reflected. Since the bracelet can be rotated 6 times (once for each bead) and reflected once, there are a total of 6 * 2 = 12 ways to represent the same arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct ways to place the 6 beads on the bracelet is 720 / 12 = 60. \n\nSo there are 60 different ways to place 6 distinct beads on a bracelet, taking into account rotations and reflections.",
