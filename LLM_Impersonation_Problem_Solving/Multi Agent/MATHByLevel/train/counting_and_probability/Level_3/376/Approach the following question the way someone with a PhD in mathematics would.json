    "solution": "After we choose the first vertex, there are 7 ways to choose the second.  There are only 2 of these that are adjacent to the first vertex, so the probability the two vertices are adjacent is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We begin by calculating the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct vertices from an octagon, which has 8 vertices. This can be done using the combination formula, which yields 8 choose 2 = 28 ways.\n\nNext, we determine the number of ways to choose 2 adjacent vertices from an octagon. Since each vertex is adjacent to 2 other vertices, there are a total of 8 ways to choose 2 adjacent vertices.\n\nTherefore, the probability of choosing 2 adjacent vertices from an octagon at random is given by the ratio of the number of ways to choose 2 adjacent vertices to the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct vertices. \n\nProbability = Number of ways to choose 2 adjacent vertices / Number of ways to choose 2 distinct vertices\nProbability = 8 / 28\nProbability = 2 / 7\n\nTherefore, the probability that 2 randomly chosen vertices from an octagon are adjacent is 2/7.",
