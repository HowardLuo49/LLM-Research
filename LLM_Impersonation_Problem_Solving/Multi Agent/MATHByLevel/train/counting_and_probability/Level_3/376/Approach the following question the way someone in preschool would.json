    "solution": "After we choose the first vertex, there are 7 ways to choose the second.  There are only 2 of these that are adjacent to the first vertex, so the probability the two vertices are adjacent is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$.",

We want to know the chance that these two corners are next to each other.\n\nTo figure this out, let's count how many pairs of corners are next to each other out of all the possible pairs. We know that there are 8 corners in total, so there are a total of 8 choose 2 = 28 pairs of corners we could pick.\n\nNow, let's count how many pairs of corners are next to each other. If we start at one corner and count around the octagon, we will see that there are 8 pairs of adjacent corners.\n\nSo, the probability that the two corners we pick are next to each other is 8/28 = 2/7. Yay, we solved the problem!",
