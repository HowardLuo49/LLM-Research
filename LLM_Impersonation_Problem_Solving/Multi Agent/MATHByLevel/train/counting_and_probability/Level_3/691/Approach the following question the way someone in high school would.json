    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this question down step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to find out how many ways we can choose the first letter to be either G or K. Since there are only two options, we have 2 choices. \n\nNext, we need to choose the last letter to be T. Since T is fixed, we have only 1 choice for the last letter. \n\nNow, we need to fill in the three remaining slots in the license plate. Since we cannot have the letter S and we cannot repeat any letters, we have:\n\n9 choices for the second slot (all letters except G,K,T,S),\n8 choices for the third slot (all letters except the one we used in the second slot and T), and\n7 choices for the fourth slot (all letters except the two we used in the second and third slot and T). \n\nSo, the total number of license plates that meet all the given conditions is:\n\n2 (choices for the first letter) x 1 (choices for the last letter) x 9 x 8 x 7 = 1,008\n\nTherefore, there are 1,008 possible license plates of five letters that meet all the given conditions.",
