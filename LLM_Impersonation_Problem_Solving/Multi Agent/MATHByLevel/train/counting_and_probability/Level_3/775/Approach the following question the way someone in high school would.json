What is the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$. The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$. Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so for the first part, we want to find the probability of getting exactly 2 heads out of 3 flips. To do this, we can use the binomial probability formula, which is:\n\nP(x successes in n trials) = nCk * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k),\n\nwhere n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes we want, p is the probability of success on any given trial, and nCk represents \"n choose k\" or the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials.\n\nFor our case, n = 3, k = 2, and p = 0.5 (since a fair coin has a 0.5 probability of landing heads up). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(2 heads out of 3 flips) = 3C2 * (0.5)^2 * (0.5) = 3 * (0.25) * 0.5 = 0.375.\n\nNext, we want to find the probability of getting exactly 3 heads out of 3 flips. Since there's only one way this can happen (getting heads on all 3 flips), it's just the probability of getting heads 3 times in a row, which is:\n\nP(3 heads out of 3 flips) = (0.5)^3 = 0.125.\n\nNow, to find the positive difference between these two probabilities, we subtract the second probability from the first:\n\n0.375 - 0.125 = 0.25.\n\nSo, the positive difference between the probability of getting exactly 2 heads out of 3 flips and the probability of getting 3 heads out of 3 flips is 1/4 or 0.25.",
