What is the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability that a fair coin lands heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips is $p_1=\\binom{3}{2}(1/2)^2(1/2)=3/8$. The probability that a fair coin lands heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is $p_2=(1/2)^3=1/8$. Finally, we have $p_1-p_2=2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips, we need to consider the number of ways this can happen. There are a total of 3 ways for exactly 2 heads to occur in 3 flips: HHT, HTH, and THH. Each of these outcomes has probability (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of getting exactly 2 heads in 3 flips is 3*(1/8) = 3/8.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of getting 3 heads in 3 flips is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\nThe positive difference between the two probabilities is 3/8 - 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the positive difference between the probability of a fair coin landing heads up exactly 2 times out of 3 flips and the probability of a fair coin landing heads up 3 times out of 3 flips is 1/4.",
