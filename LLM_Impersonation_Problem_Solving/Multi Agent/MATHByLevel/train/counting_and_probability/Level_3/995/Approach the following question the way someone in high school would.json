Each team has an equal chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Precisely one team must win at least four games.  Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games out of seven, we need to consider the possible outcomes where they win 4, 5, 6, or 7 games.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes in a best out of 7 series. Each game can either be won by the Badgers or the Cougars, so there are 2 possibilities for each game. Therefore, there is a total of 2^7 = 128 possible outcomes for the series.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of outcomes where the Badgers win at least four games. To win exactly 4 games, the Badgers can win any 4 out of the 7 games, which can be calculated using the combination formula: C(7, 4) = 35. \nFor winning 5 games: C(7, 5) = 21\nFor winning 6 games: C(7, 6) = 7\nAnd for winning all 7 games: C(7, 7) = 1\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where the Badgers win at least four games is: 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64\n\nThe probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is then: (number of favorable outcomes)/(total number of outcomes) = 64/128 = 1/2\n\nSo, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games in the series is 1/2.",
