So, C(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7 - 4)!) = 35.\\n\\nSimilarly, the number of ways the Badgers can win exactly five games is C(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * (7 - 5)!) = 21, and the number of ways they can win exactly six games is C(7, 6) = 7! / (6! * (7 - 6)!) = 7. The number of ways they can win all seven games is simply 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of ways the Badgers can win at least four games is 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 64.\\n\\nSo, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games is 64/128 = 1/2.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games in the series is 1/2.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712181620, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=340, prompt_tokens=62, total_tokens=402))",
