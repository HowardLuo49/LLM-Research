    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we have seven people and only six seats at the table. That means one person won't get a seat. \n\nNow, if we think about it, there are actually six ways to arrange the six people at the table because we can rotate the seating arrangement and it will still be the same. \n\nSo, we have 6 different ways to choose the six people and seat them at the table.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 840?: Alright, so we have seven people and only six seats at the table. That means one person won't get a seat. \n\nNow, if we think about it, there are actually six ways to arrange the six people at the table because we can rotate the seating arrangement and it will still be the same. \n\nSo, we have 6 different ways to choose the six people and seat them at the table.",
