    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to construct 4-letter words with at least one vowel from the set of letters {A,B,C,D,E}.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of 4-letter words that can be constructed from these 5 letters, without any restrictions. This can be done by using the formula for permutations with repetition, which is given by:\n\nn^r\n\nwhere n is the number of available choices (5 letters in this case), and r is the number of letters in the word (4 letters in this case). So, we have:\n\n5^4 = 625 total 4-letter words\n\nNext, we calculate the number of 4-letter words that can be constructed using only the consonants {B,C,D}. This can be done in the same way as before, which gives us:\n\n3^4 = 81 words using only consonants\n\nTo find the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel, we subtract the number of words using only consonants from the total number of words:\n\n625 - 81 = 544 words with at least one vowel\n\nTherefore, there are 544 4-letter words that can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E with at least one vowel.",
