    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
