    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Interior numbers begin in the third row of Pascal's Triangle. The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! In the fourth row, we have 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 interior numbers that add up to 6. In the fifth row, we have 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16 interior numbers that add up to 14. Now, to find the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row, we need to find a pattern. Each row adds one more interior number than the previous row. So, the sixth row will have 16 + 5 = 21 interior numbers, and the seventh row will have 21 + 6 = 27 interior numbers. \n\nTo find the sum, we can use the formula (n-2)\u00b2, where n is the number of interior numbers in the row. So, for the seventh row, it would be (27-2)\u00b2 = 25\u00b2 = 625. Yay, we did it! The sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row is 625!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 62?: Hmm, let's see! In the fourth row, we have 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 interior numbers that add up to 6.
