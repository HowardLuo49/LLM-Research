Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, what is the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of the three children in a family including at least one boy and one girl, we can use the concept of complementary probability. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes for the gender of the three children. Each child can be either a boy or a girl, so there are 2 possibilities for each child. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways in which the three children can include at least one boy and one girl. There are 3 possible scenarios in which this can happen: \n1) Boy, Boy, Girl\n2) Boy, Girl, Boy\n3) Girl, Boy, Boy\n\nEach of these scenarios has a probability of (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nSince there are 3 such scenarios, the total probability of having at least one boy and one girl is 3/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl is 3/8.",
