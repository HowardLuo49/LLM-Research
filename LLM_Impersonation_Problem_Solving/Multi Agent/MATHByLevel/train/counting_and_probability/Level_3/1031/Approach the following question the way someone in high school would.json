    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Jason is trying to remember the five digit combination to his safe.  He knows that he only used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that every even digit was followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit was followed by an even digit.  How many possible combinations does Jason need to try?",
    "solution": "Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even.  If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit.  Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit.  Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on.  This would be a total of: $$3\\times2\\times3\\times2\\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit.  There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\\times3\\times2\\times3\\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\\boxed{180}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so to figure this out, let's break it down. Since Jason used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that means there are 5 options for each digit in the combination. \n\nNext, we know that every even digit must be followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit must be followed by an even digit. That means the first digit can be any of the 5 digits. \n\nFor the second digit, since the first digit can be any of the 5 digits, there are 2 options for the second digit (since it must be the opposite of the first digit in terms of even or odd).\n\nFor the third digit, since the second digit must be the opposite of the first digit, there are again 2 options.\n\nThe same goes for the fourth digit, which also has 2 options.\n\nAnd finally, for the fifth digit, since it must be the opposite of the fourth digit, there are 2 options.\n\nSo, to find the total number of possible combinations, we multiply the number of options for each digit together: 5 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 80\n\nTherefore, Jason would need to try 80 different combinations to figure out his safe's combination.",
