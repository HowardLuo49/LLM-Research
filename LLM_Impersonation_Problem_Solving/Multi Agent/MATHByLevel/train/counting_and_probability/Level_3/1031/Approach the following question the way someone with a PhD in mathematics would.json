    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jason is trying to remember the five digit combination to his safe.  He knows that he only used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that every even digit was followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit was followed by an even digit.  How many possible combinations does Jason need to try?",
    "solution": "Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even.  If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit.  Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit.  Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on.  This would be a total of: $$3\\times2\\times3\\times2\\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit.  There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\\times3\\times2\\times3\\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\\boxed{180}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Jason used digits 1 through 5, which means there are 5 options for each digit in the combination.\n\nNext, we can determine the possible arrangements based on the condition that every even digit is followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit is followed by an even digit.\n\nLet's consider the possible patterns:\n- If an even digit is in the first position, there are 2 choices for that digit (2 or 4), and then 3 choices for the odd digit that follows (1, 3, or 5). So, there are 2*3 = 6 possibilities for this pattern.\n- If an odd digit is in the first position, there are 3 choices for that digit (1, 3, or 5), and then 2 choices for the even digit that follows (2 or 4). So, there are 3*2 = 6 possibilities for this pattern.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible combinations that Jason needs to try is the sum of these two possibilities: 6 + 6 = 12.\n\nTherefore, Jason needs to try 12 possible combinations to open his safe.",
