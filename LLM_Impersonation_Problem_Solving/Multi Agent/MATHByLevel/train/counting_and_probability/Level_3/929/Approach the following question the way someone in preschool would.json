    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Our water polo team has 15 members.  I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's count together! We need to choose 7 players from our 15 team members to be in our starting team. First, let's choose our goalie from the 15 players. We have 15 choices for this. Then, we need to choose 6 more players to complete our team. We have 14 players left to choose from for the first position, then 13 for the next position, and so on, until we have chosen all 7 players.\n\nSo, the total number of ways we can choose our starting team is:\n\n15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 = 32,274,000\n\nSo, we have 32,274,000 ways to choose our starting water polo team!",
