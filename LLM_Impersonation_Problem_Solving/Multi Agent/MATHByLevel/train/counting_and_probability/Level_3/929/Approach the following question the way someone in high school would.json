    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Our water polo team has 15 members.  I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways you can choose your starting team, you can think about it like this: first, you need to pick a goalie from the 15 players on the team, so there are 15 options for that. Then, you need to pick 6 more players from the remaining 14 players. Since the order in which these players are chosen doesn't matter, you can use the combination formula.\n\nThe formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of items to choose from and r is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 14 (since we already chose the goalie) and r = 6.\n\nSo, the number of ways you can choose your starting team is:\n\n15C1 * 14C6 = (15! / 1!14!) * (14! / 6!8!) = 15 * 3003 = 45045\n\nTherefore, there are 45,045 ways you can choose your starting team from the 15 members of the water polo team.",
