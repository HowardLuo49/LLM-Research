    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Suppose I have a bag with 12 slips of paper in it.  Some of the slips have a 2 on them, and the rest have a 7 on them.  If the expected value of the number shown on a slip randomly drawn from the bag is $3.25$, then how many slips have a 2?",
    "solution": "We let $x$ denote the number of slips with a 2 written on them.  (This is the usual tactic of letting a variable denote what we're trying to solve for in the problem.)  Then there are $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them. The probability of drawing a 2 is $\\frac{x}{12}$ and the probability of drawing a 7 is $\\frac{12-x}{12}$, so the expected value of the number drawn is $$ E = \\frac{x}{12}(2) + \\frac{12-x}{12}(7) = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$But we are given that $E=3.25$, so we have the equation $$ 3.25 = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$This simplifies to $39 = 84 - 5x$, which means that $x = 9$. Thus $\\boxed{9}$ of the 12 slips have a 2 written on them.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to remember that expected value is like the average of all the possible numbers. We know that the total number of slips is 12. Let's say there are $x$ slips with a 2 on them.\n\nTo calculate the expected value, we need to figure out the total value of all the slips. If $x$ slips have a 2 on them, then there must be $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them. \n\nThe total value of all the slips can be calculated by:\n$2x + 7(12-x) = 3.25 \\times 12$\n\n$2x + 84 - 7x = 39$\n\n$-5x + 84 = 39$\n\n$-5x = -45$\n\n$x = 9$\n\nSo, there are 9 slips with a 2 on them in the bag.",
