    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Bertha has 6 daughters and no sons. Some of her daughters have 6 daughters, and the rest have none. Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of daughters that have daughters as x, and the number of daughters that do not have daughters as 6-x. Therefore, the total number of daughters Bertha has is 6. \n\nGiven that each daughter who has daughters have 6 daughters each, the total number of granddaughters Bertha has is 6x. \n\nTherefore, the total number of daughters and granddaughters Bertha has is 6 + 6x + x = 30. \n\nSolving this equation gives us x = 3. Therefore, Bertha has 3 daughters who have daughters and 3 daughters who do not have daughters. \n\nHence, the total number of daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters is 3 + 3 = 6.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 26?: Let's denote the number of daughters that have daughters as x, and the number of daughters that do not have daughters as 6-x. Therefore, the total number of daughters Bertha has is 6. \n\nGiven that each daughter who has daughters have 6 daughters each, the total number of granddaughters Bertha has is 6x. \n\nTherefore, the total number of daughters and granddaughters Bertha has is 6 + 6x + x = 30. \n\nSolving this equation gives us x = 3. Therefore, Bertha has 3 daughters who have daughters and 3 daughters who do not have daughters. \n\nHence, the total number of daughters and granddaughters who have no daughters is 3 + 3 = 6.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. The final solution obtained is not equal to 26, it is 6.",
