    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",

There are 6 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) on each die, so the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers out of 6 is given by the combination formula:\\n\\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\\n\\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15\\n\\nFor the two even numbers to appear on exactly two dice, we need to multiply this by the number of ways of choosing 2 dice out of 5:\\n\\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of ways to have exactly two dice show an even number is 15 * 10 = 150.\\n\\nSo, the probability of exactly two of the dice showing an even number is:\\n\\n150 / 248,832 \u2248 0.0006 or 0.06%.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180109, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=293, prompt_tokens=55, total_tokens=348))",
