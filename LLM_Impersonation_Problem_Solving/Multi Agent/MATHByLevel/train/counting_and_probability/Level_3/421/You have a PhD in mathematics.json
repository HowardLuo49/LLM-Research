    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",

So, the probability of 2 dice showing even numbers is:\\nProbability of 2 dice showing even numbers = (6/12)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4\\n\\nFor the other 3 dice that show odd numbers, there are 6 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) on each die. So, the probability of 3 dice showing odd numbers is:\\nProbability of 3 dice showing odd numbers = (6/12)^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\\n\\nFinally, we can calculate the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number by multiplying the probabilities of the two different scenarios above:\\nProbability = Number of ways to choose 2 dice * Probability of 2 dice showing even numbers * Probability of 3 dice showing odd numbers\\nProbability = 10 * 1/4 * 1/8\\nProbability = 10/32\\nProbability = 5/16\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is 5/16.\", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180117, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=382, prompt_tokens=56, total_tokens=438))",
