    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",

So, the total number of ways to get exactly two dice showing an even number is 15 * (6 choose 2)* 6^2 = 27,000.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two dice showing an even number is 27,000 / 248,832 \u2248 0.1087 or about 10.87%.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180113, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=262, prompt_tokens=55, total_tokens=317))",
