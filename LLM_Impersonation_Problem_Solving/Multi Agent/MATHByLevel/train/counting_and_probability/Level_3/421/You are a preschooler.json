    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",

Each of the chosen 2 dice can show any even number from 1 to 12 (6 even numbers in total), and the remaining 3 dice must show an odd number (6 odd numbers in total).\\n\\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is C(5,2) * 6^2 * 6^3.\\n\\nNow we can calculate the probability:\\n\\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\\nProbability = [C(5,2) * 6^2 * 6^3] / 12^5\\n\\nCalculating the values, we get:\\nC(5,2) = 10\\n6^2 = 36\\n6^3 = 216\\n12^5 = 248832\\n\\nSo, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is:\\nProbability = (10 * 36 * 216) / 248832\\nProbability = 6480 / 248832\\nProbability \u2248 0.02606\\n\\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is approximately 0.02606 or 2.606%.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180104, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=328, prompt_tokens=55, total_tokens=383))",
