    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Two different  numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. What is the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive. There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total. So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{15}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater, we need to count the number of ways the difference can be $2$ or more, and then divide by the total number of ways we can choose two numbers.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total number of ways we can choose two numbers from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. There are 7 numbers to choose from for the first number, and then 6 numbers left to choose from for the second number. So there are $7 \\times 6 = 42$ total ways to choose two numbers.\n\nNext, let's count the number of ways the difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater. We can do this by listing out the pairs of numbers that satisfy this condition: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), ..., (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, 7), (3, 5), ..., (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7). There are 19 such pairs.\n\nSo the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater is $\\frac{19}{42}$, which is our final answer.",
