    "solution": "It may not be obvious how to proceed with this problem, but a little experimentation might lead you to determine the possible values of $m.$\n\nSince $0 < m^2 < 22,$ we can see that $m$ must be one of $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ or $4.$ So let's use these as our cases.\n\nCase 1: When $m=1$, we must have $n < 22-1 = 21.$ Thus there are $20$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=1.$\nCase 2: When $m=2,$ we must have $n < 22-4 = 18.$ Thus there are $17$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=2.$\nCase 3: When $m=3,$ we must have $n < 22-9 = 13.$ Thus there are $12$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=3.$\nCase 4: When $m=4,$ we must have $n < 22-16 = 6.$ Thus there are $5$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=4.$\n\nSo to get the total number of pairs of positive integers satisfying the inequality, we add up all of our possible cases, and see that there are $20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = \\boxed{54}$ possible pairs.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ that satisfy $m^2 + n < 22$, we need to consider all possible values of $m$ and $n$ that satisfy the inequality.\n\nFirst, we can consider the possible values of $m$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $m$ is $1$. We can then increment $m$ and find the largest possible value of $m$ such that $m^2 + n < 22$.\n\nFor $m=1$, we have $1^2 + n < 22$, which simplifies to $n < 21$. So, when $m=1$, there are $21$ possible values of $n$ that satisfy the inequality.\n\nFor $m=2$, we have $2^2 + n < 22$, which simplifies to $n < 18$. So, when $m=2$, there are $17$ possible values of $n$ that satisfy the inequality.\n\nSimilarly, for $m=3$ to $5$, we have $m^2 + n < 22$ simplifying to $n < 13, 8, 3$ respectively.\n\nThus, the number of pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ that satisfy $m^2 + n < 22$ is the sum of the number of possible values of $n$ for each value of $m$:\n\n$21 + 17 + 13 + 8 + 3 = 62$\n\nTherefore, there are $62$ pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ that satisfy the inequality $m^2 + n < 22$.",
