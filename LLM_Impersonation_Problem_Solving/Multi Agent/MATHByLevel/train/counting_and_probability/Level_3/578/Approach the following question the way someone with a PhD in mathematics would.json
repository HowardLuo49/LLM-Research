    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If three coins are tossed at the same time, what is the probability of getting two tails and one head? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The probability of getting two tails followed by one head is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  The probability of getting a tail followed by a head followed by a tail is also $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$.  Finally, the probability of getting a head followed by two tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{1}{8}$ as well.  In total, the probability of getting two tails and one head is $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of getting two tails and one head when three coins are tossed, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes. When three coins are tossed, each coin can land in either a heads or tails position, resulting in 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of outcomes where exactly two tails and one head are obtained. There are three ways this can occur:\n1. Tails, Tails, Head\n2. Tails, Head, Tails\n3. Head, Tails, Tails\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting two tails and one head is 3 favorable outcomes out of 8 total outcomes. This can be expressed as a fraction as 3/8. Thus, the probability of getting two tails and one head when three coins are tossed is 3/8.",
