    "solution": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To compute \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!},\\] we first note that \\[(N+1)! = (N+1)N!.\\] Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as \\[\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)(N)!} = \\frac{N}{N+1}.\\] This can be further simplified to \\[\\frac{N}{N+1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{N+1}.\\] Thus, the final result is \\[\\boxed{1 - \\frac{1}{N+1}}.\\]",
