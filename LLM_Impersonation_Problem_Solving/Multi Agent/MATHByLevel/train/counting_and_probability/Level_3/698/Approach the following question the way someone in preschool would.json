    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together how many ways we can arrange the books on the shelf. \n\nFirst, let's decide where to put the Introduction to Geometry books. We have 3 copies, so we can put them in 3 different spots: left, middle, or right.\n\nNext, let's figure out where to put the Introduction to Number Theory books. We have 4 copies, so we can put them in 4 different spots: left, middle, right, or next to the geometry books.\n\nNow, let's count the possibilities. If we put the geometry books in the left spot, there are 4 ways to arrange the number theory books. If we put the geometry books in the middle spot, again there are 4 ways to arrange the number theory books. And if we put the geometry books in the right spot, you guessed it, there are 4 ways to arrange the number theory books.\n\nSo in total, there are 3 (ways to arrange geometry books) x 4 (ways to arrange number theory books) = 12 ways to arrange all the books on the shelf. Yay, we did it!",
