    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A teacher wants to arrange 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry and 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory on a bookshelf. In how many ways can he do that?",
    "solution": "There are 7 possible locations for the books. The teacher can select 3 of these and place the copies of Introduction to Geometry in those spots and then place the copies of Introduction to Number Theory in the remaining 4 spots. This is just a combination, so our answer is $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many ways the teacher can arrange the books on the bookshelf, we need to use something called combinations. \n\nFirst, we need to add up the total number of books the teacher wants to arrange: 3 copies of Introduction to Geometry + 4 copies of Introduction to Number Theory = 7 total books.\n\nThen, we can use a mathematical formula to find out the number of ways to arrange the books. The formula is n! / (r! * (n-r)!) where n is the total number of books and r is the number of books of each type.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and r = 3 for Introduction to Geometry and r = 4 for Introduction to Number Theory.\n\nSo, we plug in the numbers and calculate:\n7! / (3! * (7-3)!) * 4! / (4! * (7-4)!) = 210 ways\n\nTherefore, the teacher can arrange the books in 210 different ways on the bookshelf.",
