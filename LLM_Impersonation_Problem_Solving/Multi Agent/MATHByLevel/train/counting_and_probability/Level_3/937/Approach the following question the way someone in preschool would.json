    "solution": "An $n$-gon has $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals.  To see this, subtract the $n$ consecutive pairs of vertices from the $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of vertices:  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{n}{2}-n&=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-n \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n}{2}-\\frac{2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n-2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-3n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}.\n\\end{align*} An octagon has $8(8-3)/2=\\boxed{20}$ diagonals.",

Let's count the number of diagonals it has:\n\n1st diagonal: We can draw a diagonal from one vertex to another that are not consecutive, so we have 7 possibilities.\n2nd diagonal: Now we have 6 vertices left, so we can draw another diagonal that is not adjacent to the last one, giving us 6 possibilities.\n3rd diagonal: We have 5 vertices remaining, so we can draw another diagonal that is not next to the previous ones, giving us 5 possibilities.\n4th diagonal: Now we have 4 vertices left, so we can draw another diagonal that is not next to the previous ones, giving us 4 possibilities.\n5th diagonal: We have 3 vertices remaining, so we can draw another diagonal that is not adjacent to the previous ones, giving us 3 possibilities.\n6th diagonal: Now we have 2 vertices left, so we can draw another diagonal that is not next to the previous ones, giving us 2 possibilities.\n7th diagonal: Finally, we have 1 vertex left, so we can draw the last diagonal that is not next to the previous ones, giving us 1 possibility.\n\nSo, a regular octagon has a total of 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28 diagonals.",
