If the pairing is done randomly, what is the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend, Irma? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Among the 29 equally likely possibilities for Margo's partner, Irma is one of them.  Therefore, the probability that Margo's partner is Irma is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{29}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend Irma out of the 29 possible pairings she could have, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations.\n\nThere are 29 other students in the class that Margo could be paired with, and only one of them is her best friend, Irma. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1.\n\nThe total number of possible pairings that could occur is given by the number of ways to choose 1 student out of the 29 remaining students, which is denoted as \"29 choose 1\" or 29C1.\n\nUsing the formula for combinations, we have:\n\n29C1 = 29! / (1!(29-1)!) = 29\n\nTherefore, the probability that Margo is paired with her best friend Irma is:\n\nP(Margo and Irma paired) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 1/29\n\nSo the probability can be expressed as a common fraction of 1/29.",
