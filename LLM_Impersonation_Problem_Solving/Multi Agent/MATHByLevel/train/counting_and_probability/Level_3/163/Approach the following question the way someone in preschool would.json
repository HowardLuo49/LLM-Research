    "solution": "We first factor 180 into three positive integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Since $180 > 5^3 = 125,$ at least one of the integers must be 6. Since $180 > 5^2\\cdot 6 = 150$, at least two integers must equal 6. Indeed, $180 = 5\\cdot6\\cdot6$ is the only such way to factor 180. Therefore, $(a,b,c) = (5,6,6), (6,5,6),(6,6,5)$ are the only possibilities for $a,b,c$. Each occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac16\\right)^3 = \\frac1{216}$, so the probability that $abc = 180$ is $3\\cdot \\frac1{216} = \\boxed{\\frac1{72}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh wow, this is a fun question! Let's see, when we roll the dice we can get numbers from 1 to 6. So let's think about how we can get the numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ to multiply to 180. \n\nWe know that $180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. So, let's try to find ways to get these prime factors using the numbers from the dice. \n\nWe need to find the number of ways to choose $a, b,$ and $c$ such that their product is 180. We know that 180 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. So, we need to figure out how many ways we can multiply three numbers from 1 to 6 to get those prime factors. \n\nLet's think about it... Oh! I know, we can have $a = 2, b = 3,$ and $c = 15$. So there's one way to get 180. \n\nAnd... oh, I'm not sure if there are any other ways! But maybe we can try some more combinations to see if there are other ways to get 180. \n\nSo, in preschool terms, we found that there is one way to get the numbers $a, b,$ and $c$ to multiply to 180. So the probability of that happening is 1 out of the total number of possible outcomes. \n\nI hope that helps! Let's keep practicing our math skills and have fun learning new things together!",
