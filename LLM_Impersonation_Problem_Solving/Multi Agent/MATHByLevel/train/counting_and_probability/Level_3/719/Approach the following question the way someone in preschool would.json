    "solution": "To form a four-digit number using 2, 0, 0 and 4, the digit in the thousands place must be 2 or 4. There are three places available for the remaining nonzero digit, whether it is 4 or 2. So the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",

That makes the number 2004! Yay we did it! Now let's see if we can make more numbers using these digits. Let's try all the different ways we can rearrange these numbers! Let's explore and have fun!",
