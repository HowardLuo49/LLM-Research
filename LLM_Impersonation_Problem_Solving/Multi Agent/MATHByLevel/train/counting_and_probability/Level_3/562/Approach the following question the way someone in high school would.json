    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "First, we know that Ace and Zeppo are already guaranteed spots in the starting lineup. That means we need to choose 3 more players from the remaining 10 players on the team to fill the remaining spots in the lineup.\n\nTo calculate the number of different starting lineups possible, we can use the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 (the number of players left to choose from) and r = 3 (the number of spots left to fill in the lineup).\n\n10C3 = 10! / 3!(10-3)! = 10! / 3!7! = (10 x 9 x 8) / (3 x 2 x 1) = 120\n\nTherefore, there are 120 different starting lineups possible for the Grunters.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 120?: First, we know that Ace and Zeppo are already guaranteed spots in the starting lineup. That means we need to choose 3 more players from the remaining 10 players on the team to fill the remaining spots in the lineup.\n\nTo calculate the number of different starting lineups possible, we can use the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nIn this case, we have n = 10 (the number of players left to choose from) and r = 3 (the number of spots left to fill in the lineup).\n\n10C3 = 10! / 3!(10-3)! = 10! / 3!7! = (10 x 9 x 8) / (3 x 2 x 1) = 120\n\nTherefore, there are 120 different starting lineups possible for the Grunters.",
