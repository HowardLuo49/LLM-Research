    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so Coach Grunt has to pick 3 more players to join Ace and Zeppo in the starting lineup. Since the order of the players doesn't matter, we can just focus on how many ways there are to pick those 3 players out of the remaining 10 players on the team.\n\nSo, to find out how many different starting lineups are possible, we need to figure out how many ways there are to choose 3 players out of 10. This is a combination problem!\n\nTo find the number of combinations, we use the formula nCr = n! / r! (n-r)!, where n is the total number of players to choose from and r is the number of players we want to choose. \n\nIn this case, n = 10 (because there are 10 players left after choosing Ace and Zeppo), and r = 3 (because Coach Grunt needs to pick 3 more players for the starting lineup).\n\nSo, the number of different starting lineups possible is 10C3 = 10! / 3! (10-3)! = 120 different starting lineups.\n\nTherefore, Coach Grunt has 120 different ways to choose the 3 players to join Ace and Zeppo in the starting lineup for the Grunters basketball team!",
