    "solution": "We start with the $0$th row, which has $1$ number. Each row has one more number than the previous row. Thus, we can see that row $n$ has $n+1$ numbers.\nSince we want the sum of numbers in the rows $0$ to $19$, we sum up every number from $1$ to $20$ to get $\\frac{(1+20)\\cdot 20}{2}=\\boxed{210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the numbers in Pascal's Triangle together! We start with the row that has $1$ number in it. Then the next row has $2$ numbers, then $3$ numbers, and so on. We keep going until we reach the $20$th row. So, to find out how many numbers there are in the first $20$ rows, we just need to add up all the numbers from $1$ to $20$. Let's count together: $1+2+3+\\dots+20 = 210.$ So there are $210$ numbers in the first $20$ rows of Pascal's Triangle!",
