    "solution": "There are $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes.  The only way that they can roll an odd product is if both their rolls are odd.  Since 3 of the 6 faces on each die are odd, this can occur in $3 \\times 3 = 9$ ways.  So a even product can occur in $36-9= 27$ ways, and the probability is thus $\\dfrac{27}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac34}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hi there! To find the probability that the product of the numbers Geoff and Trevor roll is even, we need to think about what numbers will give us an even product. \n\nLet's break it down. An even number is a number that can be divided by 2 without any remainder. So, to get an even product when rolling two dice, we need at least one even number.\n\nWhen you roll a fair six-sided die, half of the numbers are even (2, 4, 6) and half are odd (1, 3, 5).\n\nSo, to get an even product when rolling two dice, we can have:\n- An even number and any number (even * odd = even)\n- Two even numbers (even * even = even)\n\nThat means there are 3 even numbers out of 6 total possibilities on each die, so the probability of rolling an even number on each die is 3/6 or 1/2.\n\nTo find the probability of getting an even product when rolling two dice, we need to multiply the probabilities of getting an even number on each die:\n1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 \n\nSo, the probability that the product of the numbers Geoff and Trevor roll is even is 1/4. Yay for math!",
