    "solution": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$.",

So, the possible combinations are:\\n\\n1. 1_1 (e.g. 101, 111, 121, 131, ... , 191)\\n2. 2_2 (e.g. 202, 212, 222, ... , 292)\\n3. ...\\n9. 9_9 (e.g. 909, 919, ... , 999)\\n\\nTherefore, there are 9 possible three-digit palindromes for each digit from 1 to 9, which totals to 9 * 9 = 81 palindromes.\\n\\nNow, to find the palindromes that contain at least one 5, we need to consider the following cases:\\n1. Palindromes with one 5 (e.g. 515, 525, 535, ... , 595)\\n2. Palindromes with two 5s (e.g. 555)\\n\\nFor the palindromes with one 5, there are 9 possible combinations for the first and third digits, while the middle digit must be 5. This gives us a total of 9 * 1 = 9 palindromes.\\n\\nFor the palindrome with two 5s, there is only 1 combination: 555.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of palindromes containing at least one 5 is 9 + 1 = 10.\\n\\nTo find the percentage of palindromes containing at least one 5, we divide the number of palindromes containing at least one 5 by the total number of palindromes and multiply by 100:\\n\\n(10 / 81) * 100 = 12.35%\\n\\nTherefore, approximately 12.35% of the palindromes between 100 and 500 contain at least one 5.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1712180948, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_b28b39ffa8', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=430, prompt_tokens=53, total_tokens=483))",
