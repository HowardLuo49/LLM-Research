    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 6 distinct digits, there would be $6! = 720$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, 2! for the repetition of the digit 5, and again 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in 2! ways).  So, our answer is $\\frac{6!}{2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 2!} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many different positive six-digit integers we can make, we need to use all of those digits - 2, 2, 5, 5, 9, and 9.\n\nFirst, we can't start with 0 because we want a positive integer, so the first digit could be one of the three choices: 2, 5, or 9.\n\nAfter that, we have five more spots to fill. Since we have repeated digits, we have to think about how many ways we can arrange them.\n\nFor example, we have 2, 2, 5, 5, 9, 9. We can arrange them in 6!/2!*2!*2! = 90 different orders because there are 2 repeated 2s, 2 repeated 5s, and 2 repeated 9s.\n\nSo, there are 3 choices for the first digit and 90 different ways to arrange the remaining 5 digits.\n\nMultiplying 3 by 90 gives us a total of 270 different positive six-digit integers we can make using the digits 2, 2, 5, 5, 9, and 9.",
