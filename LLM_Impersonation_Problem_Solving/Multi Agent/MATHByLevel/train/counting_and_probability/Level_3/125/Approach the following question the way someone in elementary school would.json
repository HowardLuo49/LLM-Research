At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
    "solution": "From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have six books total. We want to figure out how they can be split between being in the library and checked out. Let's start by finding the different possibilities.\n\nWe know that at least one book has to be in the library and at least one has to be checked out. So, we can start by figuring out all the different combinations. \n\nThere are 5 different possibilities:\n- 1 book in the library, 5 checked out\n- 2 books in the library, 4 checked out\n- 3 books in the library, 3 checked out\n- 4 books in the library, 2 checked out\n- 5 books in the library, 1 checked out\n\nSo, there are 5 different ways that some of the books can be in the library and the rest checked out.",
