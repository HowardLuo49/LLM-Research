    "solution": "There are 3 options (boxes) for each of the 4 balls, so the number of ways is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes, we can use the concept of combinations. In this case, we are selecting 4 objects (balls) from a total of 3 choices (boxes) with repetition allowed.\n\nThe formula for this calculation is (n + r - 1) choose (r), where n is the number of choices (3 boxes), and r is the number of objects being selected (4 balls). \n\nTherefore, the number of ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 3 distinguishable boxes is (3 + 4 - 1) choose (4) = 6 choose 4 = 15 ways.",
