    "solution": "There are 3 options (boxes) for each of the 4 balls, so the number of ways is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count together. We have 4 balls and 3 boxes. We can put the first ball in any of the 3 boxes. Then, we can put the second ball in any of the 3 boxes as well. And then the third ball, and the fourth ball. So, for each ball, we have 3 choices of which box to put it in. So, if we multiply all these choices together, we get 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81 different ways to put the 4 balls in the 3 boxes. Yay, we did it!",
