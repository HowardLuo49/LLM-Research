    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Container I holds 8 red balls and 4 green balls; containers II and III each hold 2 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container I, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$ probability for a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ probability of getting green from Container I. Similarly for container II the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{9}$, and the same for container III. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the ball selected is green, we need to add up the total number of green balls in all three containers and divide by the total number of balls in all three containers.\n\nContainer I: 4 green balls \nContainer II: 4 green balls \nContainer III: 4 green balls \n\nTotal number of green balls = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12\n\nTotal number of balls in all three containers = (8 + 4) + (2 + 4) + (2 + 4) = 24\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a green ball is 12/24 which simplifies to 1/2. \n\nSo, the probability that the ball selected is green is 1/2.",
