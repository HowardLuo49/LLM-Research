    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of two randomly chosen numbers from $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ will be a multiple of 9, we first need to determine all the possible pairs of numbers whose product is a multiple of 9.\n\nA product is a multiple of 9 if at least one of the numbers in the pair is a multiple of 3. The numbers in the set $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ that are multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. Therefore, we need to consider all possible pairs that include a 3 or a 6.\n\nThe possible pairs that result in a product that is a multiple of 9 are:\n$(3, 3), (3, 6), (6, 3), (6, 6)$\n\nThere are a total of $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose two numbers without replacement from the set $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.
