    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen. None of these numbers are multiples of 9, so in order for their product to be a multiple of 9, both numbers must be a multiple of 3. The only possible pair that satisfies this is 3 and 6. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find out all the possible pairs of numbers we can choose: \n$\\{3,4\\}, \\{3,5\\}, \\{3,6\\}, \\{4,5\\}, \\{4,6\\}, \\{5,6\\}$.\n\nNow let's see which of these pairs have a product that is a multiple of 9:\n$\\{3,6\\}$.\n\nSo, there is only 1 pair that satisfies the condition.\n\nSince there are a total of $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ possible pairs, the probability of choosing a pair with a product that is a multiple of 9 is $\\frac{1}{6}$.",
