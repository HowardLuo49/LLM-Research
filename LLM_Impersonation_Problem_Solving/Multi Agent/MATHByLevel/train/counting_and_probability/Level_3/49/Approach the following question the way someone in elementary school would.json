    "solution": "We find the point which is equidistant from 0 and 4. Clearly, this occurs at 2. So, for all $x > 2$, $x$ is closer to 4 than 0. So, the probability is equal to the length of this region $\\frac{5-2}{5} = \\boxed{.6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that a point is closer to 4 than to 0, we need to consider the interval between 0 and 4. This interval has a length of 4 units. Since we want the point to be closer to 4 than to 0, we can divide the interval into two equal parts, with a length of 2 units each. This means the point should be in the closer half to 4, which is the interval between 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the point is closer to 4 than to 0 is the length of the interval between 3 and 4, divided by the length of the entire interval between 0 and 4. \n\nThe length of the interval between 3 and 4 is 1 unit, and the length of the entire interval between 0 and 4 is 4 units. \n\nSo, the probability is 1/4, which as a decimal to the nearest tenth is 0.3.",
