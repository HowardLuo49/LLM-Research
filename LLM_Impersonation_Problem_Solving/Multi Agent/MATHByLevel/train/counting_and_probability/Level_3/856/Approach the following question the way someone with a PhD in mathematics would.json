    "solution": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no zero as a digit can have for each of its five digits anything from 1 through 9 inclusive. There are $9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9\\times 9=59,\\!049$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero as a digit is  $90,\\!000-59,\\!049=\\boxed{30,951}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many 5-digit numbers have at least one zero, we can use the principle of counting. There are a total of 9 possible choices for the first digit (1-9) and 10 possible choices for each of the remaining four digits (0-9).\n\nTo calculate the number of 5-digit numbers without any zeros, we consider that there are 9 choices for the first digit and 9 choices for each of the remaining four digits. Therefore, the total number of 5-digit numbers without any zeros is given by:\n\n9 * 9 * 9 * 9 * 9 = 59,049\n\nNow, to find the total number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero, we subtract the number of 5-digit numbers without any zeros from the total number of 5-digit numbers possible. Therefore, the total number of 5-digit numbers with at least one zero is:\n\n100,000 - 59,049 = 40,951\n\nTherefore, there are 40,951 5-digit numbers that have at least one zero.",
