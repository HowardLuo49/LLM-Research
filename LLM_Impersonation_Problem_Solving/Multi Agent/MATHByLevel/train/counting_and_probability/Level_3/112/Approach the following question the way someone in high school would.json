    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{14}=\\binom{27}{14}$, so $n=14$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{27}{14}=\\binom{27}{27-14}=\\binom{27}{13}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{12}=\\binom{27}{13}$, so $n=12$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $12$ and $14$, so the sum is $12+14=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok so first let's think about what these symbols mean. $\\binom{26}{13}$ is a combination that represents choosing 13 objects out of 26 without regard to order. Similarly, $\\binom{26}{n}$ is choosing n objects out of 26 without regard to order. Finally, $\\binom{27}{14}$ is choosing 14 objects out of 27 without regard to order.\n\nSo we want to find the sum of all integer values $n$ that make the equation $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$ true.\n\nOne thing to note is that $\\binom{26}{13} = \\binom{26}{26-13} = \\binom{26}{13}$ since choosing 13 objects out of 26 is the same as choosing the other 13 objects out of 26.\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{26-n}=\\binom{27}{14}$.\n\nNotice that $\\binom{27}{14} = \\binom{27}{27-14} = \\binom{27}{13}$ since choosing 14 objects out of 27 is the same as choosing the other 13 objects out of 27.\n\nThis means that $n = 26-13 = 13$ is a solution.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which the equation is true is 13.",
