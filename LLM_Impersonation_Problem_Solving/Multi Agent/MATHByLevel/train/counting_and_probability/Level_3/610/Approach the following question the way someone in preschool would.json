    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
    "solution": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooohhh! Let's see... first we need to know how many cards are in a deck. There are 52 cards in a standard deck! Now, how many 6s are there in the deck? There are 4 6s...one of each suit. And how many Queens are there? There are also 4 Queens...one of each suit too! So, if we multiply the number of 6s by the number of Queens, we get 4 x 4 = 16 possible ways to have a 6 and a Queen as the first two cards. Now, to find the probability, we divide the number of ways to have a 6 and a Queen by the total number of possible card combinations, which is 52 cards in total. So, 16 divided by 52 is...uhh...is...um...let's count together...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...okay! So the probability of getting a 6 and a Queen is 16 out of 52! Yay!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to \\dfrac{4?: Ooohhh! Let's see... first we need to know how many cards are in a deck.
