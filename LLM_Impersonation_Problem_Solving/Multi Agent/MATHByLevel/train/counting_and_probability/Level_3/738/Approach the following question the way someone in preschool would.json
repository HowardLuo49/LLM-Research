    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! First, we need to choose one person to be the quarterback. We have 10 people to choose from, so there are 10 options for the quarterback.\n\nNext, we need to pick a running back. We still have 10 people, but we can't pick the same person as the quarterback. So we have 9 options left for the running back.\n\nNow, we need to choose an offensive lineman. We only have 3 strong people to choose from, so there are 3 options for the offensive lineman.\n\nLastly, we need to pick a wide receiver. Since all other positions can be played by anyone, we have 9 people left to choose from.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the starting lineup, we multiply the number of options for each position: 10 (quarterback) x 9 (running back) x 3 (offensive lineman) x 9 (wide receiver) = 2,430 ways to choose the starting lineup. Great job picking our team, preschool friends!",
