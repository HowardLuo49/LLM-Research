    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct on a 15-question multiple choice test with two choices for each question (correct or incorrect), we can use the binomial probability formula.\n\nLet X be the random variable representing the number of correct answers Steve gets out of 15 questions. The probability of getting a correct answer on any question is 1/2, and the probability of getting an incorrect answer is also 1/2.\n\nThe probability of getting exactly k correct answers out of 15 questions can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (15 choose k) * (1/2)^k * (1/2)^(15-k)\n\nTo find the probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct (i.e., 8 or more questions correct), we need to sum the probabilities of getting exactly 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 questions correct:\n\nP(X >= 8) = P(X = 8) + P(X = 9) + P(X = 10) + P(X = 11) + P(X = 12) + P(X = 13) + P(X = 14) + P(X = 15)\n\nCalculating this sum gives us the desired probability that Steve gets at least half of the questions correct on the test.",
