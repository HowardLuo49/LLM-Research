    "solution": "Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order.  The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars. Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we can imagine representing the balls as stars and the boxes as bars. \n\nWe have 4 balls and 3 boxes, so we can represent them as `****|||`. We need to find the number of ways to arrange these 7 symbols (4 stars and 3 bars). \n\nThe number of ways to arrange these symbols is given by the formula (n + k - 1) choose (k - 1), where n is the number of objects to be distributed (balls) and k is the number of containers to distribute them to (boxes). \n\nSo, in this case, the number of ways to distribute 4 balls in 3 boxes is (4 + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1) = 6 choose 2 = 15 ways. \n\nTherefore, there are 15 ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes.",
