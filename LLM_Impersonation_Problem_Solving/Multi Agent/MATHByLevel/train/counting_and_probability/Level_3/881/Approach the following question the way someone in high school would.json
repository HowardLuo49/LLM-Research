    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box.  There is only $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5.  This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{462}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The first thing you need to do is figure out how many total balls are in the box. Since there are 5 white balls and 6 black balls, the total number of balls in the box is 5 + 6 = 11.\n\nNext, you need to figure out how many ways you can draw 5 balls out of 11. This is a combination problem, so you need to use the formula nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!. In this case, n = 11 and r = 5, so the number of ways to draw 5 balls out of 11 is 11C5 = 11! / 5!(11-5)! = 462.\n\nLastly, you need to figure out how many ways you can draw 5 white balls from the box. Since there are 5 white balls and you are drawing 5 balls in total, there is only 1 way to draw all white balls.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing all white balls is 1/462, or approximately 0.00216450216.",
