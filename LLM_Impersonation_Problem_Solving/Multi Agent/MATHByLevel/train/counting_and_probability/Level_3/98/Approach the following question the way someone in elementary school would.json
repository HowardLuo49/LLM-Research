    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we need only count the number of balls in the distinguishable boxes.  We can put 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 balls in Box 1 (and the rest go in Box 2).  So there are $\\boxed{6}$ different arrangements.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see, if we have 5 balls to put in 2 boxes, we can think about it like this. \n\nWe can put all 5 balls in the first box and leave the second box empty. That's one way.\n\nWe can put 4 balls in the first box and 1 ball in the second box. That's another way.\n\nOr, we can put 3 balls in the first box and 2 balls in the second box. That's a different way.\n\nWe can also put 2 balls in the first box and 3 balls in the second box. That's another way.\n\nAnd, lastly, we can put all 5 balls in the second box and leave the first box empty. That's the final way.\n\nSo, there are a total of 5 ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes when the balls are not different from each other but the boxes are.",
