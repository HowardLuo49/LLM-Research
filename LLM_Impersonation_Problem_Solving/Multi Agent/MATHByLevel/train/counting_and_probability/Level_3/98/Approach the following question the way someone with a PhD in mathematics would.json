    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we need only count the number of balls in the distinguishable boxes.  We can put 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 balls in Box 1 (and the rest go in Box 2).  So there are $\\boxed{6}$ different arrangements.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and the principle of stars and bars. Since the balls are indistinguishable, we can think of each ball as a star. We need to divide the stars into two boxes, which can be represented by using bars. \n\nTherefore, we have 4 spaces (bars) to place in between the 5 stars to separate them into two boxes. We can represent this as follows:\n\n**|***|****\n\nIn this arrangement, the first box will contain 2 balls and the second box will contain 3 balls. Since the boxes are distinguishable, there is only one way to arrange the balls in this manner. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes is 1.",
