    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$. Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\dfrac{720}{8} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word TARTAR, we can use the formula for permutations of a word with repeated letters. \n\nFirst, count the total number of letters in the word TARTAR, which is 6. \n\nNext, we see that the word has two repeated letters \"T\" and two repeated letters \"A\". \n\nTo find the number of ways to arrange the word TARTAR, we can calculate 6 factorial (6!) divided by 2 factorial (2!) for the repeated \"T\" and divided by 2 factorial (2!) for the repeated \"A\".\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word TARTAR is 6! / (2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2) = 720 / 4 = 180.\n\nTherefore, there are 180 ways to arrange the letters in the word TARTAR.",
