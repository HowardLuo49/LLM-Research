    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$. Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\dfrac{720}{8} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word TARTAR, we can use the formula for permutations. \n\nThe word TARTAR has 6 letters, with the letter T appearing twice and the letter A appearing twice. \n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the letters is 6! / (2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2) = 180.\n\nTherefore, there are 180 ways to arrange the letters in the word TARTAR.",
