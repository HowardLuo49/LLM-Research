    "solution": "There are 2 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in two different locations.  So the answer is $2^5 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many ways there are to put 5 balls in 2 boxes, we can think of it like this:\n\nWe can put each ball in either Box 1 or Box 2. So for the first ball, we have 2 choices. And for the second ball, we also have 2 choices. And so on, for all 5 balls.\n\nSo, we have 2 choices for the first ball, 2 choices for the second ball, 2 choices for the third ball, 2 choices for the fourth ball, and 2 choices for the fifth ball.\n\nTo find out the total number of ways, we can multiply all the choices together:\n2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32\n\nSo, there are 32 ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls and boxes are distinguishable!",
