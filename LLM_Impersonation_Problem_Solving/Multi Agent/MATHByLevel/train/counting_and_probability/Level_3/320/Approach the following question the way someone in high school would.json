    "solution": "The row that starts 1, 12 is the row $\\binom{12}{0}, \\binom{12}{1}, \\binom{12}{2},\\binom{12}{3}$, so the fourth number in this row is $\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\boxed{220}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the fourth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12, we need to use the formula for finding the numbers in Pascal's triangle. \n\nThe formula is: nCr = (n-1)C(r-1) + (n-1)C(r), where n is the row number and r is the position in the row.\n\nIn this case, the row number is 2 (since we start with 1 and then 12), and we need to find the number in the 4th position. So we plug in n = 2 and r = 3 into the formula:\n\n2C2 = 1C1 + 1C2\n      = 1 + 1\n      = 2\n\nTherefore, the fourth number in the row is 2.",
