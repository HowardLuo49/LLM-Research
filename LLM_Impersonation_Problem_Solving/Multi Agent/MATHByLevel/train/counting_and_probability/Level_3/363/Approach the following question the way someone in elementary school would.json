Tyler has entered a buffet line in which he chooses one kind of meat, two different vegetables and one dessert.  If the order of food items is not important, how many different meals might he choose?\n\n$\\bullet$  Meat: beef, chicken, pork\n\n$\\bullet$  Vegetables: baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes\n\n$\\bullet$  Dessert: brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream",
    "solution": "There are $3$ choices for the meat and $4$ for dessert.\n\nThere are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose $2$ of the $4$ vegetables, since we don't care about the order in which the vegetables are chosen.\n\nThe answer therefore is $3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6=\\boxed{72}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's figure out how many options Tyler has for each category.\n\nFor the meat, Tyler has 3 options: beef, chicken, or pork.\n\nFor the vegetables, Tyler has 4 options: baked beans, corn, potatoes, or tomatoes. Since he needs to choose 2 out of the 4 options, let's calculate the number of combinations he can make. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r! * (n-r)! where n is the total number of options and r is the number of options to choose. In this case, n=4 and r=2. \n\n4C2 = 4! / 2! * (4-2)! = 6\n\nFinally, for the dessert, Tyler has 4 options: brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, or ice cream.\n\nTo find out how many different meals Tyler can choose, we need to multiply the number of options for each category:\n\n3 (meats) * 6 (combinations of 2 vegetables) * 4 (desserts) = 72 different meals Tyler can choose from in the buffet line.",
