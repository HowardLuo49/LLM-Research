    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "A rectangle has 4 sides. If the perimeter is 64 inches, that means all the sides added together equal 64 inches. Let's try to figure out the different ways we can add up the sides to equal 64. \n\nSome examples could be:\n- Side 1: 15 inches, Side 2: 15 inches, Side 3: 17 inches, Side 4: 17 inches\n- Side 1: 10 inches, Side 2: 22 inches, Side 3: 16 inches, Side 4: 16 inches\n- Side 1: 12 inches, Side 2: 12 inches, Side 3: 20 inches, Side 4: 20 inches\n\nSo, there are at least three different non-congruent rectangles that meet the criteria.
