    "solution": "Call the height $h$ and the width $w$. We want to find the number of solutions to $2(w+h)=64$ or $w+h=32$. The solutions to this are  \\[\n\\{(1,31),(2,30),\\ldots,(16,16),\\ldots,(31,1)\\}.\n\\] There are 31 solutions to this, but we are double-counting all the rectangles for which $w \\neq h$. There are 30 of these, so the total number of rectangles is $\\frac{30}{2}+1=\\boxed{16}$ rectangles.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to establish the relationship between the perimeter and the lengths of the sides of a rectangle. Let the length of the rectangle be denoted by l and the width be denoted by w. The perimeter of a rectangle can be expressed as 2(l+w).\n\nGiven that the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 inches, we have:\n2(l+w) = 64\nl+w = 32\n\nSince the sides of the rectangle are integers, we are looking for pairs of integers that sum to 32. Some possible pairs include (1,31), (2,30), (3,29), etc. It is important to note that the order of the sides does not matter, so (1,31) is the same as (31,1).\n\nTo count the number of non-congruent rectangles, we need to consider all the possible pairs of integer sides that sum to 32. We also need to account for the fact that the sides could be flipped, so each pair of sides actually represents two different possible rectangles.\n\nTo calculate the total number of non-congruent rectangles, we count the number of pairs of integers that sum to 32 and then multiply by 2 to account for the flipping of sides. This can be done by listing out all the pairs or by using combinatorial techniques. The total number of non-congruent rectangles meeting the specified criteria can thus be determined.",
