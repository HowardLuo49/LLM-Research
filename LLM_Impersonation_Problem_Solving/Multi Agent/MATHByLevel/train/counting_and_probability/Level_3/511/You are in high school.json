    "solution": "There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ pairs of distinct integers between 1 and 20, and there are $\\binom{8}{2}$ pairs of distinct prime numbers between 1 and 20.  Therefore, the probability that both members of a randomly chosen pair are prime is $\\dfrac{\\binom{8}{2}}{\\binom{20}{2}}=\\dfrac{8(7)/2}{20(19)/2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{95}}$.",
