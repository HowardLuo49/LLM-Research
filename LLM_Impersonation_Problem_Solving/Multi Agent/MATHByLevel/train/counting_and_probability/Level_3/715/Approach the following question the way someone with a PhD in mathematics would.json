    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I have 6 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 6 hats. The pants come in tan, black, blue, and gray. The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of outfits we can create without any restrictions. This is simply the product of the number of choices for each item: 6 shirts x 6 hats x 4 pants = 144 outfits.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of outfits where all three items are the same color. There are 4 colors available for each item, so there are 4 outfits where all items are the same color.\n\nHowever, we must subtract this from the total number of outfits, because we do not want to count these outfits. So, 144 total outfits - 4 outfits with all items the same color = 140 outfits with at least one item a different color.\n\nTherefore, there are 140 choices for outfits consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants.",
