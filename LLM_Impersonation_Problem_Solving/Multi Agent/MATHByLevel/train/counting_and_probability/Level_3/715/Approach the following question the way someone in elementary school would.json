    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. I have 6 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 6 hats. The pants come in tan, black, blue, and gray. The shirts and hats come in those colors, and also white and yellow. I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color. How many choices for outfits, consisting of one shirt, one hat, and one pair of pants, do I have?",
    "solution": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 4\\times 6=144$. There are 4 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $144-4=\\boxed{140}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's see how many choices we have for each item: \n- 6 choices for shirts (tan, black, blue, gray, white, yellow)\n- 6 choices for hats (tan, black, blue, gray, white, yellow)\n- 4 choices for pants (tan, black, blue, gray)\n\nNow, let's figure out how many outfits we can make:\n- We can't have all 3 items be the same color, so we have to subtract those choices from our total. There are 4 colors where all 3 items could be the same (tan, black, blue, gray) and there are 4 options for each of those, so we need to subtract 16 choices.\n- That leaves us with a total of 6 shirts, 6 hats, and 4 pants to choose from. \n\nTo find the total number of outfit combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each item: 6 shirts x 6 hats x 4 pants = 144 possible outfits.\n\nSo, you have 144 choices for outfits to wear!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 140?: First, let's see how many choices we have for each item: \n- 6 choices for shirts (tan, black, blue, gray, white, yellow)\n- 6 choices for hats (tan, black, blue, gray, white, yellow)\n- 4 choices for pants (tan, black, blue, gray)\n\nNow, let's figure out how many outfits we can make:\n- We can't have all 3 items be the same color, so we have to subtract those choices from our total.
