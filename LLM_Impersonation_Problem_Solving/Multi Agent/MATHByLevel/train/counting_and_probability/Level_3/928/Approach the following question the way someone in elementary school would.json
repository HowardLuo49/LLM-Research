If there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, 6 students with blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes, how many students have blue eyes?",
    "solution": "Let the number of blue-eyed students be $x$, so the number of blond students is $2x$.  Since the number of blue-eyed blond students is $6$, the number of blue-eyed non-blond students is $x - 6$, while the number of blond non-blue-eyed students is $2x - 6$.  Since the number of non-blue-eyed non-blond students is $3$, we can add up these four exclusive categories (blond blue-eyed, blond non-blue-eyed, etc.) to sum to 30 students in the class.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Blue eyes\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Blond hair\", (80,74));\nlabel(\"Neither: 3\", (44,10));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$6$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$x-6$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x-6$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nSo $(x - 6) + (2x - 6) + 6 + 3 = 30$ and $x = \\boxed{11}$, which is the number of blue-eyed students.",
    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So we know that there are 30 students in Mrs. Taylor's class. We also know that there are 6 students with both blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes.\n\nNow, since there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, we can figure out that there are 12 students with blond hair (since 12 is twice as many as 6).\n\nSo, if 12 students have blond hair, and 6 students have both blond hair and blue eyes, that means there are 6 students left who have blond hair but NOT blue eyes.\n\nAnd since we know there are 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes, and we've already figured out that there are 6 students with just blond hair (not blue eyes), we can subtract those 6 students from the 3 students who have neither trait. This leaves us with 3 students who have blue eyes!\n\nSo, Mrs. Taylor's class has 3 students with blue eyes. Yay!",
