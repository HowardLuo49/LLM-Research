    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Ten distinct points are identified on the circumference of a circle. How many different convex quadrilaterals can be formed if each vertex must be one of these 10 points?",
    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",
    "gpt_response": "1. First, let's understand what a convex quadrilateral is. A convex quadrilateral is a shape with four sides where all interior angles are less than 180 degrees.\n2. We have 10 points on the circumference of a circle, and we want to form a quadrilateral with these points.\n3. To form a convex quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points out of the 10 points on the circumference of the circle.\n4. The number of ways to choose 4 points out of 10 is calculated by the combination formula, which is denoted as C(10,4) or 10 choose 4.\n5. C(10,4) = 10! / (4!(10-4)!)\n   = 10! / (4! * 6!)\n   = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n   = 210\n6. Therefore, there are 210 different ways to choose 4 points out of the 10 points on the circumference of the circle.\n7. However, not all combinations of 4 points will form a convex quadrilateral. Some combinations may form concave or degenerate quadrilaterals.\n8. To determine the number of different convex quadrilaterals, we need to visually check each combination of 4 points and eliminate the concave and degenerate quadrilaterals.\n9. By carefully examining each combination, we can identify the different convex quadrilaterals that can be formed using the 10 points on the circumference of the circle.\n10. In conclusion, there are 210 different ways to choose 4 points out of the 10 points on the circumference of a circle, but the number of different convex quadrilaterals that can be formed will be less than 210.",
