    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many diagonals does a regular seven-sided polygon contain?",
    "solution": "A seven-sided polygon has seven vertices. There are ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$ ways to connect the pairs of these 7 points. But 7 of those pairs are pairs of consecutive vertices, so they are counted as sides. So, only $21 - 7 = \\boxed{14}$ of these segments are diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of diagonals in a regular seven-sided polygon, we can use a formula that relates the number of sides of the polygon to the number of diagonals it contains. \n\nFor a regular polygon with n sides, the number of diagonals can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of diagonals = n * (n-3) / 2\n\nIn this case, we have a regular seven-sided polygon, so n = 7. Substituting this into the formula, we get:\n\nNumber of diagonals = 7 * (7-3) / 2\nNumber of diagonals = 7 * 4 / 2\nNumber of diagonals = 28 / 2\nNumber of diagonals = 14\n\nTherefore, a regular seven-sided polygon contains 14 diagonals.",
