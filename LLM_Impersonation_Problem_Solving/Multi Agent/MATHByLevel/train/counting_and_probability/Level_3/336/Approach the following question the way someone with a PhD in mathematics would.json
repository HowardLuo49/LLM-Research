    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ that end with the digit $3$, we need to analyze the pattern of multiples of $7$ and focus on determining when the units digit is $3$. \n\nThe multiples of $7$ exhibit a repeating pattern in their units digit. Let's consider the first few multiples of $7$:\n\n$7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, ...$\n\nFrom the list above, we can observe that the units digit of multiples of $7$ cycles in the following pattern: $7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 0$. Therefore, any multiple of $7$ ending in $3$ must be of the form $3 + 10k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nWe need to find the largest multiple of $7$ that is less than $1000$ and ends with the digit $3$. This is achieved by setting $3 + 10k = 7n$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\nSolving for $k$, we get $k = (7n - 3) / 10$.\n\nSince we want $7n$ to be less than $1000$, we can try different values of $n$ starting from $1$ until we reach $n = 142$ where $7n = 994$ which is less than $1000$.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{142}$ positive multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ that end with the digit $3$.",
