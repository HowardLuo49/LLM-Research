    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We can start by thinking about each digit in the four-digit number one at a time. \n\nFor the first digit, we can choose any number from 1 to 9 because we want a positive integer. So there are 9 options.\n\nFor the second, third, and fourth digits, we want at least one of them to be a 2 or a 3. So for each of these digits, we have the option of choosing either 2, 3, or any number from 0 to 9. That's 11 options for each of these digits.\n\nSo, to find the total number of four-digit positive integers with at least one digit being a 2 or a 3, we multiply the options for each digit: 9 (options for the first digit) * 11 (options for the second digit) * 11 (options for the third digit) * 11 (options for the fourth digit).\n\nNow we can count together and find the answer! Let's start with 9 and multiply by 11 three times: 9 * 11 * 11 * 11 = 11,979.\n\nSo, there are 11,979 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3. Great job counting!",
