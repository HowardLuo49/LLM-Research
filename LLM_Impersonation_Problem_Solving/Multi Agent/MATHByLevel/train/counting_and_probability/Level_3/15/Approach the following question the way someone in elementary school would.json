    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of rolling six different numbers on six dice, we need to think about how many different outcomes there are in total and how many favorable outcomes there are.\n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so there are 6 different numbers that we could roll on each die. Since we want to roll six distinct numbers, that means we can't roll the same number on more than one die.\n\nTo find the total number of possible outcomes, we need to multiply the number of possibilities on each die: 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 46656\n\nNow we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where we roll six distinct numbers. We can choose the numbers in any order, so we can calculate this using permutations. There are 6 choices for the first die, 5 choices for the second die (since we can't roll the same number as the first), 4 choices for the third die, and so on. So the number of favorable outcomes is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\nNow we can find the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\n720 / 46656 = 5 / 324\n\nSo the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six dice is 5/324.",
