    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We have 4 balls and 2 boxes. We can put the first ball in Box 1 or Box 2, the second ball in Box 1 or Box 2, the third ball in Box 1 or Box 2, and the fourth ball in Box 1 or Box 2. That's 2 ways for each of the 4 balls, so we have 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 ways to put the 4 balls into the 2 boxes. Yay, we did it!",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 16?: Let's count together! We have 4 balls and 2 boxes. We can put the first ball in Box 1 or Box 2, the second ball in Box 1 or Box 2, the third ball in Box 1 or Box 2, and the fourth ball in Box 1 or Box 2. That's 2 ways for each of the 4 balls, so we have 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 ways to put the 4 balls into the 2 boxes. Yay, we did it!",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. The final solution obtained in the given scenario is the number of ways to put 4 balls into 2 boxes, which is 16.",
