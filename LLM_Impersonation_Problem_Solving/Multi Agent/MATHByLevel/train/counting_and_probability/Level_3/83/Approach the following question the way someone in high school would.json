    "solution": "In this problem, we only need to count the number of ways to split 4 items into two groups.  There are only 3 ways: $\\{4,0\\}$, $\\{3,1\\}$ and $\\{2,2\\}$.  Therefore, there are only $\\boxed{3}$ ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls in 2 indistinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways to put 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, we can use the stars and bars method. \n\nSince the balls are indistinguishable and the boxes are indistinguishable, we can imagine lining up the balls in a row and placing bars between them to represent the boxes. \n\nFor example, if we have 4 balls and 2 boxes, we can represent the distribution as: **||**\n\nTherefore, there are 3 ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes using the stars and bars method.",
