Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup?",
    "solution": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count the triplets as one group. So we have 14 - 3 = 11 players left to choose from. We need to choose 3 more players to start with the triplets. \n\nTo find out how many ways we can choose those 3 players, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of players left to choose from and r is the number of players we want to choose.\n\nSo, for this question, we have 11 players left to choose from and we want to choose 3 more players to start with the triplets. \n\n11C3 = 11! / 3!(11-3)!\n11C3 = 11! / 3!8!\n11C3 = (11 x 10 x 9) / (3 x 2 x 1)\n11C3 = 990 / 6\n11C3 = 165\n\nSo, there are 165 ways we can choose 3 more players to start with the triplets. \n\nTo find the total number of ways we can choose 6 starters with the triplets, we multiply the number of ways we can choose those 3 players with the triplets by the number of ways we can choose the other 3 players.\n\n165 ways to choose 3 players with the triplets x 1 way to choose the triplets = 165 ways\n\nTherefore, there are 165 ways we can choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup.",
