    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so since there are 52 cards in a deck and half of them are red and half are black, the probability of drawing a red card first is 26/52 or 1/2.\n\nNow, after drawing a red card, there are now only 25 red cards and 26 black cards left in the deck. So the probability of drawing a black card second is 26/51.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (26/51) = 26/102.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black is 26/102 or about 0.2549, which is approximately 0.255.",
