A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "I like playing with cards! We have to find out the probability of picking a red card and then a black card. \n\nFirst, let's count how many red cards there are in the deck. There are 26 cards that are red (13 hearts and 13 diamonds) and 26 cards that are black (13 spades and 13 clubs). \n\nSo, the probability of picking a red card first is $\\frac{26}{52}$ because there are 26 red cards out of a total of 52 cards. \n\nAfter we pick a red card, there are now 25 red cards left and 26 black cards left. So, the probability of picking a black card second is $\\frac{26}{51}$ because there are 26 black cards out of a total of 51 cards left. \n\nTo find the total probability, we just multiply the probability of picking a red card first by the probability of picking a black card second: \n\n$\\frac{26}{52} \\times \\frac{26}{51} = \\frac{676}{2652} = \\frac{26}{102}$\n\nSo, the probability of picking a red card first and then a black card is $\\frac{26}{102}$ or about 0.254 or 25.4%. Yay, we did it!",
