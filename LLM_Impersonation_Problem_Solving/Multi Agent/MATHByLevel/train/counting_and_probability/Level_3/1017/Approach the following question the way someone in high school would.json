What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{4}{52} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} \\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{16575}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to figure out how many Jacks, Queens, and Kings are in a standard deck. There are 4 of each, so the probability of getting a Jack on the first draw is 4/52. \n\nAfter we draw a Jack, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, so the probability of drawing a Queen next is 4/51. \n\nFinally, after drawing a Jack and a Queen, there are 50 cards remaining, so the probability of drawing a King last is 4/50. \n\nTo find the overall probability, we multiply these probabilities together: (4/52) * (4/51) * (4/50) = 0.06% \n\nSo, the probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, then a King in that order is 0.06%.",
