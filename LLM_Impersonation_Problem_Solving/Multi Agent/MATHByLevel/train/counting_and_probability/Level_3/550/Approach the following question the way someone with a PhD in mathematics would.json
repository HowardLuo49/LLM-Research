    "solution": "In all cases, at least half of John's kids will be boys or at least half will be girls.  Furthermore, since John has an odd number of children, these conditions are mutually exclusive--that is, they are never true at the same time.  Since a boy is equally likely to be born as is a girl, our answer is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that at least half of John's children are girls, we can use the binomial distribution. Let's consider the different possible outcomes of having 5 children:\n\n1. All boys: (1/2)^5 = 1/32\n2. 4 boys, 1 girl: 5 choose 1 ways = 5*(1/2)^5 = 5/32\n3. 3 boys, 2 girls: 5 choose 2 ways = 10*(1/2)^5 = 10/32\n4. 2 boys, 3 girls: 5 choose 3 ways = 10*(1/2)^5 = 10/32\n5. 1 boy, 4 girls: 5 choose 4 ways = 5*(1/2)^5 = 5/32\n6. All girls: (1/2)^5 = 1/32\n\nTo find the probability that at least half of the children are girls, we can sum the probabilities of the outcomes where there are at least 3 girls:\n\nP(at least half are girls) = P(3 girls) + P(4 girls) + P(5 girls)\n                           = 10/32 + 5/32 + 1/32\n                           = 16/32\n                           = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least half of John's children are girls is 1/2.",
