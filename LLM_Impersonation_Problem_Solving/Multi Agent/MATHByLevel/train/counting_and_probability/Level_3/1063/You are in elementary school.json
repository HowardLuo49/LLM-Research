    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",

Since the order matters, we can arrange these 2 letters in 2! ways.\\n\\nSo, the total number of distinct sequences of four letters meeting the given conditions is:\\n10 (ways to choose the middle two letters) x 2!
