    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle, we need to look for numbers that are greater than 1000 but smaller than the smallest four-digit number we have already found. Let's start by finding the smallest four-digit number in the first few rows of Pascal's triangle.\n\nThe rows that we need to look at are the 15th and 16th rows, since the smallest four-digit number we have found so far is in the 14th row of the triangle. \n\nIn the 15th row, the numbers are 1, 15, 105, 455, 1365, 3003, 5005, 6435, 6435, 5005, 3003, 1365, 455, 105, 15, 1\n\nIn the 16th row, the numbers are 1, 16, 120, 560, 1820, 4368, 8008, 11440, 12870, 11440, 8008, 4368, 1820, 560, 120, 16, 1\n\nWe can see that the smallest four-digit number in the 15th row is 1365, which is greater than 1000. The second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is therefore the smallest four-digit number in the 16th row, which is 1820.",
