    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Tim has 18 socks in his drawer. He has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks. \n\nTo find the probability that he picks a matching pair, we need to find the total number of ways he can pick two socks and the number of ways he can pick a matching pair. \n\nThere are 18 socks to choose from for the first sock and 17 socks left to choose from for the second sock. So, there are a total of 18 x 17 = 306 ways to pick two socks.\n\nTo pick a matching pair, he can either pick two gray-bottomed socks (10 choose 2 ways) or two white-bottomed socks (8 choose 2 ways). \n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick a matching pair is 10 choose 2 + 8 choose 2 = 45 + 28 = 73 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Tim picks a matching pair of socks is 73/306 = 0.2392 or about 24%.",
