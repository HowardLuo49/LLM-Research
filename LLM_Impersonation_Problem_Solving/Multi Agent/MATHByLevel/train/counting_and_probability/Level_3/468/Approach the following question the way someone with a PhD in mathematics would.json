Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Tim picks a matching pair of socks, we can consider the possible outcomes of the event. \n\nThere are two distinct types of socks in Tim's drawer - gray-bottomed socks and white-bottomed socks. Since Tim is picking two socks randomly, there are a total of ${10 + 8 \\choose 2} = {18 \\choose 2} = 153$ different pairs of socks he could pick.\n\nFor Tim to pick a matching pair, he must either pick two gray-bottomed socks or two white-bottomed socks. \n\nThe number of ways Tim can pick two matching gray-bottomed socks is ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ and the number of ways he can pick two matching white-bottomed socks is ${8 \\choose 2} = 28$. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways Tim can pick a matching pair of socks is $45 + 28 = 73$.\n\nThe probability that Tim picks a matching pair of socks is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{73}{153} \\approx 0.478$.",
