    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. A bin has 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.  If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
    "solution": "There are 5 green balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a green ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$. Similarly, the probability that a purple ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$. So the expected value is $$\\frac{5}{5+k}(2)+\\frac{k}{5+k}(-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ gives $20-4k=5+k$, or $15=5k$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $k$, we can set up an equation based on the given information. \n\nThe expected value is calculated by multiplying the value of each outcome by the probability of that outcome and summing them all up.\n\nIn this case, the expected value is $0.50 = \\frac{5}{5+k} \\cdot 2 - \\frac{k}{5+k} \\cdot 2$\n\nThis equation can be simplified to $0.50 = \\frac{10}{5+k} - \\frac{2k}{5+k}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $5+k$ to get rid of the denominator, we get $0.50(5+k) = 10 - 2k$\n\nExpanding the left side gives $2.5 + 0.50k = 10 - 2k$\n\nRearranging the terms gives $2.5 = 10 - 2k - 0.50k$\n\nCombining like terms gives $2.5 = 10 - 2.5k$\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides gives $-7.5 = -2.5k$\n\nDividing by $-2.5$ gives $k = 3$\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is 3.",
