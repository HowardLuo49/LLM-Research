    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jenna is at a fair with four friends. They all want to ride the roller coaster, but only three people can fit in a car. How many different groups of three can the five of them make?",
    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first determine the total number of ways to choose 3 people from a group of 5. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations, which is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from and k is the number of items being chosen.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 5 (Jenna and her four friends) and k = 3 (the number of people needed for the roller coaster car). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\n          = 5! / (3! * 2!)\n          = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / ((3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1))\n          = (120) / (6 * 2)\n          = 120 / 12\n          = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 different groups of three that Jenna and her friends can make to ride the roller coaster.",
