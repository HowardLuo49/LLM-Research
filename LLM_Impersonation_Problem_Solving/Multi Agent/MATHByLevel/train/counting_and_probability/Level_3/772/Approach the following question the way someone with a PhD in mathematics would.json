    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of five-digit palindromes, we must consider the possible combinations for the digits in the palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nFor a five-digit palindrome, the first two digits (thousands and hundreds) must be the same as the last two digits (tens and ones) in order for the number to be a palindrome. The middle digit can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 possible choices for the first digit (1 to 9, since a palindrome cannot start with 0) and 10 choices for the middle digit (0 to 9). Once the first two digits are chosen, the last two digits are determined.\n\nSo, the total number of five-digit palindromes is:\nNumber of choices for the first digit * Number of choices for the middle digit = 9 * 10 = 90\n\nTherefore, there are 90 five-digit palindromes.",
