    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of five-digit palindromes, we need to think about what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nFor a five-digit palindrome, we can think about the structure of the number. The first two digits must be the same as the last two digits in order to be a palindrome. So, we have the pattern ABCCBA, where A, B, and C are any digits from 0 to 9.\n\nTo find the number of five-digit palindromes, we can think about the different possibilities for A, B, and C. \n\nFor A, we have 10 choices (0-9).\nFor B, we also have 10 choices (0-9).\nFor C, we have 10 choices as well (0-9).\n\nSo, the total number of five-digit palindromes is:\n10 choices for A * 10 choices for B * 10 choices for C = 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 five-digit palindromes.\n\nTherefore, there are 1000 five-digit palindromes.",
