    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many different starting lineups are possible, we first need to determine how many players we have to choose from besides Ace and Zeppo. Since there are 12 players on the team and 2 are already chosen, we have 10 players left to pick from.\n\nTo create a 5-person starting lineup, we need to choose 3 players from the remaining 10. This can be done using the combination formula, which is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of choices and r is the number of choices we want to make.\n\nIn this case, we want to choose 3 players from 10, so the formula becomes 10C3 = 10! / (3!(10-3)!) = 10! / (3!7!) = (10 x 9 x 8) / (3 x 2 x 1) = 120.\n\nTherefore, there are 120 different starting lineups possible for the Grunters.",
