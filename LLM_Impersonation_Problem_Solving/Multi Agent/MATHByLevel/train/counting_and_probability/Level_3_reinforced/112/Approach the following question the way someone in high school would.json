    "solution": "From Pascal's identity $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\\binom{n-1}{k}=\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{14}=\\binom{27}{14}$, so $n=14$.\n\nWe know that $\\binom{27}{14}=\\binom{27}{27-14}=\\binom{27}{13}$.\n\nWe use Pascal's identity again to get $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{12}=\\binom{27}{13}$, so $n=12$.\n\nThere are two values for $n$, $12$ and $14$, so the sum is $12+14=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's review what the notation $\\binom{n}{k}$ means. It represents the number of ways to choose $k$ objects from a set of $n$ objects without regard to order. \n\nNow, let's look at the problem. We want to find all integer values of $n$ that satisfy the equation $\\binom{26}{13}+\\binom{26}{n}=\\binom{27}{14}$.\n\nIn order to find the sum of all integer values of $n$, we first need to simplify the equation. We know that $\\binom{26}{13}$ is equal to $\\binom{27}{13}$ because $\\binom{27}{13}$ is equal to $\\binom{27}{14}$. Therefore, the equation becomes $\\binom{27}{13} + \\binom{26}{n} = \\binom{27}{13}$. \n\nFrom here, we can see that $\\binom{26}{n} = 0$ because $\\binom{27}{13}$ is greater than $\\binom{26}{n}$ for any value of $n$. This means that there are no integer values of $n$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values $n$ for which the equation holds is $\\boxed{0}$.",
