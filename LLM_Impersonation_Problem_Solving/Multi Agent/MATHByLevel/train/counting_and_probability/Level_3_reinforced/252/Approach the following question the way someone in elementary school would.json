    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways we can put 4 balls into 2 boxes, we can use our fingers to help us count! \n\nLet's start by putting the first ball in the first box. We can put the ball in the box or leave it out, so we have 2 choices for the first ball.\n\nFor the second ball, we also have 2 choices - put it in the first box or the second box.\n\nFor the third ball, we again have 2 choices - put it in the first box, second box, or leave it out.\n\nAnd finally, for the fourth ball, we have 2 choices - put it in the first box, second box, or leave it out.\n\nNow we can use our fingers to help us multiply the choices for each ball: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16.\n\nSo, there are 16 different ways to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
