    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Our water polo team has 15 members.  I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many ways we can choose our starting team, first we need to choose the goalie. We have 15 people to choose from, so there are 15 ways to choose the goalie.\n\nAfter we have chosen the goalie, we need to choose the other 6 players to be on the starting team. Since the order doesn't matter, we can use combinations to find out how many ways this can be done. We can choose 6 players from the remaining 14 people on the team, which can be calculated by 14 choose 6.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose the starting team is 15 * (14 choose 6). We can find out the answer by multiplying these numbers together.",
