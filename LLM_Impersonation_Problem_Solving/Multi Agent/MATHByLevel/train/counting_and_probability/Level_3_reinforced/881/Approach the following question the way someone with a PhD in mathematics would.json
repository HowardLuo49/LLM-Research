    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box.  There is only $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5.  This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{462}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that all five balls drawn are white, we first need to determine the total number of ways to draw 5 balls from the box, and then calculate the number of ways to draw 5 white balls.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 5 balls out of the box of 11 balls (5 white and 6 black) can be calculated using combinations. The total number of ways to choose 5 balls out of 11 is C(11, 5) = 11! / (5! * 6!) = 462.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to draw 5 white balls out of the 5 white balls in the box. This can be done using combinations as well. The number of ways to choose 5 white balls out of the 5 white balls is C(5, 5) = 5! / (5! * 0!) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing 5 white balls can be calculated as the number of ways to draw 5 white balls divided by the total number of ways to draw 5 balls: 1/462 \u2248 0.00216 or approximately 0.216%.",
