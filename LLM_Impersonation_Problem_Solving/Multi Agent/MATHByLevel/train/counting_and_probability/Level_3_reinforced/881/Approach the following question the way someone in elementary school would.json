    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. A box contains 5 white balls and 6 black balls.  Five balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they all are white?",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{5} = 462$ ways to choose 5 balls out of the box.  There is only $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way to choose 5 white balls out of 5.  This means that the probability that all 5 balls are white is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{462}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's see. The box has 5 white balls and 6 black balls. First, we need to figure out how many total balls are in the box. So, we add the white and black balls together, which gives us 5 + 6 equals 11 total balls.\n\nNow, we want to know the probability of drawing 5 white balls out of the box. Since there are 5 white balls in total, the probability of drawing the first white ball is 5 out of 11, because there are 5 white balls out of 11 total balls.\n\nAfter drawing the first white ball, there are 4 white balls left in the box and 10 total balls left. So the probability of drawing a second white ball is 4 out of 10.\n\nWe keep doing this until we have drawn all 5 white balls. The probability for each draw is multiplied together to find the overall probability.\n\nSo, the probability of drawing all 5 white balls is (5/11) x (4/10) x (3/9) x (2/8) x (1/7) = 1/462.\n\nSo, the probability that all 5 balls drawn from the box are white is 1 out of 462. Wow, that's a pretty low chance!",
