    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Jason is trying to remember the five digit combination to his safe.  He knows that he only used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that every even digit was followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit was followed by an even digit.  How many possible combinations does Jason need to try?",
    "solution": "Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even.  If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit.  Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit.  Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on.  This would be a total of: $$3\\times2\\times3\\times2\\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit.  There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\\times3\\times2\\times3\\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\\boxed{180}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Jason wants to open his safe, but he forgot the combination. He only used the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. That's important to remember. He also remembers that every even number is followed by an odd number, and every odd number is followed by an even number. \n\nLet's try to figure this out: \n\nFirst we need to think about what the first number can be. There are 5 options: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n\nThen, we need to think about what the second number can be. If the first number was even, the second number has to be odd. That means if the first number was 2 or 4, the next number can only be 1, 3, or 5. So for the first number 4, there's 3 options for the second number. Same goes for the first number 2. \n\nIf the first number was odd, the second number has to be even. That means if the first number was 1, 3, or 5, the next number can only be 2 or 4. So for the first number 5, there's 2 options for the second number. Same goes for the first number 3 and 1. \n\nSo for each of the 5 options for the first number, there will be either 3 or 2 options for the second number. \n\nLet's try to list out all the possible combinations Jason needs to try: \n\n- If the first number is 1, the possible combinations are: 12, 14, 32, 34, 52\n- If the first number is 2, the possible combinations are: 23, 25, 43, 45\n- If the first number is 3, the possible combinations are: 31, 35, 53\n- If the first number is 4, the possible combinations are: 42, 54\n- If the first number is 5, the possible combinations are: 51\n\nSo Jason needs to try 10 possible combinations in total!",
