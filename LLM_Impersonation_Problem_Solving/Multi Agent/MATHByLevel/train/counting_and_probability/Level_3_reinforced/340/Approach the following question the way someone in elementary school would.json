    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. Paco uses a spinner to select a number from 1 through 5, each with equal probability. Manu uses a different spinner to select a number from 1 through 10, each with equal probability. What is the probability that the product of Manu's number and Paco's number is less than 30? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "A little casework seems like the simplest approach. First, if Paco spins a 1 or 2, it does not matter what Manu spins; the product is less than 30 regardless. If Paco spins a 3, the product will be 30 or greater only if Manu spins a 10, and both of these will be true with probability $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{50}$. If Paco spins a 4, Manu's spins of 8, 9 or 10 will tip us over the 30 barrier, and this with probability $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3}{50}$. If Paco spins a 5, Manu will break the 30 threshold with a 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, probabilities being $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}$. The total probability for these three cases is $\\frac{1+3+5}{50} = \\frac{9}{50}$. But, we want the probability that the product is less than 30, so we subtract our fraction from 1 and get $\\boxed{\\frac{41}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we need to see all the combinations that would result in a product less than 30. \n\nFor Paco's spinner, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For Manu's spinner, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. \n\nWe need to find all the combinations where the product is less than 30. These combinations are:\n\n1 x 1 = 1\n1 x 2 = 2\n1 x 3 = 3\n1 x 4 = 4\n1 x 5 = 5\n2 x 1 = 2\n2 x 2 = 4\n2 x 3 = 6\n2 x 4 = 8\n3 x 1 = 3\n3 x 2 = 6\n4 x 1 = 4\n5 x 1 = 5\n\nThere are 13 combinations that work. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of possible combinations.
