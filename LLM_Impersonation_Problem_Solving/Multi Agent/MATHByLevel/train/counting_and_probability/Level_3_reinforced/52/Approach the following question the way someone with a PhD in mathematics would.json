    "solution": "$43$ appears in the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle, since $\\binom{43}{1} = 43$. Note that $43$ is prime, so the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $43$ is actually $43$. Therefore, the $43$rd row is the first row in which $43$ appears. Also note that all the other numbers in the $43$rd row are greater than $43$, with the exception of the $1$'s on the ends. As a result, all the numbers on the following rows will either be $1$ or greater than $43$, so $43$ only appears in the $43$rd row. Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ row of Pascal's Triangle contains the number $43$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine how many rows of Pascal's Triangle contain the number $43$, we need to consider that Pascal's Triangle is constructed by summing the two numbers above to obtain the number in the current position. The $n$-th row of Pascal's Triangle has $n$ entries, so the $n$-th row corresponds to the $n$-th power in the expansion of $(a + b)^n$.\n\nThe $k$-th number in the $n$-th row of Pascal's Triangle is given by $\\binom{n}{k}$. In order to find the number of rows containing $43$, we need to solve the equation $\\binom{n}{k} = 43$. \n\nIn this case, since $43$ is prime, $43$ is only divisible by $1$ and itself. Therefore, one of the entries in a row of Pascal's Triangle that equals $43$ is when $n = 43$ and $k = 1$. Similarly, another instance is when $n = 43$ and $k = 42$. Since these are the only two possibilities for $n$, there are $2$ rows of Pascal's Triangle that contain the number $43$.",
