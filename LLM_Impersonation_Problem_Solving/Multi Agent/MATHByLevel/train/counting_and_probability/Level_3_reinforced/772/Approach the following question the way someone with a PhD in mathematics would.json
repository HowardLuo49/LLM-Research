    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of five-digit palindromes, we need to consider the possible combinations of digits that can form a palindrome. \n\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For a five-digit palindrome, the first two digits must be equal to the last two digits. This leaves us with three possible scenarios for constructing a palindrome:\n\n1. The first digit is equal to the last digit, and the second digit is equal to the fourth digit. For example, 12221.\n\n2. The first digit is equal to the last digit, and the second digit is not equal to the fourth digit. For example, 13331.\n\n3. The first digit is not equal to the last digit. For example, 12321.\n\nFor scenario 1, the first digit can be any of the numbers 1 through 9, and the second digit can be any of the numbers 0 through 9. This gives us a total of 9 * 10 = 90 possibilities.\n\nFor scenario 2, the first digit can be any of the numbers 1 through 9, the second digit can be any of the numbers 0 through 9 excluding the first digit, and the third digit can be any of the numbers 0 through 9. This gives us a total of 9 * 9 * 10 = 810 possibilities.\n\nFor scenario 3, the first digit can be any of the numbers 1 through 9, the second digit can be any of the numbers 0 through 9 excluding the first digit, and the third digit can be any of the numbers 0 through 9. This gives us a total of 9 * 9 * 10 = 810 possibilities.\n\nAdding up the possibilities from all three scenarios, we find that there are a total of 90 + 810 + 810 = 1710 five-digit palindromes.",
