    "solution": "A five-digit palindrome has digits in the form $abcba$.  Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.  There are 10 choices for each of $b$ and $c$.  Each different choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ creates a distinct five-digit palindrome, so there are a total of $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{900}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So for a five-digit palindrome, we need the first two digits to be the same as the last two digits.\n\nLet's try to think of all the possible combinations. We can start with the first digit, which can be any number from 1 to 9 (since it can't be 0 because then it wouldn't be a five-digit number). \n\nThen we need the next digit to be the same as the first one. So we have 9 options for the first digit, and 1 option for the second digit.\n\nThe third digit can be anything from 0 to 9, because it's in the middle and doesn't have to be the same as the first two digits. Same goes for the fourth digit.\n\nAnd finally, the fifth digit needs to be the same as the first one, so we only have 1 option for that.\n\nSo, to find the total number of five-digit palindromes, we multiply the number of options for each digit together: 9 (options for first digit) x 1 (options for second digit) x 10 (options for third digit) x 10 (options for fourth digit) x 1 (options for fifth digit) = 900. \n\nThere are 900 five-digit palindromes! Yay!",
