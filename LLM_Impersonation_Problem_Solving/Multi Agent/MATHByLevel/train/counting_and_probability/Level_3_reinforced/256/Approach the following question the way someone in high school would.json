    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle, we need to look at the row where the four-digit numbers start appearing. Since the first four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is 1001, we need to find the row where the second four-digit number appears.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula for finding the numbers in Pascal's triangle:\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nWe know that the 49th row contains the first four-digit number, so we can start looking at the numbers in the 50th row. The numbers in the 50th row are:\n1 50 1225 19600 230300 ...\n\nThe second smallest four-digit number in the 50th row is 1225. Therefore, the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is 1225.",
