    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle can be found by starting from the top of the triangle and working our way down until we find a four-digit number. \n\nStarting from the first row of Pascal's triangle, we have:\n1\n\nMoving to the second row:\n1   1\n\nMoving to the third row:\n1   2   1\n\nMoving to the fourth row:\n1   3   3   1\n\nMoving to the fifth row:\n1   4   6   4   1\n\nFrom examining the rows of Pascal's triangle, we can see that the second smallest four-digit number is 1001.",
