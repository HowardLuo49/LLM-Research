    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Ten distinct points are identified on the circumference of a circle. How many different convex quadrilaterals can be formed if each vertex must be one of these 10 points?",
    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",
    "gpt_response": "1. Let's first remember what a quadrilateral is - it's a shape with four sides and four corners!\n\n2. So we have ten points on the circle, and we need to make a shape with four of these points.\n\n3. Since we are making a shape with four corners, we need to choose four points from the ten on the circle.\n\n4. Let's start by choosing one point. We have ten choices for the first point!\n\n5. After we choose our first point, we have nine more points to choose from for our second point.\n\n6. Once we have our first two points, we have eight choices left for our third point.\n\n7. Now we only have seven choices left for our fourth point.\n\n8. But, wait! We need to remember that the order in which we choose the points does not matter, because we're making a shape, not a sequence.\n\n9. So to find out how many different quadrilaterals we can make, we need to divide the total number of ways we can choose the points by the number of ways to arrange each set of four points.\n\n10. So, we have 10 choices for the first point, 9 choices for the second point, 8 choices for the third point, and 7 choices for the fourth point. That gives us 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 = 5040 ways to choose the points. But since the order doesn't matter, we need to divide by 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 (4! ways to arrange four points), giving us 5040 / 24 = 210 different convex quadrilaterals we can form on the circle!",
