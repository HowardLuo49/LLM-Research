    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many combinations of pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents) and/or dimes (10 cents) are there with a total value of 25 cents?",
    "solution": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we can use generating functions and combinatorics. Let's represent the value of a penny, nickel, and dime as x, x^5, and x^10 respectively. \n\nThe number of ways to form a total value of 25 cents using only pennies, nickels, and dimes can be found by considering the coefficient of x^25 in the expansion of the generating function \n\n(1 + x + x^2 + ...)(1 + x^5 + x^10 + ...)(1 + x^10 + x^20 + ...)\n\nThis expansion represents all the possible combinations of pennies, nickels, and dimes that sum up to 25 cents. By multiplying out the three polynomials and identifying the coefficient of x^25, we can determine the number of ways to form a total value of 25 cents using the given denominations.\n\nAs a PhD in mathematics, one can use techniques in combinatorics and generating functions to effectively tackle problems involving coin combinations and value summation.",
