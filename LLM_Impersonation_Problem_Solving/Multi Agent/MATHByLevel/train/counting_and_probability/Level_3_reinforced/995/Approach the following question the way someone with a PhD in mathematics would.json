Each team has an equal chance of winning each game. What is the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Precisely one team must win at least four games.  Since the teams are equally matched, this team will be the Badgers with probability $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games out of seven, we can use the binomial distribution formula. \n\nLet X be the random variable representing the number of games the Badgers win out of seven. Since each game is independent and the probability of winning a game is 0.5, we have a binomial distribution with parameters n=7 (number of games) and p=0.5 (probability of winning a game).\n\nThe probability of winning at least four games out of seven is:\nP(X >= 4) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + P(X = 7)\n\nUsing the binomial distribution formula, we can calculate each term:\nP(X = k) = (7 choose k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(7-k) = (7 choose k) * 0.5^7\n\nPlugging in the values for k=4, 5, 6, 7:\nP(X = 4) = (7 choose 4) * 0.5^7 = 35 * (1/128) = 35/128\nP(X = 5) = (7 choose 5) * 0.5^7 = 21 * (1/128) = 21/128\nP(X = 6) = (7 choose 6) * 0.5^7 = 7 * (1/128) = 7/128\nP(X = 7) = (7 choose 7) * 0.5^7 = 1 * (1/128) = 1/128\n\nFinally, adding up all these probabilities:\nP(X >= 4) = 35/128 + 21/128 + 7/128 + 1/128 = 64/128 = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability that the Badgers will win at least four games out of seven is 1/2.",
