Two distinct numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. What is the probability that their product is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We will use complementary counting for this problem, which is a big fancy term for saying we will determine the probability of the event we want NOT occuring. Then we will subtract our answer from 1 to get the real answer. So, what is the probability of the product being an odd number? This is an easier question to answer because it requires that both numbers be odd. There are a total of ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of distinct numbers, and with only 3 of them odd, ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ pairs of odd numbers. So, the probability of having an odd product is $\\frac{3}{10}$, leaving the probability of an even product being $1- \\frac{3}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is even, we must consider the different cases where the product is even. \n\nAn even number can be obtained by multiplying an even number with either an even or odd number. \n\nLet's first find the probability of selecting two even numbers. There are 2 even numbers in the set, 2 and 4, so the probability of selecting an even number on the first draw is $\\frac{2}{5}$. After selecting the first even number, there will be 4 numbers left, with 1 even number remaining, so the probability of selecting another even number on the second draw is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Thus, the probability of selecting two even numbers is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}$. \n\nNow, let's find the probability of selecting an odd number and an even number. There are 3 odd numbers and 2 even numbers in the set, so the probability of selecting an odd number on the first draw is $\\frac{3}{5}$. After selecting an odd number, there will be 4 numbers left, with 2 even numbers remaining, so the probability of selecting an even number on the second draw is $\\frac{2}{4}$. Thus, the probability of selecting an odd number and an even number is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{10}$. \n\nSince these are the only two cases where the product is even, the total probability of selecting two distinct numbers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ such that their product is even is $\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two selected numbers is an even number is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
