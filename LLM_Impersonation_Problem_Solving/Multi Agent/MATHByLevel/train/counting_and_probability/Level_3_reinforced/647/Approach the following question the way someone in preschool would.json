    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Two distinct numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. What is the probability that their product is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "We will use complementary counting for this problem, which is a big fancy term for saying we will determine the probability of the event we want NOT occuring. Then we will subtract our answer from 1 to get the real answer. So, what is the probability of the product being an odd number? This is an easier question to answer because it requires that both numbers be odd. There are a total of ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ pairs of distinct numbers, and with only 3 of them odd, ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ pairs of odd numbers. So, the probability of having an odd product is $\\frac{3}{10}$, leaving the probability of an even product being $1- \\frac{3}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the even numbers in our set. Hmm, we have 2 and 4. That's two even numbers.\n\nNow let's think about how we can get an even product. We can get an even product by multiplying an even number with either another even number or an odd number.\n\nSo, we have two even numbers to choose from for the first number, and we can choose any number (even or odd) for the second number. That means we have a total of $2 \\times 5 = 10$ ways to choose two numbers.\n\nOut of those 10 ways, we can only choose two even numbers together in 1 way (2 and 4), so that's 1 way.\n\nTherefore, the probability of choosing two numbers that have an even product is $\\frac{1}{10}$.",
