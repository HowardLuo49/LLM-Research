    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many even three digit numbers are there such that the sum of the  tens and units digits is 10?",
    "solution": "There are nine possible digits that the hundreds digit could be. However, there are only four possible endings for the number: 46, 64, 28, and 82. Thus, there are $9 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{36}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to set up a system of equations. Let's represent the three-digit number as XYZ, where X represents the hundreds digit, Y represents the tens digit, and Z represents the units digit.\n\nSince we are looking for even numbers, Z must be an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). \n\nWe are given that the sum of the tens and units digits is 10, so we have the equation Y + Z = 10.\n\nSince Y can take on values from 0 to 9 and Z can only be even, let's pair up the possible values of Y and Z that satisfy the equation Y + Z = 10:\n\n(Y=2, Z=8),\n(Y=4, Z=6),\n(Y=6, Z=4),\n(Y=8, Z=2).\n\nTherefore, there are four pairs of Y and Z that satisfy the given condition.\n\nNow, considering the values of X, X can be any digit from 1 to 9 (as 0 cannot be the hundreds digit).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 4 possible values for Y and Z and 9 possible values for X, resulting in a total of 4 * 9 = 36 even three-digit numbers where the sum of the tens and units digits is 10.",
