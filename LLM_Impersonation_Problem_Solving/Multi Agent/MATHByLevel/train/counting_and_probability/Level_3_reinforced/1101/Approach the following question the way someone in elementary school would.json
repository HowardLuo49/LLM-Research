    "solution": "In eight of the twelve outcomes the product is even: $1\\times 2$, $2\\times\n1$, $2\\times 2$, $2\\times 3$, $3\\times 2$, $4\\times 1$, $4\\times 2$, $4\\times 3$. In four of the twelve, the product is odd: $1\\times 1$, $1\\times 3$, $3\\times 1$, $3\\times 3$. So the probability that the product is even is $\\frac{8}{12}$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\nOR\n\nTo get an odd product, the result of both spins must be odd. The probability of odd is $\\frac{1}{2}$ on Spinner $A$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ on Spinner $B$. So the probability of an odd product is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of an even product, then, is $1-\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
