    "solution": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits, we can use the complement method. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of three-digit whole numbers. Since the first digit can't be 0, we have 9 options for the first digit (1-9), and 10 options for the second and third digits (0-9). So there are 9 x 10 x 10 = 900 three-digit whole numbers in total. \n\nNext, let's find the number of three-digit whole numbers that do not have a 7 or 9 as digits. Since there are 8 options for the first digit (1-6, 8), and 8 options for the second and third digits (0-6, 8), there are 8 x 8 x 8 = 512 three-digit whole numbers without a 7 or 9. \n\nNow, to find the number of three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or at least one 9, we subtract the number of three-digit whole numbers without a 7 or 9 from the total number of three-digit whole numbers: 900 - 512 = 388 three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits. \n\nSo, the answer is that 388 three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits.",
