Tyler has entered a buffet line in which he chooses one kind of meat, two different vegetables and one dessert.  If the order of food items is not important, how many different meals might he choose?\n\n$\\bullet$  Meat: beef, chicken, pork\n\n$\\bullet$  Vegetables: baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes\n\n$\\bullet$  Dessert: brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream",

Then he can choose 2 different vegetables out of 4 (baked beans, corn, potatoes, tomatoes). Finally, he can choose 1 dessert out of 4 (brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, ice cream). \n\nTo find the total number of different meals he can choose, we need to multiply the number of choices for each category.
