    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we need to know the rule for determining if a number is divisible by 3. The rule is that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3.\n\nSince we know that the ones digit of $N$ is 3, we need to determine what the other two digits could be. The sum of the digits must be divisible by 3, so the possibilities for the other two digits are 0 and 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 possibilities for the other two digits (03 and 63) out of a total of 10*10 = 100 possible three-digit numbers (since there are 10 options for each of the other two digits).\n\nSo, the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3 is $\\frac{2}{100} = \\frac{1}{50}$. So the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
