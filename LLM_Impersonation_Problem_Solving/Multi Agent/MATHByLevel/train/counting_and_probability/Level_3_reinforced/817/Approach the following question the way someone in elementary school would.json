    "solution": "Because the women are of different heights, any handshake will take place between two people, one of whom is taller than the other. Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself. Applying this logic to all of the pairs, there are $\\boxed{0}$ handshakes.",

The second tallest woman also won't shake hands with anyone because everyone else is shorter than her too. The third tallest woman won't shake hands with the tallest two women, but she will shake hands with the shortest five women. So, there will be 5 handshakes. Great job!",
