    "solution": "There are two O's, two I's, two N's and eleven total letters, so the answer is $\\dfrac{11!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{4,\\!989,\\!600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION, we can use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements. \n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of letters in the word COMBINATION. The word has 11 letters, with 2 O's, 2 N's, and 2 I's that are repeated.\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION is calculated as:\n\n11! / (2! * 2! * 2!)\n\n= 11! / (2 * 2 * 2)\n\n= 39916800 / 8\n\n= 4989600\n\nTherefore, there are 4,989,600 ways to arrange the letters of the word COMBINATION.",
