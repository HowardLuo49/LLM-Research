    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits?",
    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the total number of three-digit whole numbers without any restrictions, and then subtract the number of three-digit whole numbers that have at least one 7 or 9 as a digit.\n\nThere are 9 choices for the first digit (1-6, 8, 0), 8 choices for the second digit (excluding 7 and 9), and 8 choices for the third digit (excluding 7 and 9). Therefore, the total number of three-digit whole numbers without any restrictions is 9*8*8 = 576.\n\nTo calculate the number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or 9 as a digit, we can consider the complement of this set - the number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and 9's. Just like above, there are 7 choices for the first digit (1-6, 8, 0), 8 choices for the second digit (excluding 7 and 9), and 8 choices for the third digit (excluding 7 and 9). Therefore, the number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and 9's is 7*8*8 = 448.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and 9's from the total number of three-digit whole numbers to get the desired result: 576 - 448 = 128. Therefore, there are 128 three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits.",
