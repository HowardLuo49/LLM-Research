    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. How many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits?",
    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how many three-digit numbers we can make without using the numbers 7 or 9. We have to make sure that the first digit is not 7 or 9, the second digit is not 7 or 9, and the third digit is not 7 or 9.\n\nSo, let's start with the first digit. We have 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) for the first digit.\n\nThen, for the second digit, we also have 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) since we can't use 7 or 9.\n\nFinally, for the third digit, we also have 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8).\n\nSo, to find the total number of three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits, we just multiply our choices together:\n\n8 x 8 x 8 = 512\n\nTherefore, there are 512 three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits. Yay!",
