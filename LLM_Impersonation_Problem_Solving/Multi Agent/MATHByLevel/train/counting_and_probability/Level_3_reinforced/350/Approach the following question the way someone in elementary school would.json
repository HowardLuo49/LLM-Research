    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits, we can think about each digit separately. Since we can't have any 7's or 9's, we can only choose from the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. \n\nFor the hundreds place, we have 7 options (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\nFor the tens place, we also have 7 options.\nFor the ones place, we have 6 options (we can't choose 0, 7, or 9).\n\nTo find the total number of possible three-digit numbers, we multiply the number of options for each place: 7 x 7 x 6 = 294 possible numbers.\n\nSo, there are 294 three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's as digits.",
