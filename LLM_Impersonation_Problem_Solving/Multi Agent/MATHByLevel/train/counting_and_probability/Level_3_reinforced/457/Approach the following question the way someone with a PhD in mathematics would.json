    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$. Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\dfrac{720}{8} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR, we first note that the word has 6 letters in total. However, two of the letters are repeated: there are two Rs and three As. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR is given by the formula:\n\n6! / (2! * 3!)\n\nWhere 6! represents the total number of ways to arrange all 6 letters, and the division by 2! and 3! accounts for the repetitions of the letters. \n\nCalculating this expression, we find:\n\n6! = 720\n2! = 2\n3! = 6\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR is:\n\n720 / (2 * 6) = 720 / 12 = 60\n\nTherefore, there are 60 different ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR.",
