    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$. Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\dfrac{720}{8} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR, we first need to count the total number of letters in the word. Here, we have 6 letters.\n\nSince the word TARTAR has repeated letters, we need to account for this when calculating the number of arrangements. In this case, the letter 'T' appears 2 times, the letter 'A' appears 2 times, and the letter 'R' appears 2 times.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the letters in the word TARTAR can be calculated using the formula for permutations with repetitions: n! / (n1! * n2! * n3! * ...), where n is the total number of letters and n1, n2, n3, ... are the number of repetitions for each letter.\n\nUsing this formula, the number of ways to arrange the letters in TARTAR is 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 ways to arrange the letters in the word TARTAR.",
