    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the number of ways in which 6 distinct beads can be placed on a bracelet, we must consider the groupings of rotations and reflections that leave the arrangement unchanged. \n\nSince there are 6 distinct beads, there are 6! = 720 total ways to arrange them in a linear fashion. However, we must divide by 6 to account for the rotations of the bracelet that leave the arrangement unchanged. This gives us 720/6 = 120 unique ways to arrange the beads on the bracelet.\n\nAdditionally, we must consider reflections of the arrangement. For each unique arrangement, there are 2 reflections (clockwise and counterclockwise) that produce the same arrangement. Therefore, we must divide by 2 to account for these reflections, giving us a total of 120/2 = 60 unique ways to arrange the beads on the bracelet while taking into account rotations and reflections.\n\nTherefore, there are 60 unique ways in which 6 distinct beads can be placed on a bracelet.",
