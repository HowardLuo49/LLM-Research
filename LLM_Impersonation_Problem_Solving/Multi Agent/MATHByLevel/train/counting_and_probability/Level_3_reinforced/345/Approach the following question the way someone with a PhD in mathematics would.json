    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the nature of prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. The first seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nTo calculate the total number of ways two distinct prime numbers can be selected from the first seven primes, we can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from (in this case, 7), and k is the number of items to choose (in this case, 2). \n\nTherefore, there are C(7,2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 21 ways to select two distinct prime numbers from the first seven primes.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways the sum of the two selected numbers will be even. For the sum of two numbers to be even, both numbers must be either even or odd. Since 2 is the only even prime number, there are 3 ways to choose two even prime numbers (2 and 2, 2 and 5, 2 and 7) and 7 ways to choose two odd prime numbers (3 and 5, 3 and 7, 3 and 11, 5 and 7, 5 and 11, 7 and 11, 11 and 13).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the sum of the two selected numbers will be even is 3 + 7 = 10.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability that the sum of the two selected numbers will be even by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of successful outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 10 / 21 = 5/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of two distinct numbers selected at random from the first seven prime numbers will be even is 5/11.",
