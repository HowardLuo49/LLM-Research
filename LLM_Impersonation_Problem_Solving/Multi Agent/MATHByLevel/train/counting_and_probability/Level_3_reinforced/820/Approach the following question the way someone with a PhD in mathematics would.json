    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two different  numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. What is the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive. There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total. So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{15}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is 2 or greater, we first need to determine the total number of ways we can choose two numbers out of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. This can be done using combinations, which is given by the formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of elements and $k$ is the number of elements we are choosing.\n\nIn this case, we are choosing 2 numbers out of 7, so the total number of ways is $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = 21$.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where the positive difference between the two numbers is 2 or greater. We have the following possibilities: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7).\n\nThere are a total of 15 favorable outcomes where the positive difference between the two numbers is 2 or greater.\n\nTherefore, the probability is given by $\\frac{15}{21} = \\frac{5}{7}$. \n\nSo, the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is 2 or greater is $\\frac{5}{7}$.",
