    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Ben rolls 5 fair 12-sided dice.  The 12 faces of each die are numbered from 1 to 12. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we first need to figure out the total number of possible outcomes. Since there are 12 sides on each die, there are a total of 12^5 possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways we can get exactly two even numbers when rolling the dice. There are 6 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) on each die, so we have 6 choices for each of the two dice that will show even numbers. The other three dice will have 6 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) to choose from. So, the number of ways to get exactly two even numbers is 6C2 * 6^3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of ways to get exactly two even numbers by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is (6C2 * 6^3)/12^5. \n\nThis calculation will give us the final answer as a decimal or fraction, which represents the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number.",
