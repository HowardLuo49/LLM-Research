    "solution": "There are $\\binom{12}{3} = \\boxed{220}$ ways to pick any 3 points, which we assume to determine a unique plane.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of unique planes that can be formed by a given number of points in space, we must first understand the conditions under which a plane is uniquely determined by three non-collinear points.\n\nGiven three non-collinear points in space, there is only one plane that passes through all three points. This is because any two of the points uniquely determine a line, and the third point can only lie on one plane that contains that line.\n\nNow, if we have 12 points in space, we can think about selecting sets of three points from this total. The number of ways to choose 3 points from 12 is given by the binomial coefficient \"12 choose 3,\" which is calculated as:\n\nC(12,3) = 12! / (3!(12-3)!) = 12! / (3! * 9!) = 220\n\nTherefore, there are 220 unique planes that can be determined by choosing any combination of 3 points from the set of 12 points in space.
