    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we are looking to choose a starting lineup of 4 players from a team of 10 members. We can first calculate the number of ways to select the offensive lineman as there are only 3 choices for this position.\n\nNext, we can choose the quarterback from the remaining 9 players in 9 ways. Then, we can choose the running back from the remaining 8 players in 8 ways. Finally, we can choose the wide receiver from the remaining 7 players in 7 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver is:\n\n3 * 9 * 8 * 7 = 1512.\n\nThus, there are 1512 ways to choose the starting lineup for the football team given the specified constraints.",
