    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability, we need to first figure out how many outcomes will result in an odd product.\n\nFirst, let's think about what numbers multiplied together result in an odd number. An odd number can only be obtained when one or more of the numbers being multiplied is odd.\n\nOn a standard die, there are three odd numbers: 1, 3, and 5.\n\nSo for the product of all six rolls to be odd, at least one of the rolls must be odd. In other words, the only way the product could be odd is if at least one of the rolls is odd. \n\nTo find the probability of this happening, let's find the probability of all rolls being even and then subtract that from 1.\n\nOn a standard die, there are three even numbers: 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the probability of all six rolls being even is (1/2)^6 = 1/64.\n\nTherefore, the probability of at least one of the rolls being odd (and thus the product being odd) is 1 - 1/64 = 63/64.\n\nSo, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 63/64.",
