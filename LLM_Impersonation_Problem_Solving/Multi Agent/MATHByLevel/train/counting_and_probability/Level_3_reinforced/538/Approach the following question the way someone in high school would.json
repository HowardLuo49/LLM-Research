    "solution": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd, we need to consider what makes a number odd when it is the product of multiple numbers.\n\nAn odd number can only result when at least one of the factors is odd. Since all numbers on a standard die are odd (1, 3, 5), every roll will result in an odd number.\n\nTo find the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd, we calculate the probability of an odd number appearing on each roll.\n\nThe probability of rolling an odd number on a standard die is 3/6 or 1/2.\n\nSince there are 6 rolls and the probability of getting an odd number on each roll is 1/2, we multiply the probabilities together to find the overall probability:\n\n(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/64\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is 1/64.",
