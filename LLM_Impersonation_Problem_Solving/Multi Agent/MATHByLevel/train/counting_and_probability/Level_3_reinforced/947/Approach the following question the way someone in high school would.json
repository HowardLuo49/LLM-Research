    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Using only the digits 7, 8 and 9, how many positive seven-digit integers can be made that are palindromes?",
    "solution": "Since we need to make a palindrome, it only matters what we pick for the first 4 digits, since the other three are reflections of the first three.  Therefore, since each of them has 3 possibilities, our total is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To create a palindrome, we need the first 3 digits to be the same as the last 3 digits. Let's consider the possible numbers for the middle digit.\n\nIf the middle digit is 7, there are 3 choices for the first and last digits (7, 8, 9). So, the total number of palindromes with a middle digit of 7 is 3.\n\nIf the middle digit is 8, there are 3 choices for the first and last digits (7, 8, 9). So, the total number of palindromes with a middle digit of 8 is also 3.\n\nIf the middle digit is 9, there are 3 choices for the first and last digits (7, 8, 9). So, the total number of palindromes with a middle digit of 9 is 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive seven-digit integers that can be made that are palindromes is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.",
