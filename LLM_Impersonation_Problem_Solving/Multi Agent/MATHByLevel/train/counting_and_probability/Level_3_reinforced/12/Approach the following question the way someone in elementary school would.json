    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to figure out how we can get $x^8$ when we expand $(x-1)^9$. To get $x^8$, we need to choose the $x$ term from $(x-1)$ 8 times and the $-1$ term 1 time. This means we need to find the combination of choosing x terms from 9 terms, so we can use the combination formula $C(n,r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. Plugging in n=9 and r=8, we get $C(9,8) = \\frac{9!}{8!1!} = 9$. So, the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$ is 9.",
