The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
    "solution": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row of Pascal's Triangle, we can start by finding the interior numbers in the sixth row.\n\nThe interior numbers in the fifth row were 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. To find the interior numbers in the sixth row, we add each pair of adjacent numbers from the fifth row. So, the interior numbers of the sixth row would be 1+4=5, 4+6=10, 6+4=10, 4+1=5.\n\nNow, to find the sum of the interior numbers in the sixth row, we add 5+10+10+5=30.\n\nTo find the interior numbers in the seventh row, we add each pair of adjacent numbers from the sixth row. The interior numbers in the seventh row would be 1+5=6, 5+10=15, 10+10=20, 10+5=15, 5+1=6.\n\nLastly, to find the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row, we add 6+15+20+15+6=62. Therefore, the sum of the interior numbers in the seventh row is 62.",
