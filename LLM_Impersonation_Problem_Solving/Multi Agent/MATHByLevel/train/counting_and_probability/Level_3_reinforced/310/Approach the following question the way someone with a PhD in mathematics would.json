    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. There are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors, we can consider the possible outcomes for the second chip given that the first chip is either blue or yellow.\n\nIf the first chip drawn is blue, then there are still 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in the bag, so the probability of drawing a yellow chip on the second draw is 3/8.\n\nIf the first chip drawn is yellow, then there are still 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in the bag, so the probability of drawing a blue chip on the second draw is 5/8.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of drawing two chips of different colors is the sum of the probabilities of the two cases:\n\n(5/8)*(3/8) + (3/8)*(5/8) = 15/64 + 15/64 = 30/64 = 15/32\n\nSo, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is 15/32.",
