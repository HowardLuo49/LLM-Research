Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
    "solution": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break it down:\n- Bertha has 6 daughters, so she is one of them. That leaves 5 daughters.\n- Some of Bertha's daughters have 6 daughters, which means there are 5 daughters who have 6 daughters each.\n- The rest of Bertha's daughters have none, which means there are 5 daughters who have no daughters.\n- So, in total, Bertha has 6 daughters + 5 daughters with 6 daughters each + 5 daughters with no daughters = 16 daughters.\n- Since each of those 5 daughters with 6 daughters each have a total of 7 descendants (6 daughters + themselves), there are 5 * 7 = 35 granddaughters in total.\n- Together with Bertha's original 6 daughters, there are now 16 + 35 = 51 daughters and granddaughters.\n- Subtracting the number of granddaughters (35), we are left with 51 - 35 = 16 daughters.\n- Therefore, 16 of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters.",
