    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ that end with the digit $3$, we need to consider the pattern of the last digit of the multiples of $7$. \n\nThe last digit of the multiples of $7$ follows the pattern: $7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 0, 7, ...$ \n\nSince we are looking for multiples that end with the digit $3$, we only need to consider every third multiple in the sequence. \n\nStarting with $3$ as the last digit, the multiples of $7$ that end with the digit $3$ are: $63, 133, 203, 273, ..., 903, 973$. \n\nTo find the total number of such multiples less than $1000$, we can divide $1000$ by $10$ to find that there are $100$ multiples of $7$ less than $1000$. \n\nDividing this by $10$ again, we find that there are $10$ multiples of $7$ less than $100$ that end with the digit $3$. \n\nTherefore, under $1000$, there are $10$ positive multiples of $7$ that end with the digit $3.",
