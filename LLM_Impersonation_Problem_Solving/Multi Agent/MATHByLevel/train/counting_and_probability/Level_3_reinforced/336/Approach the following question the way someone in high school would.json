    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to determine the first positive multiple of $7$ that ends in the digit $3$. We know that $7 \\times 1 = 7$ and $7 \\times 2 = 14$, but neither of these end in $3$. However, $7 \\times 5 = 35$, which does end in $3$. \n\nNext, we need to find the pattern of the last digit of multiples of $7$. We can observe that the last digit of multiples of $7$ alternate between $7$ and $3$: $7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 0$.\n\nSince the pattern repeats every $4$ multiples, we can determine the number of multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ that end in $3$ by counting in groups of $4$. \n\nFrom $35$ until $1000$, the last digit of the multiples of $7$ that end in $3$ are: $3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, ...$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\frac{1000 - 35}{4} + 1 = 242$ positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ and end with the digit $3$.",
