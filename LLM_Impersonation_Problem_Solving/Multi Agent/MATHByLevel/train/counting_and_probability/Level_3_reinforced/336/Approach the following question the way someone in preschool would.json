    "solution": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count together! We know that the multiples of $7$ are $7$, $14$, $21$, $28$, and so on. Let's look for the ones that end with a $3$. \nSo, we have $63$, $133$, $203$, $273$, $343$ and so on. \nLet's keep counting until we reach less than $1000$. \nI see that the last number that ends with a $3$ and is less than $1000$ is $973$. \nSo, there are $14$ positive multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ that end with the digit $3$.

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. The final solution is not 14. The final solution is 13, as there are 13 positive multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 (including 973).",
