    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 have integer side lengths, we can start by listing out all the possible combinations of side lengths that add up to 7. \n\nLet's start with the smallest possible side length of 1. If one side is 1, the other two sides must add up to 6. The possible combinations are (1,2,4) and (1,3,3). \n\nIf we try the next smallest side length of 2, the other two sides must add up to 5. The only possible combination is (2,2,3). \n\nTherefore, there are only 3 non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 7 that have integer side lengths.",
