    "solution": "We compute the probability that the sum is three or less and subtract from 1. A sum of 2 or 3 can be obtained only with the following tosses: $(1,1), (2,1), (1,2)$. There are 36 total toss possibilities, so the probability of getting a sum of 2 or 3 is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 3 is $1-\\frac{1}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the sum of two dice is greater than three, we must first establish all the possible outcomes of tossing two dice. \n\nThere are 36 possible outcomes when two dice are tossed, as each die has 6 faces with values from 1 to 6.
