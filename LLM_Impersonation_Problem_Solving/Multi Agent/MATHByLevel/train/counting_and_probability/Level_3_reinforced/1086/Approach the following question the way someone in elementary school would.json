    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so Jenna and her friends want to ride the roller coaster, but only three people can go in each car. Let's figure out how many different groups of three they can make.\n\nFirst, let's count how many different ways Jenna and her friends can choose three people from the group of five. We can use a formula for this called combinations. The formula is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of people and r is the number of people we want to choose.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 5 and r = 3. \n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n\n5C3 = 5! / 3!(5-3)!\n       = 5! / 3!2!\n       = (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) / (3 x 2 x 1 x 2 x 1)\n       = (120) / (6 x 2)\n       = (120) / 12\n       = 10\n\nSo, Jenna and her friends can make 10 different groups of three to ride the roller coaster. Have fun at the fair, Jenna!",
