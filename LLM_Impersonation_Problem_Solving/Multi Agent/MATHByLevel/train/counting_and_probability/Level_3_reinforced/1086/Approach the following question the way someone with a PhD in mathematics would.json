    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jenna is at a fair with four friends. They all want to ride the roller coaster, but only three people can fit in a car. How many different groups of three can the five of them make?",
    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. We need to choose 3 people from a group of 5. This can be represented as \"5 choose 3\", which is denoted as C(5,3) in combinatorial notation. \n\nThe formula for combinations is given as:\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nSubstituting n = 5 and k = 3 into the formula, we get:\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!)\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\nC(5,3) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / [(3 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1)]\nC(5,3) = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 different groups of three that Jenna and her friends can make to ride the roller coaster.",
