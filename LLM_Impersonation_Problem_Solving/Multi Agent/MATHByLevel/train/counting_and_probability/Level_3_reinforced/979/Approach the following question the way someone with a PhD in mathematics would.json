    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In a single-elimination tournament, each game is between two players. Only the winner of each game advances to the next round. In a particular such tournament there are 256 players. How many individual games must be played to determine the champion?",
    "solution": "A total of 255 players must be eliminated to determine the champion, and one player is eliminated after each game, so it is easy to see that $\\boxed{255}$ games must be played.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of individual games that must be played in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players, we can first calculate the total number of games played in each round before the final round. \n\nIn the first round, there will be 256 players playing 128 games. In the second round, there will be 128 players playing 64 games. This pattern continues until there is only one player left to be crowned the champion. \n\nTo determine the total number of games played in the tournament, we sum up the number of games played in each round. \n\nNumber of games in the first round: 128\nNumber of games in the second round: 64\nNumber of games in the third round: 32\nNumber of games in the fourth round: 16\nNumber of games in the fifth round: 8\nNumber of games in the sixth round: 4\nNumber of games in the seventh round: 2\nNumber of games in the eighth round (final round): 1\n\nAdding up all these individual games gives us:\n\n128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255\n\nTherefore, a total of 255 individual games must be played in a single-elimination tournament with 256 players to determine the champion.",
