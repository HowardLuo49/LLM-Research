    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are?",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we need only count the number of balls in the distinguishable boxes.  We can put 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 balls in Box 1 (and the rest go in Box 2).  So there are $\\boxed{6}$ different arrangements.",
    "gpt_response": "In this problem, we have 5 balls and 2 boxes. The balls all look the same, but the boxes are different. We need to figure out how many ways we can put the 5 balls into the 2 boxes.\n\nSince the balls all look the same, it doesn't matter which ball goes in which box. We just care about how many balls are in each box.\n\nWe can use a method called \"stars and bars\" to solve this problem. Imagine each ball as a star and each box as a bar. We need to place the bars in between the stars to divide them into groups.\n\nSo, we have 5 stars (balls) and 1 bar (since there are 2 boxes, there is only 1 division needed). The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is the same as the number of ways to put the balls in the boxes.\n\nThe formula for the number of ways is (n + k - 1) choose (k - 1), where n is the total number of objects (stars + bars) and k is the number of groups we are splitting them into.\n\nSo, using our formula, we have (5 + 2 - 1) choose (2 - 1) = 6 choose 1 = 6 ways.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ways to put 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
