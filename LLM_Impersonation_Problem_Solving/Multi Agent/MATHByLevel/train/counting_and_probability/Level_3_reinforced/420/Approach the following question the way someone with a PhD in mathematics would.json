    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
    "solution": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total number of ways the four students can stand in a straight line, ignoring the restriction that two of the students cannot stand next to each other. \n\nThe total number of ways four students can stand in a straight line is given by 4 factorial, which is denoted as 4!. \n\nNow, we need to consider the restriction that two of the students cannot stand next to each other. Let's denote the two students who cannot stand next to each other as A and B. We will consider them as a single entity, denoted as AB. \n\nSo now, we have three entities: AB, C, and D. These three entities can be arranged in 3! ways. However, within the entity AB, A and B can be arranged in 2! ways. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the four students can stand in a straight line with the restriction is given by:\nTotal ways = (4! - 2!*3!) = 24 - 12 = 12.\n\nThus, there are 12 different ways the four students can stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other.",
