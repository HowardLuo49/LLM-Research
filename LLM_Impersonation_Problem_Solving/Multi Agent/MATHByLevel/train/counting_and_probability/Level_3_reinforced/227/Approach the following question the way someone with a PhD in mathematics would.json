    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular octagon, we need to consider the different ways in which three vertices can be chosen. \n\nSince there are 8 vertices in a regular octagon, we can choose 3 of these vertices in \\( \\binom{8}{3} \\) ways. Applying the formula for combinations, this equals \\(\\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8*7*6}{3*2*1} = 56 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 56 different triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a regular octagon.",
