I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into cases:\n\nCase 1: The two identical characters are letters\nThere are 26 possibilities for the first letter, 1 possibility for the second letter (since it must be the same as the first), and 10 possibilities for the digit. This gives a total of 26*1*10 = 260 possibilities.\n\nCase 2: The two identical characters are digits\nThere are 26 possibilities for the letter, 10 possibilities for the first digit, and 1 possibility for the second digit (since it must be the same as the first). This gives a total of 26*10*1 = 260 possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose a license plate with these restrictions is 260 + 260 = 520.",
