I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by picking the letter for the first character. There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so we have 26 choices for that. \n\nNext, let's choose the middle character. It can be either a letter or a digit, so we have 36 choices for that (26 letters + 10 digits).\n\nNow, let's move on to the last character which has to be a digit. There are 10 choices for that.\n\nSince we want two of the characters to be the same, we need to decide which character it will be. This means we have 3 choices: the first, second, or third character.\n\nPutting it all together, we multiply the number of choices for each character: 26 choices for the first character * 36 choices for the middle character * 10 choices for the last character * 3 choices for which character to be the same.\n\nTherefore, there are 26 * 36 * 10 * 3 = 28,080 ways to choose a license plate with these restrictions.
