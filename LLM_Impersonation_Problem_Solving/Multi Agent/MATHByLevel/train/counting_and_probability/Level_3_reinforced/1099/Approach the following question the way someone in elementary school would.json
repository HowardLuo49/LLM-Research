I want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many ways you can choose a license plate with those rules, we have to think about all the different possibilities. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's think about the options for the first character on the license plate. Since it has to be a letter, there are 26 letters in the alphabet to choose from.\n\nNext, let's think about the middle character on the license plate. It can be either a letter or a digit. So there are 26 letters + 10 digits = 36 options to choose from.\n\nNow, let's think about the last character on the license plate. It has to be a digit, so there are 10 digits to choose from.\n\nSince you want two characters on your license plate to be the same, we have to think about how many ways we can choose those matching characters. There is only 1 way to choose the matching characters, since they have to be the same.\n\nNow, let's multiply all the possibilities together to find the total number of ways you can choose a license plate with these restrictions:\n26 (options for first character) * 1 (matching characters) *36 (options for middle character) * 1 (matching characters) * 10 (options for last character) = 9,360\n\nSo, there are 9,360 ways for you to choose a license plate with these restrictions.",
