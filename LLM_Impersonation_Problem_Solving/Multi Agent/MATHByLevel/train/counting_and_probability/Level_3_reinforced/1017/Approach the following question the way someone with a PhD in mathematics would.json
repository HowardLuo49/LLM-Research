What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
    "solution": "The probability is $\\dfrac{4}{52} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} \\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{16575}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of drawing a Jack, Queen, and King in that specific order, we first need to establish the total number of ways in which the three cards can be drawn without replacement. \n\nThe number of ways to draw the first card (Jack) is 4 (since there are 4 Jacks in a deck of 52 cards). Once the Jack is drawn, there are then 51 cards remaining in the deck. The number of ways to draw the second card (Queen) is 4 (since there are 4 Queens in the deck, and one Queen has already been removed from it). After the Queen is drawn, there are 50 cards remaining in the deck. Finally, the number of ways to draw the third card (King) is 4 (since there are 4 Kings in the deck, and two cards have already been removed).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to draw the three cards in that specific order is 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 ways.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to draw three cards from a standard deck of 52 cards without replacement, we can calculate this using the concept of combinations. This can be calculated as (52 choose 3) = 22,100 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a Jack, Queen, and King in that specific order is 64 / 22,100 = 0.0029, or approximately 0.29%.",
