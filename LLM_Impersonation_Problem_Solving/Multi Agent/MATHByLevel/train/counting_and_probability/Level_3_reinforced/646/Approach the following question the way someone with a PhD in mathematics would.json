Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "solution": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table without restrictions, we can use the formula for arranging objects in a circle, which is (n-1)!. In this case, n is equal to the total number of politicians in the committee, which is 10. Therefore, the number of ways they can sit around the circular table without restrictions is (10-1)! = 9! = 362,880.",
