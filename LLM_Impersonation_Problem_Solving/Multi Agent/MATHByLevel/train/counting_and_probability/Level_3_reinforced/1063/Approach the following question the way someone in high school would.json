    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to figure out the number of distinct sequences, we need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that each sequence must begin with L and end with Q. So that leaves us with the letters EUAS to fill in the middle two spots.\n\nSince no letter can appear more than once, we first need to choose the second letter in the sequence. There are 3 options left (E, U, A) after using L. \n\nAfter choosing the second letter, there are 2 options left (the remaining letters) for the third letter, and only 1 option left for the fourth letter (which is Q).\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct sequences that can be made is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 sequences.\n\nSo, there are 6 distinct sequences that can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear more than once.",
