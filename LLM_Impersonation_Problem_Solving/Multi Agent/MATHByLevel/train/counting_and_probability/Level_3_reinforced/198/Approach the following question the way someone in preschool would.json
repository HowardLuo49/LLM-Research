    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we have to remember that heads is the happy face of the coin and tails is the sad face. \n\nTo find the expected worth, we need to see how much we can expect to win or lose on average. Let's imagine flipping the coin 100 times. We can expect to get heads about 75 times and tails about 25 times.\n\nFor the heads flips, we will win $\\$3$ each time. So, our total winnings from heads will be $75 \\times \\$3 = \\$225$.\n\nFor the tails flips, we will lose $\\$8$ each time. So, our total losses from tails will be $25 \\times \\$8 = \\$200$.\n\nNow, to find the expected worth, we need to see the difference between our total winnings and total losses. Our total winnings were $\\$225$ and our total losses were $\\$200$. \n\nSubtracting our total losses from our total winnings, we get $\\$225 - \\$200 = \\$25$.\n\nSince we flipped the coin 100 times, on average we can expect to win $\\$25$ in total. \n\nTo find the average amount we win per flip, we need to divide $\\$25$ by 100, which gives us $\\$0.25$.\n\nTherefore, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\$0.25$.",
