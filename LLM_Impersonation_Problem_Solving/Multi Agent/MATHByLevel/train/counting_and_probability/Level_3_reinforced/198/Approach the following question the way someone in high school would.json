A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the expected worth of a coin flip, we need to multiply the value gained from heads by the probability of getting heads and subtract the value lost from tails multiplied by the probability of getting tails.\n\nSo, the expected worth is:\n\nexpected worth = $(3)(\\frac34) + (-8)(\\frac14)$\nexpected worth = $\\frac94 - 2$\nexpected worth = $\\frac94 - \\frac{8}{4}$\nexpected worth = $\\frac14$\n\nTherefore, the expected worth of a coin flip is $\\boxed{0.25}$.",
