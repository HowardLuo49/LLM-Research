A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, let's count the red cards first! There are 26 red cards out of 52 cards in total. So the probability of the first card being red is 26/52 or 1/2.\n\nNow, after we take out a red card, there are 25 red cards left out of 51 cards in total. This means the probability of the second card being black is 26/51.\n\nTo find the probability that the first card is red and the second card is black, we need to multiply the probability of the first event happening by the probability of the second event happening. So the final answer is (1/2) * (26/51) = 13/51. Yay, we solved the problem! Great job, everyone!",
