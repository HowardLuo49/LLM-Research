    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what a four digit odd number is. An odd number is a number that can't be divided evenly by 2. So a four digit odd number would start with an odd number in the thousands place. That means the thousands place could be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. \n\nNow let's think about four digit multiples of 5. Multiples of 5 end in either 0 or 5, so the units place could be either 0 or 5.\n\nTo find $A$, we need to think about all the possibilities for the other three digits. The thousands place can be filled with 5 options (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), the hundreds, tens, and units can be filled with any digit from 0 to 9 (since we want a four digit number).\n\nSo for $A$, we have 5 choices for the thousands place, 10 choices for the hundreds place, 10 choices for the tens place, and 5 choices for the units place. Therefore, $A = 5 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 5 = 2500$.\n\nFor $B$, we have 1 choice for the thousands place (since it can only be a multiple of 5), 10 choices for the hundreds place, 10 choices for the tens place, and 2 choices for the units place (0 or 5). Therefore, $B = 1 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 2 = 200$.\n\nTo find $A+B$, we just add $A$ and $B$, so $A+B = 2500 + 200 = 2700$. So there are 2700 four digit odd numbers or multiples of 5.",
