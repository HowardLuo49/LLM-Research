    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Let $A$ equal the number of four digit odd numbers.  Let $B$ equal the number of four digit multiples of 5.  Find $A+B$.",
    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's count together! \n\nFirst, let's find the number of four digit odd numbers. We know that all odd numbers have the last digit as an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Since the first digit cannot be zero, there are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), 10 choices for the second digit (0-9), 10 choices for the third digit (0-9), and 5 choices for the fourth digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So, the total number of four digit odd numbers is $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 5 = 4500$.\n\nNow, let's find the number of four digit multiples of 5. Since they are multiples of 5, the last digit must be 0 or 5. The first digit still cannot be zero, so there are 9 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second digit, 10 choices for the third digit, and 2 choices for the last digit (0 or 5). So, the total number of four digit multiples of 5 is $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 2 = 1800$.\n\nFinally, we can add the number of four digit odd numbers (4500) and the number of four digit multiples of 5 (1800) to get the total number of four digit odd numbers and multiples of 5. Let's add them up together: $4500 + 1800 = 6300$.\n\nSo, the answer is $6300$. Great job counting together!",
