    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $A$ and $B$, we first need to determine the number of four-digit odd numbers and the number of four-digit multiples of 5.\n\nFor $A$, we note that a four-digit odd number must end in an odd digit, which can be either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The first digit cannot be 0, so there are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), 10 choices for the second digit (0-9), 10 choices for the third digit (0-9), and 5 choices for the last digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Therefore, there are $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 5 = 4500$ four-digit odd numbers.\n\nFor $B$, a four-digit multiple of 5 must end in 0 or 5. The first digit cannot be 0, so there are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), 10 choices for the second digit (0-9), 10 choices for the third digit (0-9), and 2 choices for the last digit (0, 5). Therefore, there are $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 2 = 1800$ four-digit multiples of 5.\n\nTherefore, $A + B = 4500 + 1800 = \\boxed{6300}$.",
