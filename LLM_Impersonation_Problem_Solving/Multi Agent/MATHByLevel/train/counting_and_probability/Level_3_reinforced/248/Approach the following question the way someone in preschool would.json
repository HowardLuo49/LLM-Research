    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 5 and 17, inclusive.  What is the probability that their product is odd?",
    "solution": "There are 13 integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  In order for the product of two integers to be odd, both of the integers themselves must be odd. There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom72 = 21$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  Therefore, the desired probability is $\\dfrac{21}{78} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Oh wow, this is a hard question! Let's think about it together. \n\nFirst, let's see how many numbers we have to choose from between 5 and 17. We start counting them: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. That makes 13 numbers in total, right? \n\nNow, we have to think about which numbers are odd. Odd numbers are like the ones that end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. So, let's see which numbers between 5 and 17 are odd: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. That's 7 odd numbers.\n\nWhen we multiply two numbers together, the product will be odd if at least one of the numbers is odd. So, to find the probability that the product is odd, we need to find the probability that at least one of the two numbers is odd.\n\nTo find this, we can think about the total number of pairs of numbers we can choose. If we have 13 numbers to choose from, we can make 13 x 12 pairs, which is 156 pairs in total. \n\nNow, we need to find how many pairs have at least one odd number. There are 7 odd numbers to choose from, so we can pick any of these odd numbers as the first number, and then any of the 13 numbers as the second. That means we have 7 x 13 pairs where at least one number is odd. \n\nTo find the probability, we just divide the number of pairs with at least one odd number by the total number of pairs. So, the probability that the product is odd is 91/156, which can be simplified to 13/22. \n\nYay, we solved it together! Great job!",
