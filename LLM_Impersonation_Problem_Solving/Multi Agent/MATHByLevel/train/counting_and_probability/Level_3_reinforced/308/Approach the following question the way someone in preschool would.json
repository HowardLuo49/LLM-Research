    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. We have three X tiles and two O tiles. We want the arrangement to be XOXOX. So, we need the first tile to be X, the second to be O, the third to be X, the fourth to be O, and the fifth to be X. \n\nThere are 5 tiles total, so there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them all. \n\nTo calculate the probability, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the tiles as XOXOX and divide that by the total number of ways to arrange all the tiles. \n\nThere is only 1 way to arrange the tiles as XOXOX. \n\nSo the probability is 1/5! = 1/120. \n\nThat's the probability that the arrangement will read XOXOX! Yay!",
