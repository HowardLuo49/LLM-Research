    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of rolling six standard dice and getting six different numbers, we first need to figure out how many ways we can roll six distinct numbers. \n\nThere are 6 sides on each die, so for the first die, we have 6 choices. For the second die, we have 5 choices left (since we can't repeat the number from the first die). For the third die, we have 4 choices left, and so on. \n\nSo, the number of ways to roll six distinct numbers is 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720 ways.\n\nNow, to find the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice, we will calculate 6^6 = 46656 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on six dice is 720/46656, which simplifies to 5/324.",
