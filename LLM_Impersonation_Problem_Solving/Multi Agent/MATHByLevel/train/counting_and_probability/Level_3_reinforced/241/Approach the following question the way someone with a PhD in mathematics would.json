    "solution": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.  The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to distribute 5 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes, we can use the concept of partitions. \n\nLet's represent the number of balls in each box as (a, b, c), where a, b, and c are non-negative integers and a + b + c = 5. Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we are essentially looking for the number of ways to partition 5 into 3 non-negative integers.\n\nThis problem can be solved using stars and bars technique. We can imagine the 5 balls as stars and 2 dividers as bars representing the 3 boxes. The arrangement of stars and bars forms a one-to-one correspondence with the ways to distribute the balls into the boxes. The number of ways to distribute the 5 balls into 3 boxes is therefore given by the formula C(5+3-1, 3-1) = C(7, 2) = 7! / (5! * 2!) = 21.\n\nTherefore, there are 21 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes where both the balls and boxes are indistinguishable.",
