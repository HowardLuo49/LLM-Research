    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see! We need to find numbers with at least one 2 or 3. We can have 2, 3, or both 2 and 3 in the number. Let's start counting! \n\nFirst, let's think about numbers that have a 2: \n\nThere are 2 options for the first digit (2 or 3), and 10 options for each of the remaining three digits (0-9). That gives us 2 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 2,000 numbers with a 2.\n\nNext, let's think about numbers that have a 3: \n\nThere are 2 options for the first digit (2 or 3), and 10 options for each of the remaining three digits (0-9). That gives us 2 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 2,000 numbers with a 3.\n\nBut wait, we double-counted the numbers that have both 2 and 3, so we need to subtract those. \n\nThere are 1 option for the first digit (2 or 3), and 10 options for each of the remaining three digits (0-9). That gives us 1 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 1,000 numbers with both 2 and 3.\n\nSo, in total, we have 2,000 numbers with a 2, 2,000 numbers with a 3, and 1,000 numbers with both 2 and 3. \n\nThat means there are 2,000 + 2,000 - 1,000 = 3,000 four-digit positive integers that have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.
