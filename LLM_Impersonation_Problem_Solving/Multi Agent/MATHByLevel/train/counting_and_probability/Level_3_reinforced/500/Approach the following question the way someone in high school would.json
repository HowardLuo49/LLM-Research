    "solution": "There are 3 options (boxes) for each of the 4 balls, so the number of ways is $3^4 = \\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure out how many ways there are to put 4 balls in 3 boxes when everything is distinguishable, let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many ways there are to choose which box each ball goes in. Since each ball can go into any of the 3 boxes, there are a total of 3 options for each ball. Since there are 4 balls, we need to multiply 3 by itself 4 times to get the total number of ways to put the balls in the boxes.\n\n3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81\n\nSo, there are 81 ways to put 4 distinguishable balls in 3 distinguishable boxes.",
