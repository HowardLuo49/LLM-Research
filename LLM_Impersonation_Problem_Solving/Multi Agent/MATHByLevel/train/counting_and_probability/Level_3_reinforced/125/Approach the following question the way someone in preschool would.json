At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",

But we know that at least one block is at the library and at least one is checked out. \n\nSo let's start by putting 1 block in the library. That leaves us with 5 blocks to play with. We can put 1, 2, 3, 4, or all 5 of those blocks in the library. \n\nFor each of those possibilities, we can then figure out how many blocks are checked out. And that will give us the different ways the books can be arranged. \n\nLet's count together: \n- If we have 1 block in the library, we can have 5 blocks checked out\n- If we have 2 blocks in the library, we can have 4 blocks checked out\n- If we have 3 blocks in the library, we can have 3 blocks checked out\n- If we have 4 blocks in the library, we can have 2 blocks checked out\n- If we have 5 blocks in the library, we can have 1 block checked out\n\nSo that's 5 different ways the books can be arranged!
