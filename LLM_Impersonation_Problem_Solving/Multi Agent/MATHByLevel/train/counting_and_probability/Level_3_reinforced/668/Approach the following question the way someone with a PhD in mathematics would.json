Given that each region is the same area, what is the probability that you will earn exactly $\\$1700$ in your first three spins? Express your answer as a common fraction.

    "solution": "There are five slots on which the spinner can land with each spin; thus, there are 125 total possibilities with three spins. The only way in which you can earn exactly $ \\$ 1700$ in three spins is by landing on a $ \\$ 300$, a $ \\$ 400$, and a $ \\$ 1000$. You could land on any one of the three in your first spin, any one of the remaining two in your second spin, and the remaining one in your last spin, so there are $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways in which you can earn $ \\$ 1700$. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{125}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A mathematician with a PhD would approach this question by first calculating the total number of possible outcomes and then determining the number of ways in which the desired outcome can occur. \n\nThe total number of possible outcomes in 3 spins is $5^3 = 125$ (as there are 5 regions on the spinner and each spin has 5 possible outcomes).\n\nTo earn exactly $\\$1700$ in the first three spins, we need to spin $\\$5000$, $\\$1000$, and $\\$400$ in any order. There are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange these three outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to earn exactly $\\$1700$ in the first three spins is $6$.
