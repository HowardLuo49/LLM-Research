    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of possible license plates that satisfy all the given conditions, we can break down the problem into a few key steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of choices for each position in the license plate:\n- For the first position (which must be either G or K), there are 2 choices.\n- For the second position, since it cannot be the same as the first position, there are 10 choices.\n- Similarly, for the third position, there are 9 choices.\n- For the fourth position (which must be T), there is only 1 choice.\n- Finally, for the fifth position (which must be different from all previous positions), there are 8 choices.\n\n2. Multiply the number of choices for each position to get the total number of possible license plates:\nTotal = 2 * 10 * 9 * 1 * 8 = 1440\n\nTherefore, there are 1440 possible license plates of five letters that satisfy all the given conditions.",
