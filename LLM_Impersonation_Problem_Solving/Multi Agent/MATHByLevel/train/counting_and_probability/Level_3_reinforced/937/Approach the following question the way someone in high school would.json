    "solution": "An $n$-gon has $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals.  To see this, subtract the $n$ consecutive pairs of vertices from the $\\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of vertices:  \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{n}{2}-n&=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-n \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n}{2}-\\frac{2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-n-2n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n^2-3n}{2} \\\\\n&=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}.\n\\end{align*} An octagon has $8(8-3)/2=\\boxed{20}$ diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "In a regular octagon, there are 8 vertices. To find the number of diagonals in a regular octagon, we can use the formula:\nNumber of diagonals = n(n-3)/2\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nSo, for a regular octagon:\nNumber of diagonals = 8(8-3)/2\nNumber of diagonals = 8(5)/2\nNumber of diagonals = 40/2\nNumber of diagonals = 20\n\nTherefore, a regular octagon has 20 diagonals.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to 20?: In a regular octagon, there are 8 vertices. To find the number of diagonals in a regular octagon, we can use the formula:\nNumber of diagonals = n(n-3)/2\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nSo, for a regular octagon:\nNumber of diagonals = 8(8-3)/2\nNumber of diagonals = 8(5)/2\nNumber of diagonals = 40/2\nNumber of diagonals = 20\n\nTherefore, a regular octagon has 20 diagonals.",
