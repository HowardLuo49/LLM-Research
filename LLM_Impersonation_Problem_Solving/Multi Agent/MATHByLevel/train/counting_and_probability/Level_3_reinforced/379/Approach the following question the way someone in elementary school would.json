    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by counting how many 4-letter words we can make using any letter from $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. Since each letter can be used more than once, we can choose from 5 options for each of the 4 letters. This means we have $5^4 = 625$ possible 4-letter words.\n\nNow, let's count how many 4-letter words we can make using only the vowels $A$ and $E$. In this case, we have 2 options for each of the 4 letters. So, the number of 4-letter words using only the vowels is $2^4 = 16$.\n\nTo find the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant, we can subtract the number of words with only vowels from the total number of words. This gives us $625 - 16 = 609$.\n\nTherefore, there are 609 4-letter words with at least one consonant that can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$.",
