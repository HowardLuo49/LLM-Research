    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats.  (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
    "solution": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats. We need to figure out how many ways we can arrange them in a row where all animals of the same type are together.\n\nLet's start with the chickens. Since there are 4 chickens, they can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.\n\nNext, let's move on to the dogs. Since there are 2 dogs, they can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways.\n\nLastly, we have the cats. Since there are 5 cats, they can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.\n\nNow, we can multiply the number of ways each type of animal can be arranged together to find the total number of ways all the animals can be arranged in a row of cages:\n\n24 * 2 * 120 = 5,760 ways\n\nSo, there are 5,760 ways the 11 animals can be placed in a row of cages where all animals of the same type are together.",
