In how many ways can we choose 6 starters with no restrictions? (The triplets are treated as distinguishable.)",

Let's see how many options we have.\n\nFirst, let's choose the first starter. We have 14 choices for the first player.\n\nThen, we choose the second starter. There are 13 players left to choose from.\n\nAnd for the third starter, we have 12 players to choose from.\n\nFor the fourth starter, we have 11 choices.\n\nFor the fifth starter, we have 10 choices.\n\nAnd finally, for the sixth starter, we have 9 choices.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose 6 starters, we need to multiply all these options together:\n\n14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 = 218,400\n\nSo, there are 218,400 ways to choose 6 starters from the 14 players on the girls volleyball team.
