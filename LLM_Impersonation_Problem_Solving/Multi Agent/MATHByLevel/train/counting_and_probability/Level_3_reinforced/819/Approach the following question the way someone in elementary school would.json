What is the probability that the four dots will be collinear? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nsize(59);\nfor(int i = 0; i<4; ++i)\nfor(int j = 0; j<4; ++j)\ndot((i,j),linewidth(7));\n[/asy]",
    "solution": "If all four of the dots are collinear, it is obvious that it must either be a horizontal line of dots, a vertical line of dots, or a diagonal line of dots. And inspection tells us that there are $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ such collinear sets of 4. And in total, there are ${16 \\choose 4} = \\frac{16\\cdot 15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 = 1820$. So, the probability is $\\frac{10}{1820} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{182}}$.",

In this array, there can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines.\n\nNow, let's count all the possible ways to choose 4 dots out of 16:\nThere are 16 choose 4 ways, which equals to $\\binom{16}{4}$ = 1820.\n\nNext, let's count how many ways we can choose 4 collinear dots:\n- Horizontal lines: There are 4 horizontal lines, and we can choose 4 dots from each line. So, there are 4 ways.\n- Vertical lines: There are 4 vertical lines, and we can choose 4 dots from each line. So, there are 4 ways.\n- Diagonal lines: There are 2 diagonal lines, and we can choose 4 dots from each line. So, there are 2 ways.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose collinear dots = 4 (horizontal) + 4 (vertical) + 2 (diagonal) = 10.\n\nSo, the probability that the four dots will be collinear is $\\frac{10}{1820} = \\frac{1}{182}$.",
