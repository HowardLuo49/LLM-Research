    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Ooh, I love rolling dice! Let's count all the ways we can get a perfect square sum when we roll two dice. \n\nWe need to find all the sums that are perfect squares: 4, 9, and 16. \n\nTo get a sum of 4, we could roll a 1 and a 3, or a 2 and a 2. That's 2 ways. \nTo get a sum of 9, we could roll a 3 and a 6, or a 4 and a 5, or a 5 and a 4, or a 6 and a 3. That's 4 ways. \nTo get a sum of 16, we would need to roll double 8s. That's 1 way. \n\nSo, in total, there are 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 ways to get a perfect square sum when rolling two dice. \n\nNow, let's count all the possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Each die has 6 sides, so there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. \n\nTo find the probability of rolling a perfect square sum, we need to divide the number of ways to get a perfect square sum (7) by the total number of possible outcomes (36). \n\nSo, the probability of rolling a perfect square sum is 7/36. Yay, we did it!",
