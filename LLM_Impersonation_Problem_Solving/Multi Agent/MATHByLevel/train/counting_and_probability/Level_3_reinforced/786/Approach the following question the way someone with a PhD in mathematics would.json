    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that the sum rolled is a perfect square, we must first identify the possible perfect squares that can be obtained from rolling two 6-sided dice. The possible outcomes for the sum of the dice range from 2 (when both dice show a 1) to 12 (when both dice show a 6). The perfect squares within this range are 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), and 16 (4^2). \n\nNext, we must determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice. Since each die has 6 sides, there are a total of 6*6 = 36 possible outcomes when both dice are rolled.\n\nTo calculate the probability of rolling a perfect square sum, we must determine the number of favorable outcomes (i.e., rolling a sum that is a perfect square) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThere are 3 possible favorable outcomes: rolling a sum of 4, 9, or 16. Therefore, the probability of rolling a perfect square sum is 3/36 = 1/12.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that the sum rolled when two standard 6-sided dice are rolled is a perfect square is 1/12.",
