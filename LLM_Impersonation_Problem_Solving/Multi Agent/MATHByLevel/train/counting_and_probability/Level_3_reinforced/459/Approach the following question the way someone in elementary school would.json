Some of the slips have a 2 on them, and the rest have a 7 on them.  If the expected value of the number shown on a slip randomly drawn from the bag is $3.25$, then how many slips have a 2?",
    "solution": "We let $x$ denote the number of slips with a 2 written on them.  (This is the usual tactic of letting a variable denote what we're trying to solve for in the problem.)  Then there are $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them. The probability of drawing a 2 is $\\frac{x}{12}$ and the probability of drawing a 7 is $\\frac{12-x}{12}$, so the expected value of the number drawn is $$ E = \\frac{x}{12}(2) + \\frac{12-x}{12}(7) = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$But we are given that $E=3.25$, so we have the equation $$ 3.25 = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$This simplifies to $39 = 84 - 5x$, which means that $x = 9$. Thus $\\boxed{9}$ of the 12 slips have a 2 written on them.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count how much all the numbers add up to first. We know that the expected value is $3.25$, so we can multiply that by the total number of slips to find out the total sum: $3.25 \\times 12 = 39$. \n\nNow, we know that some slips have a 2 on them and some slips have a 7 on them. Let's say $x$ slips have a 2 on them. Then the number of slips with a 7 on them would be $12 - x$.\n\nThe total sum of all the numbers on the slips can be found by adding up all the 2s and 7s: $2x + 7(12 - x) = 39$.\n\nNow we can solve for $x$: \n\n$2x + 84 - 7x = 39$  \n$-5x + 84 = 39$  \n$-5x = -45$  \n$x = 9$\n\nSo, there are 9 slips with a 2 on them in the bag!",
