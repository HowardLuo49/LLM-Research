    "solution": "The row 1, 1 has 2 numbers.  The row 1, 2, 1 has 3 numbers.  The row 1, 3, 3, 1 has 4 numbers.  Each time we go down one row, we have one more number in the list.  So, the row that starts 1, $k$ has $k+1$ numbers (namely, the numbers $\\binom{k}{0}, \\binom{k}{1}, \\binom{k}{2}, \\ldots, \\binom{k}{k}$.)  So the row with 43 numbers starts 1, $\\boxed{42}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's count to 43 together! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... Ok we made it to 43! Now we need to find the second number in the row of Pascal's triangle that has 43 numbers. So let's look at the triangle and find that row. Hmm, let's see... ah, here it is! The second number in that row is 42. Yay, we did it! Great job counting and finding that number!",

Now we need to find the second number in the row of Pascal's triangle that has 43 numbers. So let's look at the triangle and find that row. Hmm, let's see... ah, here it is!
