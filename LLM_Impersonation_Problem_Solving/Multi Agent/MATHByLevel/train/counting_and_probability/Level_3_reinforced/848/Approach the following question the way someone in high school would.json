A sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of cheese. Ham, chicken, cheddar cheese, and white bread are each offered at the deli. If Al never orders a sandwich with a ham/cheddar cheese combination nor a sandwich with a white bread/chicken combination, how many different sandwiches could Al order?",
    "solution": "First, count the total number of possible sandwiches. There are four choices for bread, six for meat, and five for cheese, for a total of $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 = 120$ potential sandwiches. Discarding the ham / cheddar cheese combination will subtract four sandwiches (one for each type of bread). Similarly, discarding the white bread / chicken combination will subtract five sandwiches, one for each kind of cheese. Thus, Al can order $120 - 4 - 5 = \\boxed{111}$ different sandwiches.",
    "gpt_response": "To figure this out, we can first list out all the possible combinations of bread, meat, and cheese that Al could choose from. Since Al cannot have a sandwich with ham and cheddar cheese, or white bread and chicken, we need to exclude those combinations from our list.\n\nBread options: White bread\nMeat options: Ham, chicken\nCheese options: Cheddar cheese\n\nSo, the combinations Al cannot have are:\n- White bread with chicken\n- White bread with cheddar cheese\n- Ham with cheddar cheese\n\nNow, we can list out the remaining combinations:\n1. White bread with cheddar cheese\n2. White bread with chicken\n3. Ham with chicken\n\nTherefore, Al could order 3 different sandwiches.",
