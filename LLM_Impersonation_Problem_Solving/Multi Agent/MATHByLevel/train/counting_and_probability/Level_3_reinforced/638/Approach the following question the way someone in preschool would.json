    "solution": "A seven-sided polygon has seven vertices. There are ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$ ways to connect the pairs of these 7 points. But 7 of those pairs are pairs of consecutive vertices, so they are counted as sides. So, only $21 - 7 = \\boxed{14}$ of these segments are diagonals.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's count the diagonals together! A seven-sided polygon has seven vertices. Can you count how many ways we can connect two vertices with a line that isn't a side? Those are the diagonals! Let's count them together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 diagonals. Yay, we found 5 diagonals in a regular seven-sided polygon! Good job!",
