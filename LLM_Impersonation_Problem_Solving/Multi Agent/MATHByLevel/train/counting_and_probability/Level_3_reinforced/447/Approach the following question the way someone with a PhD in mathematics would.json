    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use combinations. The number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without regard to order is given by the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n - r)!), where n! denotes the factorial of n.\n\nIn this case, Karl wants to select 4 crayons from a set of 12 crayons without considering the order in which he selects them. Therefore, the number of ways he can do this is given by C(12, 4) = 12! / (4!(12 - 4)!) = 495.\n\nTherefore, Karl can select 4 crayons from the box in 495 different ways.",
