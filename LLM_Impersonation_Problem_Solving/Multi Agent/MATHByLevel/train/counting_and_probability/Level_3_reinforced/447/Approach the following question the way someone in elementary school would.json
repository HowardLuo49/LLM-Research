    "solution": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many ways Karl can select four crayons, we can use combinations! Combinations help us figure out how many different ways we can pick a certain number of things from a group without caring about the order.\n\nIn this case, we have 12 crayons in the box and Karl wants to select 4 of them. We can use the combination formula which is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!. \n\nWhen we plug in the numbers, we get:\n\n12C4 = 12! / 4!(12-4)! = 12! / 4!8! = (12 x 11 x 10 x 9) / (4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 495\n\nSo, there are 495 ways Karl can select four crayons from the box!",
