A certain coin is weighted such that the chance of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the chance of flipping tails is $\\frac{2}{3}$.  Suppose that we win $\\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "In one flip, we have a $1/3$ chance of getting heads and winning 3 dollars, and a $2/3$ chance of getting tails and losing 2 dollars.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{3}(\\$3) + \\frac{2}{3}(-\\$2) = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected value, we need to multiply the value of each outcome by the probability of that outcome occurring, and then sum these products. \n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing our winnings after one flip. If we flip heads, we win $\\$3$ (with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$), and if we flip tails, we lose $\\$2$ (with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$). \n\nTherefore, the expected value of our winnings after one flip, $E[X]$, is given by:\n\n$E[X] = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + (-2) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 1 - \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{-1}{3}$.\n\nSo, the expected value of our winnings after one flip is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
