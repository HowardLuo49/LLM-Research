How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
    "solution": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see...if we have 3 schools and each school sends a different number of representatives to the meeting, we can try to figure out how many ways there are to choose the host school and the representatives.\n\nFirst, we need to choose which school will host the meeting. We have 3 schools to choose from, so there are 3 ways to do that.\n\nNext, the host school will send 2 representatives to the meeting. Since there are 5 members from each school, the host school can choose 2 representatives in $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways.\n\nAfter that, the other two schools will each send 1 representative to the meeting. Each of these schools can choose 1 representative in $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways.\n\nSo in total, there are $3 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 750$ possible ways to arrange the presidency meeting with the given conditions.",
