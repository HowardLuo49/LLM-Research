    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. Tamika selects two different numbers at random from the set $\\{8,9,10\\}$ and adds them. Carlos takes two different numbers at random from the set $\\{3,5,6\\}$ and multiplies them. What is the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "Tamika can get the numbers $8+9=17$, $8+10=18$, or $9+10=19$. Carlos can get $3\\times5=15$, $3\\times6=18$, or $5\\times6=30$. The possible ways to pair these are: $(17,15)$, $(17,18)$, $(17,30)$, $(18,15)$, $(18,18)$, $(18,30)$, $(19,15)$, $(19,18)$, $(19,30)$. Four of these nine pairs show Tamika with a higher result, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's see! Tamika can choose 8 and 9, 9 and 10, or 8 and 10. That's 3 total choices. Now Carlos can choose 3 and 5, 3 and 6, or 5 and 6. Also 3 total choices. So, there are 3 x 3 = 9 total possible outcomes. Let's see which ones make Tamika's result greater than Carlos'. \n\nIf Tamika chooses 8 and 9, their sum is 17. If Carlos chooses 3 and 5, their product is 15. So Tamika's result is greater. \n\nIf Tamika chooses 9 and 10, their sum is 19. If Carlos chooses 3 and 5, their product is 15. So Tamika's result is greater. \n\nIf Tamika chooses 8 and 10, their sum is 18. If Carlos chooses 3 and 6, their product is 18. So, their results are the same. \n\nSo out of 9 total outcomes, 2 make Tamika's result greater than Carlos'. This means the probability is 2/9. Yay!",
