Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Tim picks a matching pair of socks, we first need to consider the total number of ways he can choose two socks from his drawer. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nIn this case, n = 18 (total number of socks in the drawer) and r = 2 (number of socks Tim picks).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways Tim can choose two socks from his drawer is:\n\n18C2 = 18! / 2!(18-2)! = 153\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of ways Tim can pick a matching pair of socks.
