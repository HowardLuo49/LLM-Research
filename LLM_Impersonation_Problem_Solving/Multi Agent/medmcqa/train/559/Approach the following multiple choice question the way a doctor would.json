    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when considering the concentration of potassium in oral rehydration solution (ORS), it is important to know the specific amount in micrograms in order to determine the appropriate treatment for a patient. The options provided are in milliequivalents (meq), but to convert this to micrograms we need to take into account the molar mass of potassium which is approximately 39.1 g/mol.\n\nGiven this information, we can calculate the concentration of potassium in micrograms in each option:\n\n1. 30 meq = 30 * 39.1 * 1000 = 1173000 micrograms\n2. 20 meq = 20 * 39.1 * 1000 = 786000 micrograms\n3. 90 meq = 90 * 39.1 * 1000 = 3519000 micrograms\n4. 60 meq = 60 * 39.1 * 1000 = 2346000 micrograms\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n3: 90 meq, which is equivalent to 3519000 micrograms of potassium.",
