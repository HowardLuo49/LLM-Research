    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this multiple choice question by considering the mechanisms through which growth hormone exerts its effects on growth. Growth hormone primarily acts directly on target tissues to stimulate growth and development. While insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a key mediator of growth hormone's effects, it is not the primary mode of action. Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that regulates metabolism, but it is not directly involved in the growth-promoting effects of growth hormone. Intranuclear receptors are involved in mediating the effects of some hormones, but they are not the primary mechanism through which growth hormone stimulates growth. Therefore, the correct answer would be 1: Directly.",
