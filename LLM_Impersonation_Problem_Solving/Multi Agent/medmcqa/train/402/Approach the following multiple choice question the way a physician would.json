    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "The phase of minimum motion of the heart during cardiac imaging typically occurs during mid diastole when the heart is in a state of relaxation. This is when the heart is filling with blood and there is minimal movement of the heart muscle. Therefore, the answer would be option 4: Mid diastole.",
