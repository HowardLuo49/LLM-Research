    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by first understanding the concept of competitive and non-competitive inhibitors in enzyme inhibition. \n\nCompetitive inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme, competing with the substrate for binding, while non-competitive inhibitors bind to a different site on the enzyme and prevent the enzyme-substrate complex from forming. \n\nIn this case, we are looking for a non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. To determine the correct answer, I would need to evaluate each of the options and determine if any of them fit the criteria of a non-competitive inhibitor. \n\nBased on my knowledge of biochemistry, I know that L-Tryptophan is a non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Therefore, my answer would be 3: L-Tryptophan.",
