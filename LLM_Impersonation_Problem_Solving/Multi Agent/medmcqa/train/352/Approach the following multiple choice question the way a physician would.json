    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach the diagnosis of oesophageal motility disorders by considering all available diagnostic tools. In this case, the best way to diagnose oesophageal motility disorders would be through manometry. Manometry involves measuring the pressure levels and contractions of the muscles in the oesophagus, providing a more accurate assessment of motility disorders compared to other diagnostic tests such as barium studies, endoscopy, or 24 hour pH monitoring. Therefore, I would recommend manometry as the preferred diagnostic tool for oesophageal motility disorders.",
