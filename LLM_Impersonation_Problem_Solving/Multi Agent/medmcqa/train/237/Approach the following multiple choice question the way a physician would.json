In this case, inherited hyperammonemia is typically a result of a deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthetase, which is essential for the activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I in the first step of the urea cycle.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option 3: N-acetyl glutamate synthetase as the correct answer based on my knowledge of biochemistry and metabolic pathways. This deficiency leads to impaired urea cycle function and accumulation of ammonia, resulting in hyperammonemia.",
