To determine which enzyme deficiency results in inherited hyperammonemia, a medical researcher would need to review the functions of each enzyme involved in the Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle.\n\nMalate dehydrogenase, Isocitrate dehydrogenase, and Succinate dehydrogenase are not directly involved in the urea cycle. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase plays a critical role in the regulation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, which is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle.
