A 49-year-old female taking ibuprofen for increasing joint pain in her hands presents with increasing pain in her midsternal area. Gastroscopy reveals multiple, scattered, punctate hemorrhagic areas in her gastric mucosa. Biopsies from one of these hemorrhagic lesions reveal mucosal erosions with edema and hemorrhage. No mucosal ulceration is seen.\n1: Active chronic gastritis\n2: Acute gastritis\n3: Autoimmune gastritis\n4: Chronic gastritis",

    "gpt_response": "Based on the patient's presentation of increasing joint pain and gastric mucosa findings, as well as her use of ibuprofen, the likely diagnosis is acute gastritis. Ibuprofen is a known cause of gastritis due to its effects on the gastric mucosa. The presence of mucosal erosions with edema and hemorrhage is consistent with acute gastritis. Option 2: Acute gastritis would be the most appropriate choice based on the information provided.",
