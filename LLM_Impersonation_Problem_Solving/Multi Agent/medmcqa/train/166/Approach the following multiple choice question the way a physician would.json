    "gpt_response": "In a physician's approach, I would consider the anatomy and function of the structures listed in each option in relation to the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The correct answer would be option 1: Flocculonodular Lobe, as this region of the cerebellum is involved in the coordination of eye movements in response to vestibular input. This reflex helps to stabilize vision during head movements.",
