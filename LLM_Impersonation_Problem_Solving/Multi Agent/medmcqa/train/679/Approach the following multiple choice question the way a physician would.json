    "gpt_response": "As a physician, when considering which induction agent produces cardiac stability, I would exclude options such as Propofol and Midazolam as they are known to cause cardiovascular depression. Ketamine can increase heart rate and blood pressure, potentially leading to cardiac instability. Therefore, the induction agent that is most likely to produce cardiac stability in this scenario is Etomidate.",
