A chest X-ray reveals complete consolidation of the lower lobe of the left lung. Cultures of the lower lobe of the left lung would most likely reveal which organism?\n1: Streptococcus pneumoniae\n2: Staphylococcus aureus\n3: Klebsiella pneumoniae\n4: Pseudomonas aeruginosa",

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in children and often presents with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is important to note that while other organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can also cause pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely organism in this scenario.",
