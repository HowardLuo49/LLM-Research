    "gpt_response": "Based on my medical knowledge, the correct answer is 1: LDL receptor. In Familial hypercholesterolemia, there is a genetic mutation that leads to a deficiency or dysfunction of the LDL receptor on the surface of cells. This results in impaired uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from the bloodstream, leading to high levels of LDL in the blood and an increased risk of heart disease.",
