Nuchal translucency is a standard measurement taken during the first trimester ultrasound scan to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as aneuploidy. A measurement above a certain threshold is considered a marker for increased risk of aneuploidy, particularly Down syndrome (Trisomy 21).
