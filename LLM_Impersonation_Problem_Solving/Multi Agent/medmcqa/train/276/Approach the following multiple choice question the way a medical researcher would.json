    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this multiple choice question by carefully considering each of the options in relation to the process of cleavage during week 1 of development. \n\n1: A series of meiotic divisions forming blastomeres - Meiotic divisions are involved in the formation of gametes, not blastomeres. Blastomeres are formed through mitotic divisions of the zygote.\n2: Production of highly differentiated blastomeres - Blastomeres during cleavage are not highly differentiated, as they are still in the early stages of development. \n3: An increased cytoplasmic content of blastomeres - During cleavage, blastomeres typically have a relatively small amount of cytoplasm, as they are rapidly dividing and reducing in size.\n4: A decrease in size of blastomeres - This option is correct. Cleavage involves a series of rapid cell divisions where the blastomeres decrease in size due to the lack of cell growth during this process.\n\nTherefore, option 4 is the most likely event involved in cleavage of the zygote during week 1 of development based on our understanding of the process as medical researchers.",
