Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare, but serious condition where the uninjured eye becomes inflamed and can lead to vision loss. It occurs due to an immune response triggered by the injury in the other eye.\n\nSubconjunctival hemorrhage (Option 1) and corneal edema (Option 2) are common complications following traumatic eye injury, but they are generally not as serious as sympathetic ophthalmia. Sudden loss of vision (Option 4) would be a serious complication as well, but sympathetic ophthalmia is specifically associated with trauma to one eye leading to inflammation in the other eye.\n\nTherefore, as a physician, I would select Option 3: Sympathetic ophthalmia as the most serious complication in the other eye following traumatic injury to one eye.",
