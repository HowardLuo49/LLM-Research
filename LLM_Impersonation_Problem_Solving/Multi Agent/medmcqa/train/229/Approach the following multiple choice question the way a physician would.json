    "gpt_response": "To determine the approximate age of a wound, a physician would consider factors such as the appearance of new collagen fibrils and epithelium growth. In this case, the presence of new collagen fibrils and a thick layer of growing epithelium suggests that the wound is in the process of healing.\n\nBased on the information provided, the wound is likely around 4-5 days old. This timeframe allows for the formation of new collagen fibrils and the beginning of epithelial growth. Therefore, option 1: 4-5 days would be the most appropriate choice.",
