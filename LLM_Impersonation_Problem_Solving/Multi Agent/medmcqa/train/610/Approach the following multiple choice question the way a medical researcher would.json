    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a medical researcher, we would first need to understand what \"tigroid white matter\" on MRI refers to. Tigroid white matter refers to a specific pattern of white matter abnormalities on MRI that resembles a striped or tigroid appearance.\n\nNext, we would need to consider each of the options provided and determine which condition is associated with tigroid white matter on MRI:\n\n1. Pantothenate kinase deficiency - This is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the central nervous system. There is no known association between pantothenate kinase deficiency and tigroid white matter on MRI.\n\n2. Pelizaeus-merzbacher disease - This is a rare X-linked recessive disorder that affects the central nervous system. It is known to be associated with tigroid white matter on MRI due to abnormalities in myelination.\n\n3. Neuroferritinopathy - This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal iron storage in the brain. There is no known association between neuroferritinopathy and tigroid white matter on MRI.\n\n4. Aceruloplasminemia - This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal iron metabolism and the absence of ceruloplasmin. There is no known association between aceruloplasminemia and tigroid white matter on MRI.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer would be 2: Pelizaeus-merzbacher disease.",
