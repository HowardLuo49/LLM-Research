A mutation that results in a value replacement for glutamic acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin 5 hinders normal hemoglobin function and results in sickle-cell anemia when the patient is homozygous for this mutation. This is an example of which of the following types of mutation?\n1: Deletion\n2: Frameshift\n3: Inseion\n4: Missense",
    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "4: Missense\n\nIn a missense mutation, a single nucleotide substitution results in a single amino acid change in the protein sequence. In this case, the substitution of glutamic acid for another amino acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin results in the abnormal hemoglobin function seen in sickle-cell anemia.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 4?: 4: Missense\n\nIn a missense mutation, a single nucleotide substitution results in a single amino acid change in the protein sequence. In this case, the substitution of glutamic acid for another amino acid at position 6 of the B chain of hemoglobin results in the abnormal hemoglobin function seen in sickle-cell anemia.",
