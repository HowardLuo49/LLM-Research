    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this multiple choice question by applying my knowledge of incised wounds. Incised wounds are caused by a sharp-edged object cutting through the skin. In the context of this question, I would first eliminate options that are consistent with typical features of incised wounds.\n\nOption 1 states that the length is the greatest dimension of the wound. This is consistent with incised wounds, as the length of the wound is typically longer than the width or depth.\n\nOption 2 states that the width is more than the thickness of the blade. Again, this is consistent with incised wounds, as the width of the wound is often wider than the thickness of the object that caused it.\n\nOption 3 states that the margins are inverted. Inverted margins are a characteristic feature of stab wounds, not incised wounds. Therefore, I would consider this option as a potential answer to the question.\n\nOption 4 states that hesitation cuts are seen in a suicidal attempt. Hesitation cuts are a pattern of superficial, parallel incisions that are commonly seen in suicidal attempts involving sharp objects. This is consistent with incised wounds and would not be a feature that is not present in this context.\n\nBased on my knowledge as a physician, I would consider option 3, \"Margins are inverted,\" as the feature that is not typically associated with incised wounds.",
