    "solution": 2,
    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this multiple choice question by considering the pathophysiology of sebaceous glands. Sebaceous glands produce sebum, an oily substance that can sometimes become trapped and accumulate within the glands. This can lead to various conditions depending on the location and extent of the blockage.\n\nIn this case, the most likely answer is option 2: Acne. Accumulation of sebum can clog hair follicles and lead to the development of acne lesions such as blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, and cysts. Milia (option 1) refers to small white bumps that can form on the skin due to trapped keratin, not sebum. Epidermoid cysts (option 3) and Miliaria (option 4) are also unrelated to sebaceous gland accumulation of sebum.\n\nTherefore, based on my medical knowledge, I would choose option 2: Acne as the most appropriate answer.",
