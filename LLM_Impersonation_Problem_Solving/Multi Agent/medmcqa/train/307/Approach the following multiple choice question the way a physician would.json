    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would choose option 1: NADH-Q Oxidoreductase. This enzyme complex, also known as complex I, is responsible for transferring four protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane during the electron transport chain process. This transport of protons is crucial for generating the proton gradient that drives ATP production.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: As a physician, I would choose option 1: NADH-Q Oxidoreductase. This enzyme complex, also known as complex I, is responsible for transferring four protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane during the electron transport chain process. This transport of protons is crucial for generating the proton gradient that drives ATP production.",
