    "solution": 3,
    "gpt_response": "As a physician, when approaching this multiple choice question, I would first consider the differential diagnosis for mediastinal lymph node calcification. \n\n1: Metastatic neoplasm - Metastatic neoplasms can sometimes cause calcification in lymph nodes, especially in cases of certain types of cancer such as breast or lung cancer. However, this is not the most common cause of mediastinal lymph node calcification.\n\n2: Lymphoma - Lymphoma can also cause calcification in lymph nodes, but again, this is not the most common cause of mediastinal lymph node calcification.\n\n3: Sarcoidosis - Sarcoidosis is a condition that can cause non-caseating granulomas in lymph nodes, which can sometimes calcify. It is a more common cause of mediastinal lymph node calcification.\n\n4: Bronchiectasis - Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by abnormal dilation of the bronchi, and is not typically associated with mediastinal lymph node calcification.\n\nTherefore, based on my medical knowledge and clinical experience, I would choose option 3: Sarcoidosis as the most likely cause of mediastinal lymph node calcification in this case.",
