    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when approaching this multiple choice question, I would first consider the anatomical location of the tonic neck reflex. The tonic neck reflex is a primitive reflex that is typically present in infants but should disappear by around 6 months of age. \n\nThe tonic neck reflex involves turning the head to one side, causing extension of the arm and leg on the side that the head is turned towards, and flexion of the arm and leg on the opposite side. \n\nBased on this information, I would consider that the tonic neck reflex is a higher brain function and is controlled by the cerebral cortex. Therefore, if the tonic neck reflex is lost, it would likely be due to a lesion in the cerebral cortex. \n\nGiven the options provided, the most appropriate answer would be:\n1: Cerebral cortex.",
