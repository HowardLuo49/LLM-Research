It involves turning the head to one side, which causes the arm on that side to extend and the arm on the opposite side to flex. \n\nLesions in specific areas of the brain or spinal cord can affect the tonic neck reflex. In this question, the options are cerebral cortex, midbrain, medulla, and spinal cord. \n\nBased on the known anatomical pathways involved in the tonic neck reflex, a medical researcher would know that lesions in the cerebral cortex, midbrain, or medulla are more likely to affect this reflex compared to the spinal cord. Therefore, the best answer would be:\n3: Medulla\n\nLesions in the medulla, which is part of the brainstem, can disrupt the descending motor pathways that are involved in the tonic neck reflex, leading to its loss.",
