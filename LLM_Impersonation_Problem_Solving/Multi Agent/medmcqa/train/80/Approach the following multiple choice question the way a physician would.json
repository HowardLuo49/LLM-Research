    "gpt_response": "As a physician, when considering which muscle is not a hybrid muscle, I would focus on the function and characteristics of each muscle. \n\n1: Pectoralis major - This muscle is a large muscle located in the chest that is responsible for movement of the shoulder joint. It is primarily a type II muscle fiber, making it a hybrid muscle.\n\n2: Extensor digitorum - This muscle is located in the forearm and is responsible for extending the fingers. It is primarily composed of type II muscle fibers, making it a hybrid muscle.\n\n3: Flexor digitorum profundus - This muscle is located in the forearm and is responsible for flexing the fingers. It is primarily composed of type II muscle fibers, making it a hybrid muscle.\n\n4: Brachialis - This muscle is located in the upper arm and is responsible for flexing the elbow joint. It is composed primarily of type I muscle fibers, making it not a hybrid muscle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: 4: Brachialis",
