The bicipital aponeurosis is a thin band of connective tissue that overlies the cubital fossa, a triangular depression on the anterior aspect of the elbow joint. \n\nNext, the researcher would identify the structures present in the cubital fossa. The median cubital vein, radial nerve, brachial artery, and anterior interosseous artery are all structures that pass through or are located in the cubital fossa. \n\nIn this case, the bicipital aponeurosis lies over the brachial artery in the cubital fossa.
