    "gpt_response": "To answer this question as a doctor, we need to understand that hemoglobin levels are essential for carrying oxygen throughout the body. A hemoglobin level below a certain value can indicate anemia, which can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\n\nGiven that the mean hemoglobin value is 10.3 gm% with a standard deviation of 2 gm%, we can use this information to determine the hemoglobin value below which 5% of the population will fall.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the Z-score for the 5th percentile. This can be calculated using the formula: Z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the value we are trying to find, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the 5th percentile, we look up the corresponding Z-score in a standard normal distribution table, which is approximately -1.645.\n\nNext, we plug in the values and equation: -1.645 = (X - 10.3) / 2\n\nSolving for X: X = -1.645 * 2 + 10.3\nX = 10.3 - 3.29\nX = 7.01\n\nTherefore, approximately 5% of the population will have a hemoglobin level below 7.01 gm%. Since this value is not one of the choices provided, the closest option is 7.35 gm%, making Option 2 the correct answer.",
