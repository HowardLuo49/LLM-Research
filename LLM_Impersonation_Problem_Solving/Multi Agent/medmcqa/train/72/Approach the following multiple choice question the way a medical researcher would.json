    "gpt_response": "To determine which white blood cell (WBC) is considered the \"second line of defense,\" a medical researcher would consider the specific functions and roles of each type of WBC in the immune response. \n\nNeutrophils are the most abundant type of WBC and are important in the initial response to infection or inflammation. They are considered the \"first line of defense\" because they are among the first cells to migrate to sites of infection.\n\nEosinophils are involved in allergic reactions and in defense against parasitic infections. They are not typically considered part of the immediate response to infection.\n\nBasophils release histamine and other chemicals involved in the inflammatory response, but they are not typically considered a major player in the defense against infections.\n\nMonocytes are a type of WBC that can differentiate into macrophages, which are important in phagocytosis and in presenting antigens to T cells in the immune response.\n\nBased on this information, the WBC that is considered the \"second line of defense\" would likely be the monocyte, as they play a role in the later stages of the immune response, including phagocytosis and antigen presentation.",
