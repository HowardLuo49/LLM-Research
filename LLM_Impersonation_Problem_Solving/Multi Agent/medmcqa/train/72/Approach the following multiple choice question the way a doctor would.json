Eosinophils are involved in allergic reactions and parasitic infections, but they are not typically considered second line of defense. Basophils release histamine and heparin in response to allergic reactions, but they are also not typically part of the second line of defense.\n\nMonocytes are a type of WBC that mature into macrophages, which are key players in the second line of defense. They phagocytize pathogens, present antigens to other immune cells, and help coordinate the immune response. Therefore, based on their role in the immune system, I would consider monocytes to be the WBC that is considered the \"second line of defense.\"",
