The target hemoglobin level for a 60 kg person is typically around 12 g/dL. \n\nThe patient's current hemoglobin level is 5 g/dL, so the deficit is 7 g/dL (12 g/dL - 5 g/dL). \n\nTo calculate the total deficit in grams of hemoglobin, we multiply the deficit in g/dL by the patient's weight in kg:\n7 g/dL x 60 kg = 420 grams\n\nNext, we need to convert this deficit from grams to milligrams (1 gram = 1000 mg):\n420 g x 1000 mg = 420,000 mg\n\nFinally, we add 1000 mg for iron stores:\n420,000 mg + 1000 mg = 421,000 mg\n\nTherefore, the deficit for this 60 kg person with an Hb of 5 g/dL is 421,000 mg. \n\nNone of the answer choices are exact, but the closest option is 4000 mg (or 4 grams).",
