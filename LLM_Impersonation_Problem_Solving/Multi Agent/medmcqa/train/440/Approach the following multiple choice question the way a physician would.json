    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by first understanding what hypospadias is. Hypospadias is a congenital condition where the opening of the urethra is located on the underside of the penis, rather than at the tip.\n\nIn most cases of hypospadias, the urethral opening is located on the penile shaft or on the scrotum (perineal). Glandular hypospadias refers to cases where the opening is located on the glans or head of the penis. Coronal hypospadias refers to cases where the opening is located on the underside of the penis near the corona or rim of the glans.\n\nBased on this understanding, the most common type of hypospadias is typically penile in nature. So, I would choose option 2: Penile as the most common type of hypospadias.",
