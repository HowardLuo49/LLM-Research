Factors such as molecular weight, protein binding, lipid solubility, and ionization at physiological pH would be taken into account.\n\nHeparin is a large molecule with high polarity, making it unlikely to cross the placenta. Warfarin, dicumarol, and nicoumalone are all coumarin derivatives that are known to cross the placenta and have teratogenic effects on the fetus. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\n2: Warfarin\n\nIt is important for medical researchers to understand which drugs can cross the placenta in order to minimize potential harm to the developing fetus during pregnancy.",
