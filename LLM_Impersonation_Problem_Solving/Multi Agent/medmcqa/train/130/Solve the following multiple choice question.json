This test can help identify if there are any abnormal cells present in the urine that may suggest a malignancy, such as bladder cancer. Other tests such as USG, X-ray KUB, and urine routine may also be helpful in further evaluating the cause of hematuria, but urine cytology is the most specific for detecting malignancy.",
