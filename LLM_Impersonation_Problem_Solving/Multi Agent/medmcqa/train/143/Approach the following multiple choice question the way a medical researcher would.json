They would analyze studies and clinical data to determine the frequency of different symptoms in patients with Grave's ophthalmopathy.\n\nBased on current knowledge and research, the most common presentation of Grave's ophthalmopathy is proptosis, which is the abnormal protrusion of the eyeball. Ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid, can also be present but is less common. Reduced intraocular tension and increased power of convergence are not typically associated with Grave's ophthalmopathy.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this multiple choice question from a medical researcher's perspective would be:\n\n1: Proptosis",
