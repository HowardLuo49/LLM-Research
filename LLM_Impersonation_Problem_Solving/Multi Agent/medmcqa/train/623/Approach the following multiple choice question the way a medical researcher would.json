    "gpt_response": "To determine the fatal period in sulphuric acid poisoning, a medical researcher would first review relevant medical literature, including case studies and research studies on sulphuric acid poisoning. They would then analyze the data to identify patterns and trends in the time from exposure to death in cases of sulphuric acid poisoning. Finally, they would need to consider factors such as the concentration of the acid, the route of exposure, and the individual's overall health to determine the most likely fatal period.\n\nBased on the available data, the researcher would need to calculate the average or median fatal period in cases of sulphuric acid poisoning. They would also need to determine the range of fatal periods and any factors that may influence the timing of death in these cases.\n\nGiven the options provided in the question, the medical researcher would select the most accurate and evidence-based answer based on their review of the literature and analysis of the data.",
