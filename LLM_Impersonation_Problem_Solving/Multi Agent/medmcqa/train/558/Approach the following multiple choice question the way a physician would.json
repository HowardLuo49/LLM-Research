It is not typically associated with gastric irritation. \n\nIbuprofen is known to have a moderate risk of causing gastric irritation, so it is not the correct answer. \n\nNaproxen is associated with the least risk of causing gastric irritation among the NSAIDs listed, making it the correct answer in this scenario. \n\nTherefore, as a physician, I would select option 4: Naproxen as the NSAID least likely to cause gastric irritation.",
