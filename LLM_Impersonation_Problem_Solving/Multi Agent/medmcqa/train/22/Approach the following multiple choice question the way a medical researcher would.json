    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by analyzing the possible anatomical positions of the vocal cords in a cadaver. \n\n1: Median position would suggest that the vocal cords are in the middle of the trachea, which is not a typical anatomical location for them.\n\n2: Paramedian position would suggest that the vocal cords are slightly off-center, which could be a more accurate representation of their typical position.\n\n3: Intermediate position is not a typical term used to describe the position of vocal cords. \n\n4: Full abduction refers to the vocal cords being fully open, which is not a position in terms of location but rather function.\n\nBased on the options provided, the most appropriate answer for the position of vocal cord in a cadaver would be 2: Paramedian.",
