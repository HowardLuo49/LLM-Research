Korsakoff psychosis is a neurological disorder that is primarily characterized by severe memory loss and cognitive impairment. \n\nGiven this information, the most relevant characteristic feature of Korsakoff psychosis would be amnesia (option 4). Disorientation (option 1) and delirium (option 2) are symptoms that can occur in Korsakoff psychosis, but they are not considered characteristic features of the disorder. Coarse tremor (option 3) is not typically associated with Korsakoff psychosis. \n\nTherefore, as a medical researcher, I would choose option 4: Amnesia as the characteristic feature of Korsakoff psychosis.",
