    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, a medical researcher would first review their knowledge of the anatomy of the heart to understand the locations of the structures mentioned in each answer choice. \n\nThe supraventricular crest is a ridge of tissue located in the right atrium of the heart. Based on this information, the researcher would eliminate answer choices 4 (right and left coronary artery) as these structures are not located in the right atrium. \n\nNext, the researcher would recall that the fossa ovalis is a depression in the interatrial septum of the heart, and the superior vena cava (SVC) is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood into the right atrium. The researcher would know that the atrioventricular orifice refers to the opening between the atrium and ventricle. \n\nBased on this information, the researcher would determine that the correct answer is 2: Atrioventricular orifice and fossa ovalis, as the supraventricular crest lies between these two structures in the right atrium.",
