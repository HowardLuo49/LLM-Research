    "gpt_response": "In regards to secondary retention for a removable partial denture, it is important to consider the different components that contribute to the overall stability of the prosthesis. Secondary retention is primarily provided by the intimate contact between the denture bases and the underlying tissues. This helps to create a seal that holds the denture in place during function. While both direct and indirect retainers play a role in supporting and stabilizing the denture, they do not specifically contribute to secondary retention. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n3: Intimate contact between the denture bases and the underlying tissues",
