This test involves analyzing cerebrospinal fluid obtained through a lumbar puncture for evidence of infection, such as increased white blood cells and bacteria or other pathogens. CSF PCR can also be a useful test to identify specific pathogens causing the infection. Widal test is used for diagnosing typhoid fever, and PET scan is not typically used for diagnosing meningitis.",
