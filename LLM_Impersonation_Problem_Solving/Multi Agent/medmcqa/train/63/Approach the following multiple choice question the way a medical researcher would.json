Posterior dislocation of the hip typically results in a position of flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. This is because the femur is forced out of the socket posteriorly, causing the leg to be positioned in this specific manner. \n\nBased on this understanding, the correct answer to the multiple choice question would be:\n\n2: Flexion, adduction & internal rotation",
