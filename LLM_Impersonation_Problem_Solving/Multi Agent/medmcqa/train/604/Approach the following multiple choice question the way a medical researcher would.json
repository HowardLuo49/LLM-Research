HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) indicates a current infection with hepatitis B virus. IgM Anti-HBc (IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) is indicative of recent infection, while HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen) is a marker of high infectivity.\n\nGiven that the patient is positive for HBsAg, IgM Anti-HBc, and HBeAg, this suggests an acute infection with hepatitis B virus and high infectivity.
