    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 2: Acute hepatitis B with high infectivity.\n\nThis is because the presence of HBsAg, IgM Anti-HBc and HBeAg positive indicates an acute infection of hepatitis B with high infectivity. HBsAg is the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus, IgM Anti-HBc indicates recent infection, and HBeAg is a marker of active viral replication.",
