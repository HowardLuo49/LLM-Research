The presentation of neurological symptoms suggests that the infection may have progressed to the tertiary stage of syphilis. \n\nTo monitor the response to treatment for syphilis, the standard tests that are typically used include the VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test, RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test, and FTA ABS (Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption) test. \n\nIn this scenario, the most appropriate test to monitor the response to treatment would be either the VDRL or RPR test. These tests are used to detect the presence of antibodies against the syphilis bacterium and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. The TPI (Treponema pallidum immobilization) test is another test for syphilis, but it is not commonly used for monitoring treatment response. \n\nTherefore, in this context, the most appropriate test to monitor the response to treatment would be either VDRL or RPR.",
