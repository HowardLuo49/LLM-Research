    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this question by considering the physiological processes that occur in the body after death. Putrefaction is the process of decay that begins shortly after death. In females, the last organ to putrefy would likely be the uterus, as it is a relatively protected organ located inside the pelvis. The other organs listed (liver, brain, breast) are more exposed and therefore would likely undergo putrefaction more quickly. Therefore, I would choose option 2: Uterus as the last organ to putrefy in females.",
