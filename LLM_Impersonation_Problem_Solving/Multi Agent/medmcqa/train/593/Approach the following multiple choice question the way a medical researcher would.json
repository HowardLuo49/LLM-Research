Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: The functional unit of muscle that is responsible for muscle contraction is the sarcomere. Sarcomeres are made up of actin and myosin filaments, as well as troponin and tropomyosin proteins. Therefore, the correct answer to the multiple choice question would be 1: Sarcomere.",
