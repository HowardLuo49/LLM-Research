In this case, the least useful investigation in multiple myeloma would be the ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), as it is a non-specific marker of inflammation and would not provide specific information about the presence of multiple myeloma. The most useful investigations in diagnosing multiple myeloma include a bone marrow biopsy, which can provide definitive evidence of abnormal plasma cells, as well as imaging studies such as X-rays and bone scans to evaluate skeletal involvement.",
