Given these findings, the likely cause would be polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age and is characterized by hormonal imbalances, such as high levels of LH and androgens, leading to symptoms such as hirsutism and irregular periods. Exogenous steroid ingestion could also potentially cause similar hormonal imbalances, but in this case, PCOS would be the more likely diagnosis. Turner syndrome and Kleinfelter syndrome typically present with other clinical features and not typically associated with high levels of LH and androgens.",
