I would look for studies that have identified the virus responsible for causing the condition.\n\nGiven the options provided in the multiple choice question, I would also consider the known characteristics of each virus. Enterovirus 70 is known to cause acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, so this would be a likely choice. Adenovirus is another common cause of viral conjunctivitis, but it is not typically associated with the hemorrhagic form. Poliovirus is not known to cause acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Hepadnavirus is associated with hepatitis B, not conjunctivitis.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, I would select option 1: Enterovirus 70 as the cause of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Further research and laboratory testing may be needed to confirm this association.",
