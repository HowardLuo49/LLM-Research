Metachromatic granules are structures found in certain bacteria and are known to take up stains differently than the surrounding cytoplasm.\n\nIn this case, I would eliminate options 2 and 3 (Negative stain and Gram's stain) as these are typically not used for staining metachromatic granules. Negative stain is used for highlighting the background of a specimen, while Gram's stain is used for differentiating between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nNext, I would consider options 1 (Ponder's stain) and 4 (Leishman stain). While Ponder's stain is a general histological stain that can be used for various purposes, Leishman stain is commonly used in the laboratory to stain structures like granules in cells. Therefore, I would choose option 4: Leishman stain as the correct answer for staining metachromatic granules.",
