    "gpt_response": "A medical researcher would approach this question by evaluating the various indicators of antemortem drowning to determine which one is the most reliable and specific. \n\nIn this case, the best indicator of antemortem drowning would be froth in the mouth and nostrils. Froth in the airway is a common finding in cases of drowning due to the body's natural response to inhaling water. This indicator is more specific and directly related to the act of drowning compared to the other options provided. Washerman's hand and cutis anserina are more general signs of drowning and can be present in various other conditions as well. Water in the nose may be seen in cases of drowning, but it is not as reliable of an indicator as froth in the mouth and nostrils. \n\nTherefore, a medical researcher would choose option 1: Froth in the mouth and nostrils as the best indicator of antemortem drowning.",
