    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is 3: Doppler law. Pulse oximetry works by measuring the changes in blood volume in tissues, which can be detected through the Doppler effect. This method is commonly used in medical settings to measure blood oxygen levels and assess tissue perfusion. Beer's law, Pascal's law, and Poisslues law are not directly related to the determination of pulp vitality by pulse oximeter.",
