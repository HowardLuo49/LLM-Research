    "gpt_response": "Based on the presentation of delayed milestones, hypopigmented hair and blue eyes, eczemas, and irritability, the most likely diagnosis is Albinism. Albinism is a genetic condition characterized by a lack of melanin production, leading to fair skin, hair, and eyes. It can also be associated with vision problems and skin conditions such as eczema. Phenylketonuria, Alkaptonuria, and Cystinosis would not typically present with the same symptoms as described in this case.",
