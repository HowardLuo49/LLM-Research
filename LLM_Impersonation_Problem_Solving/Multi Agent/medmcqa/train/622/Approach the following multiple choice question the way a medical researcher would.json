    "gpt_response": "To determine the correct answer, a medical researcher may first consider the structure and function of acyl carnitine. Acyl carnitine is known to play a role in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation. This process is essential for energy production in the form of ATP. Long chain fatty acids are typically greater than 12 carbons in length, making option 1 the most likely correct answer. A researcher may also consider the metabolic pathways involved in the transportation of short chain fatty acids, NADH, and FADH in order to rule out these options.",
