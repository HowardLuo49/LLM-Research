Five days after an uneventful cholecystectomy, an asymptomatic middle-aged woman is found to have a serum sodium level of 125 mEq/L.

In this case, the most likely cause is syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), a common complication after surgery.\n\nThe most appropriate management strategy for this patient would be option 2: Restriction of free water. This involves limiting the patient's intake of fluids to help correct the imbalance of sodium in the body. This can be done by monitoring fluid intake and output, and adjusting accordingly.\n\nOptions 1, 3, and 4 are not appropriate in this case as they do not address the underlying cause of the hyponatremia.
