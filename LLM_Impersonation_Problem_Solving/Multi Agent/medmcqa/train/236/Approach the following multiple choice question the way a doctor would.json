    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when approaching this question, I would consider each option carefully based on my medical knowledge and experience.\n\nBlood stained sputum can be a concerning symptom and may indicate various underlying conditions. In this case, we are looking for a condition where blood stained sputum may be the only symptom.\n\n1: Bronchiectasis - Bronchiectasis is a condition where the airways in the lungs are abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of mucus and recurrent infections. Blood stained sputum may be present in bronchiectasis, but it is not typically the only symptom.\n\n2: Carcinoma bronchus (lung cancer) - Lung cancer, specifically carcinoma bronchus, can present with blood stained sputum as one of the symptoms. In some cases, blood stained sputum may be the only symptom in the early stages of lung cancer.\n\n3: Adenoma bronchus - Adenoma bronchus refers to a benign tumor in the bronchial tubes. While blood stained sputum can be a symptom of adenoma bronchus, it is not typically the only symptom.\n\n4: Pulmonary T.B. (tuberculosis) - Pulmonary TB is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. Blood stained sputum is a common symptom of pulmonary TB, but it is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as cough, fever, weight loss, and fatigue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely answer is 2: Carcinoma bronchus, as blood stained sputum may be the only symptom in some cases of lung cancer.",
