    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "The mandibular nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), supplies sensory innervation to the lower teeth and gums, the floor of the mouth, the skin of the lower jaw, part of the external ear, and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It also supplies motor innervation to the muscles of mastication, including the masseter, temporalis, and tensor tympani muscles. The buccinator muscle, however, is innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1: Buccinator",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question, with options 1, 2, 3, 4. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: The mandibular nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), supplies sensory innervation to the lower teeth and gums, the floor of the mouth, the skin of the lower jaw, part of the external ear, and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It also supplies motor innervation to the muscles of mastication, including the masseter, temporalis, and tensor tympani muscles.
