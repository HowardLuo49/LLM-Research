    "gpt_response": "Based on the presentation of a middle-aged female with a mass in the sella turcica and increased hormone levels, the most likely hormone to be elevated would be prolactin. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary adenoma, typically found in the sella turcica, and can cause increased prolactin levels leading to symptoms such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility. Thyroxine, estrogen, and ADH are not typically associated with sella turcica masses or increased levels in this context.",
