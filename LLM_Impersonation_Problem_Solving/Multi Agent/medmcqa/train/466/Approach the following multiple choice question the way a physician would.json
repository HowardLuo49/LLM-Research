    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this multiple choice question by considering each option in relation to its potential to cause glomerular proteinuria. \n\n1: Diabetes Mellitus is a well-known cause of glomerular proteinuria, particularly diabetic nephropathy which can lead to damage to the glomeruli and protein leakage into the urine. \n\n2: Amyloidosis can also be a cause of glomerular proteinuria, as the deposition of amyloid protein in the kidney can lead to damage to the glomeruli and protein leakage.\n\n3: Multiple myeloma is also a known cause of glomerular proteinuria, as the abnormal proteins produced by the plasma cells can accumulate in the kidneys and lead to kidney damage.\n\n4: \"Nil Lesion\" typically refers to a normal or non-specific finding on kidney biopsy, rather than a specific cause of glomerular proteinuria. Therefore, this would be the correct answer as the cause of glomerular proteinuria.\n\nIn conclusion, as a physician, I would choose option 4: Nil Lesion as the correct answer as it is not a known cause of glomerular proteinuria.",
