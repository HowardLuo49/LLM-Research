    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, when considering signs of diabetic ketoacidosis, it is important to focus on symptoms related to metabolic abnormalities and electrolyte imbalances that are commonly seen in this condition. In this case, the sign of dehydration (option 3) would be most relevant for diabetic ketoacidosis, as it is a consequence of high blood sugar levels leading to increased urination and fluid loss. Other signs such as loss of sweating (option 1) may also be present due to dehydration, but it is important to prioritize symptoms that directly reflect the underlying pathophysiology of the condition. Depression (option 2) and absent deep tendon reflexes (option 4) are not typically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis and would not be the primary signs to consider in this context.",
