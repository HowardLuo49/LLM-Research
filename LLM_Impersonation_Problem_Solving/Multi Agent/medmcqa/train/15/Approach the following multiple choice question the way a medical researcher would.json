This test can help identify any abnormal cells in the urine that may indicate the presence of a malignancy, such as bladder cancer. While other investigations like USG and X-ray KUB can provide valuable information, urine cytology is specifically focused on detecting cancer cells in the urine, making it the most relevant test in this scenario.",
