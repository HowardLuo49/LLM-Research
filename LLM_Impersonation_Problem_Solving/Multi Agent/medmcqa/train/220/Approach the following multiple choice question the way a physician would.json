    "gpt_response": "As a physician, I would approach this multiple choice question by considering the most common causes of bacterial pyogenic parotitis affecting the parotid gland. In this case, the correct answer would be option 3: Debilitation after major surgery. This is because postoperative patients are at an increased risk for developing parotitis due to factors such as decreased saliva production, impaired immune response, and possible introduction of bacteria during the surgical procedure. Other options such as uveo-parotid fever, mumps, and administration of iodine are less likely to be associated with bacterial parotitis.",
