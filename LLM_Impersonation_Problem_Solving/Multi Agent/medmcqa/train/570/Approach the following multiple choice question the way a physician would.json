    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "1: Ca\n\nExocytosis is a cellular process in which vesicles inside the cell fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. Calcium ions play a crucial role in the regulation of this process by triggering the fusion of the vesicle with the cell membrane. Therefore, calcium is the correct answer in this case.",
