    "gpt_response": "To determine the storage form of thyroid hormone, a medical researcher would need to evaluate the properties and functions of each of the options provided.\n\n1: Tri-iodo tyrosine - This is a precursor to the synthesis of thyroid hormones, but it is not the storage form of thyroid hormone.\n\n2: Tri - iodo thyronine - This is a form of thyroid hormone, also known as T3, which is the active form of thyroid hormone. It is not typically the storage form of thyroid hormone.\n\n3: Thyroglobulin - This is a storage form of thyroid hormone. Thyroglobulin is a protein produced by the thyroid gland that stores thyroid hormones within its structure until they are needed. This is the correct answer for the storage form of thyroid hormone.\n\n4: Di-iodo tyrosine - This is another precursor to the synthesis of thyroid hormones, but it is not the storage form of thyroid hormone.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer for the storage form of thyroid hormone is option 3: Thyroglobulin.",
