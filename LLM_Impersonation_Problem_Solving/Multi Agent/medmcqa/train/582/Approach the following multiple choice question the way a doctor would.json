Gastroesophageal obstruction (G.O.O.) can lead to persistent vomiting which can result in a number of electrolyte and acid-base imbalances. \n\nOption a) Hyponatremic hyperchloremia can occur due to loss of stomach acid and fluids in the vomitus. Option b) Hypernatremia without decreased chloride can happen due to dehydration from vomiting. Option c) Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis can occur due to loss of potassium and hydrogen ions. Option d) Paradoxical aciduria is when there is aciduria despite metabolic alkalosis.\n\nBased on my medical knowledge, I would select option c) Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis as the most likely consequence of persistent vomiting in G.O.O. This is because vomiting leads to loss of stomach acid and potassium, resulting in metabolic alkalosis with low potassium levels.",
