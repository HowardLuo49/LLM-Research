Given these symptoms, the most probable diagnosis in this case would likely be meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Meconium aspiration syndrome occurs when a newborn inhales meconium (the baby's first stool) into their lungs during or before delivery, leading to airway obstruction, inflammation, and respiratory distress. \n\nTherefore, out of the options provided, I would select:\n4: Meconium aspiration syndrome",
