    "gpt_response": "As a physician, the best procedure for intrapartum fetal monitoring would be continuous electrical fetal heart monitoring (option 3). This method provides real-time monitoring of the fetus's heart rate during labor and delivery, allowing for prompt detection of any abnormalities or distress. Fetal echocardiography (option 1) is a diagnostic imaging technique used to assess the fetal heart structure, but it is not typically used for intrapartum monitoring. Fetal scalp pH (option 2) is used to assess fetal oxygenation, but it is a more invasive procedure and is usually reserved for cases where continuous monitoring is not feasible. Physical examination (option 4) alone is not sufficient for accurate intrapartum fetal monitoring.",
