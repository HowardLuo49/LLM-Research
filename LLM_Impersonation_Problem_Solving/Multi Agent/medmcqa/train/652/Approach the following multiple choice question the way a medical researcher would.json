They would look at factors such as frequency of co-occurrence, common risk factors, genetic mutations, and any known pathways that connect the two conditions.\n\nBased on current research, the correct answer would be option 2: Retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye cancer that is associated with an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly in individuals with a genetic mutation in the RB1 gene. Studies have shown a strong link between retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma, making it the condition with the strongest association with osteosarcoma among the options listed.",
