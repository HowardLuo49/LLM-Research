    "gpt_response": "The daily maintenance fluid requirement for a child is calculated using the Holliday-Segar method which states that for the first 10 kg of body weight, 100 mL/kg/day is given, for the next 10 kg, 50 mL/kg/day is given, and for every additional kg after that, 20 mL/kg/day is given.\n\nFor a child weighing 24 kg, the calculation is as follows:\n- For the first 10 kg: 10 kg * 100 mL/kg/day = 1000 mL/day\n- For the next 10 kg: 10 kg * 50 mL/kg/day = 500 mL/day\n- For the remaining 4 kg: 4 kg * 20 mL/kg/day = 80 mL/day\n\nAdding these together, we get: 1000 mL/day + 500 mL/day + 80 mL/day = 1580 mL/day\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: 4: 1580 mL/day.",
