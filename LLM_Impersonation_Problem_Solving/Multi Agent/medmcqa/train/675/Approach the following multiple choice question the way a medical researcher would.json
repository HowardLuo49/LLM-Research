Ferruginous bodies are asbestos fibers coated with an iron-protein complex, and they are pathognomonic for asbestos exposure. Therefore, the correct answer would be 3: Asbestosis. Silicosis is caused by inhalation of silica dust, and does not present with Ferruginous bodies. Byssinosis is caused by inhalation of textile dust, and Baggassosis is caused by inhalation of sugar cane dust, neither of which are associated with Ferruginous bodies.",
