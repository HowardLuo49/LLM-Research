It works by binding to bacterial RNA polymerase and inhibiting RNA synthesis. Therefore, it does inhibit DNA dependent RNA synthesis.\n\n2: Ethambutol is another drug used to treat tuberculosis, but it works by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acids in the cell wall of the bacteria. It does not directly inhibit DNA dependent RNA synthesis.\n\n3: Colchicine is a medication used to treat gout and familial Mediterranean fever by inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It does not directly inhibit DNA dependent RNA synthesis.\n\n4: Chloromycetin (chloramphenicol) is an antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It does not directly inhibit DNA dependent RNA synthesis.\n\nTherefore, of the options provided, rifampicin is the drug that inhibits DNA dependent RNA synthesis.",
