    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "To determine which ligament is most likely to be injured in this case, we must consider the anatomy and function of the ligaments surrounding the ankle joint. In a typical inversion injury, the most commonly injured ligament is the anterior talofibular ligament (A), followed by the calcaneofibular ligament (C), and then the posterior talofibular ligament (D). The ligament least likely to be injured in this scenario is the deltoid ligament (B), as this ligament is on the medial side of the ankle and is less commonly affected in inversion injuries. Therefore, the correct answer is A: the anterior talofibular ligament.",
