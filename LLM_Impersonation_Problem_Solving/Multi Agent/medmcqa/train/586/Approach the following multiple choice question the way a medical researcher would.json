    "gpt_response": "To approach this multiple choice question as a medical researcher, we would systematically evaluate each option based on our knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and medical conditions related to uterine souffle.\n\n1: A soft blowing murmur synchronous with fetal heart sounds: This is a common description of uterine souffle, which is caused by the flow of blood through the dilated uterine vessels, particularly during pregnancy.\n\n2: Due to an increase in blood flow through the dilated uterine vessels: This is correct. Uterine souffle is indeed caused by the increase in blood flow through the dilated uterine vessels.\n\n3: Due to active fetal movements: While fetal movements can sometimes be detected by monitoring devices, they are not directly related to uterine souffle. Uterine souffle is primarily caused by blood flow through the uterine vessels.\n\n4: Indicates underlying fetal distress: Uterine souffle is typically considered a normal physiological finding during pregnancy and is not directly indicative of fetal distress.\n\nBased on our evaluation, option 2 (\"Is due to an increase in blood flow through the dilated uterine vessels\") is the correct answer as it aligns with our understanding of uterine souffle as a result of increased blood flow through dilated uterine vessels.",
