One of the constituents of the commonly used metered dose inhalers in bronchial asthma which is an air pollutant & dangerous to earth's stratosphere is -\n1: Flurocarbons\n2: Salbutamol\n3: Ozone\n4: Oxygen",
    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by first understanding the purpose of metered dose inhalers in bronchial asthma and how they function. Metered dose inhalers deliver medication directly to the lungs to treat asthma symptoms such as bronchospasm and inflammation.\n\nNext, I would consider the options provided in the question. Salbutamol is a common bronchodilator medication used in inhalers to relieve asthma symptoms. Oxygen is a naturally occurring gas essential for human life and is not a pollutant. Ozone is a harmful air pollutant found in the earth's stratosphere, but it is not typically used as a constituent in metered dose inhalers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is 1: Flurocarbons. Flurocarbons are chemicals found in some metered dose inhalers as propellants to deliver the medication. However, flurocarbons are known to contribute to ozone depletion in the earth's stratosphere, making them a dangerous air pollutant.",
