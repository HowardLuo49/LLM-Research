Ministry of health and family welfare - While this ministry may have programs related to child health and welfare, it may not specifically focus on child protection schemes.\n\n2. Ministry of Social welfare - This ministry could have a role in child protection, but it may be more broadly focused on social welfare issues for all age groups, not specifically children.\n\n3. Ministry of Women and Child Development - This ministry is most likely to be responsible for child protection schemes as it specifically mentions women and children in its title.\n\n4.
