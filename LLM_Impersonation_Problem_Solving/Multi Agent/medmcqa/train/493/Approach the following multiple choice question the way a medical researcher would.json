They would consider the prevalence of each potential cause in this age group and compare the likelihood of each condition causing hirsutism.\n\nBased on previous research, the most common cause of hirsutism in teenage girls is usually obesity, as it can lead to an imbalance of hormones such as insulin and androgens, which can contribute to excessive hair growth. Other common causes of hirsutism in adolescent girls include adrenal gland disorders like adrenogenital syndrome.\n\nWhile ovarian diseases and pheochromocytoma can also present with hirsutism, they are less commonly seen in teenage girls. Therefore, from a research perspective, obesity would be the most likely cause of hirsutism in a teenage girl based on existing evidence.",
