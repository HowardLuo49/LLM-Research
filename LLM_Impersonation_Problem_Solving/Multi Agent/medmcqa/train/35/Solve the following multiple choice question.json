    "gpt_response": "1: Left lateral decubitus view\n\nThe left lateral decubitus view is the preferred view for detecting free air (pneumoperitoneum) in the abdomen. This position allows the free air to collect along the right lateral side of the abdomen, making it more visible on the x-ray. Standing position is usually the best for detecting free air, but since the patient is unable to stand, the left lateral decubitus view would be the next best option.",
