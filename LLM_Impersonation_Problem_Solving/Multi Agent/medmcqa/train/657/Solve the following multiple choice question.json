    "gpt_response": "1: Loss of sensation of lateral foot. \n2: Loss of sensation of adjacent sides of 1st & 2nd toe. \n3: Inversion inability. \n4: Loss of dorsiflexion.\n\nThe correct answer would be:\n1: Loss of sensation of lateral foot. \n2: Loss of sensation of adjacent sides of 1st & 2nd toe. \n4: Loss of dorsiflexion.\n\nInjury to the common fibular nerve (also known as the common peroneal nerve) which runs along the lateral aspect of the fibula can result in loss of sensation in the lateral foot and adjacent sides of 1st & 2nd toe. It can also lead to weakness or paralysis of the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion of the foot. Inversion inability is a function of the tibial nerve which is not directly affected by a lathi injury to the lateral aspect of the fibula.",
