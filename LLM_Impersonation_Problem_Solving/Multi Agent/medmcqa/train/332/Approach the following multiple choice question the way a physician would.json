    "solution": 4,
    "gpt_response": "As a physician, when considering which anaesthetic agent increases intracranial tension, it is important to understand how each agent affects the central nervous system. \n\n1) Thiopentone: Thiopentone is a barbiturate that can decrease intracranial pressure by reducing cerebral metabolic rate, cerebral blood flow, and neuronal activity. It is commonly used in neurosurgical procedures to reduce intracranial pressure.\n\n2) Propofol: Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent that is commonly used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It can also reduce intracranial pressure by decreasing cerebral blood flow and neuronal activity.\n\n3) Lignocaine: Lignocaine, also known as lidocaine, is a local anaesthetic that is not typically associated with increasing intracranial pressure.\n\n4) Sevoflurane: Sevoflurane is an inhaled anaesthetic agent that can increase intracranial pressure by causing cerebral vasodilation and increasing cerebral blood flow. It should be used with caution in patients with elevated intracranial pressure.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, Sevoflurane is the anaesthetic agent that increases intracranial tension.",
