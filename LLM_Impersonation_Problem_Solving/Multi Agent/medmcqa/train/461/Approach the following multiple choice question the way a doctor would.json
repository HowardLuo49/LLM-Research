This is a characteristic of the virus.\n\n3: HIV is not easily inactivated by 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It typically requires more potent disinfectants to effectively kill the virus.\n\n4: HIV is not thermostable, meaning it is not resistant to heat. High temperatures can effectively inactivate the virus.\n\nTherefore, based on my medical knowledge, I would choose option 1 as the correct answer: HIV can cross the blood brain barrier.",
