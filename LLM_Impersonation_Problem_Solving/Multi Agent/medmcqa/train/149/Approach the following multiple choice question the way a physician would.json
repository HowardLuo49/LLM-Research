Receptor activation, selective gate, and non-selective channel are all components of transport systems in the body. These components play a role in facilitating the movement of molecules across cell membranes.\n\nTherefore, from a physiological standpoint, the component that is not typically associated with transport systems in the body is option 4: Energy coupling system. Energy coupling systems are more often associated with cellular processes such as ATP synthesis, rather than transport mechanisms.",
