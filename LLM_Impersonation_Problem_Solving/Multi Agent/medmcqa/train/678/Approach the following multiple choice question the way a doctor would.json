Patient gives a history of road traffic accident 5 hours ago and had a lacerated wound on lower back region. General physical examination reveals-\nBlood pressure-80/60mmHg.\nJuglar venous pressure- low.\nPulsus paradoxus- present.\nCardiac output- Increased.\nThe patient is in which type of shock?\n1: Neurogenic\n2: Obstructive\n3: Distributive\n4: Hypovolemic",
    "solution": 3,
    "gpt_response": "Based on the symptoms described and the patient's history of a road traffic accident with a lacerated wound, the patient is most likely in hypovolemic shock. This type of shock is characterized by low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased blood volume due to significant blood loss. The presence of pulsus paradoxus, which is an exaggerated drop in blood pressure during inspiration, also supports the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock. Immediate treatment should focus on stopping the bleeding, restoring blood volume, and stabilizing the patient's condition.",
