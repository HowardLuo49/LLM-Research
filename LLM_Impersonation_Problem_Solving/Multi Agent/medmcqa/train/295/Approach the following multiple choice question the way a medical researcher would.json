    "solution": 1,
    "gpt_response": "To determine the preferred choice between Metoprolol and Propranolol for a medical researcher, the researcher would need to consider the specific characteristics and mechanisms of action of each drug.\n\nMetoprolol is a selective beta-1 receptor blocker, while Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker that blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Therefore, option 1 is correct - Metoprolol is more potent in blocking beta-1 receptors.\n\nBeta-2 receptors play a role in bronchodilation and vascular smooth muscle relaxation, so blocking beta-2 receptors with Propranolol could potentially lead to unwanted side effects such as bronchoconstriction and vasoconstriction. This is why Metoprolol, which is selective for beta-1 receptors, may be preferred in certain situations.\n\nOptions 3 and 4 are not valid reasons for preferring Metoprolol over Propranolol, as the efficacy in suppressing essential tremors and the impairment of exercise capacity are not generally considered when choosing between the two drugs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n1: Is more potent in blocking beta-1 receptors.",
