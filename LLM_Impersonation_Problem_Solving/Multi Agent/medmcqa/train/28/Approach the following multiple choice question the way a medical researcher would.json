    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would approach this question by considering the current evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of traumatic facial nerve injury. \n\nBased on existing research, the treatment of choice for traumatic facial nerve injury would likely be systemic corticosteroids. This is because corticosteroids have been shown to reduce inflammation and edema, which can help improve nerve function and potentially lead to better outcomes for patients with facial nerve injuries.\n\nWhile facial sling, facial nerve repair, and conservative management may also play a role in the overall management of traumatic facial nerve injuries, systemic corticosteroids are commonly recommended as the initial treatment option. However, the specific treatment approach may vary depending on the severity of the nerve injury and individual patient factors. \n\nIn conclusion, as a medical researcher, I would consider systemic corticosteroids as the treatment of choice in traumatic facial nerve injury based on current evidence and guidelines.",
