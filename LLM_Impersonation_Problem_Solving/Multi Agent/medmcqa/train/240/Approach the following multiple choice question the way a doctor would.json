In this case, the proposed guideline values should be based on minimizing potential health risks associated with exposure to radioactive substances.\n\nBased on this principle, the answer with the most conservative values for radioactivity levels would be the safest option. Therefore, I would choose option 1: Gross a activity 0.1 Bq/L and Gross b activity 1.0 Bq/L as the proposed guideline value for radioactivity in drinking water. This option provides lower levels of radioactive substances, which would lessen the potential health risks for individuals consuming the water.",
