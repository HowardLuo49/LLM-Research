    "gpt_response": "As a physician, it is important to understand the metabolic pathways involved in alcohol metabolism in order to effectively manage patients with chronic alcoholism. The rate-limiting component for alcohol metabolism excluding enzymes is the cofactor NAD+. NAD+ is required for the conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, and a depletion of NAD+ can slow down the metabolism of alcohol leading to its accumulation in the body. Therefore, the correct answer to this question would be:\n\n2: NAD+",
