    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would choose option 2: Atracurium. Atracurium is a muscle relaxant that is often used in patients with renal failure because it is predominantly metabolized by the liver and does not require renal excretion for elimination. This makes it a safer choice in patients with impaired kidney function. The other options, Ketamine, Pancuronium, and Fentanyl, may not be as suitable for use in patients with renal failure due to their potential effects on renal function.",
