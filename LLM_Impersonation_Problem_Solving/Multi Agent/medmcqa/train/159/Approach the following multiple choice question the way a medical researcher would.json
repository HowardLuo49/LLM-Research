    "gpt_response": "As a medical researcher, I would consider the characteristics of the tests in terms of their specificity and sensitivity for detecting renovascular hypertension. \n\nCT Angiography and Doppler ultrasound of renal arteries are both imaging tests that can provide detailed information about the renal vasculature, making them potentially useful for diagnosing renovascular hypertension. However, CT Angiography is more specific and sensitive compared to Doppler ultrasound as it provides a more detailed and accurate assessment of the renal arteries.\n\nCaptopril enhanced radionuclide scan is a functional test that involves measuring changes in renal perfusion before and after administration of a medication called captopril. While this test may be helpful in certain cases, it is less specific and sensitive compared to CT Angiography for diagnosing renovascular hypertension.\n\nIn summary, based on specificity and sensitivity criteria, CT Angiography would be considered the most specific and sensitive screening test for renovascular hypertension among the options provided.",
