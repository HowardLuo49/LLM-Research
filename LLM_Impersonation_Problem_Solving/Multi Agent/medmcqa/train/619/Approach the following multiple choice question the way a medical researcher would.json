    "gpt_response": "The most important prognostic factor of Wilms tumor is typically histopathology. While ploidy of cells, age at diagnosis, and specific genetic mutations can also play a role in predicting prognosis, histopathology, which involves analyzing the microscopic structure of tumor tissue, is crucial in determining the aggressiveness of the tumor and guiding treatment decisions.",
