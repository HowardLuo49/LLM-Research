    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a physician, we must first understand that putrefaction is the process of tissue decomposition after death. Therefore, we are looking for a substance that slows down or retards this natural process.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer would be option 1: Aluminium phosphide. Aluminium phosphide is a pesticide that releases phosphine gas when it comes into contact with moisture or acids. This gas is toxic and inhibits the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria, leading to cell death. One of the effects of phosphine gas poisoning is the inhibition of bacterial growth, which ultimately slows down the process of putrefaction. \n\nTherefore, as a physician, the correct answer to the question is option 1: Aluminium phosphide.",
