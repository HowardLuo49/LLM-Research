    "gpt_response": "Medical researchers would approach this question by considering the effects of each substance on putrefaction. They would know that aluminium phosphide is a pesticide used to kill insects and rodents, but it has no known effect on putrefaction. Lead, arsenic, and copper are all heavy metals that have antimicrobial properties and can potentially retard putrefaction. However, arsenic is the most commonly known substance used historically to preserve bodies and retard putrefaction, making it the most likely correct answer based on medical research.",
