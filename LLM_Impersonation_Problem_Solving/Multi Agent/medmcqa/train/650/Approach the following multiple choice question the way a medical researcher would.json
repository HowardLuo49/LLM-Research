    "gpt_response": "To determine the correct answer as a medical researcher, one would need to review research studies and literature on the anatomy of the brain, specifically the opercular portion of the cerebral cortex and Broca's area. This would involve looking at neuroimaging studies, anatomical dissections, and functional MRI studies to understand the location of Broca's area within the brain.\n\nBased on existing knowledge, Broca's area is typically located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the opercular portion of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the correct answer to the multiple choice question is option 2: Inferior frontal gyrus.",
