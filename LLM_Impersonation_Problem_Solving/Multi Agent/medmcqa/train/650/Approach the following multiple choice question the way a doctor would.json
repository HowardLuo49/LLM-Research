    "gpt_response": "As a doctor, I would approach this question by first recognizing that the opercular portion of the cerebral cortex is associated with higher brain functions such as speech production. Broca's area, which is responsible for language production, is located in the dominant hemisphere of the brain. \n\nBased on this knowledge, I would consider the options provided:\n\n1: Superior frontal gyrus - This area is more related to motor functions and working memory, not language production.\n\n2: Inferior frontal gyrus - This area is associated with language and speech production, and specifically contains Broca's area. \n\n3: Cingulate sulcus - This area is associated with emotional processing and cognitive control, not specifically language production.\n\n4: Insula - This area is associated with various functions including interoception, emotion, and self-awareness, not specifically language production.\n\nTherefore, I would select option 2: Inferior frontal gyrus as the correct answer.",
