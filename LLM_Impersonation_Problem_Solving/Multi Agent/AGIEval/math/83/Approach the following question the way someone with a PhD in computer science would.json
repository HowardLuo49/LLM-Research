A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",
    "solution": "48",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can treat each plane as a distinct entity and think of the task as arranging these entities in a specific order (since the order in which the planes take off matters).\n\nSince there are 3 planes, we have 3! = 6 ways to arrange them. However, we must consider that the two runways are indistinguishable, meaning we need to divide our total number of arrangements by 2!. This accounts for cases where the planes are scheduled on the same runway but in a different order.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the three takeoffs can be scheduled is 3!/2! = 3 ways. This means there are 3 distinct ways in which the blue, red, and white planes can take off from the airport.",
