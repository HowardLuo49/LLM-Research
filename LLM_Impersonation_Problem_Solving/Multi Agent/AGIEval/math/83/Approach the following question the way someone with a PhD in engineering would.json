A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",

    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the number of ways in which the three planes can be scheduled for takeoff, we need to consider the possible permutations of the planes on the two runways. Since each plane can take off from either runway and the order of takeoff matters, we can use the concept of permutations.\n\nFor the first plane, there are 2 choices of runways. For the second plane, there are again 2 choices of runways. And for the third plane, there are once more 2 choices of runways. Therefore, the total number of ways in which the three takeoffs can be scheduled is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 ways in which the three planes can be scheduled for takeoff from the airport with two runways.",
