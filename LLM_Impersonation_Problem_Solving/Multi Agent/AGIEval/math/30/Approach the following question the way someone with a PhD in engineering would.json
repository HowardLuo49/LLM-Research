    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the surface area of the spheres. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the sphere. \n\nFor Theo's sphere with a radius of 5:\nSurface area = 4\u03c0(5)^2 = 4\u03c0(25) = 100\u03c0\n\nFor Akshaj's spheres with a radius of 2:\nTotal surface area = 2 * 4\u03c0(2)^2 = 2 * 4\u03c0(4) = 32\u03c0\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is:\n100\u03c0 / 32\u03c0 = 25/8\n\nIn conclusion, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 25:8.",
