    "gpt_response": "To factor the polynomial $32x^3-4x^2+20x$, we first look for common factors that can be factored out. In this case, the greatest common factor of the terms is 4x. When we factor out 4x, we get:\n\n$4x(8x^2 - x + 5)$\n\nNow, we need to factor the trinomial $8x^2 - x + 5$. To do this, we can use the quadratic formula or factor by grouping. Since the quadratic formula may be more appropriate in this context, let's use it:\n\nThe quadratic formula is $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, a = 8, b = -1, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(8)(5)}}{2(8)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 160}}{16}$\n\n$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-159}}{16}$\n\nSince the square root of -159 is not a real number, we can conclude that $8x^2 - x + 5$ cannot be factored further over the real numbers. Thus, the factored form of $32x^3-4x^2+20x$ is $4x(8x^2 - x + 5)$.",
