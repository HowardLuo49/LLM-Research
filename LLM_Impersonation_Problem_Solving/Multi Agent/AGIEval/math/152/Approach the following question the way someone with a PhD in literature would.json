    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the amount of time it will take Casey to paint $300$ dimples on the golf ball, we first need to determine the total time it takes to paint one dimple and then multiply it by the total number of dimples required. Given that Casey takes $2$ seconds to paint one dimple, the total time required to paint $300$ dimples can be calculated as follows:\n\n$300$ dimples * $2$ seconds/dimple = $600$ seconds\n\nTo convert this result into minutes, we divide by $60$:\n\n$600$ seconds / $60$ seconds/minute = $10$ minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Casey a total of $10$ minutes to paint $300$ dimples on the golf ball in his shop class.",
