This indicates that the function can be factorized in such a way that the factor in the numerator that causes the denominator to be zero at $x=-5$ can be canceled out. In other words, $(x+5)$ can be a factor of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nTo find the constant $c$, we can expand the factorized form of the function as:\n$\\frac{3x^2+16x+5}{2x^2+7x-c} = \\frac{(x+5)(3x+a)}{(x+5)(2x+b)}$\n\nWhere $a$ and $b$ are constants. By equating the terms inside the fraction bar, we have:\n$3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (x+5)(3x+a)$\n$2x^2 + 7x - c = (x+5)(2x+b)$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we solve for $a$:\n$3x^2 + 16x + 5 = 3x^2 + 5x + 3ax + 15 \\Rightarrow 16x = 5x + 3ax + 15$\n$11x = 3ax + 15 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{11x - 15}{3x} = \\frac{11}{3} - \\frac{15}{3x}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $a$ back to the second equation:\n$2x^2 + 7x - c = 2x^2 + bx + 10x + 5b$.\n\nComparing the coefficients of $x$ in both sides, we have:\n$7x = bx + 10x \\Rightarrow 7 = b + 10 \\Rightarrow b = -3$.\n\nTherefore, the factorized form of the function is:\n$\\frac{3x^2 + 16x + 5}{2x^2 + 7x - c} = \\frac{(x+5)(3x + \\frac{11}{3} - \\frac{15}{3x})}{(x+5)(2x - 3)} = \\frac{3x + 11 - 5x}{2x - 3} = \\frac{-2x + 11}{2x - 3}$.\n\nNow, to find the vertical asymptote of the graph, we need to find the values of $x$ which make the denominator zero.
