Two intersecting circles have a common chord of length 16 ft, and their centers lie on opposite sides of the chord. The radii of the circles are 10 ft and 17 ft respectively. Express the distance between the centers of the circles in feet.",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can utilize the properties of intersecting circles and the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote the distance between the centers of the circles as d, the radius of the smaller circle as r1 (10 ft), the radius of the larger circle as r2 (17 ft), and the length of the common chord as c (16 ft).\n\nFirst, we can draw a right triangle with legs of length r1 and r2, and the hypotenuse being equal to d.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up the following equation:\n\nr1^2 + r2^2 = d^2\n\nSubstitute the values of r1 and r2 into the equation:\n\n10^2 + 17^2 = d^2\n\n100 + 289 = d^2\n\n389 = d^2\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to solve for d:\n\nd = sqrt(389) \u2248 19.72 ft\n\nTherefore, the distance between the centers of the circles is approximately 19.72 ft.",
