    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the smallest possible integer value for x such that the function f(x) = $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$ yields a real number value, one must first consider the domain of the function. It is evident that the function is defined for all real numbers x such that x > 2, as the denominator x-2 must be non-zero.\n\nThe square root term $\\sqrt{x-1}$ is also only real-valued when the quantity under the square root is non-negative. Therefore, x-1 must be greater than or equal to 0, implying that x must be greater than or equal to 1. Combining these conditions, we find that x must be greater than 2 and greater than or equal to 1, yielding the smallest possible integer value for x to be 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the smallest possible integer value for x such that the function f(x) = $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$ has a real number value is x = 3.",
