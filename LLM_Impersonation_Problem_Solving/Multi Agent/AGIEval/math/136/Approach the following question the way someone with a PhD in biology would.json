    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $K$, we first need to determine the length of one of the diagonals of the rhombus. Since the area of a rhombus is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}d_1 d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the two diagonals, we can solve for the length of a diagonal as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n80 &= \\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2 \\\\\n160 &= d_1 d_2\n\\end{align*}\n\nNext, we find the distance between the two given points, $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$, which is the same as the length of one of the diagonals of the rhombus:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Distance} &= \\sqrt{ (4 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{ 8^2 } \\\\\n&= 8\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the length of one of the diagonals of the rhombus is 8 units. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and the midpoint of the given points, $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$, is the center of the rhombus, the other vertex $(0, K)$ lies on the line passing through the center of the rhombus $(0, 0)$. Therefore, the distance between the center and $(0, K)$ is half the length of the diagonal, which is 4 units.\n\nThus, $K = 4$.",
