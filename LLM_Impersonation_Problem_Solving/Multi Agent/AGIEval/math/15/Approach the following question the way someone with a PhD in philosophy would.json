    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the expression $16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}$, we must analyze each term individually. \n\nLet's start by examining $16^{17}$. We are only concerned with the units digit of this number, which follows a repeating pattern: the units digit of powers of 6 cycle in a pattern of 6, 6, 6, 6, ... Thus, the units digit of $16^{17}$ is the same as the units digit of $6^{17}$, which is 6.\n\nNext, we consider $17^{18}$. The units digit of powers of 7 cycle in a pattern of 7, 9, 3, 1, ... Thus, the units digit of $17^{18}$ is the same as the units digit of $7^{18}$, which is 1.\n\nLastly, we evaluate $18^{19}$. The units digit of powers of 8 cycle in a pattern of 8, 4, 2, 6, ... Thus, the units digit of $18^{19}$ is the same as the units digit of $8^{19}$, which is 8.\n\nMultiplying the units digits of these terms together, we have $6 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 48$. Therefore, the units digit of the expression $16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}$ is 8.",
