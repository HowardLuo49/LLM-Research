    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the given expression, we can consider each term individually and focus on their units digits. \n\nFirst, let's consider $16^{17}$. The units digit of powers of 6 follow a repeating pattern: 6, 6, 6, 6, ..., and so on. Since 17 is an odd number, the units digit of $16^{17}$ will be 6.\n\nNext, let's consider $17^{18}$. The units digit of powers of 7 also follow a repeating pattern: 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1, ... Since 18 is an even number, the units digit of $17^{18}$ will be 1.\n\nFinally, let's consider $18^{19}$. The units digit of powers of 8 also follow a repeating pattern: 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6, ... Since 19 is an odd number, the units digit of $18^{19}$ will be 8.\n\nNow, we multiply these units digits together: $6 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 48$. The units digit of 48 is 8.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}$ is 8.",
