At a competition with $N$ players, the number of players given elite status is equal to $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$. Suppose that $19$ players are given elite status. What is the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$?",

    "gpt_response": "In approaching this question, a PhD in literature may first recognize the mathematical components involved and the significance of the formula provided in relation to the given scenario. \n\nThe formula given describes the number of players granted elite status based on the total number of players present in the competition ($N$). By analyzing the formula, one can observe that it involves logarithmic functions and exponentiation. This may prompt the individual to consider the implications of these mathematical operations and their relationship to the concept of elite status in the context of the competition.\n\nGiven that $19$ players are granted elite status, the PhD in literature may begin by setting up the equation as follows:\n\n$19 = 2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$\n\nNow, the goal is to find the two smallest possible values of $N$ that satisfy this equation. The PhD in literature may proceed by trial and error, systematically testing different values of $N$ until a solution is found that equates to $19$ when plugged into the formula provided.\n\nUpon finding the two smallest possible values of $N$ that satisfy the equation, the PhD in literature would then sum these values to arrive at the final answer.
