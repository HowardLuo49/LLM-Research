    "solution": "3600",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how much the area of the square changes when its dimensions are altered, we must calculate the change in area resulting from the change in the square's dimensions.\n\nLet the initial length of the square be $L$ and the initial width be $W$, so the initial area is given by $A_1 = L \\times W$. After the length is decreased by $60$ and the width is increased by $60$, the new length becomes $L - 60$ and the new width becomes $W + 60$. Thus, the new area is given by $A_2 = (L - 60)(W + 60)$.\n\nThe change in area is then given by $\\Delta A = A_2 - A_1$.\nExpanding $A_2$, we have \n$$\nA_2 = (L - 60)(W + 60) = LW + 60W - 60L - 3600.\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\Delta A = (LW + 60W - 60L - 3600) - (LW) = 60W - 60L - 3600.\n$$\n\nGiven that $L = W = 3491$, we substitute the values in to find\n$$\n\\Delta A = 60\\times 3491 - 60 \\times 3491 - 3600 = -3600.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the area of the square decreases by $3600$ units when its length is decreased by $60$ and its width is increased by $60$.",
