    "solution": "3600",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the change in area of the square, we must first determine the initial and final areas of the square.\n\nInitial area:\nThe initial area of a square with side length $3491$ can be calculated using the formula for the area of a square, which is length squared. Therefore, the initial area is $3491^2 = 12,188,881$.\n\nFinal area:\nWhen the length is decreased by $60$ to $3491-60 = 3431$ and the width is increased by $60$ to $3491+60 = 3551$, the final area of the square can be calculated as the product of the new length and width. Therefore, the final area is $3431 \\times 3551 = 12,179,681$.\n\nChange in area:\nThe change in area of the square can be determined by subtracting the initial area from the final area. Therefore, the change in area is $12,179,681 - 12,188,881 = -9200$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square decreases by $9200$ units.",
