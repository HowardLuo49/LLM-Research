    "solution": "3600",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the change in area of the square, we can first calculate the original area and then the area after the changes have been made.\n\nThe original square has dimensions 3491 by 3491, so its area is $3491^2$.\n\nAfter the changes, the square's dimensions are 3431 by 3551. The new area is 3431 * 3551.\n\nThe change in area is the new area minus the original area. So, the change in area is:\n\n$3431 \\times 3551 - 3491^2$\n\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n\n$12,198,281 - 12,183,681$\n\nSolving this, we get:\n\n$14,600$\n\nTherefore, the area of the square changes by $14,600$ square units.",
