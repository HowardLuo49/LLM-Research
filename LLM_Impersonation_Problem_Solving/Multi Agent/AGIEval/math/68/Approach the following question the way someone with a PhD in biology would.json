An adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long. If the area of the garden is 184 square feet, what is the length, in feet, of the common side?",
    "solution": "23",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to apply basic principles of geometry and algebra. Let's denote the length of the common side as x. Since the adjacent side is 8 feet long, the area of the garden can be represented as the product of x and 8, which gives us:\n\nArea = x * 8 = 184\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 8:\n\nx = 184 / 8\nx = 23\n\nTherefore, the length of the common side, in feet, is 23.",
