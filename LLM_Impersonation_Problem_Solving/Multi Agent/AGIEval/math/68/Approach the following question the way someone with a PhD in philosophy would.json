An adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long. If the area of the garden is 184 square feet, what is the length, in feet, of the common side?",
    "solution": "23",
    "gpt_response": "In considering this question, we must first establish a conceptual framework within which to analyze the relationship between the given dimensions of the garden and house, as well as the overall area of the garden. \n\nLet us denote the length of the common side, which the garden shares with the house, as x. Given that the adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long, we can denote this as 8. Furthermore, we are informed that the area of the garden is 184 square feet. \n\nNow, using basic principles of geometry, we can express the area of the garden in terms of its dimensions. The area of a rectangle is calculated as the product of its length and width. In this case, the length of the garden would be x, and the width would be 8. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\nx * 8 = 184\n\nSolving for x, we find:\n\nx = 23\n\nThus, the length of the common side, in feet, would be 23.",
