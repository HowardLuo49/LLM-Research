An adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long. If the area of the garden is 184 square feet, what is the length, in feet, of the common side?",
    "solution": "23",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use our knowledge of geometry and algebra. Let's first define the dimensions of the garden. Since one side of the garden shares a side with the house, we can assume that the house runs along the longer side of the garden, and the length of the garden is along the shorter side. Let the length of the garden be denoted by L and the width be denoted by W. \n\nGiven that the area of the garden is 184 square feet, we have the equation:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n184 = L x 8\n\nSolving for L, we get:\nL = 184 / 8 = 23\n\nTherefore, the length of the garden is 23 feet. Since one side of the garden shares a side with one side of the house, the common side is the width of the garden. We are solving for W.\n\nGiven that one side of the garden is 8 feet long, we have:\n\nW = 8\n\nTherefore, the length of the common side, in feet, is 8 feet.",
