We are given that square $ABCD$ has a side length of 10, which imparts certain geometric properties upon the figure. It is also stated that point $E$ lies on segment $BC$, thereby creating a right triangle, $\\triangle ABE$.\n\nMoving forward, we are told that the area of $\\triangle ABE$ is 40. Given that the base of the triangle is $AB$, which is a side of the square, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height, to calculate the height $h$ of $\\triangle ABE$. Solving for $h$ yields $h=8$. \n\nSince the height of $\\triangle ABE$ is the same as the length of $BE$, it follows that $BE=8$.
