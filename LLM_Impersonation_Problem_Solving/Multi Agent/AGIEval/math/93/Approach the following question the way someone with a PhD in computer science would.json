    "gpt_response": "To determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we must first factorize the number 84 into its prime factors. \n\n84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7\n\nNow, we must consider all the possible combinations of these prime factors that can be multiplied together to give us a product of 84 while maintaining distinctness. \n\nSince we want the least possible sum, we should start with the smallest prime factors and work our way up. \n\nLet's consider the prime factor 2. We can have the following possibilities:\n1. 2, 42\n2. 2, 2, 21\n3. 2, 3, 14\n4. 2, 2, 3, 7\n\nNow, let's calculate the sums for each of these possibilities:\n1. Sum = 2 + 42 = 44\n2. Sum = 2 + 2 + 21 = 25\n3. Sum = 2 + 3 + 14 = 19\n4. Sum = 2 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 14\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of distinct positive integers that multiply to 84 is 14.",
