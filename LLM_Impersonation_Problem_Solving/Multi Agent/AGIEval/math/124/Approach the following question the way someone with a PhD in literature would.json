Susan buys $4$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $25\\%$ discount. Pam buys $5$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $30\\%$ discount. How many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?",
    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many more dollars Pam pays than Susan, we first need to calculate the discount Susan and Pam each receive on their tickets.\n\nFor Susan, the $25\\%$ discount means she pays $75\\%$ of the full price. This can be calculated as $0.75 \\times 20 = 15$ dollars per ticket. Since Susan buys 4 tickets, the total amount she pays is $4 \\times 15 = 60$ dollars.\n\nFor Pam, the $30\\%$ discount means she pays $70\\%$ of the full price. This can be calculated as $0.70 \\times 20 = 14$ dollars per ticket. Since Pam buys 5 tickets, the total amount she pays is $5 \\times 14 = 70$ dollars.\n\nSubtracting the total amount Susan pays from the total amount Pam pays, we find that Pam pays $70 - 60 = 10$ dollars more than Susan. Therefore, Pam pays 10 dollars more than Susan.",
