The amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",
    "solution": "11",
    "gpt_response": "To find the quantity at which the company breaks even or makes a profit, we need to find the value of $x$ which corresponds to when $y=0$ in the given function $y=x^2-8x-33$. \n\nSetting $y=0$, we get $0=x^2-8x-33$. This is a quadratic equation that we can solve using the quadratic formula: $x=\\frac{-(-8) \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(1)(-33)}}{2(1)}$. Simplifying this expression yields $x=\\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64+132}}{2}$.\n\nSolving this equation gives us two possible values for $x$, which are $x=-1$ and $x=9. \n\nSince we can't produce a negative quantity, the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit is when $x=9$.",
