The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",
    "solution": "60",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total number of handshakes that took place at the mixer, we can consider the handshakes between witches and sorcerers separately.\n\nThere are 6 witches and 10 sorcerers at the mixer. Each witch will shake hands with each sorcerer, resulting in 6 x 10 = 60 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, a total of 60 handshakes took place at the arcane mixer.",
