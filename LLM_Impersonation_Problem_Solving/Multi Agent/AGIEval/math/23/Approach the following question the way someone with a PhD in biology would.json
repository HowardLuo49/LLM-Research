    "solution": "15",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of sides in the given polygon, we must first establish an equation relating the interior and exterior angles of a regular polygon. \n\nIn a regular polygon, all interior angles are equal and all exterior angles are equal. The sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can express the relationship between the interior angle (x) and the exterior angle (y) as:\nx + y = 180 degrees\n\nGiven that the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle, we can write:\nx = 6.5y\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n6.5y + y = 180\n7.5y = 180\ny = 24 degrees\n\nNow that we have the measure of the exterior angle, we can use the formula for the exterior angle of a regular polygon:\nExterior angle = 360 / n\n\nWhere n represents the number of sides in the polygon. Since the measure of the exterior angle is 24 degrees, we can solve for n:\n24 = 360 / n\nn = 360 / 24\nn = 15\n\nTherefore, the polygon has 15 sides.",
