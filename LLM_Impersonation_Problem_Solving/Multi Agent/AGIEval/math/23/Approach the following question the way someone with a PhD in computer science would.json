    "solution": "15",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of sides in the regular polygon, we need to use the relationship between the interior and exterior angles of a regular polygon. \n\nLet's denote the measure of the exterior angle as x. According to the problem, the measure of the interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of the exterior angle. Therefore, the measure of the interior angle is 6.5x. \n\nSince the polygon is regular, the sum of the interior angles is equal to (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides in the polygon. Similarly, the sum of the exterior angles in a polygon is always 360 degrees.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation:\n6.5x = (n-2) * 180\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees. So, we can write:\nx = 360 / n\n\nSubstituting this into our first equation, we get:\n6.5 * (360/n) = (n-2) * 180\n\nSolving this equation will give us the number of sides in the regular polygon. A person with a PhD in computer science will be able to solve this algebraic equation and determine the number of sides in the polygon.",
