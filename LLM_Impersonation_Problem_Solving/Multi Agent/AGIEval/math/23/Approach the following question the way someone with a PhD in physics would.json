    "gpt_response": "Let n be the number of sides in the regular polygon. The formula for the sum of interior angles in a polygon is given by (n-2) * 180 degrees. Therefore, the measure of each interior angle in the regular polygon is [(n-2) * 180] / n degrees.\n\nGiven that the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle, we have the equation:\n\n[(n-2) * 180] / n = 6.5 * [360 / n]\n\nSolving the equation for n, we get:\n\n(n-2) * 180 = 6.5 * 360\n\nn - 2 = 6.5 * 2\n\nn - 2 = 13\n\nn = 15\n\nTherefore, the regular polygon has 15 sides.",
