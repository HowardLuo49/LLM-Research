    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first analyze the nature of the system of equations provided. \n\nGiven the equations $3ax + 3y = 5b$ and $2x + y = 5$, let us rewrite the second equation as $y = 5 - 2x$. Substituting this expression for $y$ into the first equation, we obtain $3ax + 3(5-2x) = 5b$, which simplifies to $3ax + 15 - 6x = 5b$. Rearranging terms, we have $3ax - 6x = 5b - 15$, or equivalently $3x(a-2) = 5(b-3)$. \n\nIn order for this system to have infinite solutions $(x,y)$, there must be a valid relation between $a$, $b$, and $x$. This means that $a$ and $b$ should be chosen in such a way that the equation $3x(a-2) = 5(b-3)$ holds for all $x$, or in other words, for infinitely many $x$. One way to achieve this is by setting $a = 2$ and $b = 3$, as this will result in $3x(2-2) = 5(3-3)$ which simplifies to $0 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a,b) = (2,3)$ is the solution for which there exist infinite solutions $(x,y)$ to the given system of equations.",
