    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to understand the underlying mathematical properties at play. The numbers $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ can be represented as $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10$ and $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12$, respectively. \n\nGiven that the sum of these two numbers is $123422$, we can set up the equation $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 + 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 = 123422$. Simplifying, we get $20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422$.\n\nFrom here, we can isolate the sum $A + M + C$ by noting that it is a common factor in all the coefficients. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as $200(A + M + C) + 22 = 123422$, or equivalently $200(A + M + C) = 123400$. \n\nFinally, solving for $A + M + C$, we get $(A + M + C) = \\frac{123400}{200} = 617$. Therefore, the sum $A + M + C$ is $617$.",
