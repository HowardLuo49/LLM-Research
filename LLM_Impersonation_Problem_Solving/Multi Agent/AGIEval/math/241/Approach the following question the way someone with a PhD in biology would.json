    "gpt_response": "To find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers for which $x^2+ax+b$ has a non-real root whose cube is $343$, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.\n\nLet the non-real root be denoted as $r = c + di$, where $c$ and $d$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Since the cube of $r$ is $343 = 7^3$, we have:\n$(c + di)^3 = 343$\nExpanding the left side using the binomial formula for cubes gives:\n$c^3 + 3c^2di - 3cd^2 - d^3i = 343$\nMatching the real and imaginary parts on both sides gives the following equations:\n$c^3 - 3cd^2 = 343$    (real part)\n$3c^2d - d^3 = 0$        (imaginary part)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for $d$ in terms of $c$:\n$d = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{c^3 - 343}{3c}}$\n\nNow, since $r = c + di$ is a root of $x^2 + ax + b$, by Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$r_1 + r_2 = -a$ and $r_1r_2 = b$\n\nSubstituting $r = c + di$ into the formulas above, we get:\n$c + d + c - d = -a$\n$c^2 - d^2 = b$\n\nUsing the expression for $d$ in terms of $c$ derived from the first equation, we can solve for $c$ and $d$.
