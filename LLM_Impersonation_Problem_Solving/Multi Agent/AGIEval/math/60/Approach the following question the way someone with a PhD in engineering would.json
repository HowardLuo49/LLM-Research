Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we identify the possible single digit numbers that add up to 4: 4. \n\nNext, we identify the possible two digit numbers that add up to 4: \n- 13\n- 22\n- 31\n- 40\n\nNow, we identify the possible three digit numbers that add up to 4:\n- 103\n- 112\n- 121\n- 130\n- 202\n- 211\n- 220\n- 301\n- 310\n- 400\n\nFinally, we count the total number of pages with page numbers that have digits adding up to exactly 4. \n- For single-digit numbers, there is 1 possibility.\n- For two-digit numbers, there are 4 possibilities.\n- For three-digit numbers, there are 10 possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages that have page numbers with digits adding up to exactly 4 is 1 + 4 + 10 = 15. \n\nIn a textbook with 1,000 pages, the proportion of pages meeting this criteria is 15/1,000 = 0.015 or 1.5%.",
