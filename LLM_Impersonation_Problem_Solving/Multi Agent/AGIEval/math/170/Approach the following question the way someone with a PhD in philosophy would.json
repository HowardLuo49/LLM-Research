An odd function is one that satisfies the property $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. This property implies a symmetry with respect to the origin, leading to specific patterns in the function's behavior.\n\nGiven that the graph of $y = f(x)$ passes through the point $(-3,5)$ and $f(x)$ is an odd function, we can infer that the graph will also pass through the point $(3,-5)$.
