    "gpt_response": "As an odd function, $f(x)$ must satisfy the property $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain. Since the point $(-3,5)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we can use this property to find a second point that must be on the graph.\n\nSince $(-3,5)$ is on the graph, we know that $f(-3) = 5$. Using the odd property, we have $f(3) = -f(-3) = -5$. Therefore, the point $(3,-5)$ must also be on the graph of $f(x)$ as an odd function.\n\nSo the graph of $y=f(x)$ must pass through the points $(-3,5)$ and $(3,-5)$ as an odd function.",
