We are tasked with finding the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20. In order to achieve the smallest possible value while satisfying these conditions, we must minimize the value of each digit in the number.\n\nGiven that the digits must add up to 20, we can deduce that the five-digit number must consist of the digits 1, 1, 1, 8, and 9, as these are the smallest non-zero digits that can be combined to reach the desired sum. \n\nArranging these digits in ascending order, we arrive at the number 11189 as the smallest five-digit number that meets the specified criteria.
