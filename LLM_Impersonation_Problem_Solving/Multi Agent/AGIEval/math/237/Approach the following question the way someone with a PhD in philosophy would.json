    "gpt_response": "To address the question at hand, it is essential to recognize that the cosine function is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side of a right triangle to its hypotenuse. In this specific scenario, the angle $V$ is bounded by the hypotenuse and the adjacent side, thereby leading to the derivation of the cosine function. Given that the cosine of angle $V$ is equivalent to $\\frac{2}{3}$, one may ascertain that the adjacent side corresponding to angle $V$ has a length of $2$ units, while the hypotenuse possesses a length of $3$ units. As the adjacent side and the opposite side are orthogonal in the context of right triangles, this conveys that the opposite side of angle $V$ has a length of $\\sqrt{3^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{9-4} = \\sqrt{5}$ units. \nOwing to the understanding that both sides of the triangle emanating from angle $V$ are established, it is thereby possible to derive the value of $TV$. Recognizing that $TV$ is essentially the opposite side to angle $TVU$, which forms an exact angle of $90^{\\circ}$ with the adjacent side associated with angle $V$, the Pythagorean theorem can be applied in this context. By undertaking such an approach, it becomes evident that $TV = \\sqrt{24^2 - (\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\sqrt{576-5} = \\sqrt{571}$ units. Consequently, it has been elucidated that the length of $TV$ corresponds to $\\sqrt{571}$ units.",
