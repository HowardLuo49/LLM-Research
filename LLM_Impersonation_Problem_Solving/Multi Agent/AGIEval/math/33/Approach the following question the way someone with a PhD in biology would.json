    "gpt_response": "To find the center of the ellipse given by the equation $9x^2 + 72x + 4y^2 - 8y - 176 = 0$, we need to first rewrite the equation in standard form. The standard form of the equation for an ellipse is $\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the ellipse, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $b$ is the semi-minor axis.\n\nSo, let's start by completing the square for both $x$ and $y$. We have:\n\n$9x^2 + 72x + 4y^2 - 8y - 176 = 0$\n$9(x^2 + 8x) + 4(y^2 - 2y) = 176$\n$9(x^2 + 8x + 16) - 9(16) + 4(y^2 - 2y + 1) - 4 = 176$\n$9(x + 4)^2 + 4(y - 1)^2 = 256$\n\nDividing through by 256, we get:\n\n$\\frac{(x + 4)^2}{\\frac{256}{9}} + \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{64} = 1$\n\nComparing this to the standard form of the equation, we see that:\n\n$(h, k) = (-4, 1)$\n\nTherefore, the center of the ellipse is at $(-4, 1)$.",
