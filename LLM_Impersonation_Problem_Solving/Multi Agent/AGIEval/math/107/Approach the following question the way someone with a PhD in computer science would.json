    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Cartesian distance between Stacey's starting point and her ending point after she took the mentioned steps.\n\nWe can represent these steps as vectors in a 2-dimensional coordinate system. Stacey started at the origin (0,0) and moved west by 11 meters (a vector of -11 in the x-direction), then north by 30 meters (a vector of 30 in the y-direction), then west 4 meters (a vector of -4 in the x-direction), and finally south by 22 meters (a vector of -22 in the y-direction).\n\nAdding up these vectors, we get a net displacement vector of (-15, 8), which represents Stacey's final position in the coordinate system.\n\nTo calculate the distance between Stacey's starting point at the origin and her final position, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\ndistance = sqrt((-15)^2 + 8^2)\ndistance = sqrt(225 + 64)\ndistance = sqrt(289)\ndistance = 17 meters\n\nTherefore, Stacey is 17 meters away from her starting point.",
