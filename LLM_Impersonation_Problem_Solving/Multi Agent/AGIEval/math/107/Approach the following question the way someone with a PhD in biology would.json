    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, Stacey's movements can be represented as vectors in a 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Each movement can be described in terms of its magnitude (distance) and direction (north/south/east/west).\n\nStarting at the origin (0,0), Stacey first walks 11 meters west, which is represented as a vector (-11,0). \nShe then walks 30 meters north, represented as a vector (0,30).\nNext, she walks 4 meters west, represented as a vector (-4,0).\nFinally, she walks 22 meters south, which can be represented as a vector (0,-22).\n\nTo calculate Stacey's final position relative to her starting point, we need to sum up all the individual vectors. This can be done by adding the x-components of the vectors and the y-components of the vectors.\n\nAdding the x-components, we get -11 + (-4) = -15.\nAdding the y-components, we get 30 + (-22) = 8.\n\nStacey's final position relative to her starting point is at coordinates (-15,8). To find the magnitude of this final position vector, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\ndistance = \u221a((-15)^2 + 8^2) = \u221a(225 + 64) = \u221a289 = 17 meters.\n\nTherefore, Stacey is 17 meters away from her starting point.",
