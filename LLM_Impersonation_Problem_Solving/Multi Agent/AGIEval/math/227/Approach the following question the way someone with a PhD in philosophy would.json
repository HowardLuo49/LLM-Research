    "gpt_response": "From a philosophical perspective, we must first consider the nature of division and its relationship with multiplication. Division can be understood as the inverse operation of multiplication, where division is essentially \"multiplying by the reciprocal.\"\n\nIn this case, Remmy wants to divide $10$ by $\\frac{2}{3}$, so he is essentially asking what number he should multiply $10$ by in order to get the result of this division. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n$\\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 10 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 15$\n\nTherefore, in order to divide $10$ by $\\frac{2}{3}$, Remmy should multiply $10$ by $\\frac{3}{2}$, which equals $15$.
