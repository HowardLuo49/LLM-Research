These solutions can be visualized as partitions of a 7-unit line using two separators. For example, one possible solution is $x=3$, $y=2$, and $z=2$. \n\nNext, we must consider the range of the function $f(x,y,z)=xyz$ under the given constraints. Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all non-negative, the minimum value of $f$ occurs when $x=y=z=0$, resulting in $f(0,0,0)=0$. \n\nTo find the maximum value of $f$, we observe that the product $xyz$ is maximized when $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all as close to 7/3 as possible. In this case, the maximum value of $f$ would occur when $x=y=z=7/3$, resulting in $f(7/3,7/3,7/3)=(7/3)^3$.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $f(x,y,z)=xyz$, subject to the constraints $x+y+z=7$ and $x,y,z \\ge 0$, is $[0,(7/3)^3]$.",
