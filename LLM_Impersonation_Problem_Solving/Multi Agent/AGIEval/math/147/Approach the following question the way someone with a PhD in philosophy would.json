    "solution": "\\frac{10}{11}",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ as $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b, c$ are integers. Given that $4-\\sqrt{11}$ is a root of $p(x)$, by the Conjugate Root Theorem, this implies that $4+\\sqrt{11}$ is also a root of $p(x)$. \n\nTherefore, using Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots of $p(x)$ are given by:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Sum of roots} &= -(b/a) = 4+\\sqrt{11} + 4-\\sqrt{11} = 8, \\\\\n\\text{Product of roots} &= c/a = (4+\\sqrt{11})(4-\\sqrt{11}) = 16 - 11 = 5.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the sum and product of the roots are integrals, this implies that the coefficients of $p(x)$ must be integers as well. Thus, the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ can be written as $(x^2 - 8x + 5)$.\n\nNow, we can evaluate $\\frac{p(3)}{p(4)}$ by substituting $x=3$ and $x=4$ into the expression $p(x)$:\n\\begin{align*}\np(3) &= (3^2 - 8(3) + 5) = 9 - 24 + 5 = -10, \\\\\np(4) &= (4^2 - 8(4) + 5) = 16 - 32 + 5 = -11.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{p(3)}{p(4)} = \\frac{-10}{-11} = \\frac{10}{11}$. Hence, the expression $\\frac{p(3)}{p(4)}$ evaluates to $\\frac{10}{11}$.",
