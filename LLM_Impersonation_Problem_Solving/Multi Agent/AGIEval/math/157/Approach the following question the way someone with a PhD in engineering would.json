    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, we first need to identify the odd perfect squares in this range. A perfect square is defined as a number that is the square of an integer, meaning it can be expressed as the square of a whole number.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for odd perfect squares, which means the square root of the number is also an odd integer.\n\nStarting from 5, the first odd perfect square is 3^2 = 9. The next odd perfect square is 5^2 = 25, followed by 7^2 = 49, and so on.\n\nTo find the upper limit for our range, we calculate the square root of 211, which is approximately 14.52. Therefore, the highest perfect square within the range is 14^2 = 196, which is an even square.\n\nTherefore, the odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 are 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169. There are a total of 6 odd perfect squares within this range.",
