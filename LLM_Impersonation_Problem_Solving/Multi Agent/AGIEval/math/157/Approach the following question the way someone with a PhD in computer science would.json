    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, we first need to identify the odd perfect squares within this range. \n\nIt is well-known in mathematics that a perfect square is always the square of an integer. In the case of odd perfect squares, the square of an odd integer results in an odd perfect square. Therefore, we need to find all odd integers within the range [sqrt(5), sqrt(211)], where sqrt denotes the square root function.\n\nSince the square of an odd integer is also odd, we only need to consider odd integers for our calculations. By counting the odd integers within the range [sqrt(5), sqrt(211)], we can determine the number of odd perfect squares in the specified range.\n\nBy calculating the square roots of 5 and 211, we find that the odd integers within the range [sqrt(5), sqrt(211)] are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Therefore, there are 7 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question of how many odd perfect squares are between 5 and 211 is 7.",
