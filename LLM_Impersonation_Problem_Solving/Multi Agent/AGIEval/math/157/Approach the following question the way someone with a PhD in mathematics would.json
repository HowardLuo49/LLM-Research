    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, we first need to identify the odd perfect squares within this range. \n\nAn odd perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an odd integer. Therefore, we need to find the odd integers whose squares fall within the range of 5 to 211.\n\nThe smallest odd integer whose square is greater than 5 is 3 (3^2 = 9). The largest odd integer whose square is less than 211 is 14 (14^2 = 196). Therefore, the odd perfect squares within the range of 5 to 211 are 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169.\n\nThere are a total of 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.",
