    "gpt_response": "To find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the given equation and the point (4,5), we must first determine the vertex of the graph. \n\nThe equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6$ is in the standard form of a quadratic equation, $y=ax^2+bx+c$, where $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-6$. The x-coordinate of the vertex of this quadratic equation can be found using the formula $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nSubstitute $a=1$ and $b=2$ into the formula to get $x=-\\frac{2}{2(1)}=-1$. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is x=-1. Now, substitute x=-1 into the equation $y=x^2+2x-6$ to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n $y=(-1)^2+2(-1)-6=1-2-6=-7$. \n\nTherefore, the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ is (-1,-7). Now, to find the distance between the vertex (-1,-7) and the point (4, 5), we can use the distance formula: \n\n$d=\\sqrt{(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2}$.\n\nSubstitute the coordinates into the formula:\n\n$d=\\sqrt{(4-(-1))^2 + (5-(-7))^2}$\n\n$d=\\sqrt{(5)^2 + (12)^2}$\n\n$d=\\sqrt{25+144}$\n\n$d=\\sqrt{169}$\n\n$d=13$.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation $y=x^2 + 2x - 6 $ and the point (4,5) is 13 units.",
