Each of them arrives at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00. What is the probability that the number of minutes Alice is late for the party plus the number of minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can consider the range of possible arrival times for both Alice and Bob. Let A be the number of minutes Alice is late for the party, and B be the number of minutes Bob is late for the party.\n\nSince both Alice and Bob arrive at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00, we can consider that A and B are uniformly distributed between 0 and 60. Therefore, the joint probability density function of A and B is constant within this range.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that A + B < 45. Geometrically, this corresponds to the region below the line A + B = 45 in the square [0,60]x[0,60].\n\nThe area of the region below the line A + B = 45 within the square is given by (1/2)*(45)*(45) = 1012.5 square minutes.\n\nThe total area of the square is 60*60 = 3600 square minutes.\n\nTherefore, the probability that A + B < 45 is 1012.5 / 3600 = 9/32. \n\nSo, the probability that the sum of the minutes Alice is late for the party plus the minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45 is 9/32.",
