Each of them arrives at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00. What is the probability that the number of minutes Alice is late for the party plus the number of minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I would approach this question by first defining the random variables for the arrival times of Alice and Bob. Let A be the number of minutes Alice is late for the party, and B be the number of minutes Bob is late for the party.\n\nSince both Alice and Bob arrive at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00, we can assume that A and B are uniformly distributed between 0 and 60 minutes. Therefore, A and B follow a continuous uniform distribution on the interval [0, 60].\n\nWe are interested in finding the probability that A + B < 45. This can be visualized as the area of the region below the line A + B = 45 in the 60x60 square representing all possible pairs of A and B.\n\nTo calculate this probability, we need to find the ratio of the area of the region where A + B < 45 to the total area of the square. The area of the region where A + B < 45 is a right triangle with base and height both equal to 45, so its area is (1/2)*45*45 = 1012.5.\n\nThe total area of the square is 60*60 = 3600. Therefore, the probability that A + B < 45 is 1012.5/3600 = 9/32.\n\nHence, the probability that the number of minutes Alice is late for the party plus the number of minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45 is 9/32.",
