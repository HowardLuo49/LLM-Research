    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to consider the properties of integer roots in a polynomial with integer coefficients. Given that all the coefficients are integers and the constant coefficient is 42, we know that the possible integer roots must divide 42.\n\nSince the polynomial has distinct integer roots, they cannot share any common factors. Therefore, the largest possible number of integer roots will be the number of distinct divisors of 42.\n\nThe divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of integer roots in the polynomial is 8, corresponding to the distinct divisors of 42.",
