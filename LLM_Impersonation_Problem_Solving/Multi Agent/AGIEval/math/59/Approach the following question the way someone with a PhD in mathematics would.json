    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible number of integer roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients and a constant term of 42, we need to consider the factors of 42. The integer roots of the polynomial are the values for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.\n\nGiven that the constant term is 42, the possible integer roots must be divisors of 42. The divisors of 42 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\nTo maximize the number of integer roots of the polynomial, we can construct the polynomial by using these divisors as roots. We can do this by expressing the polynomial as a product of linear factors using these roots.\n\nFor example, one possible polynomial that has the maximum number of integer roots could be:\n\n(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-6)(x-7)(x-14)(x-21)(x-42)\n\nBy creating a polynomial with these linear factors, we ensure that all the roots are integers and distinct.
