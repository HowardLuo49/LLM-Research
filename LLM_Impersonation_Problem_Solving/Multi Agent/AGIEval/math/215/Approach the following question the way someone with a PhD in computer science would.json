    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. A math textbook with a double-digit number of pages is split into sections. Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",
    "solution": "71",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem as someone with a PhD in computer science, we can first define some variables and constraints. Let's denote the total number of pages in the textbook as $n$. We can also define an integer variable $k$ to represent the number of full sections in the textbook. Since each section is $12$ pages long, we have $k = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{12} \\rfloor$.\n\nGiven that the epilogue is $11$ pages long, we can express the total number of pages as $n = 12k + 11$.\n\nNow, we need to consider the trivia facts presented on the bottom of every $5$th page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then the total number of pages must be in the form $5m + 2$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\nSubstitute $n = 12k + 11$ into the form $5m + 2$:\n$12k + 11 = 5m + 2$\n$12k + 9 = 5m$\n$3(4k + 3) = 5m$\n\nSince $3$ divides the left side of the equation, $3$ must also divide the right side. This implies that $5m$ is a multiple of $3$, which is only possible if $m$ is a multiple of $3$. Therefore, we can let $m = 3p$, where $p$ is an integer.\n\nSubstitute $m = 3p$ into $12k + 9 = 5m$:\n$12k + 9 = 15p$\n$12k = 15p - 9$\n$4k = 5p - 3$\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that $5p - 3$ must be divisible by $4$. Upon inspection, we find that $p = 3$ satisfies this condition. Therefore, the number of pages in the textbook is $5 \\cdot 3 + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
