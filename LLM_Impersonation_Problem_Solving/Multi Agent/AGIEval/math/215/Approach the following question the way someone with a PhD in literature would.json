Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we must first consider the structure of the math textbook as described in the question. The textbook is split into sections, with each section being $12$ pages long except for the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. This information allows us to establish a pattern for the total number of pages in the textbook.\n\nLet's denote the total number of pages in the textbook as $P$. We know that each section is $12$ pages long, except for the epilogue which is $11$ pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages in sections (excluding the epilogue) can be represented as $12n$, where $n$ is the number of complete sections in the textbook.\n\nThe epilogue is $11$ pages long, so the total number of pages in the textbook is $12n + 11$. Additionally, we know that a trivia fact appears on the bottom of every $5$th page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then the total number of pages in the textbook must be congruent to $2$ modulo $5$.\n\nTherefore, we can set up an equation to represent this information:\n\n$12n + 11 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$\n\nSolving this congruence equation will give us the value of $P$, which represents the total number of pages in the math textbook. This type of problem requires a systematic approach and attention to detail to solve accurately.",
