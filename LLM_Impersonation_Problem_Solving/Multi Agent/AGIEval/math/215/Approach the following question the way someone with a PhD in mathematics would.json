Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",
    "solution": "71",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the total number of pages in the textbook. We know that the epilogue is $11$ pages long, leaving $n-11$ pages for the main sections of the book.\n\nSince each section is $12$ pages long, there are $\\frac{n-11}{12}$ sections in the main part of the book. Each section has $12$ pages, so the total number of pages in the main part of the book is $\\frac{n-11}{12} \\times 12 = n-11$.\n\nIf a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then it must be on the bottom of the last page of one of the sections in the main part of the book. Since a trivia fact appears on every 5th page starting from the 5th page, the second-to-last page must be a multiple of 5. However, since there is an epilogue of 11 pages, the second-to-last page cannot be the 5th page of any section, so it must be the 10th page of a section.\n\nThis means that the total number of pages in the main part of the book is $10$ pages more than a multiple of $12$. This implies that $n-11 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{12}$. Hence, $n \\equiv 9 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nFurthermore, since the book has a double-digit number of pages, we know that $n \\geq 10$. Combining this with $n \\equiv 9 \\pmod{12}$, we find that the possible solutions are $n = 9, 21, 33, 45, ...$.\n\nHowever, the book must have more than $11$ pages in total since the epilogue is $11$ pages long. Therefore, the only possible solution is $n=21$.\n\nThus, the textbook has $21$ pages.",
