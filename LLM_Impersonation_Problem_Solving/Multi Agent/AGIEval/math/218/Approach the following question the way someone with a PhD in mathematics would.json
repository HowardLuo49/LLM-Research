A pyramid with a square base is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and is 2 units from the base.  The surface area of the smaller pyramid that is cut from the top is half the surface area of the original pyramid.  What is the altitude of the original pyramid?",
    "solution": "4+2\\sqrt{2}",
    "gpt_response": "Let the side length of the square base of the original pyramid be denoted as 's', and let the altitude of the original pyramid be denoted as 'h'. \n\nSince the plane cutting the pyramid is parallel to its base and is 2 units from the base, the height of the smaller pyramid cut off from the top can be denoted as '2', and the altitude of this smaller pyramid can be denoted as 'x'. \n\nWe know that the surface area of a pyramid is given by the formula:\nSurface Area = base area + (1/2)*perimeter*slant height\n\nFor the original pyramid:\nSurface Area_original = s^2 + (1/2)*4s*h\n\nFor the smaller pyramid:\nSurface Area_smaller = s^2 + (1/2)*4s*x\n\nGiven that Surface Area_smaller = (1/2)*Surface Area_original, we can set up the following equation:\ns^2 + (1/2)*4s*x = 0.5*(s^2 + 2sh)\n\nSolving this equation for 'x' gives:\n4s*x = 0.5*2sh\nx = 0.25h\n\nWe also know that the height of the smaller pyramid is 2 units, so x = 2.
