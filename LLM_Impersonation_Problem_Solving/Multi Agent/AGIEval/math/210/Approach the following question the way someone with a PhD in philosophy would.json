    "solution": "324",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first recognize the definition of a perfect square as a number that can be written as the square of an integer. Let n represent the smaller of the two consecutive perfect squares. Therefore, the larger perfect square can be represented as (n+1)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the positive difference between these two consecutive perfect squares is 35. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n(n+1)^2 - n^2 = 35\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\nn^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2 = 35\n\nSimplifying further:\n2n + 1 = 35\n2n = 34\nn = 17\n\nTherefore, the smaller perfect square is 17^2 which equals 289 and the larger perfect square is (17+1)^2 = 18^2 which equals 324. Hence, the greater of the two squares is 324.",
