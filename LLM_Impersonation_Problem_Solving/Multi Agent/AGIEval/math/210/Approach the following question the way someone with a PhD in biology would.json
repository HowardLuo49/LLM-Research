    "solution": "324",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a PhD in biology, we first need to understand the properties of perfect squares. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer multiplied by itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc., are all perfect squares.\n\nGiven that the positive difference between two consecutive perfect squares is 35, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let's represent the larger perfect square as x^2 and the smaller perfect square as (x-1)^2. Therefore, our equation would be:\n\nx^2 - (x-1)^2 = 35\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nx^2 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 35\nx^2 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 35\n2x - 1 = 35\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2x = 36\nx = 18\n\nTherefore, the larger perfect square, x^2, is 18^2, which is equal to 324. Hence, the greater of the two squares is 324.",
