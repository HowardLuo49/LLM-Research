    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the difference between two consecutive perfect squares. \n\nLet the two consecutive perfect squares be n^2 and (n+1)^2, where n is a positive integer. The positive difference between these two squares is given by:\n\n(n+1)^2 - n^2 = 35\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\nn^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2 = 35\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2n + 1 = 35\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\n2n = 34\n\nDividing by 2, we get:\n\nn = 17\n\nTherefore, the two consecutive perfect squares are 17^2 = 289 and 18^2 = 324.
