Thirteen of the boxes contain pencils, nine of the boxes contain pens, and three of the boxes contain neither pens nor pencils. How many boxes contain both pens and pencils?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of set theory. Let's denote the number of boxes containing both pens and pencils as x.\n\nAccording to the information given, there are 13 boxes containing pencils, 9 boxes containing pens, and 3 boxes containing neither. We can represent this information using a Venn diagram.\n\nLet's denote the total number of boxes as T. Therefore, T = number of boxes with pencils + number of boxes with pens - number of boxes with both + number of boxes with neither.\n\nT = 13 + 9 - x + 3 \n\nWe also know that the total number of boxes is 20. Therefore, T = 20.\n\nSolving the equation:\n20 = 13 + 9 - x + 3\n20 = 22 - x\n-x = -2\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, there are 2 boxes that contain both pens and pencils.",
