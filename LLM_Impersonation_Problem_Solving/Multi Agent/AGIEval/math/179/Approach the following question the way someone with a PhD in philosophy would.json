    "gpt_response": "To ascertain the value of the expression $\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{1}{3}$, we must engage in a process of mathematical calculation, specifically addition using common denominators. This involves identifying a common denominator for the fractions, which in this case is 15. By expanding the fractions with this common denominator, the expression can be rewritten as $\\frac{6}{15} + \\frac{5}{15}$. Subsequently, these fractions can be added together to yield a result of $\\frac{11}{15}$. Hence, the value of the expression $\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\frac{11}{15}$. This represents the sum of the two given fractions in the indicated format, elucidating the mathematical value encapsulated within this rational expression.",
