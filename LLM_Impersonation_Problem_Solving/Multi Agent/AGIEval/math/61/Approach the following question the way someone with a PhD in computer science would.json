    "gpt_response": "We can approach this problem by using the concept of symmetric polynomials along with some algebraic manipulation.\n\nConsider the polynomial $P(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)$. We know that the coefficient of $x^3$ in $P(x)$ is $-(a + b + c + d) = -17$, and that the constant term is $abcd$. Furthermore, the coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$ is $ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd$. \n\nAccording to Vieta's formulas, $ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = 46$. From this, we can deduce that the coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$ is $41$. \n\nNow, let's expand $P(x)$ to get  \\begin{align*}\nP(x) &= (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d) \\\\\n&= x^4 - (a + b + c + d)x^3 + (ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd)x^2 - (abc + abd + acd + bcd)x + abcd.\n\\end{align*} \n\nComparing the coefficient of $x$ in $P(x)$ to the coefficient of $x^3$ in $P(x)$, we find that $abc + abd + acd + bcd = 0$.\n\nFrom Vieta's formulas, we know that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ is equal to $(a + b + c + d)^2 - 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd)$. Substituting in the values we know, this evaluates to $17^2 - 2 \\cdot 46 = \\boxed{129}$. \n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ is $129$.",
