The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",
    "solution": "1250",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar in 1992, we can set up a proportion using the cost of gelato in both currencies. \n\nLet x be the equivalent exchange rate in dollars for 1 lire. \n\nWe have the following equation based on the given information:\n$\\frac{1200 \\text{ lire}}{1} = \\frac{\\$1.50}{x}$\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n$1200x = 1.50$\n\nSolving for x, we find:\n$x = \\frac{1.50}{1200}$ dollars per lire\n\nTherefore, the equivalent exchange rate in 1992 was approximately $\\$0.00125$ per lire. \n\nTo find out how many dollars are equivalent to 1 million lire, we can set up another proportion:\n$\\frac{1000000 \\text{ lire}}{1} = \\frac{?}{\\$0.00125}$\n\nSolving for the missing value on the right side of the equation, we get:\n$? = 1000000 \\times 0.00125$\n\nSo, 1,000,000 lire would be equivalent to $\\$1250$ at the exchange rate in 1992.",
