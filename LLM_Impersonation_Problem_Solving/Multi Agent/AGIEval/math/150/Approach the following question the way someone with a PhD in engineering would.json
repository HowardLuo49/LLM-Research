    "gpt_response": "To determine the subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers, we must first find all divisors of 72. The prime factorization of 72 is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2$. \n\nThe divisors of 72 can be found by considering all combinations of the prime factors raised to powers 0 to their respective exponents. Therefore, the divisors of 72 are:\n$1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72$\n\nNow, we need to identify which of these divisors are composite numbers. A composite number is a positive integer greater than one that is not a prime number. From the list above, we can see that the composite divisors of 72 are:\n$4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36$\n\nTo find the number of subsets containing only composite numbers, we need to consider all possible combinations of these composite divisors. Since we have 8 composite divisors, there are $2^8 = 256$ total subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers. \n\nThis includes the empty set, as it also meets the criteria of containing only composite numbers (as there are no numbers in the empty set).
