    "gpt_response": "To evaluate $2911_{11}-1392_{11}$, we need to perform subtraction in base 11.\n\nFirst, let's line up the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & 2 & 9 & 1 & 1_{11} \\\\\n- & & 1 & 3 & 9 & 2_{11} \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\n& A & 5 & B & 1 & 0_{11} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNow, we perform the subtraction. Starting from the rightmost column, we subtract 2 from 1. Since 1 is smaller than 2, we borrow 1 from the next column to the left, converting that 9 into an 8. This gives us 1 (from the 11s place) + 11 - 2 = A (representing 10 in base 11) in the 1s place. \n\nMoving to the next column, we have 8 - 9. We again borrow 1 from the next column to the left, converting that 9 into a B. This gives us 11 + 8 - 9 = 10 (or A) in the 11s place.\n\nIn the 11s column, we have 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nTherefore, $2911_{11} - 1392_{11} = A5B10_{11}$.",
