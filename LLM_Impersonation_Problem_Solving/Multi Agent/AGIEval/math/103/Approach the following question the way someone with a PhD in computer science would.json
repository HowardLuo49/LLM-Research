    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. At a certain amusement park, there is a bulk discount for tickets. If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the revenue the amusement park receives from selling tickets in bulk. Let's denote $p$ as the price of each ticket, and $n$ as the number of tickets bought.\n\nThe revenue function can be defined as:\n\\[ R = p \\cdot n \\]\n\nGiven the pricing scheme:\n- If $n \\leq 60$, $p = 70$.\n- If $n > 60$, $p = 70 - (n - 60)$.\n\nTo find the largest $t$ that will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$, we need to calculate the profit when selling $t$ tickets. The profit can be defined as:\n\\[ P = R - 4200 \\]\n\nSubstitute the revenue function into the profit function and consider both cases when $t \\leq 60$ and $t > 60$:\n- For $t \\leq 60$:\n\\[ P = 70t - 4200 \\]\n\n- For $t > 60$:\n\\[ P = (70 - (t - 60))t - 4200 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum value of $t$ that will bring a profit greater than $\\$4200$. To do this, we can set up the inequality:\n\\[ P > 4200 \\]\n\nThen, solve for $t$ to find the largest $t$ satisfying the condition.
