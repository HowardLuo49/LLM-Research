    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that the range of the sine function is between -1 and 1. This means that if $\\sin x = -0.31$, there must be a solution for $x$ within the given range of $0^\\circ \\le x < 990^\\circ$.\n\nWe can start by finding the reference angle associated with $\\sin^{-1}(-0.31)$. Using a calculator, we find that $\\sin^{-1}(-0.31) \\approx -18.7^\\circ$. Since sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we know that the angles where $\\sin x = -0.31$ are in the third and fourth quadrants.\n\nTo find the first angle in the third quadrant, we can add $180^\\circ$ to the reference angle: $180^\\circ - 18.7^\\circ \\approx 161.3^\\circ$. We continue adding multiples of $360^\\circ$ to find all possible values in the third and fourth quadrants less than $990^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the two possible values of $x$ that satisfy $\\sin x = -0.31$ in the given range are $161.3^\\circ$ and $198.7^\\circ$.
