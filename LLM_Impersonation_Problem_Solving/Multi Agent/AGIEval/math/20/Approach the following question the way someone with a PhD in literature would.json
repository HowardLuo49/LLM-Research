In a Cartesian plane, the midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the line segment into two equal parts.\n\nGiven that the line segment has one endpoint at $(3,9)$ and the midpoint at $(1,2)$, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of the other endpoint. \n\nThe midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are:\n\\[(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})\\]\n\nIn this case, we know the endpoint at $(3,9)$ and the midpoint at $(1,2)$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\\[(\\frac{3+x_2}{2}, \\frac{9+y_2}{2}) = (1,2)\\]\n\nSolving for $x_2$ and $y_2$, we get:\n\\[\\frac{3+x_2}{2} = 1 \\Rightarrow 3+x_2 = 2 \\Rightarrow x_2 = -1\\]\n\\[\\frac{9+y_2}{2} = 2 \\Rightarrow 9+y_2 = 4 \\Rightarrow y_2 = -5\\]\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the other endpoint are $(-1,-5)$.
