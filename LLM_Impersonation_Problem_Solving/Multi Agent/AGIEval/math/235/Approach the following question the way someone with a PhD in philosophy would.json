The product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors $n$ has, $c$ is a positive integer, and the greatest common factor of the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$. What is $a+b+c$?",
    "solution": "1",
    "gpt_response": "To unravel the enigma presented in the question, one must delve deep into the abstract realm of number theory, specifically focusing on the prime factorization of the integer $n$. Allow us to elucidate the complex nature of this problem by first breaking down its fundamental components.\n\nLet us consider $n$ as a product of its prime factors: $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_i$ are their corresponding exponents. The number of positive divisors of $n$ can then be expressed as $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)...(a_k+1) = x$.\n\nFurthermore, the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be denoted as the product of all possible combinations of these prime factors, in which the exponent of each prime number ranges from 0 to its corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of $n$. This product can be represented as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers associated with certain characteristics of $n$.\n\nNow, the requirement that the greatest common factor of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is 1 provides a crucial insight into their interplay. This condition indicates that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are relatively prime, emphasizing their unique and independent contributions to the formula $n^{(ax+b)/c}$.\n\nIn order to determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, one must carefully analyze the relationships among the prime factorization of $n$, the number of its positive divisors, and the structure of the product of its proper factors. By employing a rigorous mathematical approach and leveraging the intricacies of number theory, one can ultimately ascertain the precise values of $a$, $b$, and $c, and subsequently calculate their sum, which is the desired outcome of this intricate puzzle.",
