If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win when rolling the die once, we need to consider the probabilities of winning 1 dollar when rolling a prime number, losing 1 dollar when rolling a composite number, and the probability of nothing happening when rolling 1.\n\nThere are 6 numbers on a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Of these numbers, 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers, while 4 and 6 are composite numbers. Rolling a 1 does not result in winning or losing any money.\n\nThe probability of rolling a prime number is 3/6 = 1/2, while the probability of rolling a composite number is 2/6 = 1/3. The probability of rolling 1 is 1/6.\n\nThe expected value (E) of the amount of money Beth will win can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nE = (1 dollar)(probability of winning) - (1 dollar)(probability of losing) + (0 dollars)(probability of nothing happening)\nE = (1)(1/2) - (1)(1/3) + (0)(1/6)\nE = 1/2 - 1/3\nE = 3/6 - 2/6\nE = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win when rolling the die once is 1/6, expressed as a common fraction.",
