If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "In addressing this question, we must first analyze the possible outcomes of Beth rolling the fair six-sided die. \n\nThere are six possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nOf these outcomes, only four are relevant to Beth's winning or losing money: 2, 3, 5 are prime numbers which result in her winning 1 dollar each, while 4 and 6 are composite numbers which result in her losing 1 dollar each.\n\nGiven that Beth rolls a fair six-sided die, each outcome has a probability of 1/6. Therefore, the probability of rolling a prime number (2, 3, or 5) is 3/6 = 1/2, while the probability of rolling a composite number (4 or 6) is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nTo calculate the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win, we multiply the amount won or lost by the respective probabilities of each outcome and sum them up.\n\nExpected Value = (1/2 * 1) + (1/3 * -1) = 1/2 - 1/3 = 3/6 - 2/6 = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 1/6.",
