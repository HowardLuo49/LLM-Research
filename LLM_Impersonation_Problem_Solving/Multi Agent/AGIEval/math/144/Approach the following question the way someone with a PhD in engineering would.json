Two numbers are independently selected from the set of positive integers less than or equal to 5. What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers is greater than their product? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{9}{25}",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to determine all the possible outcomes when selecting two numbers from the set of positive integers less than or equal to 5. These outcomes can be represented as pairs (x, y), where x and y are both positive integers less than or equal to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes can be calculated using the formula for combinations, given by nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!). In this case, we have 5 choices for the first number and 5 choices for the second number, giving us a total of 5 x 5 = 25 possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of outcomes where the sum of the two numbers is greater than their product. We can represent this condition as x + y > xy. By rearranging the terms, we get y < (x-1) / (x-1).\n\nBy examining the possible pairs (x, y), we find that the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), and (5, 5) do not satisfy the condition. For all other pairs, the sum of the two numbers is greater than their product.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 25 (total outcomes) - 4 (unfavorable pairs) = 21.\n\nThe probability that the sum of the two numbers is greater than their product is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, which is 21 / 25.\n\nExpressed as a common fraction, the probability is 21 / 25.",
