    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of seconds it takes for Michael to walk to school, we need to convert the time from hours to seconds. \n\n1 hour is equivalent to 3600 seconds (1 hour = 60 minutes, 1 minute = 60 seconds, therefore 1 hour = 60 minutes x 60 seconds = 3600 seconds).\n\nGiven that it takes Michael 0.30 hours to walk to school, we can calculate the total number of seconds by multiplying 0.30 by 3600:\n\n0.30 hours x 3600 seconds/hour = 1080 seconds\n\nTherefore, it takes Michael 1080 seconds to walk to school.",
