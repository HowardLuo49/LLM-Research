    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum height Ben will reach while climbing the tree, we need to find the minimum value of the quadratic function $2t^2-5t+29$. \n\nFirst, we note that this function is in the form of a quadratic function $at^2+bt+c$ where $a=2$, $b=-5$, and $c=29$. \n\nThe formula for finding the minimum value of a quadratic function of this form is $-\\frac{b}{2a}$. \nSubstitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the formula, we get $-\\frac{-5}{2(2)} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$.\n\nBy substituting this value back into the original function, we can find the minimum height Ben will reach at $t = 1.25$. \n\nPlugging $t=1.25$ into the function $2t^2-5t+29$, we get $2(1.25)^2 - 5(1.25) + 29 = 3.125 - 6.25 + 29 = 25.875$. \n\nRounded to the nearest foot, Ben's minimum height will be 26 feet. \n\nTherefore, Ben will reach a minimum height of 26 feet while climbing the tree.",
