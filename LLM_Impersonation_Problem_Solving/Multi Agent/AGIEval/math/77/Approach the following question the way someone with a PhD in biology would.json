An ice cream cone consists of a sphere of vanilla ice cream and a right circular cone that  has the same diameter as the sphere. If the ice cream  melts, it will exactly fill the cone.  Assume that the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream. What is the ratio of the cone's height to its radius? (Note: A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\pi r^2 h/3$, and a sphere with radius $r$ has volume $4\\pi r^3/3$.)",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in biology, we can utilize our knowledge of volume calculations for geometric shapes, as well as the concept of ice cream melting and filling a cone.\n\nLet's first define the volume of the frozen ice cream using the volume of a sphere formula: $V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$. We can then calculate the volume of the melted ice cream, which is $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream: $V_{\\text{melted ice cream}} = 0.75 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$.\n\nSince the melted ice cream will exactly fill the cone, we can equate the volume of the cone to the volume of the melted ice cream. The formula for the volume of a cone is $V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$.\n\nNow, we equate the two volumes: $V_{\\text{melted ice cream}} = V_{\\text{cone}}$. Substituting our expressions for the volumes into this equation, we get: $0.75 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$. Simplifying, we find that $h = 3r$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the cone's height to its radius is $h:r = 3:1$.",
