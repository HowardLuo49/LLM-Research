    "gpt_response": "To start, let's use change of base to rewrite the logarithms in terms of a common base. Let $\\log_8 x = a$ and $\\log_2 x = b$. Then, we can rewrite the given equation as $\\log_2 (\\log_8 x) = \\log_8 (\\log_2 x)$ as $log_2 a = log_8 b$. \n\nUsing the property of logarithms that $log_a b = \\frac{log_c b}{log_c a}$, we rewrite the equation as $\\frac{log_{2} b}{log_{2} a} = \\frac{log_{8} b}{log_{8} a}$. \n\nNext, we take the variables $a$ and $b$ back in terms of $x$, we get $\\frac{log_{2} (log_{2} x)}{log_{2} (log_{8} x)} = \\frac{log_{8} (log_{2} x)}{log_{8} (log_{8} x)}$.\n\nAgain using the change of base, we simplify the equation as $\\frac{log_{2} (log_{2} x)}{log_{2} (log_{8} x)} = \\frac{log_{8} (log_{2} x)}{3 log_{2} (log_{2} x)}$. So, $3 log_{8} (log_{2} x)=log_{2} (log_{8} x)$.\n\nNow, let's substitute the values for $a$ and $b$ back into the equation. We get $3 a = b$. Therefore, $3 log_{8} x = log_{2} x$.\n\nSolving this equation, we find $3 log_{2} x = log_{2} x$ which implies $log_{2} x = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $(log_2 x)^2 = 0^2 = \\boxed{0}$.",
