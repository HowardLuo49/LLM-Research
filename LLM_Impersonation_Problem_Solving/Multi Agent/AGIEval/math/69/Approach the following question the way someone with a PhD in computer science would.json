    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must employ knowledge of divisibility rules. For a number to be divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of its odd-positioned digits and the sum of its even-positioned digits must be a multiple of $11$.\n\nThe number $124$ has odd-positioned digits $1$ and $4$, and even-positioned digit $2$. Therefore, the difference is $1 - 4 + 2 = -1$. Since the difference is not a multiple of $11$, we need to consider other cases where the number is divisible by $11$.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to change the tens digit and hundreds digit. Let the tens digit be $a$ and the hundreds digit be $b$. The digits are now $1ab4$. The new difference we need to calculate is $b - a + 1 - 4 = b - a - 3$. For the number to be divisible by $11$, the new difference must be a multiple of $11$.\n\nTo find possible values of $a$ and $b$ that make the new difference a multiple of $11$, we can set up the equation $b - a - 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Solving this congruence equation will give us the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the condition.",
