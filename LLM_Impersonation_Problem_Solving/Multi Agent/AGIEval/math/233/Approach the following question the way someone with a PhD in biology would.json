    "solution": "9",
    "gpt_response": "In an equiangular hexagon, all interior angles are equal to 120 degrees. By knowing the lengths of four consecutive sides as 1, 7, 2, and 4 units, we can use the property that the sum of the lengths of opposite sides in an equiangular hexagon is equal. Thus, the sum of the two remaining sides can be found by adding the lengths of the remaining consecutive sides: 7 + 2 = 9 units. Thus, the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides is 9 units.",
