    "gpt_response": "An equiangular hexagon is a regular hexagon, meaning that it has all its angles equal and all its sides equal in length. In this particular case, we are given the lengths of four consecutive sides of the equiangular hexagon: 1, 7, 2, and 4 units.\n\nSince all sides of a regular hexagon are equal in length, we know that the length of each side is the same as the length of the adjacent side. Therefore, we can represent the lengths of the six sides of the hexagon as follows: 1, 7, 2, 4, x, x.\n\nThe sum of the lengths of all six sides of the hexagon can be calculated as follows:\n\n1 + 7 + 2 + 4 + x + x = 6x\n\nSince the sum of the lengths of all six sides of a hexagon is equal to the perimeter of the hexagon, we can find the perimeter by adding up the lengths of the four sides that are given: 1 + 7 + 2 + 4 = 14 units.\n\nUsing this information, we can set up an equation to solve for the value of x:\n\n14 + 2x = 6x\n14 = 4x\nx = 3.5\n\nTherefore, the lengths of the two remaining sides of the equiangular hexagon are both 3.5 units. The sum of these two sides is:\n\n3.5 + 3.5 = 7 units\n\nThus, the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides of the equiangular hexagon is 7 units.",
