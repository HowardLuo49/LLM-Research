    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to understand the properties of an equiangular hexagon. An equiangular hexagon is a six-sided polygon where all interior angles are equal.\n\nGiven that the hexagon is equiangular, we can deduce that the sum of the interior angles of the hexagon is equal to 720 degrees, as this is the sum of the interior angles of any hexagon. Since an equiangular hexagon has all interior angles equal, each angle measures 120 degrees.\n\nNext, we note that the consecutive sides of the hexagon are of lengths 1, 7, 2, and 4 units. To find the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides, we need to find the lengths of all sides.\n\nSince all sides are of equal length in an equiangular hexagon, we can divide the sum of the lengths of the four given sides by 6 (the total number of sides) to find the length of one side. \n\nSum of the lengths of the four given sides: 1 + 7 + 2 + 4 = 14 units\nLength of one side: 14 units / 6 sides = 2.33 units (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nGiven that all sides of the equiangular hexagon are of equal length, the two remaining sides also have a length of 2.33 units each.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides is 2.33 + 2.33 = 4.66 units.",
