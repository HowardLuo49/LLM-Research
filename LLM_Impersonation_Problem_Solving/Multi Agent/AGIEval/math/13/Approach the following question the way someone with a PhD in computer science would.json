Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories, we need to consider the different ways in which he can select his CDs. \n\nThe total number of ways Carlos can select 5 CDs from the 12 available is given by the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 12 and r = 5. Therefore, the total number of ways Carlos can select 5 CDs from the 12 available is:\n\n12C5 = 12! / (5! * 7!) = 792\n\nTo calculate the number of ways Carlos can select CDs such that he includes at least one CD from each category, we need to consider the different combinations of CDs that he can choose:\n\n1.
