For example, in base $10$, the number $71$ has a value of $7\\cdot10^1+1\\cdot10^0 =71$. \n\nGiven that $(b_a)^2=71_a$, we can rewrite this as $b_a=b\\cdot a$, which is equivalent to $b\\times a$ in base 10. Thus, the square of a two-digit number in base $a$ is equal to the product of its digits in base 10. \n\nNext, we are given that $b=a-1$. Substituting this into our previous equation, we have $(a-1)\\times a=71$. Expanding and rearranging, we get $a^2-a-71=0$. \n\nThis is a simple quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula.
