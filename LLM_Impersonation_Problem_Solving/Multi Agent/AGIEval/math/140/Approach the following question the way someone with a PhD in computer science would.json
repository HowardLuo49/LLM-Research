    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information. The notation $(b_a)$ represents the number $b$ in base $a$. So, $(b_a)^2 = 71_a$ means that when the number $b$ is represented in base $a$ and squared, it equals $71$ in base $a$. \n\nLet's convert $71$ in base $a$ to base $10$ to make it easier to work with. In base $a$, $71$ is $7a + 1$. \n\nNow, let's express the square of $(b_a)$ in base $a$ as well. Since $b=a-1$, $(b_a)^2 = (a-1)_a^2$. Squaring $(a-1)_a$ simplifies to $(a^2 - 2a + 1)_a = (7a + 1)_a$. \n\nExpanding $(a^2 - 2a + 1)_a$ gives $a^2 - 2a + 1$. Setting this equal to $7a + 1$, we get $a^2 - 2a = 7a$, which simplifies to $a^2 - 9a = 0$.\n\nBy factoring out an $a$, we find that $a(a-9) = 0$. So, $a=0$ or $a=9$. However, since $a$ is a digit, $a$ cannot be $0$. Therefore, $a=9$.\n\nIn conclusion, the digit $a$ that satisfies the conditions is $9$.",
