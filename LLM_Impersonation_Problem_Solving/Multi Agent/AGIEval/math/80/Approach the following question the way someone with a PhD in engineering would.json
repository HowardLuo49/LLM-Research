    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to expand the left side of the equation and set it equal to the right side in order to determine the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n$(ax+b)(2x+3)= ax(2x) + ax(3) + b(2x) + b(3) = 2ax^2 + 3ax + 2bx + 3b$\n\nNow we set this expression equal to the right side of the equation:\n$2ax^2 + 3ax + 2bx + 3b = 20x^2 + 44x + 21$\n\nComparing coefficients of each term, we get the following equations:\n$2a = 20$\n$3a + 2b = 44$\n$3b = 21$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $a = 10$.\nSubstituting $a$ in the second equation, we get $3(10) + 2b = 44$, which simplifies to $30 + 2b = 44$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ are 10 and 7, respectively. Thus, the sum $a+b$ is equal to 17.",
