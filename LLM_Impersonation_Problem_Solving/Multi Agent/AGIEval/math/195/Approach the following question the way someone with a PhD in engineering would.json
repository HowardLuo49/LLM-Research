We also need to consider that there are 365 days in a non-leap year like 2007. \n\nGiven that January 1, 2007, was a Monday, we can calculate the day of the week for the last day of the year, December 31, 2007. By observing that there are 52 weeks in a year and that 365 days is equivalent to 52 weeks and 1 day, we find that December 31, 2007, is also a Monday.\n\nSince there are exactly seven days in a week, and the days of the week in a year cycle through in a repeated pattern, we can infer that each day of the week appears 52 times in a non-leap year. Therefore, there are a total of 52 Fridays in the year 2007.",
