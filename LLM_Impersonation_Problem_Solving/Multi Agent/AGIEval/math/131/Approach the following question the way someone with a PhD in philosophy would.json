    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first establish the relationship between the length and width of the rectangle. Let us denote the width of the rectangle as \\(w\\) and the length as \\(2w\\), as per the given information.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the rectangle's diagonal. The diagonal, which acts as the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the width, length, and diagonal, can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\((2w)^2 + w^2 = (5\\sqrt{5})^2\\)\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation, we get:\n\n\\(4w^2 + w^2 = 125\\)\n\n\\(5w^2 = 125\\)\n\n\\(w^2 = 25\\)\n\n\\(w = 5\\)\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is 5 units and the length is \\(2w = 10\\) units.\n\nTo find the area of the rectangle, we can use the formula: \\(\\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width}\\). Substituting in our values, we have:\n\n\\(\\text{Area} = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\text{ square units}\\)\n\nHence, the area of the rectangle is 50 square units.",
