    "solution": "371,\\!043,\\!400",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of ways the Town Library Club can form the 7-person steering committee, we can use the combination formula, which is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people available to choose from (in this case, 30 men and 40 women), and k is the number of people needed for the committee (3 men and 4 women).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 men from 30 men is denoted by C(30, 3), and the number of ways to choose 4 women from 40 women is denoted by C(40, 4).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to form the committee is given by the product of these two combinations:\n\nC(30, 3) * C(40, 4) = (30! / (3! * 27!)) * (40! / (4! * 36!))\n\nCalculating this expression will provide the exact number of ways the 7-person steering committee can be formed by selecting 3 men and 4 women from the Town Library Club.",
