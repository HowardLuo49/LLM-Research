    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use combinations, which are a way of selecting items from a larger group without regard to the order in which they are chosen. \n\nFirst, we need to determine how many ways we can choose 3 men from the 30 men in the Town Library Club. This is represented by the combination formula: \nnCr = n! / r!(n - r)!\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n30C3 = 30! / 3!(30-3)! \n30C3 = 30! / 3!27!\n30C3 = (30*29*28) / (3*2*1) \n30C3 = 4060\n\nNext, we need to determine how many ways we can choose 4 women from the 40 women in the Town Library Club. This is represented by the same combination formula:\n40C4 = 40! / 4!(40-4)!\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n40C4 = 40! / 4!36!\n40C4 = (40*39*38*37) / (4*3*2*1) \n40C4 = 91390\n\nFinally, to determine the total number of ways the committee can be formed, we multiply the number of ways to choose the men and women together:\nTotal ways = (30C3) * (40C4)\nTotal ways = 4060 *91390 \nTotal ways = 371006700\n\nTherefore, there are 371,006,700 ways to form the committee with 3 men and 4 women from the Town Library Club.",
