    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we must first identify the odd integers in this range: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. The product of these numbers is 1 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 9 x 11, which can be calculated to be 10395. The units digit of this product is 5, as it is the digit in the ones place. Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.",
