Katie has a list of real numbers such that the sum of the numbers on her list is equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers on her list. Compute the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of her numbers.",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can set up the following equation:\n\nLet the numbers on Katie's list be x1, x2, x3, ..., xn.\n\nGiven that the sum of the numbers on her list is equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers on her list, we have:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn = x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + ... + xn^2\n\nWe know that the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean is achieved when all the numbers on the list are equal. So, we can assume x1 = x2 = x3 = ... = xn = a.\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation above:\n\nn*a = n*a^2\n=> a = 1\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of Katie's numbers is 1.",
