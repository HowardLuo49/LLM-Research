    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. A recipe for crispy rice treats results in a mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. If a crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe is poured into a pan that is 10 inches by 15 inches, to what depth, in inches, will the pan be filled? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "1.17",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the volume of the original crispy rice treats mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. This can be done by multiplying the dimensions of the pan (9 inches by 13 inches by 1 inch) to get the volume in cubic inches.\n\nVolume = Length x Width x Depth\nVolume = 9 x 13 x 1 = 117 cubic inches\n\nNext, we need to determine the volume of the crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe. This can be calculated by multiplying the original volume by 1.5.\n\nNew Volume = 117 x 1.5 = 175.5 cubic inches\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the depth to which the 1.5 times original recipe mixture will fill in the 10-inch by 15-inch pan. This can be done by dividing the new volume by the area of the pan (10 inches by 15 inches).\n\nArea of pan = Length x Width = 10 x 15 = 150 square inches\n\nDepth = New Volume / Area of pan\nDepth = 175.5 / 150 = 1.17 inches\n\nTherefore, the 10-inch by 15-inch pan will be filled to a depth of 1.17 inches with the crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe.",
