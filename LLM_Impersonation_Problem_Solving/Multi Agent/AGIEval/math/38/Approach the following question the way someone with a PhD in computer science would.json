    "gpt_response": "To solve this equation, we need to simplify both sides using basic arithmetic operations. \n\nOn the left side, we first subtract 90 from 500, which gives us 410. Adding 7 to that results in 417.\n\nOn the right side, we first subtract 60 from 400, which gives us 340. Then, adding 5 to that results in 345.\n\nSo, we have the equation 417 = 345 + N. To find the value of N, we need to subtract 345 from both sides, which gives us:\n\nN = 417 - 345\nN = 72\n\nTherefore, the value of N is 72.",
