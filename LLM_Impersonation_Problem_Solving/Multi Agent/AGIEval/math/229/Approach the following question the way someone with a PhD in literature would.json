In Cartesian space, three spheres centered at $(-2,5,4),$ $(2,1,4),$ and $(4,7,5)$ are all tangent to the $xy$-plane.  The $xy$-plane is one of two planes tangent to all three spheres; the second plane can be written as the equation $ax + bx + cz = d$ for some real numbers $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Find $\\frac{c}{a}.$",
