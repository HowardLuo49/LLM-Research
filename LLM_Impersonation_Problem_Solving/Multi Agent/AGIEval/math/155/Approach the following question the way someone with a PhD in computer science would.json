Find the number of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of positive real numbers such that\n\\[\\left( x + \\frac{1}{y} \\right) \\left( y + \\frac{1}{z} \\right) \\left( z + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = 8.\\]",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by expanding the product on the left-hand side of the given equation. \n\nExpanding, we get\n\\[(xyz + x + \\frac{x}{z} + y + \\frac{y}{x} + \\frac{1}{yz} + z + \\frac{z}{y} + \\frac{1}{xy}) = 8.\\]\n\nSince $x, y, z$ are positive real numbers, we can apply AM-GM inequality to simplify the expression. By AM-GM, we know that\n\\[xyz + \\frac{x}{z} \\ge 2x, \\quad y + \\frac{y}{x} \\ge 2y, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z + \\frac{z}{y} \\ge 2z.\\]\n\nAdding all three inequalities together, we have\n\\[xyz + x + \\frac{x}{z} + y + \\frac{y}{x} + \\frac{1}{yz} + z + \\frac{z}{y} + \\frac{1}{xy} \\ge 2x + 2y + 2z + \\frac{1}{xy} + \\frac{1}{yz} + \\frac{1}{zx}.\\]\n\nSince the product of the ordered triple is $xyz = 1$, we have $\\frac{1}{xy} + \\frac{1}{yz} + \\frac{1}{zx} = 1$. \n\nTherefore, we have \n\\[2x + 2y + 2z + \\frac{1}{xy} + \\frac{1}{yz} + \\frac{1}{zx} \\ge 2(x+y+z) + 1 = 8.\\]\n\nThis shows that the minimum value of the left-hand side of the equation is 8. Since the equation is given to be equal to 8, this means equality must hold. Therefore, we must have equality in the AM-GM inequalities used earlier.\n\nThis implies that $xyz = \\frac{x}{z} = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{z}{y} = 1$. Solving this system of equations gives $x=y=z=1$.\n\nHence, there is only one ordered triple $(x,y,z)$ that satisfies the given equation, and this triple is $(1,1,1)$.",
