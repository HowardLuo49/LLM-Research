First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",

Let $x$ represent the amount of money Stacy has after visiting the lottery stall, and let $n$ represent the number of times Stacy alternates between playing the lottery and visiting a shop. \n\nGiven that Stacy's initial amount of money is $d$, we have the initial equation:\n\n\\[x = 2d\\]\n\nAfter visiting the first shop, Stacy's money is reduced by $1024$ dollars, resulting in:\n\n\\[x - 1024 = 2d\\]\n\nDuring the alternating process, the amount of money Stacy has after each cycle is as follows:\n\n\\[x \\times 2^{n+1} - 1024 \\times 2^n = 2d\\]\n\nUpon visiting the final shop, Stacy exhausts all her money:\n\n\\[x \\times 2^{n} - 1024 \\times 2^{n-1} = 0\\]\n\nGiven these equations, we must find the minimum possible value of $d$ such that Stacy has no money left after visiting the last shop. By substituting the relation for $x$ from the initial equation into the alternating process equations, we find that the minimum possible value of $d$ is $\\boxed{512}$ dollars.",
