First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can look at the sequence of Stacy's money after each iteration. Let $a_0 = d$ be Stacy's initial amount of money.\n\nAfter going to the lottery, Stacy's money becomes $2a_0$. After spending $1024$ dollars in the first shop, she has $2a_0 - 1024$ dollars remaining. \n\nAfter each subsequent round (lottery -> shop -> lottery), Stacy's money can be represented by the following recurrence relation:\n\\[a_{n+1} = \\begin{cases} \n2a_n & \\text{ if n is odd} \\\\\n2a_n - 1024 & \\text{ if n is even} \n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nWe want to find the minimum possible value of $d$ such that Stacy's money is completely spent after exiting the last shop (i.e., $a_{10} = 0$).\n\nBy solving the above recurrence relation for $n=10$, we find that the minimum possible value of $d$ is $2048$ dollars. At this starting amount, Stacy will have exactly $0$ dollars after exiting the last shop.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of $d$ is $\\$2048$.",
