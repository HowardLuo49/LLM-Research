First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",
