    "gpt_response": "We start by noticing that the given equations suggest a connection to the fundamental theorem of Vieta. \n\nLet us denote $S_1 = a + b + c$ and $S_2 = ab + bc + ac$. According to Vieta's formulas, for a given quadratic equation $x^2 - S_1x + S_2 = 0$ with roots $a$, $b$, and $c$, we have that $a^2 = S_1c - S_2 = bc$. Therefore, the given $a^2 = bc$ translates to $S_1c - S_2 = bc$ in accordance with the Vieta theorem. \n\nRearranging the relationship $S_1c - S_2 = bc$ yields $c = \\frac{S_2}{S_1 - b}$. \n\nSubstituting $c = \\frac{S_2}{S_1 - b}$ into the equation $S_1 = abc = ab\\frac{S_2}{S_1 - b}$, we can solve for $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n\nThis simplifies to $S^2_1 - S_1b - S_2 = 0$, which is a quadratic equation in $S_1$. We can solve for $S_1$ using the quadratic formula. \n\nNext, substitute the value of $S_1$ back into the equations $a^2 = bc$ and $a + b + c = abc$ to find the value of $a$, $b$, and $c$.
