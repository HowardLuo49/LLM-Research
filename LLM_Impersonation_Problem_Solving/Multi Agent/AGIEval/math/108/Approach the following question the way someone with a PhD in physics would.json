Since the sum of the prime factors is 47, we can list out the prime numbers that add up to 47: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.\n\nNext, we can consider all the possible combinations of these prime factors in order to find a three-digit number where the hundreds, tens, and units digit are the same. One such combination that satisfies this condition is 111, as the prime factorization of 111 is 3 x 37. \n\nTherefore, the three-digit number in question is 111.",
