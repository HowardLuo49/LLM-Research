    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to identify all the three-digit numbers where the hundreds, tens, and units digits are the same. These numbers include 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, and 999.\n\nNext, we need to find the prime factors of each of these numbers and calculate their sum. The number 111 has prime factors of 3 and 37, which add up to 40. The number 222 has prime factors of 2 and 37, which add up to 39. The numbers 333 to 999 have prime factors of 3 and a larger prime number, resulting in sums greater than 47.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number that meets the given criteria is 111, with a sum of prime factors equal to 47.",
