An aquarium has a rectangular base that measures 100 cm by 40 cm and has a height of 50 cm. The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest 100th.",

    "gpt_response": "To determine by how many centimeters the water level rises when a rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is placed in the aquarium and completely submerged, we first need to calculate the initial volume of water in the aquarium before adding the rock.\n\nThe initial volume of water in the aquarium can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: $V = l \\times w \\times h$, where $l$ is the length, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height.\n\nGiven that the length of the base of the aquarium is 100 cm, the width is 40 cm, and the water level rises to a depth of 37 cm, the initial volume of water in the aquarium is: \n$V_{water} = 100 \\times 40 \\times 37 = 148,000 \\text{cm}^3$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total volume of the water and the rock after the rock is submerged in the aquarium. Since the total volume of water and rock remains constant, we can use the equation: $V_{water} + V_{rock} = V_{total}$.\n\nGiven that the volume of the rock is $1000 \\text{cm}^3$, the total volume is: \n$V_{total} = V_{water} + V_{rock} = 148,000 + 1000 = 149000 \\text{cm}^3$.\n\nTo find the new water level when the rock is submerged, we rearrange the initial volume formula to solve for the new height:\n$h = \\frac{V_{total}}{l \\times w} = \\frac{149000}{100 \\times 40} = 37.25 \\text{cm}$.\n\nTherefore, the water level rises by 0.25 cm when the rock is submerged in the aquarium.",
