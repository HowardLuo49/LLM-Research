    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can start by examining the relationship between $n$ and $2n+1$ in terms of remainders when divided by 7. \n\nGiven that $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, we can represent $n$ as $n = 7k + 3$, where $k$ is an integer representing the quotient of the division. \n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $2n+1$:\n$2n + 1 = 2(7k+3) + 1 = 14k + 6 + 1 = 14k + 7$\n\nNow, considering $14k + 7$, we can see that when this expression is divided by 7, the remainder will be 0. This is because the term $14k$ is divisible by 7, leaving only 7 as the remainder.\n\nTherefore, when $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, the expression $2n+1$ will give a remainder of 0 when divided by 7.",
