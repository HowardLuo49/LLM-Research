    "gpt_response": "To find the range of the function, we first need to analyze the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches infinity and negative infinity.\n\nLet's start with $x \\to \\infty$.

So, we have\n\\[f(x) \\approx \\sqrt{x^2} - \\sqrt{x^2} = 0.\\]\nThus, as $x$ approaches infinity, $f(x)$ approaches 0.\n\nNow, let's consider $x \\to -\\infty$. Again, as $x$ becomes very large in magnitude (negative in this case), the terms inside the square roots dominate.

Therefore, we can conclude that the minimum of the function occurs at $x = 3$, and is equal to $f(3) = \\sqrt{3^2 - 10 \\cdot 3 + 34} - \\sqrt{3^2 + 4} = \\sqrt{1} - \\sqrt{13} = 1 - \\sqrt{13}$.\n\nSince the function decreases as $x$ approaches negative infinity and increases as $x$ approaches positive infinity, the range of the function is $(-\\infty, 1 - \\sqrt{13})$.",
