Notice that the square root term must be non-negative, so we need to consider when both $x^2 - 10x + 34 \\ge 0$ and $x^2 + 4 \\ge 0$. \n\nThe discriminant of $x^2 - 10x + 34$ is $(-10)^2 - 4(34) = 100 -136 = -36$, so $x^2 - 10x + 34$ has no real roots, meaning it is always positive. $x^2 + 4$ is always positive as well. \n\nTherefore, the domain of $f(x)$ is all real numbers. To find the range, we will look at the limit of the function as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity. As $x$ goes to infinity, both $\\sqrt{x^2 - 10x + 34}$ and $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$ approach infinity, so their difference also approaches infinity. As $x$ goes to negative infinity, $\\sqrt{x^2 - 10x + 34}$ also goes to infinity while $\\sqrt{x^2 + 4}$ remains positive. Thus, the range of $f(x)$ is all real numbers.",
