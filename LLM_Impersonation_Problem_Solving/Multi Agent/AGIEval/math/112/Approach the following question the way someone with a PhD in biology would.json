    "gpt_response": "To find the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 - 10x + 34} - \\sqrt{x^2 + 4} \\), we first need to consider the domain of the function. \n\nSince we are taking the square root of some terms, the radicand must be greater than or equal to 0. This gives us two conditions:\n\nFor \\( \\sqrt{x^2 - 10x + 34} \\) to be defined, we need \\( x^2 - 10x + 34 \\geq 0 \\), which gives us \\( (x-3)(x-7) \\geq 0 \\), so either \\( x \\leq 3 \\) or \\( x \\geq 7 \\).\n\nFor \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + 4} \\) to be defined, we need \\( x^2 + 4 \\geq 0 \\), which is true for all \\( x \\).\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function is \\( x \\in (-\\infty,3] \\cup [7, \\infty) \\).\n\nNow, to find the range of the function, we can use algebraic manipulation and properties of square roots to simplify the expression. After simplifying, we find that \n\\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{(x - 5)^2 + 9} - \\sqrt{x^2 + 4}. \\]\n\nSince the inside of the square root is squared, it will always be non-negative, meaning the minimum value of \\( \\sqrt{(x - 5)^2 + 9} \\) is 3 when \\( x = 5 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + 4} \\) is non-negative for all \\( x \\). Therefore, the range of the function is all real numbers greater than or equal to 3.\n\nIn conclusion, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 - 10x + 34} - \\sqrt{x^2 + 4} \\) is all real numbers greater than or equal to 3.",
