    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in engineering, I would analyze this problem using modular arithmetic. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. A number is divisible by 2 if its units digit is even (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nIn this case, the number is $21420N$. To determine which nonzero value of $N$ makes this number divisible by 6, we must find the sum of the digits and check if it is divisible by 3. \n\nThe sum of the digits is $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$. For this sum to be divisible by 3, $N$ must be 3, as adding 3 to 9 results in a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the nonzero value of $N$ that makes the number $214203$ divisible by 6 is $N = 3$.",
