    "gpt_response": "To determine the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a $12$-hour clock at $2\\!:\\!48$, we first calculate the angles made by the hour and minute hands separately.\n\nThe hour hand moves $30$ degrees every hour, dividing the clock face into $12$ equal segments. At $2\\!:\\!48$, the hour hand has moved $2$ segments past the $2$ o'clock position. Thus, the hour hand is at an angle of $2 \\times 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ$ from the $12$ o'clock position.\n\nThe minute hand moves $360$ degrees in $60$ minutes. At $48$ minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved $48/60 \\times 360^\\circ = 288^\\circ$ from the $12$ o'clock position.\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands is the absolute value of the difference between their angles. In this case, the smaller angle is $|288^\\circ - 60^\\circ| = |228^\\circ| = 228^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of the clock at $2\\!:\\!48$ is $228^\\circ$.",
