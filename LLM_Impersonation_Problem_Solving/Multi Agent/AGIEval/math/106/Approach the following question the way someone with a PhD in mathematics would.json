The hour hand has moved $\\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the way around the clock (each hour is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the total distance around the clock), which is equivalent to $30^\\circ$ ($\\frac{1}{6} \\times 360^\\circ = 60^\\circ$).\n\nAt $2\\!:\\!48$, the hour hand has moved $\\frac{1}{6} = 8$ tick marks past $2$, representing $8 \\times 30^\\circ = 240^\\circ$ from the $12$ position (where $0^\\circ$ is the $12$ position).
