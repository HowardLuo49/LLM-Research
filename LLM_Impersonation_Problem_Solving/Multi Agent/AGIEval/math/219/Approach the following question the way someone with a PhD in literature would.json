    "solution": "36",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the radius of the circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. In this case, we have $12\\pi = 2\\pi r$, which simplifies to $r = 6$ units.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of a square with sides the same length as the radius of the circle, which is 6 units. The formula for the area of a square is $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square. In this case, $s = 6$, so the area of the square is $A = 6^2 = 36$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square with sides the same length as the radius of the circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units is 36 square units.",
