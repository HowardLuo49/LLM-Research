    "solution": "36",
    "gpt_response": "To find the area of a square with sides equal to the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\u03c0$ units, we first need to find the radius of the circle.\n\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\u03c0r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. We are given that the circumference is $12\u03c0$, so we have:\n\n$12\u03c0 = 2\u03c0r$\n\nSolving for $r$, we find that $r = 6$.\n\nSince the sides of the square are equal to the radius of the circle, each side of the square has a length of 6 units. Therefore, the area of the square is given by $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square. Plugging in $s = 6$, we get:\n\n$A = 6^2 = 36$ square units.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 36 square units.",
