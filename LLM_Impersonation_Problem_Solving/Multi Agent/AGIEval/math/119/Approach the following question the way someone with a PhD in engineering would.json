In the graph of $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$, let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes.

Since the cancelled factor was $x+3$, we have a hole in the graph at $x = -3$.\n\nTo find the number of vertical asymptotes, we need to look at the factors in the denominator that do not cancel out.
