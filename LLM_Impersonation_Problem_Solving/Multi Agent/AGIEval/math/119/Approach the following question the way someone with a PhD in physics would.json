In the graph of $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$, let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.",

    "gpt_response": "To begin, let us first simplify the expression $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$. Through factoring both the numerator and the denominator, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} = \\frac{x}{x+1}$. \n\nNow we analyze the behavior of the simplified function. The function is undefined at $x=-1$, as it would result in division by zero. Thus, there is a hole in the graph at $x=-1$, making $a=1$.\n\nNext, we determine the vertical asymptotes of the function. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero. In this case, the denominator $(x+1)$ equals zero at $x=-1$, resulting in a vertical asymptote. Therefore, there is one vertical asymptote, making $b=1$.\n\nMoving on to horizontal asymptotes, as $x$ approaches infinity, the function becomes $y=1$. Therefore, there is one horizontal asymptote, making $c=1$.\n\nLastly, we examine the presence of oblique asymptotes. Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, there are no oblique asymptotes in this function, meaning $d=0$. \n\nFinally, we can calculate $a+2b+3c+4d=1+2(1)+3(1)+4(0)=1+2+3=\\boxed{6}$.",
