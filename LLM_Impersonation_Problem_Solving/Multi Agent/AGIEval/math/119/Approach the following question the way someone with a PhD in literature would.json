In this case, the numerator $x^2+3x$ equals zero when $x=0$ or $x=-3$, while the denominator $x^2+4x+3$ equals zero when $x=-1$ or $x=-3$. However, due to the fact that $x=-3$ is a common root between the numerator and denominator, it results in a hole at $x=-3$.\n\nMoving on to vertical asymptotes, these occur at values of $x$ for which the denominator of the rational function evaluates to zero while the numerator does not. In this case, the denominator $x^2+4x+3$ evaluates to zero when $x=-1$ or $x=-3$, but only $x=-1$ does not result in a hole. Thus, there is one vertical asymptote at $x=-1$.\n\nHorizontal asymptotes, on the other hand, can be determined by examining the degree of the numerator and denominator of the rational function. In this case, both the numerator and denominator have the same degree of 2, which means there is one horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote can be found by dividing the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator, which yields $y=1$.\n\nLastly, oblique asymptotes occur when the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is one greater than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. In this case, the degrees are equal and therefore there are no oblique asymptotes present.\n\nTo find the desired quantity $a+2b+3c+4d$, we substitute the values we have found:\n\n$a = 1$ (from the hole at $x=-3$)\n$b = 1$ (from the vertical asymptote at $x=-1$)\n$c = 1$ (from the horizontal asymptote $y=1$)\n$d = 0$ (as there are no oblique asymptotes)\n\nTherefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1 + 2(1) + 3(1) + 4(0) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.
