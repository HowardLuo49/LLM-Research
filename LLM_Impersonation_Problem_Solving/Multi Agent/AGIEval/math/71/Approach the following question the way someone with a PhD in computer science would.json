    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in computer science, I would approach this question by analyzing the given inequalities with respect to the mathematical properties involved. \n\n1. $ab < ac$\nSince $b<0$ and $a<c$, multiplying a negative number with a larger positive number results in a smaller product. Therefore, $ab < ac$ is always true. \n\n2. $a+b<c+b$\nAdding a negative number (b) to a positive number (a) is equivalent to subtracting the absolute value of b from a. Since a<c, a+b will always be less than c+b. Therefore, $a+b<c+b$ is always true.\n\n3. $a-b < c-b$\nSubtracting a negative number (b) from a positive number (a) is equivalent to adding the absolute value of b to a. Since a is less than c, the effect of subtracting b from both will still result in a being less than c. Therefore, $a-b < c-b$ is always true. \n\n4. $c/a > 1$\nGiven that $a<c$ and $b<0$, we cannot guarantee that c/a will always be greater than 1 since the values of a and c are not specific. Hence, $c/a > 1$ is not always true. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'A, B, C'.",
