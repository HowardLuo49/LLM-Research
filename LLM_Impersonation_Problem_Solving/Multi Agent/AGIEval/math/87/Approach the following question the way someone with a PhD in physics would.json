    "gpt_response": "A convex hexagon has 6 vertices. In general, the number of diagonals that can be drawn from a given vertex of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula (n-3). Therefore, the number of distinct diagonals that can be drawn from each vertex of a convex hexagon is (6-3) = 3. However, each diagonal connects two distinct vertices, so each diagonal is counted twice when considering all diagonals of the hexagon. So, the total number of distinct diagonals that can be drawn in a convex hexagon is 3 * 6 / 2 = 9.",
