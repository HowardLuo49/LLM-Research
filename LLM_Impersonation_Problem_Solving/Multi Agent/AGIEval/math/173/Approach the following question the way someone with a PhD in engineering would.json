    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the given rational function, we need to consider the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero. \n\nThe denominator of the function is $x^2 + 7x - 30$. To find the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero, we need to solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + 7x - 30 = 0$.\n\nTo do this, we can factor the quadratic equation as follows:\n$(x + 10)(x - 3) = 0$\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives us:\n$x + 10 = 0 \\implies x = -10$\n$x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = 3$\n\nTherefore, the values of $x$ that make the denominator zero are $x = -10$ and $x = 3$. These are the values of $x$ that correspond to vertical asymptotes in the graph of the function.\n\nTherefore, the graph of $y=\\frac{x-3}{x^2+7x-30}$ has 2 vertical asymptotes.",
