    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation, we must first understand the concept of least common multiple (lcm). The lcm of two numbers $a$ and $b$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $a$ and $b$.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for positive integers $r$ such that the lcm of $r$ and 700 is equal to 7000. Since 7000 is divisible by both 700 and $r$, we can express 7000 as the product of $r$ and some integer $k$: $$ 7000 = 700r \\cdot k.$$\n\nBy simplifying this equation, we find: $$r \\cdot k = 10.$$\n\nSince $r$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $r$ that satisfy the above equation are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The sum of these positive integers is $1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation is 18.",
