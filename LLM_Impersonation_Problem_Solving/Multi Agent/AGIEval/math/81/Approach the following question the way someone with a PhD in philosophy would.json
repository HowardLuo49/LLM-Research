    "gpt_response": "To solve the given equation, we first need to understand the concept of least common multiple (LCM) in the context of number theory. The LCM of two integers, denoted by $\\text{lcm}[a,b]$, is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $a$ and $b$.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the equation $\\text{lcm}[r,700] = 7000$. This equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\\frac{r \\cdot 700}{\\text{gcd}(r,700)} = 7000~,$$\n\nwhere $\\text{gcd}(r,700)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $r$ and $700$. We know that the product of the LCM and GCD of two integers is equal to the product of the two integers. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$r \\cdot 700 = 7000 \\cdot \\text{gcd}(r,700)~.$$\n\nSince $700 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$$r \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 = 7000 \\cdot \\text{gcd}(r,700).$$\n\nSimplifying both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$$r = 100 \\cdot \\text{gcd}(r,700).$$\n\nThus, $r$ must be a multiple of $100$. The positive integers that satisfy this condition are $r = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000$, that is, all multiples of $100$ less than or equal to $1000$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation is:\n\n$$100 + 200 + 300 + 400 + 500 + 600 + 700 + 800 + 900 + 1000 = 5500~.$$",
