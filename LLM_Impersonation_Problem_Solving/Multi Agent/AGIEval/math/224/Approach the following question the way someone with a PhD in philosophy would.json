A strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\\dots$ has the property that for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic. Suppose that $a_{13} = 2016$. Find $a_1$.",

We are given that for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic. This implies that there exist constants $r$ and $d$ such that $a_{2k} = ra_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k+1} = ra_{2k}$, and $a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d$. \n\nNow, we are given that $a_{13} = 2016$. Since $13$ is odd, we can express $a_{13}$ in terms of $a_{12}$ and $a_{14}$ using the geometric property. Therefore, we have $a_{13} = ra_{12} = r^2 a_{11}$. Similarly, we can express $a_{13}$ in terms of $a_{12}$ and $a_{14}$ using the arithmetic property. Thus, we have $a_{13} = a_{12} + d = a_{14} - d$. \n\nCombining the equations $a_{13} = r^2 a_{11}$, $a_{12} + d = a_{13}$, and $a_{14} - d = a_{13}$, we can eliminate $a_{13}$ to obtain $r^2 a_{11} = a_{12} + d = a_{14} - d$. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we can express $a_{12}$ in terms of $a_{10}$ and $a_{13}$, and $a_{14}$ in terms of $a_{12}$ and $a_{15}$. This allows us to derive a recursive equation for $a_{10}$ in terms of $a_1$.\n\nSolving this recursive equation will give us $a_1$. Thus, by carefully manipulating the given properties of the sequence, we can determine the value of $a_1$.",
