    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ice cream scoops needed to fill the ice cream cone, we first need to calculate the volume of the cone and the volume of each ice cream scoop.\n\nThe volume of a cone can be calculated using the formula V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone. In this case, the radius (r) is 2 inches and the height (h) is 5 inches. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nV_cone = (1/3)\u03c0(2)^2 * 5\nV_cone = (1/3)\u03c0 * 4 * 5\nV_cone = (1/3)\u03c0 * 20\nV_cone = 20\u03c0/3 cubic inches\n\nNext, we need to calculate the volume of each ice cream scoop. The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius (r) is 1 inch. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:\n\nV_scoop = (4/3)\u03c0(1)^3\nV_scoop = (4/3)\u03c0 cubic inches\n\nFinally, to determine the number of ice cream scoops needed to fill the cone, we divide the volume of the cone by the volume of each scoop:\n\nNumber of scoops = V_cone / V_scoop\nNumber of scoops = (20\u03c0/3) / (4/3)\u03c0\nNumber of scoops = 20/4\nNumber of scoops = 5\n\nTherefore, 5 ice cream scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and height of 5 inches.",
