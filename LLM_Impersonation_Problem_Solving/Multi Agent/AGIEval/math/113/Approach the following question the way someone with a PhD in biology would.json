    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 and exactly two dice showing a 2, we first need to determine how many ways this event can occur. \n\nThere are six dice rolled, and we want exactly two of them to show a 1 and exactly two of them to show a 2. \n\nFirst, we need to choose which two of the six dice will show a 1. This can be done in (6 choose 2) = 15 ways. \n\nNext, we need to choose which two of the remaining four dice will show a 2. This can be done in (4 choose 2) = 6 ways. \n\nFinally, the remaining two dice can show any of the remaining four numbers (3, 4, 5, 6), giving us 4 possible outcomes for each of the remaining two dice. This gives a total of 4^2 = 16 possibilities. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways this event can occur is 15 * 6 * 16 = 1440. \n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice is 6^6 = 46656. \n\nTherefore, the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 and exactly two dice showing a 2 is 1440/46656 = 20/651.",
