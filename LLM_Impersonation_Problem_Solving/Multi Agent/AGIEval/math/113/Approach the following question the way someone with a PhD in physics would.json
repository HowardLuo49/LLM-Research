    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 and exactly two dice showing a 2 when rolling six 6-sided dice, we need to first determine the total number of ways this outcome can occur.\n\nThere are 6 choices for the two dice that will show a 1, and then there are 5 choices for the remaining two dice that will show a 2. The remaining two dice can show any of the remaining four numbers on the dice, so there are 4 choices for each of the remaining two dice.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways this outcome can occur is given by:\n\nTotal number of ways = 6 choose 2 * 5 choose 2 * 4 choose 2\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n\n[6! / (2! * (6-2)!)] * [5! / (2! * (5-2)!)] * [4! / (2! * (4-2)!)]\n= [15] * [10] * [6]\n= 900\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling exactly two dice showing a 1 and exactly two dice showing a 2 is:\n\nProbability = Total number of ways / Total number of possible outcomes\n= 900 / 6^6\n= 900 / 46656\n= 25 / 1296\n\nSo, the probability is 25/1296.",
