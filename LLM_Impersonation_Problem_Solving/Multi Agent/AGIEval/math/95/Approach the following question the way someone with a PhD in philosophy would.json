At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
    "solution": "9c+6",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the cost of a chocolate bar as $c$ dollars. Then, the cost of a vanilla bar can be represented as $c+2$ dollars.\n\nJamie buys a chocolate bar for $c$ dollars and three vanilla bars for a total of $3(c+2)$ dollars. Therefore, Jamie spends $c+3(c+2) = 4c+6$ dollars in total.\n\nKevin buys five chocolate bars for a total of $5c$ dollars.\n\nThus, in terms of $c$, the total amount spent by Jamie and Kevin at the candy store is $4c+6+5c = 9c+6$ dollars.",
