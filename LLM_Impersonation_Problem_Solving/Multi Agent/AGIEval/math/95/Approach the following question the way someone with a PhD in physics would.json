At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
    "solution": "9c+6",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, one must first express the cost of a vanilla bar in terms of the cost of a chocolate bar. Given that a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar, the cost of a vanilla bar can be expressed as $c+2$ dollars.\n\nNext, we have to calculate the total amount spent by Jamie and Kevin at the candy store. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, so Jamie spends a total of $c+(3)(c+2)$ dollars on candy.\n\nKevin buys five chocolate bars, so Kevin spends a total of $(5)c$ dollars on candy.\n\nAdding both amounts together gives the total amount spent by Jamie and Kevin at the candy store:\n\n$$(c+(3)(c+2)) + (5)c = c + 3c + 6 + 5c = 9c + 6$$ \n\nTherefore, Jamie and Kevin spend a total of $9c + 6$ dollars at the candy store in terms of $c$.",
