Given that each die has 6 sides, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\nNext, we must determine how many of these outcomes result in the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5. There is only one outcome that satisfies these conditions - specifically, when the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5 when two 6-sided dice are rolled is calculated as follows:\n\n(number of desired outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = 1 / 36.\n\nHence, the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5 is 1/36.",
