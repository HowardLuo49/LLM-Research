    "gpt_response": "First, we find the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle. Let $a$ and $b$ be the lengths of the legs $AC$ and $BC$ respectively. We know that the area of a triangle can be computed as $\\frac{1}{2}ab$ for a right triangle, so we have $\\frac{1}{2}ab = 4$.\n\nSince $\\overline{AB}$ is the hypotenuse, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = 12^2 = 144$.\n\nNow, we want to compute $\\sin 2A$. Using the double angle formula, we have $\\sin 2A = 2\\sin A \\cos A$.\n\nWe can find $\\sin A$ using the sides of the triangle. Since $\\sin A = \\frac{a}{12}$, we can solve for $a$ in terms of $b$ from the area equation:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}ab = 4 \\Rightarrow ab = 8 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{8}{b}$.\n\nPlugging this into the Pythagorean theorem, we have $\\left(\\frac{8}{b}\\right)^2 + b^2 = 144$, which simplifies to $64 + b^4 = 144 \\Rightarrow b^4 = 80$.\n\nTaking the positive root, we have $b = \\sqrt[4]{80} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\sin A = \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Now, we can compute $\\cos A$ as $\\cos A = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 A} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}$.\n\nFinally, we can find $\\sin 2A$:\n\n$\\sin 2A = 2\\sin A \\cos A = 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{9}$.",
