The digits that multiply to give 6 are 1, 2, and 3. \n\nTo form the greatest three-digit integer, we should place the largest digit, which is 3, in the hundreds place to maximize the value of the integer. Then, we can place the next largest digit, which is 2, in the tens place to further increase the value. Finally, we place the smallest digit, which is 1, in the units place.\n\nThus, the greatest three-digit integer in which the product of the digits is 6 is 321.",
