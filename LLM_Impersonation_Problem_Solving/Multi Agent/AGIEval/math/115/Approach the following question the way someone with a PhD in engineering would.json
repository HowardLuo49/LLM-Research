We know that the distance between the foci and vertices is equal to 2ae and 2b, respectively, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the hyperbola. Thus, we have $a = \\sqrt{5}$, $b = 2$, and $e = \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{5}$.

This yields $\\frac{16-y^2}{5} = 1 - \\frac{y^2}{4}$, which simplifies to $y = \\pm \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Substituting these values of $y$ back into the equation of the circle, we find the corresponding values of $x$, which are $\\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the four points of intersection are $(\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}, \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{5}}), (-\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}, \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{5}}), (\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}, -\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{5}}),$ and $(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}, -\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{5}})$.\n\nThe area of the quadrilateral formed by these four points can be calculated using the Shoelace Formula, which involves finding the sum of the products of the coordinates of the vertices and then subtracting the sum of the products of the coordinates of the vertices taken in the reverse order.
