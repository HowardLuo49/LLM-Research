The inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ is found by swapping the roles of $x$ and $y$ and solving for $y$. Thus, if $y=f(x)$, then $x=f^{-1}(y)$. To find the inverse of $f(x)$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Replace $f(x)$ with $y$: $y = 5x - 12$.\n2. Swap $x$ and $y$ to find $f^{-1}(x)$: $x = 5y - 12$.\n3.
