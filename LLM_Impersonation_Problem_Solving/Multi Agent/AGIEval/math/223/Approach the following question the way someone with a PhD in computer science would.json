    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of selecting a subcommittee of 3 members that consists of only Republicans from a Senate committee consisting of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the Senate committee is given by the total number of ways to choose 3 members out of 13, which is denoted as \"13 choose 3\" or C(13,3) and can be calculated as:\n\nC(13,3) = 13! / (3!(13-3)!)\nC(13,3) = 13! / (3! * 10!)\nC(13,3) = 13*12*11 / 3*2*1\nC(13,3) = 286\n\nNow, the number of ways to select a subcommittee of 3 members consisting of only Republicans is given by choosing 3 members from the 5 Republicans, which is denoted as \"5 choose 3\" or C(5,3) and can be calculated as:\n\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!)\nC(5,3) = 5! / (3! * 2!)\nC(5,3) = 5*4 / 2*1\nC(5,3) = 10\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a subcommittee consisting of only Republicans is:\n\nP(3 Republicans) = Number of ways to choose 3 Republicans / Total number of ways to choose 3 members\nP(3 Republicans) = C(5,3) / C(13,3)\nP(3 Republicans) = 10 / 286\nP(3 Republicans) \u2248 0.035\n\nThus, the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans is approximately 0.035 or 3.5%.",
