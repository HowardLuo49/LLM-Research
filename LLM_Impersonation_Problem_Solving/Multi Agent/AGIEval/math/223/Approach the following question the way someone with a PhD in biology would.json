A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{5}{143}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans, we need to determine the total number of ways to choose 3 members out of the total 13 members of the Senate committee. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by:\n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nWhere n is the total number of items to choose from (13 members in this case), r is the number of items to choose (3 members in this case), and ! denotes factorials.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 members out of 13 is:\n\n13C3 = 13! / (3! * (13-3)!) = 286\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans out of the 5 Republicans in the Senate committee. This can be calculated using the combination formula as well:\n\n5C3 = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 10\n\nTherefore, the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans is:\n\n(5C3) / (13C3) = 10 / 286 \u2248 0.0349\n\nSo, the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans is approximately 0.0349 or 3.49%.",
