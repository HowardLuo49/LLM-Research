    "gpt_response": "To analyze the pattern, I will first describe the process by which each figure is created. In each step:\n- The endpoints of each line segment are replaced by a smaller Y shape, with the ends of the Y connecting to the endpoints of the original line segments.\n- The number of Y shapes at the ends of each line segment increases by 1.\n- The size of the Y shapes decreases with each step.\n\nFor Figure 5, we can observe that the end points of the line segments are replaced by Y shapes three times. This means we will have 3 Y shapes connected to each end point.\n\nTo determine the total number of end points in Figure 5, we need to count the number of end points in each previous figure and add the new end points created in the next step. Let's calculate:\nFigure 1: 3 end points\nFigure 2: 3 x 2 = 6 end points (3 end points with 2 new Y shapes at each)\nFigure 3: 6 x 2 = 12 end points (6 end points with 2 new Y shapes at each)\nFigure 4: 12 x 2 = 24 end points (12 end points with 2 new Y shapes at each)\nFigure 5: 24 x 2 = 48 end points (24 end points with 2 new Y shapes at each)\n\nTherefore, Figure 5 will have a total of 48 end points.",
