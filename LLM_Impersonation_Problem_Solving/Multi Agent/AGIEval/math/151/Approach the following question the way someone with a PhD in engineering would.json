A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$, where $t$ is the time after launch. At what time is the height of the ball at its maximum?",

The vertex of a parabolic function in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the formula $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = -25$ and $b = 75$, so the time at which the height of the ball is at its maximum can be found by calculating $t = -\\frac{75}{2*(-25)} = \\frac{75}{50} = 1.5$ seconds.\n\nTherefore, the height of the ball is at its maximum at $t = 1.5$ seconds after launch.",
