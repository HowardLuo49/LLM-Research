    "gpt_response": "To find an integer $n$ such that $0\\leq n<398$ and $n$ is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398, we must solve the congruence $7n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$. This is equivalent to finding $n$ such that $7n = 1 + 398k$ for some integer $k$. \n\nTo solve this congruence, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm. Let $a=398$ and $b=7$. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we can find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = \\gcd(a,b)$. In this case, $\\gcd(398,7) = 1$, so we can find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $398x + 7y = 1$.\n\nBy running the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that $x=-53$ and $y=302$ satisfy this equation. Now, multiplying both sides of the equation by 398, we get $398(-53) + 7(302) = 1$. \n\nTherefore, $n = -53$ is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398. Since we are looking for a non-negative integer $n$, we need to find the equivalent non-negative value of $n$ modulo 398. \n\nTo do this, we can add multiples of 398 to -53 until we get a non-negative integer. In this case, adding 3 multiples of 398 to -53 results in $n = 398 - 53 = 345$. \n\nThus, the integer $n=345$ is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398.",
