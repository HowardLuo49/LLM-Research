    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ that is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398, we need to solve the congruence equation $7n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{398}$. This equation is equivalent to finding $n$ such that $7n = 1 + 398k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nBy considering the properties of congruences, we can rewrite the equation as $7n - 398k = 1$. This is a linear Diophantine equation in two variables.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 7 and 398, and express it as a linear combination of 7 and 398. Then the coefficient of 7 in this linear combination will be our desired integer $n$.\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we have:\n$398 = 7 \\cdot 56 + 6$\n$7 = 6 \\cdot 1 + 1$\n$6 = 1 \\cdot 6 + 0$\n\nNow, working backwards, we can express 1 as a linear combination of 7 and 398:\n$1 = 7 - 6$\n$1 = 7 - (398 - 7 \\cdot 56) = 7 \\cdot 57 - 398$\n\nThus, our integer $n$ that is a multiplicative inverse to 7 modulo 398 is 57.
