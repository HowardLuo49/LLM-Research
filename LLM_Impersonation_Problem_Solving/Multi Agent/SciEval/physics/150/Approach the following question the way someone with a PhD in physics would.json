Given that 1 solar mass is approximately 1.989e30 kg, we have M1 = 80 * 1.989e30 kg and M2 = 38 * 1.989e30 kg.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nE = (5/256) * (6.674e-11)^2 / (3e8)^5 * (80 * 1.989e30) * (38 * 1.989e30) * ((80 * 1.989e30) + (38 * 1.989e30))^(5/3) / (3.086e25)^2\n\nCalculating the above expression will give us the minimum energy required for the gravitational wave detector. \n\nThe closest answer choice to the correct answer is: D. 3.39e-31",
