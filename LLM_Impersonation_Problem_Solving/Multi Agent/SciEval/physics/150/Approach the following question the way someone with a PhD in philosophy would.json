Given the masses of the two black holes, we can calculate the total mass of the system (M1 + M2).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms:\nm1 = 80 * (1.989e30)\nm2 = 38 * (1.989e30)\n\nNext, we calculate the total mass of the system:\nM_total = m1 + m2\n\nWe can now substitute the values into the formula to calculate the power emitted. Given that f_GW = 100, the energy carried by the gravitational waves per second is given by:\n\nE = P / f_GW\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula, we get:\n\nE = (32/5) * (G^4 / (c^5)) * ((m1 * m2 * (m1 + m2))^2 / (d)^5) / 100\n\nAfter calculating the expression, we find the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3.39e-31",
