    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational velocity of the Milky Way's galactic disk at a distance of 57069 light-years from the galactic center, we can use the formula for calculating the total velocity of a star in a galaxy, given by:\n\nV_total^2 = V_rot^2 + V_rad^2\n\nWhere V_total is the total velocity, V_rot is the rotational velocity, and V_rad is the radial velocity. We can rearrange this formula to solve for V_rot as follows:\n\nV_rot = sqrt(V_total^2 - V_rad^2)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nV_rot = sqrt((311 km/s)^2 - (256 km/s)^2)\nV_rot = sqrt(96721 km^2/s^2 - 65536 km^2/s^2)\nV_rot = sqrt(31185 km^2/s^2)\nV_rot = 176.54 km/s\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 209.65 km/s",
