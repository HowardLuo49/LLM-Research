    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nRotational period = 2 * \u03c0 * r / v\n\nwhere r is the average radius of the galactic halo and v is the velocity of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the average radius from light-years to meters:\n15866 light-years * 9.461e15 m = 1.499e20 meters\n\nNow we plug in the values into the formula:\nRotational period = 2 * 3.14 * 1.499e20 / 3e8\n\nRotational period = 9.42e19 / 3e8 = 3.14e12 seconds\n\nFinally, we convert the seconds to years:\n3.14e12 seconds * (1 year / 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25 seconds) = 99.53 years\n\nThe closest answer among the options provided is:\nB. 1.36e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1.36e+08 years.",
