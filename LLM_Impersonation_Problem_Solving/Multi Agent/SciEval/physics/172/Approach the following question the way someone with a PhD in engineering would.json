Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius associated with a black hole, beyond which the gravitational pull becomes so strong that not even light can escape. It is calculated using the formula:\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * G * mass / c^2\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 9 solar masses, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius as follows:\n\nMass = 9 * 1.989e30 kg\nMass = 1.7901e31 kg\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 1.7901e31 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2\nSchwarzschild radius = 23,348.85 meters\n\nThe closest option is A. 23022 m.",
