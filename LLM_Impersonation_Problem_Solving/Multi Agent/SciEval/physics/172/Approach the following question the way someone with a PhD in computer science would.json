Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object is compressed within that sphere, the escape velocity from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. It is related to black holes because it defines the boundary known as the event horizon, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\nThe formula for calculating the Schwarzschild radius is: Rs = 2GM / c^2, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 9 solar masses, we can first convert this to kilograms: 9 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass = 1.7901e31 kg.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: Rs = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 1.7901e31 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2 = 26549.15 meters.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nC. 26549 m.",
