    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of the magnetic field in this galaxy, we can use the formula for the magnetic field in a rotating disk, which is given by B = \u221a(2\u03c0G\u03c3), where G is the gravitational constant and \u03c3 is the surface density of the galaxy. Since the galaxy has a radius of 50,000 light-years and a rotational velocity of 337 km/s, we can calculate the surface density \u03c3 as the mass divided by the area of the disk. \n\nNext, we can calculate the magnetic field using the formula and convert the units appropriately. The magnetic field in the rotating galaxy will be influenced by the rotation of the galaxy, resulting in a stronger magnetic field compared to a non-rotating galaxy. \n\nOut of the given choices, the closest answer is B. 4843 T.",
