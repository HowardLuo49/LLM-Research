    "gpt_response": "To calculate the value of the magnetic field in a galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we need to consider the relationship between the rotational velocity of the galaxy and the magnetic field strength. The magnetic field strength (B) in a galaxy can be estimated using the following formula:\n\nB = (v_rot * 1.22 * 10^-10) / R\n\nWhere:\nB = magnetic field strength\nv_rot = rotational velocity of the galaxy (in m/s)\nR = radius of the galaxy (in m)\n\nConverting the given values to the appropriate units:\nv_rot = 337 km/s = 337,000 m/s\nR = 50,000 light-years = 4.73 * 10^20 m\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\nB = (337,000 * 1.22 * 10^-10) / 4.73 * 10^20\nB = 8.72 * 10^-7 T\n\nThus, the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster would be approximately 8.72 * 10^-7 T. \n\nComparing this with a similar non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field in the rotating galaxy would be stronger due to the effects of rotation causing a higher magnetic field strength. Therefore, the magnetic field in the non-rotating galaxy would be weaker than 8.72 * 10^-7 T. \n\nAmong the given choices, the option closest to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4890 T.",
