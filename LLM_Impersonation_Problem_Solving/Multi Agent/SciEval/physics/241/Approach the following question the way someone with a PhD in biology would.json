    "gpt_response": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop carrying a current, we can use the formula for the magnetic field inside a current-carrying loop. The formula is given by B = (\\mu_0 * I) / (2 * r), where B is the magnetic field, \\mu_0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the side length of the square loop is 8.0 m, so the distance from the center to any side of the square loop is half of the side length, which is 4.0 m. Therefore, r = 4.0 m.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get B = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 9) / (2 * 4) = 5.33 x 10^(-7) Tesla.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 5.33 x 10^(-7) Tesla.",
