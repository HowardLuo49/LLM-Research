    "gpt_response": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. This law states that the magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire at a point P is directly proportional to the current, length of the wire, and sine of the angle between the wire and the line connecting the wire to point P.\n\nFor a square loop, we can consider it as four straight wires carrying current. The total magnetic field at the center of the loop is the vector sum of the magnetic fields due to each side of the loop.\n\nGiven that the side length of the square loop is 7.0 m and the current flowing through it is 2 A, we can calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center using the formula:\n\nB = (\u03bc0 * I) / (2 * \u03c0 * r)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, and r is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 2) / (2 * \u03c0 * 3.5) = 1.62 x 10^(-7) Tesla\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer would be:\n\nA. 1.62 x 10^(-7) Tesla",
