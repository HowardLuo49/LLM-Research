What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (2.1solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 8.97e+48 J\nB. 8.15e+48 J\nC. 7.08e+48 J\nD. 3.76e+47 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the equation E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 2.1 solar masses, we first need to convert this into kilograms. 1 solar mass is equal to 1.989e30 kg, so 2.1 solar masses is equal to 2.1 * 1.989e30 kg.\n\nNow, using the equation E=mc^2 and plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = (2.1 * 1.989e30 kg)(3e8 m/s)^2\n\nCalculating this out gives us a value closest to option A: 8.97e+48 J.",
