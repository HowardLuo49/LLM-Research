    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula for the period of an object in circular motion:\n\nT = (2*pi*R) / v\n\nWhere T is the rotational period, R is the radius, and v is the velocity. Given that the average radius is 41149 light-years, we first need to convert this to meters:\n\nR = 41149 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year = 3.8952e20 m\n\nNext, we need to find the velocity. Since the galactic halo does not have a fixed velocity, we will use the velocity of light as an approximation. Thus, v = c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the formula to find the rotational period:\n\nT = (2 * 3.14 * 3.8952e20) / 3e8 = 4.08e12 seconds\n\nFinally, we convert this to years by dividing by the number of seconds in a year (3.154e7 seconds/year):\n\nT = 4.08e12 / 3.154e7 = 1.29e+04 years\n\nNone of the provided answer choices closely match this result.",
