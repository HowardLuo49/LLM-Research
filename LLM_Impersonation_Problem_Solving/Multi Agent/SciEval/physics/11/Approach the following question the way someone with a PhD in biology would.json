    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2\u03c0r/v\n\nWhere T is the period, r is the radius, and v is the velocity of the Milky Way's galactic halo. Given that the radius is 35850 light-years, we need to convert this to meters:\n\n35850 light-years * 9.461e15 m = 3.392e20 m\n\nNow, we need to calculate the velocity of the Milky Way's galactic halo. This can be estimated by using the velocity of light:\n\nv = c\n\nv = 3e8 m/s\n\nNow, plugging these values into the formula:\n\nT = 2 * 3.14 * 3.392e20 / 3e8 = 6.74e17 / 3e8 = 2.247e9 seconds\n\nFinally, converting seconds to years:\n\n2.247e9 seconds * (1 year / 60s * 60m * 24h * 365.25d) \u2248 71.23 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is A. 3.07e+08 years.",
