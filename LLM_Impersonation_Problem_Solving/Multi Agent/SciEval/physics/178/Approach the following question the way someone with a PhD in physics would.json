Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a concept in physics which defines the radius at which the gravitational pull of a black hole becomes so strong that not even light can escape from it. It is the radius where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light, and is given by the formula Rs = 2*G*M/c^2, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 2 solar masses (M = 2 * 1.989e30 kg), and the values of G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 and c = 3e8 m/s, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 2 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\nRs = 93160.8006 m\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is B. 93161 m.",
