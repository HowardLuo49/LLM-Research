    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the wavelength at which the radiation peaks is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula is given by \u03bb_peak * T = constant, where the constant is around 2.898 mm-K.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at around 799.9 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s). This gives us a wavelength of \u03bb_peak = (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (799.9 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.375 m or 375 mm.\n\nNow, by using the formula \u03bb_peak * T = 2.898 mm-K, we can solve for T:\n\n375 mm * T = 2.898 mm-K\nT = 2.898 mm-K / 375 mm\nT = 0.007728 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7.73 K.\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is D. 7.73 K.",
