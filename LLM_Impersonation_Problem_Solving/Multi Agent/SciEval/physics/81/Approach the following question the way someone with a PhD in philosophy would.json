What is the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 74869 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, assuming a circular orbit around the galactic center? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of a star in a circular orbit around the galactic center, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period of a celestial body is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. In this case, the semi-major axis of the star's orbit is the distance of 74869 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, which we will need to convert to meters for the calculation.\n\nGiven that 1 light year is equal to 9.461e15 meters, the distance of 74869 light years is equal to 7.08e17 meters.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the mass of the Milky Way galaxy, which is estimated to be around 1.5 trillion solar masses. So, the mass of the Milky Way galaxy would be 1.5e12 times the solar mass, which is 1.5e12 * 1.989e30 kg.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for orbital period: T = 2 * \u03c0 * sqrt(a^3 / (G * M)), where T is the orbital period, a is the semi-major axis in meters, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nT = 2 * 3.14 * sqrt((7.08e17)^3 / (6.674e-11 * 1.5e12 * 1.989e30))\n\nCalculating this gives a value of approximately 1.35e+09 years.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is B. 1.35e+09 years.",
