What is the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 38040 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, assuming a circular orbit around the galactic center? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 4.90e+08 years\nB. 9.1e+08 years\nC. 2.67e+08 years\nD. 8.78e+08 years\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of the star, we can use Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. \n\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\n\nT^2 = (4\u03c0^2 / GM) * r^3\n\nwhere:\nT = orbital period\nG = gravitation constant\nM = mass of the Milky Way galaxy\nr = distance of the star from the center of the Milky Way\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mass of the Milky Way galaxy. The mass of the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to be around 1.5 trillion solar masses. We can convert this to kilograms:\n\nMass of Milky Way = 1.5 trillion * 1.989e30 kg\n\nNext, we convert the distance of 38040 light years to meters:\n\nr = 38040 light years * 9.461e15 m/light year\n\nNow we can plug in the values and solve for the orbital period:\n\nT^2 = (4 * \u03c0^2 / G * (Mass of Milky Way)) * r^3\n\nSolving this equation will give us the orbital period in seconds.
