    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is \u03bb_max = b / T, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 431.2 GHz, we can use the relation between frequency, wavelength, and speed of light (c = f\u03bb) to convert the frequency to wavelength. First, we convert the frequency to wavelength in meters:\n\nf = 431.2 x 10^9 Hz\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s\n\u03bb = c / f = 3 x 10^8 / 431.2 x 10^9 = 6.9551 x 10^-4 m\n\nNow that we have the peak wavelength in meters, we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\n\u03bb_max = 6.9551 x 10^-4 m\nb = 2.8977729 x 10^-3 m K\n\u03bb_max = b / T\nT = b / \u03bb_max = 2.8977729 x 10^-3 / 6.9551 x 10^-4 = 4.17 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 4.17 K.
