    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = (c / f_peak)\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength,\nc is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s),\nf_peak is the frequency of the radiation peak (431.2 GHz).\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n\n\u03bb_peak = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (431.2 x 10^9 Hz)\n\u03bb_peak = 6.95 x 10^-4 m or 695 nm\n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature at which the cosmic microwave background radiation peaks:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_peak\n\nWhere:\nT is the temperature,\nb is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 K * m).\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 K * m) / (6.95 x 10^-4 m)\nT = 4.17 K\n\nSo, the correct answer is: C. 4.17 k",
