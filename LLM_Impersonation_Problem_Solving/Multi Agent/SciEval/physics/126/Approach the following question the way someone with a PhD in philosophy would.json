The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = b\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength of the peak radiation, T is the temperature of the object, and b is Wien's displacement constant, which is approximately equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 m * K. \n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 431.2 GHz, we can use the relation between frequency and wavelength for electromagnetic radiation:\n\nc = f * \u03bb\n\nwhere c is the speed of light, f is the frequency, and \u03bb is the wavelength.
