    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) is the residual radiation from the Big Bang and has cooled over time due to the expansion of the universe. The relationship between the temperature of the CMB at different times can be described by the equation T(z) = T(0) * (1+z), where T(z) is the temperature of the CMB at a redshift z, T(0) is the present-day temperature of the CMB, and z is the redshift.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the CMB is approximately 6.9 Kelvin and the age of the universe at a redshift of 380,000 years after the Big Bang is equivalent to a redshift of about z=1100, we can calculate the temperature at this time using the formula above:\n\nT(1100) = 6.9 * (1+1100) = 6.9 * 1101 = 7596.9 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 7596.9 Kelvin",
