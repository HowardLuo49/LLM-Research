Redshift is the phenomenon where the expansion of the universe causes light waves to stretch out, leading to a decrease in frequency and an increase in wavelength. This can be related to the temperature of the universe at different points in time.\n\nThe formula to relate the temperature at two different times is T_final = T_initial / (1 + z), where T_final is the final temperature, T_initial is the initial temperature, and z is the redshift.\n\nGiven that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a present-day temperature of 6.9 Kelvin, we can set T_initial = 6.9 Kelvin, and T_final = ? Kelvin at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nThe redshift can be calculated using the formula z = (t_final - t_initial) / t_initial, where t_final = 380,000 years and t_initial = 13.8 billion years (age of the universe at present).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (380,000 years / 13.8 billion years) = 2.75 x 10^-5\n\nNow, using the original formula:\n\nT_final = 6.9 Kelvin / (1 + 2.75 x 10^-5)\nT_final = 6.9 Kelvin / 1.0000275 = 6.899765 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang would be approximately 6.9 Kelvin.\n\nThe closest option from the given choices is:\n\nA. 1232.9 Kelvin",
