    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, we can use the rigidity of the proton, which is defined as momentum per unit charge.

Therefore, the new maximum energy will also increase by a factor of 10.\n\nTherefore, the new maximum energy with the increased diffusion coefficient will be approximately 9.57e+15 eV, which is not a provided option.
