What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 5.8 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 97 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 4.6e+48 J\nB. 7.87e+48 J\nC. 1.63e+49 J\nD. 6.3e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the remnant and v is the velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses from solar masses to kg:\nInitial mass = 97 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass = 1.93e32 kg\nRemnant mass = 5.8 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass = 1.15362e32 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy released:\nKE = 0.5 * 1.15362e32 kg * (10000 km/s)^2 = 5.7681e42 J\n\nSince the kinetic energy is a small fraction of the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can estimate the total energy to be around 10 times the kinetic energy:\nTotal energy ~ 10 * 5.7681e42 J = 5.7681e43 J\n\nFrom the given options, the closest answer is A. 4.6e+48 J.",
