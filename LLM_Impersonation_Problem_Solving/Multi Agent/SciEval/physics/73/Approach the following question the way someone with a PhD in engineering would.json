What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 5.8 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 97 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 4.6e+48 J\nB. 7.87e+48 J\nC. 1.63e+49 J\nD. 6.3e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",
