    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 6 e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the absorption coefficient of the human body to cosmic rays. The absorption coefficient depends on the energy of the cosmic ray and the density of the material.\n\nGiven the energy of the cosmic ray is 6 e+18 eV, we can convert this to joules (1 eV = 1.60218 x 10^-19 J) to get 9.62 x 10^-1 J. The absorption coefficient for cosmic rays passing through the body is approximately 1/m. Therefore, the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the body is 1/A, where A is the absorption area, which is 0.1 m^2. So, the probability is 1/0.1 = 10.\n\nNow, let's calculate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body. The absorbed dose (D) is given by D = E * P, where E is the energy of the cosmic ray (9.62 x 10^-1 J) and P is the probability of passing through the body (10). Therefore, D = 9.62 x 10^-1 * 10 = 9.62 Gy.\n\nComparing this with the given options, the closest answer is:\n\nA. 8.65e-13 Gy\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 8.65e-13 Gy.",
