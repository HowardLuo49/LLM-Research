What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (7.7solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 4.67e+48 J\nB. 1.38e+48 J\nC. 7.82e+48 J\nD. 5.74e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2.\n\nGiven the mass of the white dwarf star is 7.7 solar masses, we can convert this to kilograms by multiplying by the mass of the sun:\n7.7 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg = 1.52853e31 kg.\n\nSince the entire mass is converted into energy, we can assume all of it contributes to the explosion. Therefore, the mass used in the formula is 1.52853e31 kg.\n\nNow, for a type Ia supernova explosion, the typical velocity of the ejected material is about 10,000 km/s (1e7 m/s).\n\nPlugging in the values into the formula:\nKE = 0.5 * 1.52853e31 kg * (1e7 m/s)^2 = 7.64265e46 J = 7.64e+46 J.\n\nGiven the closest option from the choices provided, the most appropriate answer is:\nD. 5.74e+48 J",
