What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 1.7 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 106 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 8.19e+48 J\nB. 1.87e+49 J\nC. 5.13e+48 J\nD. 8.41e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for kinetic energy: E = 0.5 * m * v^2. \n\nFirst, we convert the initial and final masses from solar masses to kg: \nInitial mass = 106 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg = 2.10734e32 kg \nFinal mass = 1.7 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg = 3.3813e30 kg \n\nNext, we calculate the change in mass: \nChange in mass = Initial mass - Final mass = 2.10734e32 kg - 3.3813e30 kg = 1.76952e32 kg \n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy released using the equation for kinetic energy: \nE = 0.5 * 1.76952e32 kg * (1e4 m/s)^2 = 8.8476e41 J \n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is A. 8.19e+48 J.",
