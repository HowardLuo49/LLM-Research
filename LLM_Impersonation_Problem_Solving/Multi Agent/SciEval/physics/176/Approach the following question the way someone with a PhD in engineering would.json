    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius, denoted by Rs, is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole, as defined by the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity. It represents the radius at which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, and thus marks the event horizon of a black hole.\n\nThe formula for the Schwarzschild radius is given by Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 8 solar masses, we can substitute the known values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * G * (8 * 1.989e30 kg) / c^2\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * (8 * 1.989e30 kg) / (3e8 m/s)^2\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 15.912e30 / 9e16 = 2 * 100.93 / 9 = 22.43\n\nTherefore, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses is approximately 22.43 meters.\n\nThe closest option among the given choices is:\nB. 23599 m",
