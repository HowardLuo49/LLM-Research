Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. It is defined as Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 8 solar masses, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius as follows:\nM = 8 * (1.989e30 kg) = 15.912e30 kg\nRs = 2 * (6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2) * (15.912e30 kg) / (3e8 m/s)^2\nRs = 2 * 10.602e19 / 9e16\nRs = 2.356 m\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 23599 m.",
