    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula:\n\nf = 1 / (2\u03c0) * (G * (m1 + m2) / c^3)^(3/2) * (m1 * m2 / (m1 + m2)) * 1 / P\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes, G is the gravitational constant, c is the velocity of light, and P is the orbital period.\n\nGiven masses of 38 and 71 times the mass of the sun, the total mass (m1 + m2) = 109 times the mass of the sun.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nf = 1 / (2\u03c0) * (6.674e-11 * 1.989e30 * 109 / (3e8)^3)^(3/2) * (38 * 71 / 109) * 1 / 92\n\nCalculating this value gives f = 2.73e-4 Hz or 2.73e-15 kHz.\n\nThe amplitude of gravitational waves when they reach Earth can be calculated from the formula:\n\nh = (4G / c^4) * (m1 * m2 / r) * (2\u03c0f)^2\n\nwhere r is the distance between the black holes and Earth.
