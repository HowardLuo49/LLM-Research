What is the distance that a star must be from a black hole of 9 solar masses in order to orbit the black hole with a period of 1 day? How does the accretion disk around the black hole affect the star's orbit? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : \\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

The presence of the accretion disk can introduce additional gravitational interactions that may cause the star's orbit to precess or change in shape over time. The star may also experience tidal forces from the accretion disk, which can further influence its orbit.",
