    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational velocity of the Milky Way's galactic disk at a distance of 49757 light-years from the galactic center, we can use the equation for the velocity of a star in a galaxy due to rotation:\n\nV_rot = V_rad / sin(theta)\n\nWhere V_rot is the rotational velocity of the galactic disk, V_rad is the observed radial velocity of the star (250 km/s in this case), and theta is the angle between the line of sight from the galactic center to the star and the line perpendicular to the direction of rotation. At a distance of 49757 light-years from the galactic center, we can assume theta is very close to 90 degrees.\n\nTherefore, V_rot = 250 km/s / sin(90) = 250 km/s.\n\nSince the average rotational velocity of the galactic disk at that distance is given to be 323 km/s, we can calculate the difference between the observed rotational velocity and the average rotational velocity:\n\n323 km/s - 250 km/s = 73 km/s.\n\nSo, the answer closest to the correct value is:\n\nB. 201.15 km/s.",
