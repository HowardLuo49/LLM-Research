    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the universe expanding and cooling over time. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is a key indicator of this cooling process.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1.9 Kelvin, we can estimate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang by considering the redshift factor. This factor accounts for the expansion of the universe and the stretching of light waves, leading to a decrease in temperature.\n\nUsing the formula for redshift, we find that the approximate temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang would be around 1243.2 Kelvin. Therefore, the answer closest to the correct estimate is:\n\nC. 1243.2 kelvin.",
