    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary system, we use the formula derived from General Relativity theory:\n\nf = 1/(2\u03c0) * (G * (M1 + M2) ) / c^3 * (M1 * M2) / (M1 + M2)^(3/2)\n\nSubstitute the given values:\nM1 = 47 * 1.989e30 kg = 93.523e30 kg\nM2 = 90 * 1.989e30 kg = 179.01e30 kg\n\nf = 1/(2\u03c0) * (6.674e-11) * (93.523e30 + 179.01e30) / (3e8)^3 * (93.523e30 * 179.01e30) / (93.523e30 + 179.01e30)^(3/2)\n\nCalculating this gives us f \u2248 9.75e-15 Hz.\n\nNext, to find the amplitude of the waves when they reach Earth, we use the formula:\n\nh = (4/5) * (G^(5/3) / (c^4)) * (\u03c0^(2/3) / d) * (M1 * M2 / (M1 + M2))^(2/3) * (f)^(2/3)\n\nwhere d is the distance from the source to the Earth.
