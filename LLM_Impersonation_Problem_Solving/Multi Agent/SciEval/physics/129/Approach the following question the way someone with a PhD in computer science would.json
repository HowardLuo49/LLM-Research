    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength at which the radiation peaks is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula is as follows: \n\n\u03bbmax = b / T \n\nWhere \u03bbmax is the wavelength at which the radiation peaks, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.897 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 771.2 GHz, we can first convert this to wavelength using the formula: \n\nc = \u03bb * f \n\nWhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency.\n\n\u03bb = c / f \n\u03bb = 3 x 10^8 m/s / 771.2 x 10^9 Hz \n\u03bb = 3.89 x 10^-4 m \n\nNow we can calculate the temperature using Wien's displacement law: \n\nT = b / \u03bbmax \nT = 2.897 x 10^-3 m*K / 3.89 x 10^-4 m \nT = 7.45 K \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 7.45 K",
