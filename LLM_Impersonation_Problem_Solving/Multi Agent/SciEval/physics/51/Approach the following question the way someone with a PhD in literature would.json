    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to use the concept of cosmic cooling due to the expansion of the universe. The temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe, which is given by the formula: T(t) = T0 * (1 + z), where T(t) is the temperature at time t, T0 is the present-day temperature, and z is the redshift factor. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the redshift factor using the formula: a(t) = 1 / (1 + z), where a(t) is the scale factor at time t. From the given age, t = 380,000 years, we can use the relation between time and scale factor: t = 2 / (3 * H0 * sqrt(\u03a9m)) * (1 - a^-3/2), where H0 is the Hubble constant, \u03a9m is the matter density parameter, and a is the scale factor. \n\nAfter solving for a, we can calculate the redshift factor z = 1/a - 1. \n\nFinally, we can substitute the redshift factor into the formula T(t) = T0 * (1 + z) to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years.\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer based on this calculation is:\n\nC. 8831.4 kelvin.",
