    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift of cosmic microwave background radiation. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation has decreased over time due to the expansion of the universe. We can use the formula T' = T/(1+z) to calculate the temperature at a given age, where T' is the temperature at the given age, T is the present-day temperature, and z is the redshift factor.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 4.9 Kelvin, and the age we are interested in is 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to calculate the redshift factor. The redshift factor is given by z = (1 + z) = (T/T') - 1. Plugging in the values, we get z = (4.9/T') - 1.\n\nNow we can solve for T' by rearranging the formula to T' = 4.9/(1+z). Plugging in the calculated redshift factor, we get T' = 4.9/(1 + (4.9/T') - 1). Solving for T' gives us T' = 4.9/9.9 \u2248 0.4949 Kelvin.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is A. 5394.9 Kelvin.",
