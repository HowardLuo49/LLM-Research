    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law for a black body spectrum. \n\nWien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bbmax = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bbmax is the peak wavelength, b is a constant, and T is the temperature. \n\nSince the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum, we can use this law to find the temperature of the universe at that time.\n\nWe know that the peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation corresponds to the temperature T0 of 2.73 k. \n\nTherefore, for the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can set up the equation:\n\n\u03bbmax = (T0 / T1) = b / T1\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\nT1 = T0 / (\u03bbmax)\n\nGiven that T0 = 2.73 k, we need to find the value of \u03bbmax. The peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1.06 mm (0.00106 m). \n\nTherefore, plug in the values:\nT1 = 2.73 k / (0.00106 m) = 2571.70 k\n\nThe closest option to 2571.70 k is option B, 3000.0 k. So, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3000.0 k",
