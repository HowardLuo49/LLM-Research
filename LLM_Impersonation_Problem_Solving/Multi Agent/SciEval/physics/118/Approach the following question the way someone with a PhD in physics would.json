Let's assume the typical human body has a cross-sectional area of 0.1 m^2.\n\nThe probability of interaction for the cosmic ray can be calculated using the formula:\nP = 1 - exp(-n * A), where n is the number density of the target (approximated to 10^29 m^(-3) for a human body) and A is the absorption area.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nP = 1 - exp(-10^29 * 0.1) \u2248 1\n\nTherefore, the probability of the cosmic ray passing through a typical human body is very close to 1.\n\nNext, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to calculate the absorbed dose.
