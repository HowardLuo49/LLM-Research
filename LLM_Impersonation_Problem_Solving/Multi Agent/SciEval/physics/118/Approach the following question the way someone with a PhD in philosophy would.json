    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 9e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, several factors need to be considered. These factors include the energy of the cosmic ray, the absorption area of the body, and the interaction cross-section of the body.\n\nFirstly, we need to convert the energy of the cosmic ray from electronvolts to joules: 9e+18 eV = 1.44e-9 J.\n\nNext, we calculate the interaction cross-section of the body using the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2. Let's assume the interaction cross-section is approximately equal to the absorption area for simplicity: \u03c3 = A = 0.1 m^2.\n\nThe probability, P, of the cosmic ray passing through the body can be calculated using the formula P = e^(-\u03c3d), where d is the thickness of the body. Since we are dealing with a typical human body, we can estimate the thickness to be around 0.2 m.\n\nP = e^(-0.1*0.2) \u2248 0.8187\n\nThus, the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 9e+18 eV passing through a typical human body is approximately 0.8187.\n\nNow, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we use the absorbed dose formula: D = E * M / m, where E is the energy of the cosmic ray, M is the mass stopping power of the material, and m is the density of the material.\n\nThe absorbed dose can be calculated as D = 1.44e-9 J * M / m. Since we don't have the specific values for M and m, we can estimate the absorbed dose to be in the order of 1e-13 Gy.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is A. 3.20e-13 Gy.",
