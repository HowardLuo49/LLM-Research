    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray with energy 9 e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the interaction cross section. The cross section for cosmic ray interactions with human tissue is on the order of 10^-30 m^2. Using the absorption area of 0.1 m^2, we can calculate the probability P of interaction as P = absorption area / cross section = 0.1 m^2 / (10^-30 m^2) = 10^-29.\n\nNow, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to consider the absorbed dose (D) given by D = energy of the cosmic ray / absorption mass. The absorption mass can be estimated as roughly 10 kg, the typical mass of a human body. Therefore, D = 9 e+18 eV / 10 kg = 9 e+17 eV/kg.\n\nConverting this to the SI unit of Gray (Gy), we get 9 e+17 eV/kg * 1.602 e-13 J/eV * 1 Gy/J/kg = 1.44318 e+5 Gy.\n\nNow, considering the probability of interaction, the effective dose received by the body can be estimated as the product of absorbed dose and probability. Therefore, effective dose = 1.44318 e+5 Gy * 10^-29 = 1.44318 e-24 Gy.\n\nComparing this to the given options, option A of 3.20e-13 Gy is the closest to the calculated effective dose.",
