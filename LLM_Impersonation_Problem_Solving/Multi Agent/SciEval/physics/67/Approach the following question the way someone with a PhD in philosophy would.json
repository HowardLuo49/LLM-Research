What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (2.5solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 4.48e+47 J\nB. 9.68e+48 J\nC. 5.19e+48 J\nD. 5.8e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a Type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the equation E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 2.5 solar masses, we first need to convert this into kilograms. Since 1 solar mass = 1.989e30 kg, the mass of the white dwarf star is 2.5 x 1.989e30 kg = 4.9725e30 kg.\n\nNext, we can calculate the energy released by multiplying the mass by the speed of light squared:\nE = 4.9725e30 kg x (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 4.9725e30 kg x 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 4.47525e47 J\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nA. 4.48e+47 J",
