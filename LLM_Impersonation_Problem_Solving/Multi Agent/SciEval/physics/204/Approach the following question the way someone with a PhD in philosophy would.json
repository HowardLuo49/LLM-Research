    "gpt_response": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a distance of 2 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 8 A, we can use the Biot-Savart law. \n\nThe formula for the magnetic field strength B at a distance r from an infinitely small current element Idl is given by B = (\\mu_0 * Idl * sin(theta))/(4 * pi * r^2), where theta is the angle between the current element and the radially outward vector from the wire.\n\nSince the current flows perpendicular to the wire in this case, theta is 90 degrees, and sin(90) = 1. Therefore, we can simplify the formula to B = (\\mu_0 * Idl)/(4 * pi * r^2).\n\nNow, we can consider the wire as a collection of current elements and integrate to find the total magnetic field strength at the given distance. However, since the wire is straight and carries a current perpendicular to it, the direction of the magnetic field will be constant around the wire. Therefore, the integration simplifies to a multiplication.\n\nGiven that the wire has a length of 8 cm and a current of 8 A, the total current in the wire is 8 A. The total length of the wire is 0.08 m. Therefore, the current element Idl = 8 A * 0.08 m = 0.64 A*m.\n\nPlugging in the values of \\mu_0 = 1.26 * 10^(-6) V\u00b7s/(A\u00b7m) and r = 0.02 m into the equation B = (\\mu_0 * Idl)/(4 * pi * r^2), we get B = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 0.64)/(4 * pi * (0.02)^2) = 64.57 x 10^(-6) Tesla.\n\nTherefore, the option closest to the correct answer is B.",
