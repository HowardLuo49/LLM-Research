Since the loop is rectangular, we can consider it as two semi-circles of radius r. Therefore, the radius r is half the length of one of the sides of the rectangle, so r = 4.0 m / 2 = 2.0 m.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) V\u00b7s/(A\u00b7m) * 9 A) / (2 * 2.0 m)\nB = (1.134 * 10^(-5)) / 4\nB = 2.835 * 10^(-6) T\n\nNow, looking at the options provided, the closest answer is:\n\nA. 99.67 x 10^(-7) Tesla\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the loop is closest to 99.67 x 10^(-7) Tesla.",
