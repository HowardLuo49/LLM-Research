    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system. The formula for the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by binary systems is f = (c^3 / G) * (M1 + M2) / (pi * (M1 * M2)^(3/2)), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes.\n\nPlugging in the values for M1 = 19 solar masses = 19 * 1.989e30 kg and M2 = 34 solar masses = 34 * 1.989e30 kg, we get f = (3e8)^3 / (6.674e-11) * (19 + 34) / (3.14 * (19 * 34)^(3/2)) = 3.75e-15 Hz.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth. The formula for the amplitude of gravitational waves is h ~ (G / (r * c^4)) * (M1 * M2) / R, where r is the distance between the binary system and Earth, and R is the distance between the binary system and the coordinate origin.\n\nAssuming r = 1 light year = 9.461e15 m and R = 1e22 m, we get h ~ (6.674e-11 / (9.461e15 * (3e8)^4)) * (19 * 34) / 1e22 = 6.46e-16.\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the black holes is 3.75e-15 Hz and the amplitude when they reach Earth is 6.46e-16. \n\nIn order to detect these waves, scientists use gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) that are capable of measuring very small changes in the lengths of their arms caused by passing gravitational waves. The implications of detecting gravitational waves include verifying Einstein's theory of general relativity, providing insights into the nature of black holes and other astrophysical phenomena, and opening up a new field of astronomy using gravitational waves as a tool to study the universe.",
