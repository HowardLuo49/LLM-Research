    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = c / f_max\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and f_max is the frequency of the radiation peak (975.5 GHz = 975.5 x 10^9 Hz).\n\nWe know that the peak frequency of the radiation is 975.5 GHz, so we can calculate the peak wavelength by substituting the values into the formula:\n\n\u03bb_max = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (975.5 x 10^9 Hz)\n\u03bb_max = 307.4 x 10^-3 m\n\u03bb_max = 0.3074 mm or 0.0003074 m\n\nNow, using Wien's displacement law, we can calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation using the peak wavelength:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\nwhere b is Wien's constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSubstitute the values to find T:\n\n0.0003074 m = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / T\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / 0.0003074 m\nT = 9.42 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 9.42 Kelvin. The closest option from the given choices is C. 9.42 K.",
