In this case, the loop is rectangular which we can treat as a circle with radius r = sqrt(4^2 + 7^2)/2 = 2.71 m. Therefore, R = 2.71 m. Additionally, since there is only 1 turn in the loop, N = 1. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nB = \\frac{1.26 * 10^(-6) * 5 * 1}{2 * 2.71} = 4.18 * 10^(-7) Tesla\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is A. 4.18 x 10^(-7) Tesla.",
