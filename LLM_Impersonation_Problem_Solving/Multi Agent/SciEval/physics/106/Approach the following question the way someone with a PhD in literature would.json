    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is as follows:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T \n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_max = peak wavelength\nb = Wien's displacement constant (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m K)\nT = temperature\n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at that time, we can assume that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum. The peak wavelength for the cosmic microwave background radiation can be calculated using the formula above. The peak wavelength for the cosmic microwave background radiation corresponds to a temperature of 2.73 K (T0).\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the following formula:\n\nT = T0 / (380,000 years / 13.8 billion years)^(1/2)\n\nT = 2.73 K / (380,000 / (13.8 x 10^9))^(1/2)\nT = 2.73 K / (2.75362319 x 10^-5)^(1/2)\nT = 2.73 K / 0.00525\nT \u2248 520.0 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 6121.88 K",
