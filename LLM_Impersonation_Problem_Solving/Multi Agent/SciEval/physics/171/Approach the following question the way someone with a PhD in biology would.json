Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a concept in physics that defines the size of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. It is the radius at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\nThe formula to calculate the Schwarzschild radius is: Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 8 solar masses, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius as follows:\n\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 8 * 1.989e30 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 8 * 1.989e30 / 9e16\nRs = 21.344e19 / 9e16\nRs = 2.3715556e3 m\nRs \u2248 23599 m\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given choices is A. 23599 m.",
