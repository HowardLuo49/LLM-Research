What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 97 and 30 times the mass of the sun, orbiting each other in a binary system with an orbital period of 44 seconds? What would be the amplitude of these waves when they reach Earth? Lastly, how could we detect these waves and what are the implications of detecting them?

Plugging in the values:\n\nM1 = 97 * solar mass = 97 * 1.989e30 kg,\nM2 = 30 * solar mass = 30 * 1.989e30 kg,\nG = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2,\nc = 3e8 m/s,\nT = 44 s.\n\nCalculating, we get:\n\nf = 1 / (2\u03c0) * (6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * (97 * 1.989e30 kg + 30 * 1.989e30 kg) / (3e8 m/s)^3)^(3/2) * (1 / 44 s) = 3.71e-15 Hz.\n\nTo find the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we would need additional information about the distance from the black hole binary to Earth and the specific properties of the gravitational waves.

Detecting gravitational waves has implications for confirming predictions of general relativity, studying extreme astrophysical events, and opening up a new era of astronomy.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the black hole binary is:\n\nB. 3.71e-15",
