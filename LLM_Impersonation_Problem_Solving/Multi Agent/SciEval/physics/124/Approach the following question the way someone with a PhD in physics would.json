    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength of maximum emission of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.898 \u00d7 10^6 / T \n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength of maximum emission in meters and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 394.7 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f \n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency (394.7 \u00d7 10^9 Hz).\n\nCalculating the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency:\n\n\u03bb = 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 / 394.7 \u00d7 10^9 \u2248 7.60 \u00d7 10^-4 meters\n\nNow we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature T:\n\nT = 2.898 \u00d7 10^6 / 7.60 \u00d7 10^-4 \u2248 3.81 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3.81 K",
