    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 63 and 33 times the mass of the sun orbiting each other, we can use the formula for the gravitational wave frequency emitted by a binary system:\n\nf = (f_0 / (1+z)) * ((M_c / M_sun))^(5/8)\n\nwhere f_0 is the orbital frequency of the black holes, z is the redshift, M_c is the chirp mass given by M_c = (M_1 * M_2)^(3/5) / (M_1 + M_2)^(1/5), and M_1 and M_2 are the masses of the two black holes.\n\nGiven M_1 = 63 * M_sun and M_2 = 33 * M_sun, the chirp mass M_c can be calculated using the formula above. With the orbital period T = 92 seconds and the total mass M = M_1 + M_2, we can calculate the orbital frequency f_0 = 1 / T. Substituting these values into the formula, we can calculate the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the binary system.\n\nTo calculate the amplitude of these waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula for the amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system:\n\nh = (4 * M_c * (f * M_sun * pi * G / c^3)^(2/3)) / D\n\nwhere D is the distance from the binary system to Earth.\n\nAssuming the distance D is the same as the distance to the nearest black hole binary system, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth.\n\nTo detect these waves, we can use interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and Virgo. The detection of gravitational waves can provide valuable information about the merging black holes, their masses, spins, and distances, as well as allow us to test Einstein's theory of general relativity in extreme conditions. Additionally, the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers can help us better understand the formation and evolution of black holes in the universe.",
