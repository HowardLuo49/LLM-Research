    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of redshifting. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases as the universe expands, following the relationship T_final = T_initial / (1 + z), where T_final is the final temperature, T_initial is the initial temperature (present-day temperature in this case), and z is the redshift factor.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7.8 Kelvin, we can calculate the redshift factor at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula z = (T_initial / T_final) - 1. Plugging in the values, we get z = (7.8 / T_final) - 1 = (7.8 / T_final) - 1 = (7.8 / T_final) = 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nThen we can solve for T_final: T_final = 7.8 / (1 + z) = 7.8 / (1 + 380,000) = 7.8 / 380,000. \n\nAfter performing the calculation, we get T_final = 0.000020526 Kelvin, however, it is clear that this is wrong as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation should still be in the Kelvin range at this point. This is a very rough estimation, and in reality, the temperature at 380,000 years is slightly above 2500 Kelvin. Given the available options, C. 7305.2 Kelvin seems to be the closest answer despite the oversimplification in calculations.",
