    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift of cosmic microwave background radiation. The relationship between redshift (z) and temperature (T) is given by T = T0 / (1 + z), where T0 is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and z is the redshift.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature is approximately 7.8 Kelvin, we can calculate the redshift at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula t = (1 + z)^-3/2. The specific calculation involves solving for (1+z), and then plugging this redshift value into the formula for temperature to find the temperature at that specific age.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find that the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 7305.2 Kelvin.",
