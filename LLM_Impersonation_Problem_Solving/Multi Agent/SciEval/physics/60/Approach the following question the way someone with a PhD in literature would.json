    "gpt_response": "The temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated using the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as it scales with the expansion of the universe. This formula is given by T_final = T_initial / a, where T_final is the final temperature, T_initial is the present-day temperature (7.8 Kelvin), and a is the scale factor of the universe at the given time.\n\nThe scale factor a can be calculated as a = (time after Big Bang / present age of the universe)^(2/3). Given that the present age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years, and the age in question is 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can calculate the scale factor a. \n\nUsing the formula a = (380,000 / 13.8 billion)^(2/3) = 0.000171, we can then calculate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang as T_final = 7.8 Kelvin / 0.000171 = 45,614.04 Kelvin.\n\nThe option closest to the correct answer is D. 9168.1 Kelvin.",
