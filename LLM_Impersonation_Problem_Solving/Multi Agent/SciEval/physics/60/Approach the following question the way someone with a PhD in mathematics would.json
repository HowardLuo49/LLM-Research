    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as it scales with the age of the universe:\n\nT = T0 * (1 + z), \n\nwhere T is the temperature of the universe at the given age, T0 is the present-day temperature (7.8 Kelvin), and z is the redshift factor. The redshift factor z can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = (1 + 380000 / 13.8 billion),\n\nwhere 13.8 billion years is the estimated age of the universe. \n\nBy plugging in the values, we get:\n\n1 + z = (1 + 0.0275) = 1.0275,\nz = 0.0275.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the temperature T at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\n\nT = 7.8 * (1 + 0.0275) = 7.8 * 1.0275 = 8.0055 Kelvin.\n\nAmong the given choices, the closest answer is option C: 7305.2 Kelvin.",
