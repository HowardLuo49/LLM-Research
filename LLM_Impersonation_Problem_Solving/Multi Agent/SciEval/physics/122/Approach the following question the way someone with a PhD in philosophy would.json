    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the wavelength of the peak intensity of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody.\n\nThe formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = b, where b is a constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K)\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 906.6 GHz (9.066 x 10^11 Hz), we can use the relation between frequency and wavelength:\n\nc = \u03bb * f, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nRearranging for wavelength, we get:\n\n\u03bb = c / f = 3 x 10^8 / 9.066 x 10^11 = 3.31 x 10^-4 m = 0.331 mm.\n\nNow, we can plug this into Wien's displacement law:\n\n0.331 mm * T = 2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K\n\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 / 0.331 x 10^-3 = 8.76 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 8.76 K.\n\nAmong the given options, the closest answer is:\n\nD. 8.76 K.",
