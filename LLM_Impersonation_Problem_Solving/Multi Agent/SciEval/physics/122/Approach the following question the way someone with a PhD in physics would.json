    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which relates the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum to its temperature.\n\nThe frequency of the radiation peaks at approximately 906.6 GHz. We can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / f_peak\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_peak = peak wavelength of radiation\nc = speed of light in vacuum = 3 x 10^8 m/s\nf_peak = peak frequency of radiation\n\n\u03bb_peak = (3 x 10^8) / (906.6 x 10^9) = 3.31 x 10^-4 m\n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = constant\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT = constant / \u03bb_peak\n\nThe constant in this case is approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m * K. Plugging in the values:\n\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3) / (3.31 x 10^-4) = 8.75 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 8.75 K.
