What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (5.4solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 2.0e+48 J\nB. 1.89e+48 J\nC. 9.68e+48 J\nD. 9.67e+47 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy:\n\nKE = (1/2)mv^2\n\nWhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is the velocity of the object.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 5.4 solar masses, we can convert this to kilograms:\n\n5.4 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass = 1.07226e31 kg\n\nSince the entire mass is converted into energy in the supernova explosion, we can use the conversion of mass to energy formula:\n\nE = mc^2\n\nWhere E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the velocity of light. Substituting in the values:\n\nE = 1.07226e31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.65034e46 J\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy released in the type Ia supernova explosion would be approximately 9.65e+46 J, which is closest to option D.",
