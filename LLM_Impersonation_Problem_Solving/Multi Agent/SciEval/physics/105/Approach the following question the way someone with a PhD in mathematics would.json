    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which relates the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum to its temperature.\n\nThe peak wavelength, \u03bb_max = 2.9 mm K / T. Given that the temperature at present, T0 = 2.73 K, we can write the equation for the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang as:\n\n\u03bb_max(t) = \u03bb_max(0) * (1 + t/t0) = 2.9 mm K / T(t)\nT(t) = 2.9 mm K / \u03bb_max(t)\nT(380,000 years) = 2.9 mm K / \u03bb_max(380,000 years)\n\nNow, at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the scale factor of the universe was a = 1/1100, so the temperature would be 1100 times greater than the current temperature:\n\nT(380,000 years) = 1100 * T0 = 1100 * 2.73 K = 3003 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices would be:\n\nC. 3000.0 K.",
