    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. \n\nSince the CMB radiation has a black body spectrum, the peak wavelength corresponds to the temperature of the universe at that time. The peak wavelength of the CMB radiation is approximately 1.06 mm.\n\nUsing Wien's displacement law: \u03bb_peak = b / T \n\nWhere b is Wien's displacement constant, equal to 2.8977729 x 10^-3 m*K\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for temperature:\nT = b / \u03bb_peak\n\nConvert the wavelength from mm to meters:\n\u03bb_peak = 1.06 x 10^-3 m\n\nPlug in the values:\nT = 2.8977729 x 10^-3 m*K / 1.06 x 10^-3 m\nT \u2248 2.73 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.73 K, which is closest to option C.",
