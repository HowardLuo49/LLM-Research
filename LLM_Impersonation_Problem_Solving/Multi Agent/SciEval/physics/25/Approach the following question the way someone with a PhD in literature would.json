Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nThe formula for Kepler's third law is:\n\nT^2 = (4\u03c0^2 / G(M1 + M2)) * a^3\n\nWhere:\nT = orbital period = 8 days = 691200 seconds\nG = gravitational constant = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2\nM1 = mass of the star = unknown\nM2 = mass of the black hole = 7 solar masses = 7 * 1.989e30 kg\na = semi-major axis of the orbit = distance from the star to the black hole\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula and solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n\na = cuberoot((G * (M1 + M2) * T^2) / (4\u03c0^2))\n\na = (6.674e-11 * (M1 + 7 * 1.989e30) * 691200^2) / (4 * \u03c0^2)^(1/3)\na = (6.674e-11 * (M1 + 13.923e30) * 478157107200) / (4 * 9.8696)^(1/3)\na = (3.5302448e19 * (M1 + 13.923e30)) / 1.598569\na = 0.55438025e12 * (M1 + 13.923e30)\na = 0.55438025e12 * M1 + 7.71773e42\n\nTo take into account the effect of the accretion disk around the black hole on the star's orbit, we must consider the possibility of mass transfer from the disk to the black hole, which can alter the effective mass of the black hole and therefore affect the star's orbit.
