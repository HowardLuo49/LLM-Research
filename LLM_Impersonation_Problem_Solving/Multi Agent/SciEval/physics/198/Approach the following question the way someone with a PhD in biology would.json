    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of the magnetic field in a galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we can utilize the formula for magnetic field strength in a rotating galaxy, which is given by:\n\nB = sqrt((4\u03c0 * rho * v_r * R_g) / (c))\n\nWhere B is the magnetic field strength, rho is the mass density of the galaxy, v_r is the rotational velocity, R_g is the radius of the galaxy, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the radius of the galaxy is 50,000 light-years (4.73e+20 m), the rotational velocity is 791 km/s (7.91e+5 m/s), and assuming a typical mass density of a galaxy, we can calculate the magnetic field strength using the formula above.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = sqrt((4\u03c0 * rho * 7.91e+5 m/s * 4.73e+20 m) / (3e+8 m/s))\n\nB = sqrt((1.88e+26 * rho) / 3e+8))\n\nB = sqrt(6.27e+17 * rho)\n\nUnfortunately, without specific values for the mass density of the galaxy, we cannot calculate the exact magnetic field strength.
