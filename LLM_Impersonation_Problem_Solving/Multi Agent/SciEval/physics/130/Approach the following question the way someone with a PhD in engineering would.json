    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we will use Wien's displacement law which relates the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation curve to its temperature. \n\nThe formula for Wien's displacement law is: \u03bbmax = b / T, where \u03bbmax is the wavelength of the peak radiation, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. \n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 553.3 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the formula \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). Thus, \u03bb = 3 x 10^8 m/s / (553.3 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.542 mm. \n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to solve for the temperature: T = b / \u03bbmax = 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K / 0.542 x 10^-3 m = 5.35 K. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer closest to the calculated temperature is option A: 5.34 K.",
