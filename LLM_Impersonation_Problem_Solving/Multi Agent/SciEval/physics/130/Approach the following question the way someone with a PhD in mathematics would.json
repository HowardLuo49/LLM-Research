    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation is proportional to the inverse of its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 553.3 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the speed of light:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency.\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\u03bb = 3 x 10^8 / 553.3 x 10^9\n\u03bb = 5.42 x 10^-4 m\n\nNow, we can use the above wavelength with Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_peak\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 / 5.42 x 10^-4\nT \u2248 5.35 K\n\nSo, the correct answer is closest to option A: 5.34 K.",
