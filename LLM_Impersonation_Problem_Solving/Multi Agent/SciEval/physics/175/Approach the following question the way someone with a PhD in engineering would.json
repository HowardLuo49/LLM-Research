Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 29969 m\nB. 14750 m\nC. 73799 m\nD. 96761 m\n\nAnswer:",
