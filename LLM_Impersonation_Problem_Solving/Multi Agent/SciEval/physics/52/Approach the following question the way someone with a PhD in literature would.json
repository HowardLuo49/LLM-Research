    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmological redshift. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is essentially a remnant of the Big Bang, decreases over time due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe relationship between the temperature (T) of the cosmic microwave background radiation at different ages (t) after the Big Bang can be described by the formula: T = To / (1 + z), where To is the present-day temperature (9.0 K) and z is the cosmological redshift at a specific age.\n\nThe cosmological redshift (z) at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated using the formula 1 + z = (1 + t / To)^(1/2), where t is the age in years and To is the present-day age (13.8 billion years).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: 1 + z = (1 + 3.8 x 10^5 / (1.38 x 10^10))^(1/2) = (1 + 0.0000275)^(1/2) \u2248 1.00001375. Therefore, z \u2248 0.00001375.\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula T = 9.0 / (1 + 0.00001375) \u2248 9.0 / 1.00001375 \u2248 8994.5 Kelvin.\n\nConsidering the given options, the closest answer is B. 9909.0 Kelvin.",
