    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmological redshift. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases with the expansion of the universe, which results in a redshift of the photons.\n\nThe relationship between the temperature at different times can be described as:\nT(z) = T0 / (1 + z)\n\nwhere T(z) is the temperature of the universe at a redshift z, T0 is the present-day temperature (6.3 Kelvin in this case), and z is related to the age of the universe according to the cosmological model.\n\nTo find the redshift z corresponding to an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the relation between the redshift and the age of the universe:\nz = (age of universe - age of CMB formation) / age of CMB formation\n\nThe age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years, and the age of CMB formation is around 380,000 years. Plugging these values into the equation gives:\nz = (13.8 billion - 380,000) / 380,000\n\nAfter calculating the redshift z, we can find the temperature of the universe at that time using the formula T(z) = T0 / (1 + z).\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is:\nC. 3749.1 kelvin.",
