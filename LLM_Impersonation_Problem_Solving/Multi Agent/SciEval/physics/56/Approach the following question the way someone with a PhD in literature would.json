    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the fact that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases as the universe expands. The relationship between the temperature of the CMB and the age of the universe is given by the formula T = T0 * (1+z), where T0 is the present-day temperature of the CMB (6.3 Kelvin) and z is the redshift.\n\nTo find the redshift at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula z = (1 + z)^(1/3) - 1, where z is the redshift and t is the time since the Big Bang in units of the Hubble time. At 380,000 years, the redshift is approximately z = 1090.\n\nPlugging this redshift into the temperature formula, we get:\n\nT = 6.3 Kelvin * (1 + 1090) = 6936.3 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 6936.3 kelvin.",
