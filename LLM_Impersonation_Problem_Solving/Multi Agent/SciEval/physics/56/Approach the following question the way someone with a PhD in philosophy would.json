    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the fact that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a present-day temperature of approximately 6.3 Kelvin. \n\nThe temperature of the universe at a given age can be determined by using the relationship between temperature and time in the framework of the standard cosmological model. This relationship is given by the formula T(t) = T0 * (1 + z), where T(t) is the temperature of the universe at time t, T0 is the present-day temperature of the CMB (6.3 Kelvin), and z is the redshift.\n\nAt an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the redshift z can be calculated as z = (t/t0)^(1/2) - 1, where t0 is the age of the universe today (approximately 13.8 billion years). Plugging in the values, we find z \u2248 1089. \n\nUsing the formula T(t) = T0 * (1 + z), we can calculate the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang as T(380,000 years) = 6.3 Kelvin * (1 + 1089) \u2248 6936.3 Kelvin.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nD. 6936.3 kelvin",
