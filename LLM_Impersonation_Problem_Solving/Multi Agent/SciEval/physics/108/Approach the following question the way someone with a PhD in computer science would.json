    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is \u03bb_max = b / T, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is a constant (2.897 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that T0 = 2.73 K, we can determine the peak wavelength at that temperature: \u03bb_max = 2.897 x 10^-3 / 2.73 = 1.06 x 10^-3 m.\n\nNow, we know that the observable universe has expanded by a factor of about 1100 since the time of recombination (380,000 years after the Big Bang). Therefore, we need to adjust the temperature using the redshift factor z = 1100. The relation between temperature and redshift is T_final / T0 = 1 + z. \n\nSo, T_final = (1 + 1100) * T0 = 1101 * 2.73 = 3003.73 K.\n\nConsidering the given options, the closest answer to the calculated temperature is:\n\nC. 3000.0 K.",
