What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 46 and 55 times the mass of the sun, orbiting each other in a binary system with an orbital period of 48 seconds? What would be the amplitude of these waves when they reach Earth? Lastly, how could we detect these waves and what are the implications of detecting them?

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use Kepler's third law:\n\nf = 1 / (2 * \u03c0) * \u221a(G * (m1 + m2) / a^3)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. The semi-major axis can be calculated from the orbital period using Kepler's third law:\n\na = (G * (m1 + m2) * T^2 / (4 * \u03c0^2))^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute the given masses and orbital period into the equations to calculate the frequency. \n\nNext, to calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * (m1 * m2) * (f / c^4))^(1/3)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of the gravitational waves, c is the velocity of light.\n\nSubstitute the calculated frequency into the equation to get the amplitude.\n\nTo detect these waves, we would need a gravitational wave detector such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory).
