    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary system of two black holes, we would first need to calculate the chirp mass of the system. The chirp mass, denoted as M_c, represents a reduced mass of the system and is given by the formula:\n\nM_c = (m1 * m2)^(3/5) / (m1 + m2)^(1/5)\n\nwhere m1 = 46 * mass of the sun, m2 = 55 * mass of the sun.\n\nSubstitute the given values in the above formula to find the chirp mass:\n\nm1 = 46 * 1.989e30 kg = 91.514e30 kg\nm2 = 55 * 1.989e30 kg = 109.395e30 kg\n\nM_c = (91.514e30 * 109.395e30)^(3/5) / (91.514e30 + 109.395e30)^(1/5)\nM_c = 1.94e31 kg\n\nNow, using the chirp mass, we can calculate the expected frequency of the emitted gravitational waves using the formula:\n\nf = (1 / (3*sqrt(3) * pi)) * (c^3 / (G * M_c))\n\nwhere c = speed of light, G = gravitational constant.\n\nSubstitute the given constants and chirp mass into the formula to find the expected frequency:\n\nf = (1 / (3 * sqrt(3) * 3.14)) * (3e8)^3 / (6.674e-11 * 1.94e31)\nf \u2248 4.79e-8 Hz\n\nNext, to calculate the amplitude of the waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula for the strain amplitude of gravitational waves, denoted as h0, which is given by:\n\nh0 = (32/5)^(1/4) * (G^(5/3) * m1 * m2 * (pi * f)^(2/3) / (c^4 * D))\n\nwhere D is the distance from the source to Earth. Assuming D is 1 light year = 9.461e15 m, substitute the values into the formula to find the amplitude:\n\nh0 = (32/5)^(1/4) * (6.674e-11)^(5/3) * 91.514e30 * 109.395e30 * (3.14 * 4.79e-8)^(2/3) / (3e8)^4 * 9.461e15\nh0 \u2248 7.53e-22\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer for the amplitude of the waves when they reach Earth is option A: 2.35e-15.\n\nIn terms of detection, gravitational waves can be detected using interferometers such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). The detection of these waves provides valuable information about the sources and allows for testing of general relativity in extreme conditions. Detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole system would confirm the existence of such systems, shedding light on the dynamics and evolution of black holes in the universe. It would also provide insights into astrophysical processes that cannot be observed through traditional electromagnetic radiation.",
