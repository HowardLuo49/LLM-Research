    "gpt_response": "To calculate the minimum energy required for a gravitational wave detector to measure the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes with masses 39 and 71 solar masses, we can use the formula for gravitational wave energy:\n\nE_GW = (5/256) * ((G^2 * M^5) / (c^5 * d^4))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the black holes, c is the velocity of light, and d is the distance between the detector and the black holes.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nM = 39 + 71 = 110 solar masses = 110 * 1.989e30 kg\nG = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2\nc = 3e8 m/s\nd = 3.086e25 m\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula to get the energy emitted by the black holes:\n\nE_GW = (5/256) * ((6.674e-11^2 * (110 * 1.989e30)^5) / (3e8^5 * 3.086e25^4))\n\nCalculating this out will give you the energy emitted by the black holes in Joules.
