    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmic expansion and redshift. As the universe expands, the wavelengths of photons also stretch, causing their temperature to decrease.\n\nThe relationship between the temperature T and the scale factor a of the universe is given by T=T0/a, where T0 is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and a is the scale factor at the specified time after the Big Bang.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature T0 is approximately 9.7 Kelvin, we can calculate the scale factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula a = T0 / T, where T is the temperature at the specified time:\n\na = 9.7 Kelvin / T\n\nNow, to find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we rearrange the equation as T = 9.7 Kelvin / a.\n\nAssuming a standard cosmological model, the scale factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is roughly a = 0.0018.\n\nTherefore, T = 9.7 Kelvin / 0.0018 \u2248 5388.9 Kelvin.\n\nAmong the given choices, the closest option is C. 5734.1 Kelvin.",
