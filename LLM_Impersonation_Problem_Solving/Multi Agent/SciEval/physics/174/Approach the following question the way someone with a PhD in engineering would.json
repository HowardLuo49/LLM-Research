Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole. It represents the distance from the center of a black hole at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light. This radius is given by the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * G * M / c^2\n\nwhere Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the mass of the black hole as 2 solar masses (M = 2 * 1.989e30 kg) and the values of G and c, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 2 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\nRs = 2.376e-10 * 3.978e30 / 9e16\nRs = 9.45784e20 / 9e16\nRs = 105,086.029 m\n\nTherefore, the calculated Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses is closest to option C: 83092 m.",
