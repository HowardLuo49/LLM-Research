    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the universe's expansion and the relation between temperature and scale factor.\n\nThe temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe. The scale factor is given by a = (age of the universe) / (present age of the universe). In this case, the scale factor at an age of 380,000 years is 380,000 / 13.8 billion years = 2.754 x 10^-2.\n\nUsing the relation between temperature and scale factor:\n\nT_initial / T_current = (a_initial / a_current)^2\n\nT_initial = T_current * (a_initial / a_current)^2\nT_initial = 6.6 K * (1/2.754 x 10^-2)^2\nT_initial = 7266.6 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 7266.6 kelvin",
