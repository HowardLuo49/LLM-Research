    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2\u03c0r/v\n\nWhere:\nT = rotational period\nr = average radius of the galactic halo = 28603 light-years x 9.461e15 meters\nv = velocity of light = 3e8 m/s\n\nFirst, we convert the average radius from light-years to meters:\n\n28603 light-years x 9.461e15 m/light-year = 2.7063e20 meters\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n\nT = 2 x 3.14 x 2.7063e20 / 3e8\nT = 5.3869e20 / 3e8\nT = 1.7956e12 seconds\n\nNow, we convert the seconds to years:\n\n1.7956e12 seconds x 1 year / 3.154e7 seconds = 5.69e4 years\n\nTherefore, the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo is approximately 5.69e4 years.
