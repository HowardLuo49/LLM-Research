Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole. It represents the radius at which the gravitational pull becomes so strong that not even light can escape, leading to the formation of an event horizon.
