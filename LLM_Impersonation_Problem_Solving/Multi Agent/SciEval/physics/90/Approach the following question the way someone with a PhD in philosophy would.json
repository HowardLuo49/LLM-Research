Thus, the semi-major axis (a) is 6.898e20 meters.\n\nNext, we can use the following equation to calculate the orbital period (T) of the star:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt(a^3 / (G * M))\n\nWhere:\nT = Orbital period\n\u03c0 = 3.14\na = Semi-major axis = 6.898e20 meters\nG = Gravitational constant = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2\nM = Mass of the Milky Way galaxy = 1.523e42 kg (assuming 8.00e11 solar masses)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt((6.898e20)^3 / (6.674e-11 * 1.523e42)) seconds\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt(2.8504e62 / 1.01897e31) seconds\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt(2.79558e31) seconds\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * 5.286e15 seconds\n\nT = 3.32e16 seconds\n\nFinally, we convert the orbital period to years using the conversion factor that 1 year = 3.154e7 seconds:\n\nOrbital period (in years) = (3.32e16 seconds) / (3.154e7 seconds/year) = 1.05e9 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1.30e+09 years",
