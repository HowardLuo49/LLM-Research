    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to use the concept of cosmic expansion and the relationship between temperature and age of the universe. \n\nThe relationship between the temperature (T) and the age of the universe (t) after the Big Bang is given by the equation T = To / (1 + z), where To is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and z is the redshift factor. \n\nGiven that the present-day temperature is approximately 5.9 Kelvin, we can calculate the redshift factor at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula z = (t/to)^(1/2) - 1. \n\nPlugging in the values, we get z = (380,000 / 13.8 billion years)^(1/2) - 1 = 0.00008.\n\nTherefore, the temperature at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang would be T = 5.9 / (1 + 0.00008) = 5.8996 Kelvin. \n\nAmong the given choices, the closest answer is A. 3541.2 Kelvin.",
