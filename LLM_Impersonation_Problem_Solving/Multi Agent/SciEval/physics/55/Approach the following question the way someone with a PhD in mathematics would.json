    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The redshift factor is given by z = (1 + z)^(-1), where z is the redshift.\n\nAt present, the cosmic microwave background radiation has a temperature of approximately 5.9 Kelvin. Therefore, the redshift factor at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang is z = 5.9/(T_initial), where T_initial is the temperature of the universe at that time.\n\nSolving for T_initial, we get T_initial = 5.9/(1 + z) = 5.9/6.9 = 0.855 Kelvin.\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\nC. 8756.5 kelvin\n\nThis answer is the closest to the calculated temperature of 0.855 Kelvin.",
