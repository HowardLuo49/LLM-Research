    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of the star, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which relates the orbital period (T) of a celestial body to its average distance from the object it is orbiting (r). This law can be expressed as:\n\nT^2 = (4\u03c0^2/ G * (m1 + m2)) * r^3\n\nWhere:\nT = orbital period\nG = gravitational constant\nm1 = mass of the star\nm2 = mass of the Milky Way's center\nr = distance of the star from the center of the Milky Way\n\nGiven that the star is located at a distance of 65202 light years from the center of the Milky Way, we first need to convert this distance into meters. One light year is equivalent to 9.461e15 meters. Therefore, the distance (r) in meters would be:\nr = 65202 light years * 9.461e15 meters/light year = 6.168e20 meters\n\nNext, we need to calculate the mass of the Milky Way's center. The solar mass is given as 1.989e30 kg and the mass of the Milky Way's center can be assumed to be equivalent to the mass of a large number of stars, such as 100 billion solar masses. Therefore, m2 = 100 billion * 1.989e30 kg = 1.989e41 kg.\n\nLastly, we factor in the gravitational constant and solve for the orbital period (T). This gives us:\n\nT^2 = (4 * \u03c0^2/ G * (m1 + m2)) * r^3\nT^2 = (4 * 3.14^2 / 6.674e-11 * (m1 + m2)) * r^3\nT^2 = (1.24e3 / 6.674e-11 * (1.989e30 + 1.989e41)) * (6.168e20)^3\nT^2 = (1.24e3 / 6.674e-11 * 1.989e41) * 2.702e62\nT^2 = (1.24e3 / 1.33068e30) * 2.702e62\nT^2 = 931.54 * 2.702e62\nT^2 = 2.519e65\nT = sqrt(2.519e65)\nT \u2248 1.585e32 seconds\n\nConverting the orbital period from seconds to years, we have:\nT \u2248 1.585e32 seconds / (3e8 meters/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 365.25 days/year)\nT \u2248 5.01e23 years\n\nTherefore, the expected orbital period of the star at a distance of 65202 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 5.01e23 years. The option closest to this value is:\n\nB. 5.51e8 years",
