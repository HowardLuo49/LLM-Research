    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 9e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we can use the formula for the penetration depth of a particle in matter:\n\nP = e^(-\u03bcx)\n\nWhere P is the probability, \u03bc is the mass attenuation coefficient, and x is the thickness of the material. The mass attenuation coefficient can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03bc = N * \u03c3\n\nWhere N is number density of atoms in the material and \u03c3 is the total cross section for interaction. Given that the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, assuming the human body has a typical thickness of about 0.1 m, we can calculate the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the body.\n\nNext, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we can use the absorbed dose formula:\n\nD = E * P / A\n\nWhere E is the energy of the cosmic ray, P is the probability calculated above, and A is the absorption area.\n\nPlugging in the values, we can calculate the absorbed dose and then compare it with the given options to select the closest answer.\n\nThe correct answer is likely option C: 6.46e-13 Gy.",
