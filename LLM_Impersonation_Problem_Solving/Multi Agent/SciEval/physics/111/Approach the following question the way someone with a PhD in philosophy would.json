    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 5 e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the cross-section of the body that the cosmic ray needs to pass through. Assuming the body can be approximated as a cylinder with a radius of 0.1 m and thickness of about 0.3 m, we can calculate the probability using the formula for the cross-section of a cylinder.\n\nUsing the formula for the cross-section of a cylinder, we find:\n\nCross-section = \u03c0 * r^2 = \u03c0 * (0.1)^2 \u2248 0.0314 m^2\n\nWith the absorption area given as 0.1 m^2, we could estimate that the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the body would be approximately 0.1 / 0.0314 = 3.18.\n\nNext, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we can use the formula:\n\nDose = Energy * Probability = 5e+18 eV * 3.18 \u2248 1.59e+19 eV\n\nConverting this energy to Gray (Gy) using the conversion factor 1.60218e-13 Gy/eV, we find the dose to be approximately 1.59e+19 * 1.60218e-13 \u2248 2.54e+6 Gy.\n\nSo, the closest option to the correct answer would be:\nC. 1.19e-13 Gy",
