    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nRotational Period = Circumference / Velocity\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the circumference of the galactic halo using the formula for the circumference of a circle:\n\nCircumference = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\n\nCircumference = 2 * 3.14 * 48038 light-years = 301931.84 light-years\n\nNext, we convert the circumference from light-years to meters:\n\n301931.84 light-years * 9.461e15 meters/light-year = 2.856e24 meters\n\nNow we can calculate the rotational period:\n\nRotational Period = 2.856e24 meters / 3e8 m/s = 9.52e15 seconds\n\nFinally, we convert the rotational period from seconds to years:\n\n9.52e15 seconds * (1 year / 3.154e7 seconds) = 3.01e8 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3.52e+08 years",
