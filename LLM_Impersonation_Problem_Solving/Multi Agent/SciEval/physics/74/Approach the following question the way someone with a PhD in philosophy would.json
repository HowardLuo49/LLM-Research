    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation E = (1/2)MV^2, where E is the total energy, M is the mass, and V is the velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the final kinetic energy of the remnant. The final mass of the remnant is 7.2 solar masses, which is equivalent to 7.2 x 1.989e30 kg = 1.431e31 kg. The final velocity is given as 10,000 km/s, which is equivalent to 10,000 x 1000 = 1e7 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the final kinetic energy of the remnant is (1/2) x 1.431e31 kg x (1e7 m/s)^2 = 7.155e45 J.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the initial kinetic energy of the supernova explosion. The initial mass of the supernova is 62 solar masses, which is equivalent to 62 x 1.989e30 kg = 1.233e32 kg. The initial velocity is given as 10,000 km/s, which is equivalent to 1e7 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the initial kinetic energy of the supernova explosion is (1/2) x 1.233e32 kg x (1e7 m/s)^2 = 6.165e46 J.\n\nThe total energy released in the supernova explosion can be calculated as the difference between the initial kinetic energy and the final kinetic energy: 6.165e46 J - 7.155e45 J = 4.449e46 J.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given options is D. 4.54e+48 J.",
