    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law for the black body spectrum. \n\nWien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of radiation from a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. Mathematically, it is given by:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^6) / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength corresponding to the peak of the black body spectrum, and T is the temperature of the black body in Kelvin.\n\nAt the time 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) would be equal to the temperature of the universe. So in this case, T = T0, where T0 = 2.73 K.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^6) / 2.73\n\u03bb_max \u2248 1060884.981\n\nNow, as the universe is completely ionized at this time, the CMBR has a black body spectrum.
