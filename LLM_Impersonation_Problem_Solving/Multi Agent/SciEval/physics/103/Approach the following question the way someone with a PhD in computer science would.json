    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation:\n\nT = T0 * (1 + z)\n\nWhere T is the temperature of the universe at that time, T0 is the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (2.73 K), and z is the redshift factor. \n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at that time, we know that the redshift factor z can be calculated as:\n\n1 + z = (1 + z_eq) * (1 + z_flow) \n\nWhere z_eq is the redshift at the time of matter-radiation equality and z_flow is the redshift at the time when the universe transitioned from being completely ionized to being neutral.\n\nUsing known values for z_eq and z_flow, we can calculate the redshift factor z.\n\nPlugging in the values into the formula, we get:\n\n1 + z = (1 + 3,000) * (1 + 1,100) = 4,100 * 2,100 = 8,610,000\n\nSo, z = 8,610,000 - 1 = 8,609,999\n\nNow we can calculate the temperature T:\n\nT = 2.73 K * 8,609,999 = 23,554,997 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nB. 5401.16 K",
