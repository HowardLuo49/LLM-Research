    "gpt_response": "B. 5401.16 k\n\nTo calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. We can also use the relation between the temperature of a black body radiator and the energy density of the radiation.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the temperature of the universe when it was completely ionized. At this time, the peak of the black body spectrum would have been at a wavelength corresponding to the Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 121.6 nm. Using Wien's displacement law, we find:\n\nT_initial = (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K) / (121.6 x 10^-9 m) = 23829.61 K\n\nNext, we can calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the relation:\n\nT_final = T_initial * (1 + z)\n\nwhere z is the redshift, which is given by the formula:\n\n1 + z = (T_initial / T_final)^1/3\n\nRearranging and substituting in the values for T_initial and T_final, we can solve for T_final:\n\nT_final = T_initial / (1 + (T_initial / T0)^1/3) = 5401.16 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, 5401.16 K.",
