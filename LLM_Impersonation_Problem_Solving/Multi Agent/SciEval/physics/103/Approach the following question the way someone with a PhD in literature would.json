    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's law which relates the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum to its temperature. \n\nThe formula for Wien's law is:\n\u03bb_max = 2.898 \u00d7 10^(-3) / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength in meters, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the universe was completely ionized at that time, the peak wavelength can be calculated using the formula:\n\u03bb_max = c / f_0\n\nWhere c is the speed of light (approx. 3 x 10^8 m/s), and f_0 is the observed frequency of the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nTherefore,\nT = 2.898 \u00d7 10^(-3) / (c / f_0)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nT = 2.898 \u00d7 10^(-3) / (3 x 10^8 / c)\n\nGiven that T0 = 2.73 k, we can find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang by:\nT = T0 * (\u03bb_max0 / \u03bb_max)^(-1)\n\nSubstitute the values and simplify to find the closest option to the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the closest option is:\nC. 4075.94 k",
