    "gpt_response": "To determine the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop carrying a current, we can use the formula for the magnetic field at the center of a rectangular loop. The formula is given by B = (\u03bc0 * I * N) / (2 * R), where B is the magnetic field, \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, N is the number of loops, and R is the distance from the center of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 9 A, the dimensions of the loop are 9.0 m x 8.0 m, so the radius R is 4.5 m (half of the shorter side). There is only one loop in the rectangular loop, so N is 1.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 9 * 1) / (2 * 4.5) \nB = (1.134 * 10^(-5)) / 9\nB = 1.26 * 10^(-6) Tesla\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 6.01 x 10^(-7) Tesla",
