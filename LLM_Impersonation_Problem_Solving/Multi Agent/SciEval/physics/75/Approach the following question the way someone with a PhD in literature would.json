What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 4.6 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 71 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * mass * velocity^2. \nFirst, we need to convert the given masses from solar masses to kg: 71 solar masses = 71 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.41039e32 kg and 4.6 solar masses = 4.6 * 1.989e30 kg = 9.154e30 kg.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the formula: KE = 0.5 * (1.41039e32 kg - 9.154e30 kg) * (10,000 km/s)^2 = 6.94705e31 kg * (10,000 km/s)^2.\n\nNext, we need to convert km/s to m/s: 10,000 km/s = 10,000 * 10^3 m/s = 1.0e7 m/s.\n\nSubstitute this into the formula: KE = 6.94705e31 kg * (1.0e7 m/s)^2 = 6.94705e31 kg * 1.0e14 m^2/s^2 = 6.94705e45 J.\n\nNow, let's compare this calculation to the given answer choices:\n\nA. 8.03e+48 J\nB. 7.65e+48 J\nC. 5.93e+48 J\nD. 1.19e+49 J\n\nThe closest answer choice to our calculated result of 6.94705e45 J is option C: 5.93e+48 J.",
