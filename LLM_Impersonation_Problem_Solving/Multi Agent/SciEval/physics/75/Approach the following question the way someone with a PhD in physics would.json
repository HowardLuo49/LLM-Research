    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we need to consider the mass difference between the initial mass and the remnant mass, and also take into account the velocity of the remnant.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mass difference:\nInitial mass = 71 solar masses = 71 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.41019e32 kg\nRemnant mass = 4.6 solar masses = 4.6 * 1.989e30 kg = 9.1384e30 kg\nMass difference = Initial mass - Remnant mass = 1.41019e32 kg - 9.1384e30 kg = 5.96e31 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the kinetic energy of the remnant using the formula: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2\nKE = 0.5 * 9.1384e30 kg * (10,000,000 m/s)^2 = 4.5692e39 J\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total energy released by the supernova as the sum of the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy:\nE = mc^2 + KE\nE = 5.96e31 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 + 4.5692e39 J\nE = 5.364e46 J + 4.5692e39 J\nE = 5.364e46 J + 4.5692e39 J\nE = 5.364e46 J\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nA. 8.03e+48 J",
