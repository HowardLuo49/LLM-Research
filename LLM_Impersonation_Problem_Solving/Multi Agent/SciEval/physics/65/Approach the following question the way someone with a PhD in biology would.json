    "gpt_response": "In a Type Ia supernova explosion, the entire mass of a white dwarf star (4.5 solar masses) is converted into energy. To calculate the kinetic energy released, we can use the formula E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the white dwarf star to kilograms:\n4.5 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass = 8.95e30 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the energy released:\nE = (8.95e30 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 8.05e47 kg m^2/s^2 = 8.05e47 J\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the correct kinetic energy released in a Type Ia supernova explosion is:\n\nB. 8.06e+47 J",
