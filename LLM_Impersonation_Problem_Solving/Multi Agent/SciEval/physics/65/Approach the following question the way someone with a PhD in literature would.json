What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (4.5solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 2.01e+48 J\nB. 8.06e+47 J\nC. 3.48e+48 J\nD. 8.98e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",
