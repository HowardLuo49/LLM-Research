    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the temperature of a black body radiation spectrum:\n\nT = T0 / (1 + z)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the universe at a given time, T0 is the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (2.73 K), and z is the redshift parameter.\n\nThe redshift parameter can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = \u03bb0 / \u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bb0 is the current wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation (1.06 mm) and \u03bb is the wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation at the time of interest.\n\nSince the wavelength of black body radiation is inversely proportional to temperature (\u03bb ~ 1/T), we can write:\n\n\u03bb = \u03bb0 * (T0 / T)\n\nSubstituting this expression for \u03bb into the equation for redshift, we get:\n\n1 + z = T / T0\n\nz = T/T0 - 1\n\nGiven that the universe was completely ionized at that time, we know that the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang was equal to the temperature of recombination, which occurred at z ~ 1100. Therefore, z = 1100. Using the formula above, we can calculate the temperature:\n\nT = (1100 + 1) * T0 = 1101 * 2.73 K = 3000.0 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option is A. 3000.0 K.",
