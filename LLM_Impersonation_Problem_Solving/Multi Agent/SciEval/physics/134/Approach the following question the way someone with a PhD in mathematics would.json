What is the mass density of a filament of the cosmic web that is 778 megaparsecs in length and has an average thickness of 10 kiloparsecs? Given that the gas in the filament is made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass, calculate the number density of atoms in the filament assuming it is in thermal equilibrium.

The volume can be calculated by multiplying the length by the cross-sectional area (which is the thickness multiplied by the length). \n\nVolume = length x thickness = 778 megaparsecs x 10 kiloparsecs \nVolume = 778 x 10 Megaparsec^2 = 7780 Megaparsec^3\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume to cubic centimeters since the density will be in atoms per cubic centimeter. 1 Megaparsec^3 is equal to 3.08567758 \u00d7 10^79 cubic centimeters. \n\nVolume = 7780 Megaparsec^3 x 3.08567758 \u00d7 10^79 cubic centimeters/Megaparsec^3 \nVolume = 2.39963 x 10^83 cubic centimeters\n\nSince the gas is made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass, we can assume the number density of atoms in the filament will be proportional to the mass density.
