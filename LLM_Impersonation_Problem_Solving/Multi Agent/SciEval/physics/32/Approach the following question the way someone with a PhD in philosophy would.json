What is the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, assuming a diffusion coefficient of 710^28 cm^2/s and a magnetic field strength of 6 microgauss? How does this maximum energy change if the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 10? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : elementary charge :e = 1.6e-19 C ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, we can use the rigidity equation: E = ZeBRL, where E is the energy of the particle, Z is the atomic number of the particle (1 for a proton), e is the elementary charge, B is the magnetic field strength, R is the rigidity, and L is the path length.\n\nThe rigidity of a particle is defined as R = pc/Ze, where p is the momentum of the particle and c is the velocity of light. By combining these two equations, we can express the energy of the particle in terms of the momentum: E = p^2c^2/Ze. \n\nFurthermore, in the diffusive shock acceleration theory, the maximum energy a particle can attain is given by: E_max = ZeBLc/3D, where D is the diffusion coefficient. \n\nPlugging in the values provided in the question: Z = 1, B = 6e-6 T (6 microgauss), D = 7e28 cm^2/s (or 7e21 m^2/s when converted), we can calculate the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain as follows: \n\nE_max = (1)*(6e-6)*(3e8)/(3*(7e21)) = 2.57e15 eV\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer would be option D, 10.0e+14 eV.",
