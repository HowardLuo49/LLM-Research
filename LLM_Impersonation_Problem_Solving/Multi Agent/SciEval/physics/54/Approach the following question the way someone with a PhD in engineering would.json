    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as it relates to time. This formula is based on the redshift of the radiation, which is related to the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nT = To*(1 + z)\n\nWhere:\nT = temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang\nTo = present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (1.5 Kelvin)\nz = redshift factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang\n\nTo calculate the redshift factor, we can use the formula:\n\n1 + z = (1 + z1) / (1 + z2)\n\nWhere:\nz1 = redshift at 380,000 years after the Big Bang\nz2 = redshift at present day (z2 = 0)\n\nFrom cosmological calculations, we know that the redshift at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 1100. Therefore, using the formula above, we find:\n\n1 + 1100 = (1 + z) / (1 + 0)\n1101 = 1 + z\nz = 1100\n\nNow, plugging this value into the first formula we have:\n\nT = 1.5 Kelvin * (1 + 1100)\nT = 1.5 Kelvin * 1101\nT = 1651.5 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nD. 1651.5 Kelvin",
