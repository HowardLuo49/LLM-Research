    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion when the entire mass of a white dwarf star (1.8 solar masses) is converted into energy, we can use the formula for energy equivalence, E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the white dwarf star into kilograms. 1.8 solar masses = 1.8 * 1.989e30 kg = 3.58e30 kg.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released:\n\nE = (3.58e30 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 3.58e30 kg * 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 3.22e47 J\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is C. 3.22e+47 J.",
