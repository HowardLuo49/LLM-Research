What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (1.8solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 6.71e+48 J\nB. 3.68e+48 J\nC. 3.22e+47 J\nD. 6.87e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the equation E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 1.8 solar masses, we can calculate the mass in kilograms by multiplying by the mass of the sun (1.989e30 kg):\n\nMass = 1.8 x 1.989e30 kg = 3.5802e30 kg\n\nNow, using the equation E=mc^2, we can calculate the energy released:\n\nE = 3.5802e30 kg x (3e8 m/s)^2 = 3.5802e30 kg x 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 3.22218e47 kg m^2/s^2 = 3.22218e47 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is closest to option C: 3.22e+47 J.",
