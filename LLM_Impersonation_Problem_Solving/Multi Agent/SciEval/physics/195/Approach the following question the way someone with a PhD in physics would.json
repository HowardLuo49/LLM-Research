    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field in the galaxy, we can use the formula for the magnetic field in a rotating disk, B = \u03bc0 * I / (2 * \u03c0 * R), where B is the magnetic field, \u03bc0 is the magnetic permeability of free space, I is the current (which in this case can be approximated by the rotational velocity of the galaxy multiplied by the radius), and R is the radius of the galaxy.\n\nPlugging in the values for the rotational velocity (368 km/s) and the radius (50,000 light-years) into the formula, we get:\n\nB = (4 * \u03c0 * 10^-7 T*m/A) * (368 km/s * 50,000 ly) / (2 * \u03c0 * 50,000 ly)\nB = 0.97748 * 10^-6 T\n\nConverting this value to Tesla, we get B = 9774.8 T\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 9803 T",
