    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC(=COC)C(=O)O.Cl can be expressed as C5H8O3Cl. This compound consists of 5 carbon atoms, 8 hydrogen atoms, 3 oxygen atoms, and 1 chlorine atom. The structure of the molecule includes a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbonyl group, and a chlorine atom attached to the oxygen atom. The presence of these functional groups gives the compound unique chemical properties and reactivity. Further analysis of the molecular structure and properties can be carried out using spectroscopic techniques and computational methods.",
