    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of (1S,2S)-2-aminocycloheptane-1-carboxamide can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the compound. To determine the molecular weight, we must consider the molecular formula of the compound: C9H18N2O. By consulting the periodic table and summing the atomic weights of each element present in the compound (C=12.01, H=1.008, N=14.01, O=15.999), we arrive at a molecular weight of approximately 158.25 g/mol.",
