    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule represents its unique structure using a simple and concise notation. In the case of C8H14O, the SMILES expression would be \"CCCC(C)CC(CC)O\" which represents a linear chain of 8 carbon atoms, with a methyl group attached to the third carbon atom and a hydroxyl group attached to the eighth carbon atom. This notation allows for easy representation and comparison of molecular structures in computational chemistry and chemical informatics applications.",
