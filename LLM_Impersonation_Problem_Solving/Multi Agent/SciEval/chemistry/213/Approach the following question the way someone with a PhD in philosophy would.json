    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCC(CC)NC1CCCC1C#N represents a compound consisting of 22 carbon atoms, 6 nitrogen atoms, and 6 hydrogen atoms. This molecule is a complex organic compound with multiple carbon and nitrogen atoms in its structure, which indicates a potentially significant level of complexity in its chemical properties and reactivity. The presence of the carbon-carbon triple bond (C#N) suggests the potential for interactions and reactivity typical of nitrile functional groups in organic chemistry. Further analysis, such as structural elucidation and spectroscopic characterization, would be required to fully understand the properties and behavior of this particular molecule in a given chemical context.",
