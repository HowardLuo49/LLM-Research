    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C9H17N, a molecular formula representing a chemical compound, would likely consist of a simplified version of its molecular structure. In this case, the SMILES expression for C9H17N would outline the connectivity of the carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N) atoms in the molecule. To accurately determine the SMILES expression, one would need to carefully examine the bonds between the atoms and consider the possible isomeric forms of the compound. This information would be essential in generating an accurate and concise representation of the chemical structure using the SMILES notation system.",
