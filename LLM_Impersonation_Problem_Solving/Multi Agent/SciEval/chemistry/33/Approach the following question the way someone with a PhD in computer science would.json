    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C8H13NS can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of each atom in the molecule. \n\nThe atomic weights of each element are:\n- C (Carbon): 12.01\n- H (Hydrogen): 1.008\n- N (Nitrogen): 14.01\n- S (Sulfur): 32.06\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H13NS is calculated as follows:\n\n(8*C) + (13*H) + N + S\n= (8*12.01) + (13*1.008) + 14.01 + 32.06\n= 96.08 + 13.104 + 14.01 + 32.06\n= 155.248\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H13NS is 155.248.",
