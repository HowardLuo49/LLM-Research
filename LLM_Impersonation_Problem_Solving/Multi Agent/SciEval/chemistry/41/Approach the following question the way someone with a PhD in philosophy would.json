    "solution": [
        "C6H12N2"
    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCCCC(C#N)N refers to the chemical structure of a compound composed of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Specifically, this compound consists of five carbon atoms connected in a linear chain, with a nitrogen atom bonded to the fourth carbon atom in the chain via a triple bond. This molecular formula represents a nitrile compound, and its unique structure highlights the presence of multiple carbon-carbon bonds and the functional group of a nitrile group. The molecular formula CCCCC(C#N)N can be further analyzed in terms of its structural characteristics, chemical properties, and potential reactivity in various chemical reactions and processes.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response ['C6H12N2']?: The molecular formula of CCCCC(C#N)N refers to the chemical structure of a compound composed of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Specifically, this compound consists of five carbon atoms connected in a linear chain, with a nitrogen atom bonded to the fourth carbon atom in the chain via a triple bond. This molecular formula represents a nitrile compound, and its unique structure highlights the presence of multiple carbon-carbon bonds and the functional group of a nitrile group. The molecular formula CCCCC(C#N)N can be further analyzed in terms of its structural characteristics, chemical properties, and potential reactivity in various chemical reactions and processes.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. The final solution obtained in the response is not ['C6H12N2']. The molecular formula provided in the response is 'CCCCC(C#N)N', which refers to a compound composed of carbon and nitrogen atoms connected in a specific arrangement.",
