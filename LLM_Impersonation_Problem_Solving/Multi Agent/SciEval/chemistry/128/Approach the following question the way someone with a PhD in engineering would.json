    "gpt_response": "To determine the SMILES expression of C8H17NO2S, we first need to understand the molecular structure of the compound. C8H17NO2S consists of 8 carbon atoms, 17 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, 2 oxygen atoms, and 1 sulfur atom. \n\nUsing this information, the SMILES expression can be constructed based on the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. The SMILES expression represents a unique and concise way to describe the structure of a molecule using ASCII characters.\n\nThe SMILES expression of C8H17NO2S would be: CC(C)CCCC(C)N(C)S=O. In this expression, the capital letters represent the atomic symbols of the elements, while the lowercase letters and symbols represent the connections between the atoms. The double bond between sulfur and oxygen is indicated by the \"=\", and the bonds between the atoms are represented by the characters in the sequence.",
