    "solution": [
        "4-amino-1,1-bis(phosphanyl)butan-1-ol"
    ],
    "gpt_response": "The chemical compound C4H13NOP2 is known as phytate, or inorganic phosphate. Its name is derived from its molecular structure comprising four carbon (C4), thirteen hydrogen (H13), one nitrogen (N), one oxygen (O), and two phosphorus (P) atoms. Phytate is a prevalent form of phosphorus storage in plant seeds and grains, serving as an essential nutrient for plants and animals alike. Its intricate molecular composition and biological significance make it a subject of study in various fields including biochemistry, nutrition, and agricultural science.",
