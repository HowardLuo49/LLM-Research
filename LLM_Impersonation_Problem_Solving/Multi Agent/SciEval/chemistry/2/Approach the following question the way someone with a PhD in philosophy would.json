    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of (2R,5S)-5-ethyl-2-methylnonanal, one must first understand the organic nomenclature system used to describe organic compounds. In this case, the compound is a nonanal, which is a nine-carbon aldehyde. The stereochemistry of the compound is indicated by the (2R,5S) configuration, which tells us the arrangement of substituents around the second and fifth carbon atoms.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we first need to count the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in the compound. The aldehyde functional group consists of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom, and the remaining carbon atoms are part of the alkyl chain. In this case, the compound has a total of nine carbon atoms.\n\nNext, we consider the substituents on the carbon chain: an ethyl group (-C2H5) attached to the fifth carbon atom and a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the second carbon atom. These substituents add two carbon atoms and five hydrogen atoms to the molecular formula.\n\nCombining these components, we arrive at the molecular formula of (2R,5S)-5-ethyl-2-methylnonanal: C9H18O. The molecular formula indicates that the compound contains 9 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom.",
