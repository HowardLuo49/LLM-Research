    "gpt_response": "28 atoms\n\nExplanation:\nThe molecular formula C11H15NO indicates that there are 11 carbon atoms (C), 15 hydrogen atoms (H), 1 nitrogen atom (N), and 1 oxygen atom (O) in the compound. By adding up the total number of atoms, we get:\n11 (C) + 15 (H) + 1 (N) + 1 (O) = 28 atoms\n\nTherefore, there are 28 atoms in C11H15NO.",
