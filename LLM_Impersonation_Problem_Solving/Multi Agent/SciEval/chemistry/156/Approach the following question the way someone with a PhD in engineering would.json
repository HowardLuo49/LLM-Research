    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula for C11H15NO represents a chemical compound containing 11 carbon atoms, 15 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 oxygen atom. To calculate the total number of atoms in this compound, we simply add up the individual atom counts, resulting in:\n\n11 (C) + 15 (H) + 1 (N) + 1 (O) = 28 atoms\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 28 atoms in one molecule of C11H15NO.",
