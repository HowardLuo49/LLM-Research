    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule is a linear notation that represents the structure of the molecule in a compact and concise manner. In order to determine the SMILES expression of C11H11I, we must first consider the structure of the molecule. \n\nC11H11I has 11 carbon atoms, 11 hydrogen atoms, and 1 iodine atom. Based on this information, we can determine the structural formula of the molecule, which is C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-I. \n\nNext, we can translate this structural formula into a SMILES expression using the appropriate rules and conventions of the SMILES notation system. In this case, the SMILES expression for C11H11I would be CC(C)C(C)C(C)C(C)C(C)C(C)C(C)I. \n\nThis SMILES expression represents the structure of the molecule C11H11I in a concise and standardized manner, making it easier to communicate and analyze its chemical properties.",
