    "gpt_response": "It is prudent to approach the determination of the molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane by first identifying the molecular formula of the compound. In this case, the molecular formula can be derived as C10H21BrO. Utilizing the periodic table to ascertain the atomic weights of the constituent elements (carbon: 12.01, hydrogen: 1.01, bromine: 79.90, oxygen: 16.00), the molecular weight can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of all the atoms present in the molecule. Therefore, the molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane is estimated to be 249.27 g/mol.",
