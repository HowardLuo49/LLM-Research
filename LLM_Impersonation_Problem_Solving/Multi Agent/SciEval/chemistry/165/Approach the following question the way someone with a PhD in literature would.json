    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of all the atoms in the compound. \n\n2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane consists of 14 carbon atoms, 29 hydrogen atoms, 1 bromine atom, and 1 oxygen atom. \n\nThe atomic weight of carbon is approximately 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen is approximately 1.008 g/mol, bromine is approximately 79.9 g/mol, and oxygen is approximately 16 g/mol. \n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane can be calculated as: \n\n(14 x 12.01) + (29 x 1.008) + (1 x 79.9) + (1 x 16) = 242.17 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane is approximately 242.17 g/mol.",
