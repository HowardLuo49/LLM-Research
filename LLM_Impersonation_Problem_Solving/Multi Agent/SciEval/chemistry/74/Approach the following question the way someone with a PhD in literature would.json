    "gpt_response": "42 atoms\n\nExplanation: The molecular formula for C10H22O represents a molecule composed of 10 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. To determine the total number of atoms in the molecule, one must add together the individual counts of each element. Thus, 10 carbon atoms + 22 hydrogen atoms + 1 oxygen atom = 42 atoms in total.",
