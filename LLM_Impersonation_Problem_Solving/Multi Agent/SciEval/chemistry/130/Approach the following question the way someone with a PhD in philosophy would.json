    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCCCCCCCCCC(C)OOOC denotes a complex organic compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Upon careful examination, we observe that there are 13 carbon atoms, 15 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms present in the compound. This information allows us to determine the molecular formula of CCCCCCCCCCC(C)OOOC as C13H15O3. This molecular formula provides us with a foundational understanding of the structure and composition of the compound, enabling further analysis and exploration of its chemical properties and behavior.",
