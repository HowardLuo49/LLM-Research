    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine can be determined by first identifying the individual components of the compound. The prefix \"1-methoxy\" indicates the presence of a methoxy group (CH3O-) attached at the first position of the molecule. The prefix \"N-propyl\" indicates the presence of a propyl group (C3H7-) attached to the nitrogen atom of the amine functional group. The parent compound is hept-5-yn-2-amine, which consists of a heptane chain (C7H16) with a triple bond at the second carbon and an amino group (NH2) at the fifth position.\n\nPutting these components together, we can construct the molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine as: C10H21NO.",
