From a philosophical perspective, the name of this compound is derived from the IUPAC nomenclature system, which aims to provide a systematic and unambiguous way to name chemical substances based on their structure and composition. In this case, the name of the compound is likely a systematic name based on the arrangement of carbon and nitrogen atoms within the molecule, following the guidelines set forth by the IUPAC. This naming convention serves as a means of communication and classification within the scientific community, allowing for accurate and standardized identification of chemical compounds.",
