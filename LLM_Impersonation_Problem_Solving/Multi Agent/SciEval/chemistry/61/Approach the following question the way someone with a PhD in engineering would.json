    "gpt_response": "C6H13BrO2S is a chemical formula representing a compound. To determine the number of atoms in this compound, we first need to break down the elements present and their respective subscripts:\n\n- C6 indicates 6 carbon atoms\n- H13 indicates 13 hydrogen atoms\n- Br indicates 1 bromine atom\n- O2 indicates 2 oxygen atoms\n- S indicates 1 sulfur atom\n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in C6H13BrO2S is:\n\n6 (C) + 13 (H) + 1 (Br) + 2 (O) + 1 (S) = 23 atoms.\n\nSo, there are 23 atoms in C6H13BrO2S.",
