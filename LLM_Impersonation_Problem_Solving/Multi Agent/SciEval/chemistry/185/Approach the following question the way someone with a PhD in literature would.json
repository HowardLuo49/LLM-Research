    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C6H13N3O is CC(C)N(C)C(=O)NCCCN. This molecular structure consists of a hexane backbone with nitrogen atoms at positions 3 and 4, and an oxygen atom connected to a carbonyl group at position 2. The SMILES notation provides a concise and unambiguous way to represent the 2D structure of organic molecules, which is crucial for computational analysis and chemical modeling in the field of chemistry and related disciplines.",
