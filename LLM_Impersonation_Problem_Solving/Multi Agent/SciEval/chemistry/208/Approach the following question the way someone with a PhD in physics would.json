The molecule contains carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms arranged in a specific pattern. By analyzing the molecular structure, it can be determined that there are 3 carbon atoms, 2 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom present in the molecule. Therefore, the molecular formula of CC(CN)NCC(C)(CCOC)O can be simplified to C3N2O.",
