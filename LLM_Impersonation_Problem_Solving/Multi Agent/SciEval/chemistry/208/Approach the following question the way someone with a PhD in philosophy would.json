    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC(CN)NCC(C)(CCOC)O can be analyzed through the application of organic chemistry principles and spectroscopic techniques. By identifying the various functional groups present in the compound - including carbon-carbon bonds, nitrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms - and arranging them in the appropriate configuration based on molecular connectivity, one can elucidate the structural formula of the compound. This process involves consideration of valence electrons, bonding patterns, and steric considerations to ascertain the accurate representation of the molecular formula. Additionally, spectroscopic methods such as NMR and mass spectrometry can be utilized to corroborate the proposed structural formula and confirm the elemental composition of the compound. Through this rigorous analytical approach, the molecular formula of CC(CN)NCC(C)(CCOC)O can be elucidated with confidence and precision.",
