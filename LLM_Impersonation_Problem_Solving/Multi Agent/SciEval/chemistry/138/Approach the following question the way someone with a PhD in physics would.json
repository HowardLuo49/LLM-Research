    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCOC(=O)C1CCCCC=CC1 is C11H16O. This compound contains 11 carbon atoms, 16 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. The structure consists of a central carbon atom doubly bonded to an oxygen atom, which is then bonded to another carbon atom and a chain of five additional carbon atoms forming a cyclohexene ring structure.",
