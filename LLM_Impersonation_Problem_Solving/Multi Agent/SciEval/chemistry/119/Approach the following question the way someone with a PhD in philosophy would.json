    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C7H13F3N2, a molecular formula representing a chemical compound characterized by the presence of seven carbon atoms, thirteen hydrogen atoms, three fluorine atoms, and two nitrogen atoms, would be constructed according to the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) notation rules for chemical structures. The precise SMILES expression for this particular compound would involve the sequential representation of atoms and their connectivity in a linear string format, following the established conventions of SMILES notation for organic and inorganic molecules.",
