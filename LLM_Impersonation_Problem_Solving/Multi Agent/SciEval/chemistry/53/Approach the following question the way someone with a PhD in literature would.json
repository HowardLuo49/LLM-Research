    "gpt_response": "The chemical compound C12H21NO is commonly known as methadone. Methadone is a synthetic opioid commonly used for pain management and as a treatment for opioid addiction. Its widespread use is due to its ability to provide similar effects to other opioids, while also having a longer duration of action and lower risk of overdose. In literature, methadone has been referenced in various literary works exploring themes of addiction, recovery, and the complexities of human behavior. Its chemical name reflects its molecular structure, which consists of 12 carbon atoms, 21 hydrogen atoms, one nitrogen atom, and one oxygen atom.",
