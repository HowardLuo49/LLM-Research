    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of atoms present in the compound 3-(5-bromo-2-methyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)propan-1-amine, one must first analyze the molecular formula of the compound. Breaking down the chemical structure, we can identify the following atoms present in the compound:\n\n- Carbon (C)\n- Hydrogen (H)\n- Nitrogen (N)\n- Bromine (Br)\n\nBy counting the number of each atom present in the compound, we can determine the total number of atoms. Therefore, the total number of atoms in 3-(5-bromo-2-methyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)propan-1-amine is:\n\nTotal number of atoms = 3*(C) + 9*(H) + 3*(N) + 1*(Br) \n\nTotal number of atoms = 3*3 + 9*8 + 3*2 + 1\n\nTotal number of atoms = 9 + 72 + 6 + 1\n\nTotal number of atoms = 88\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 88 atoms in the compound 3-(5-bromo-2-methyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)propan-1-amine.",
