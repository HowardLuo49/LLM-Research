However, drawing upon my knowledge of scientific principles, I can provide an answer to the query. The molecular weight of a compound is calculated by summing the atomic weights of all atoms in a molecule. In the case of C14H27Br, carbon has an atomic weight of 12, hydrogen 1, and bromine 79. Thus, the molecular weight of C14H27Br is 14(12) + 27(1) + 1(79) = 168 + 27 + 79 = 303 g/mol.",
