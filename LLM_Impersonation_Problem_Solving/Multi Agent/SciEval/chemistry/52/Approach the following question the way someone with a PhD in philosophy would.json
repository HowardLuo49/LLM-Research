    "gpt_response": "285.37g/mol\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of C14H27Br, we first need to determine the atomic weights of each element. Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.011, hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1.008, and bromine (Br) has an atomic weight of approximately 79.904.\n\nNext, we multiply the number of each element by its atomic weight and sum the products:\n\n(14 x 12.011) + (27 x 1.008) + (1 x 79.904) = 168.154 + 27.216 + 79.904 = 285.37 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C14H27Br is 285.37 g/mol.",
