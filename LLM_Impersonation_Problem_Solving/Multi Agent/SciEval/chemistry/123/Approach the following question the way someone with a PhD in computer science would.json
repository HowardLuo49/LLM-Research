    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C10H21NO2 can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of each element in the chemical formula. Carbon has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01, hydrogen has an atomic weight of approximately 1.008, nitrogen has an atomic weight of approximately 14.01, and oxygen has an atomic weight of approximately 16.00. \n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C10H21NO2 is calculated as follows:\n\n10(C) + 21(H) + 1(N) + 2(O)\n= (10 * 12.01) + (21 * 1.008) + 14.01 + (2 * 16.00)\n= 120.1 + 21.168 + 14.01 + 32.00\n= 187.278\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C10H21NO2 is approximately 187.278 g/mol.",
