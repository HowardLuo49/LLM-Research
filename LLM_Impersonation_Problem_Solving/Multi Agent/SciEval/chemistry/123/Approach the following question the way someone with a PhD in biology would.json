    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C10H21NO2 is 187.28 g/mol. This can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of each individual element present in the molecule: carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol, nitrogen (N) = 14.01 g/mol, and oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol. Thus, the molecular weight is calculated as follows:\n\n(10 x 12.01) + (21 x 1.008) + 14.01 + (2 x 16.00) = 187.28 g/mol",
