    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of CC1(C(=O)N(N=N1)C)C, we must first analyze the structure of the molecule. From the given formula, we can see that the molecule consists of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms.\n\nBreaking down the formula, we see that it contains two carbon atoms, three nitrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Additionally, there are two double bonds (C=C and N=N) present in the molecule.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecular formula of CC1(C(=O)N(N=N1)C)C can be written as C2N3O1.",
