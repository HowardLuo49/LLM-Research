The formula represents a complex organic compound containing carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N) atoms arranged in a specific configuration.\n\nTo calculate the total number of atoms, one must count the individual atoms present in the molecular formula. In this case, there are 9 carbon atoms (C), 13 hydrogen atoms (H), and 2 nitrogen atoms (N). Therefore, the total number of atoms in the molecular formula CC(C)(C)C1CC=NN1C is 24.\n\nThis numerical value provides a quantitative representation of the molecular composition of the compound in question, reflecting the complexity and diversity of atoms involved in its structure.",
