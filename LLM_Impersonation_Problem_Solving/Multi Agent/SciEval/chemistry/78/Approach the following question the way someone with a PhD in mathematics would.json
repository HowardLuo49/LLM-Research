    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of methyl (3S)-3-amino-4-methylhexanoate can be determined by first identifying the structure of the compound. The prefix \"methyl\" indicates a methyl group attached to a carbon atom. The stereochemistry designation \"(3S)\" indicates that the substituent at the third carbon position is in the S (sinister) configuration. The compound also contains an amino group attached to the third carbon and a methyl group attached to the fourth carbon of a hexanoate chain.\n\nBy counting the number of carbon atoms in the hexanoate chain (6), adding the methyl group at the fourth carbon, and considering the amino group at the third carbon, the molecular formula of methyl (3S)-3-amino-4-methylhexanoate can be determined to be C8H17NO2.",
