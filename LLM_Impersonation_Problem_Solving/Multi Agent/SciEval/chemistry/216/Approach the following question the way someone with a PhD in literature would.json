    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C6H14N2O2, which represents the chemical structure of the organic compound in a compact and linear notation, is CC(CC(N)C)C(N)C(=O)O. This expression captures the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule and provides a standardized way to represent its structure in chemical databases and software tools. The use of SMILES notation allows for easy comparison and analysis of chemical structures in the field of organic chemistry and biochemistry, aiding in understandings of the molecular properties and interactions of such compounds.",
