    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (3S)-3-methyloxane-2-thiol is C5H12S. This can be determined by analyzing the structure of the compound and counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur atoms present in the molecule. In this case, the compound contains 5 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 1 sulfur atom, leading to the molecular formula C5H12S.",
