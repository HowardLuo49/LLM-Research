    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (3S)-3-methyloxane-2-thiol is C5H12OS. This can be determined by analyzing the structure of the molecule, recognizing the substituents on the carbon backbone, and identifying the functional groups present. The presence of a sulfur atom and an oxygen atom in the molecule dictates the final molecular formula.",
