The formula represents the total number of atoms of each element present in a molecule, specifically carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S). By counting the atoms in the given molecular formula, we can determine the empirical formula which provides the simplest whole number ratio of atoms in a compound. From there, additional information such as molecular geometry and bonding can be determined through chemical analysis and computational modeling techniques.",
