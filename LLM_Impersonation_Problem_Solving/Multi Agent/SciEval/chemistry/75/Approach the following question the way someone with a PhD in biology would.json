    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC(OS(=O)C(C)S)S represents a compound containing carbon (C), sulfur (S), and oxygen (O) atoms in a specific arrangement. In this compound, there are two carbon atoms, four sulfur atoms, and one oxygen atom. The central sulfur atom is double-bonded to one oxygen atom and single-bonded to two carbon atoms. The structure of the compound suggests a complex arrangement of covalent bonds between the atoms, indicating a potentially significant molecular weight and structural complexity. Further analysis through spectroscopic techniques would be required to fully elucidate the molecular structure and properties of this compound.",
