    "gpt_response": "The chemical compound COC1COC2C1OCC2OC is known as a cyclic acetal. This compound contains two acetal functional groups, which are formed by the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with two equivalents of an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. Cyclic acetals are commonly used in organic synthesis as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds, as well as in the design of cyclic molecules with specific properties. The structure of COC1COC2C1OCC2OC can be elucidated through spectroscopic techniques such as NMR and mass spectrometry.",
