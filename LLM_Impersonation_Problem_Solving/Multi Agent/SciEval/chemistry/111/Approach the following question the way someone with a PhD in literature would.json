    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC(=O)C=CC=COO can be elucidated by analyzing the structural formula which represents a compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The presence of double bonds and functional groups such as carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups indicates the compound is likely an unsaturated organic molecule. By interpreting the arrangement of atoms in the formula, it can be deduced that the molecular formula is C6H6O2. This information allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the chemical composition of CC(=O)C=CC=COO.",
