    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC(=O)C=CC=COO is C5H6O2. This compound consists of five carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The presence of the double bonds indicates a potential for resonance structures within the molecule. The molecular formula provides important information about the composition of the compound, which can then be used to determine its chemical properties and behavior in various reactions and environments.",
