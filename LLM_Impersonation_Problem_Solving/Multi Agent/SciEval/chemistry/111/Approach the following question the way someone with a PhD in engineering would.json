    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC(=O)C=CC=COO is C6H8O3. This can be determined by looking at the structure of the molecule and counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms present. The structure indicates that there are 6 carbon atoms, 8 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the molecular formula is C6H8O3.",
