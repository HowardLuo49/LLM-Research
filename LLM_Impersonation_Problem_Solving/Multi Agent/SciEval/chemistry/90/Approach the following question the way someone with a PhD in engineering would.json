    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of atoms in methyl 2-[3-(methylaminomethyl)cyclobutyl]oxyacetate, we first need to break down the structure of the molecule.\n\nThe molecular formula of methyl 2-[3-(methylaminomethyl)cyclobutyl]oxyacetate is C11H21NO4. Its structure consists of 11 carbon atoms, 21 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 4 oxygen atoms. \n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in methyl 2-[3-(methylaminomethyl)cyclobutyl]oxyacetate is:\n\n11 (carbon) + 21 (hydrogen) + 1 (nitrogen) + 4 (oxygen) = 37 atoms\n\nSo, there are 37 atoms in methyl 2-[3-(methylaminomethyl)cyclobutyl]oxyacetate.",
