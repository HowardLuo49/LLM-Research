    "gpt_response": "144.17\n\nExplanation: \nTo calculate the molecular weight of C7H12O3, we first need to determine the atomic weights of each element in the compound. The atomic weight of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01, hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.01, and oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00.\n\nNext, we calculate the total molecular weight by multiplying the number of atoms of each element by their respective atomic weights and adding them together:\n(7 x 12.01) + (12 x 1.01) + (3 x 16.00) = 84.07 + 12.12 + 48.00 = 144.17\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C7H12O3 is 144.17.",
