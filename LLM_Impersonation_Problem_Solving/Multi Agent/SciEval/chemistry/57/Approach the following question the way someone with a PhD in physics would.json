The connection between atoms is shown by the order of the symbols, with single bonds indicated by the absence of a symbol and double bonds indicated by an equal sign (=). In this specific compound, the sulfur atom is connected to two oxygen atoms through double bonds, and it is further connected to a methyl group (CH3) and a pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl group (C5H10N) forming a cyclic structure.",
