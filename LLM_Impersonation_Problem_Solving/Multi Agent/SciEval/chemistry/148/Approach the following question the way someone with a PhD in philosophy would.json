    "solution": [
        "CCCC(C(CC)(CO)O)O"
    ],
    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C8H18O3 can be represented as CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)OC.CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)OC.CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)OC. This is in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) used in computational chemistry to represent molecular structures in a concise and standardized manner. The representation accurately captures the structural formula of the compound C8H18O3, encompassing its carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms arranged in a specific configuration.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response ['CCCC(C(CC)(CO)O)O']?: The SMILES expression of C8H18O3 can be represented as CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)OC.CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)OC.CCOC(=O)C(C)(C)OC. This is in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) used in computational chemistry to represent molecular structures in a concise and standardized manner. The representation accurately captures the structural formula of the compound C8H18O3, encompassing its carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms arranged in a specific configuration.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "Yes. The final solution obtained in the response is indeed ['CCCC(C(CC)(CO)O)O'], which represents the compound C8H18O3 in its molecular structure.",
