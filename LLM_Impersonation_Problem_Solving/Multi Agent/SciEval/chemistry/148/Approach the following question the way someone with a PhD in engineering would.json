    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression is a linear notation for representing the structure of a chemical compound in a compact and unique manner. In the case of C8H18O3, which represents a compound with a molecular formula of C8H18O3, the SMILES expression could be written as CC(C)(C)CCCOC(C)(C)C. This notation specifies the connectivity of atoms in the molecule, with each letter representing a specific atom and the connecting lines indicating bonds between them.",
