In this case, we have:\n- 2 Carbon atoms (CC)\n- 9 Hydrogen atoms (CCCC)\n- 1 Oxygen atom (O)\n- 1 Sulfur atom (S)\n- 1 Nitrogen atom (#)\n\nSo total number of atoms = 2 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14 atoms.\n\nAdditionally, we have a cyclohexane ring (C1CCCCS1) which has 7 Carbon atoms (including the Carbon atoms from the main chain). So, we need to add 7 to our total:\n\n14 + 7 = 21 atoms\n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in the given chemical formula (CC#CCCC(C1CCCCS1)O) is 21 atoms.",
