    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of 4,4-dimethyl-1-methylsulfanylhexane is CC(C)(C)SCCCCCC. SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a chemical notation that uses ASCII strings to represent chemical structures in a compact and human-readable format. In this case, the SMILES expression represents a hexane molecule with two methyl groups (CH3) at the 4th carbon atom, a methylsulfanyl group (CH3S) at the 1st carbon atom, and a total of 6 carbon atoms in the main chain.",
