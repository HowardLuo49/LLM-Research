    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of 4,4-dimethyl-1-methylsulfanylhexane can be derived through a structural analysis of the molecule. In this case, the compound consists of a hexane backbone with a sulfur atom bonded to a methyl group at the first carbon position, and two methyl groups at the fourth carbon position. Therefore, the SMILES expression for 4,4-dimethyl-1-methylsulfanylhexane would be CC(C)C(SC)CC(C)C. This representation captures the structural information of the molecule in a concise and standardized format, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of similar compounds within chemical databases.",
