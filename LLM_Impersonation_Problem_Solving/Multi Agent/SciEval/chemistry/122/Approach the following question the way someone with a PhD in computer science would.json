    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCC(C)CCC(C)(O)O is C8H18O2. This can be determined by counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms present in the compound and representing them in the chemical formula. In this case, there are 8 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms, leading to the molecular formula C8H18O2.",
