SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a linear notation for representing molecular structures in a simple and unambiguous way. In this case, the SMILES expression represents the structural formula of a molecule composed of 10 carbon atoms, 20 hydrogen atoms, and 2 nitrogen atoms. The notation provides a concise and standardized representation of the molecule's connectivity and can be used for computer-based analysis and prediction of chemical properties.",
