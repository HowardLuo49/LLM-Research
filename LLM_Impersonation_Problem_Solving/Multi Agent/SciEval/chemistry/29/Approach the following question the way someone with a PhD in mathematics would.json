    "gpt_response": "1. To determine the name of a chemical compound, we first need to identify the functional groups present in the molecule C9H18N2O. \n\n2. By examining the molecular formula, we can see that there are 9 carbon atoms (C9), 18 hydrogen atoms (H18), 2 nitrogen atoms (N2), and 1 oxygen atom (O). \n\n3. The presence of nitrogen and oxygen in the compound indicates the possibility of amine and amide functional groups, respectively. \n\n4. By conducting a structural analysis of the molecule, we can deduce that it contains an amide functional group, as it is commonly found in organic compounds with the formula CnH2n+1CONH2.\n\n5. Therefore, the name of the compound C9H18N2O is N-cyclohexylacetamide.",
