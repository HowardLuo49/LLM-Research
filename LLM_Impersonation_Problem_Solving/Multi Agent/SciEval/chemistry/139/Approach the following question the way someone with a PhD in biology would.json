    "gpt_response": "The compound CC(C)(C)C#CCBr.P is commonly known as tert-butylacetylene bromophosphine. It is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C6H9BrP. This compound is a derivative of acetylene with a tert-butyl and bromo substituent, as well as a phosphine functional group. The tert-butyl group and bromine atom likely confer steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing properties, respectively, while the phosphine group may participate in coordination chemistry reactions.",
