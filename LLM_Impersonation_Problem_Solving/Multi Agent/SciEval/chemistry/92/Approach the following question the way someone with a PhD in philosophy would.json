    "gpt_response": "161.22 \n\nA molecule of C8H17NO3 is composed of 8 carbon atoms, 17 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 3 oxygen atoms. To calculate its molecular weight, we need to consider the atomic weights of these individual atoms. The atomic weight of carbon is approximately 12.01, hydrogen is approximately 1.01, nitrogen is approximately 14.01, and oxygen is approximately 16.00.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the molecular weight of C8H17NO3 as follows:\n\n(8*12.01) + (17*1.01) + 14.01 + (3*16.00) = 96.08 + 17.17 + 14.01 + 48.00 = 161.22\n\nThus, the molecular weight of C8H17NO3 is 161.22.",
