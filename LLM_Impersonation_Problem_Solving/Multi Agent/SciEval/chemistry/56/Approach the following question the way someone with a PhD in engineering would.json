SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a method used to represent chemical structures using short, text-based strings. This representation provides a compact and easily readable format for various chemical compounds. In the case of Nicotinamide, the SMILES expression highlights the connectivity of atoms and the arrangement of functional groups within the molecule.",
