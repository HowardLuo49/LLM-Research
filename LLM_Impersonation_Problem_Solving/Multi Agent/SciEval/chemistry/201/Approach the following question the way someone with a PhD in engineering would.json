    "gpt_response": "The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) expression of C7H11N3S is CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)N)SCNC(=NC)N. In this notation, C represents carbon, H represents hydrogen, N represents nitrogen, and S represents sulfur. The SMILES expression provides a compact and unique representation of the molecular structure, allowing for easy comparison and manipulation of chemical structures in computational chemistry and chemical informatics.",
