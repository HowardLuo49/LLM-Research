    "gpt_response": "158.25 g/mol\n\nExplanation: To calculate the molecular weight of C9H18N2O, we first need to determine the individual atomic weights of each element present in the compound. The atomic weights of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) are 12.01 g/mol, 1.01 g/mol, 14.01 g/mol, and 16.00 g/mol respectively.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of atom in the compound. There are 9 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, 2 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom in C9H18N2O.\n\nFinally, we calculate the molecular weight by adding up the atomic weights of each atom present in the compound: \n(9 x 12.01 g/mol) + (18 x 1.01 g/mol) + (2 x 14.01 g/mol) + (1 x 16.00 g/mol) =  108.09 + 18.18 + 28.02 + 16.00 = 158.25 g/mol.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C9H18N2O is 158.25 g/mol.",
