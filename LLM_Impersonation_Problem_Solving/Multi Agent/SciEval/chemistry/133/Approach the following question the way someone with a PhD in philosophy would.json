    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C7H13N3 can be calculated by adding up the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The atomic weight of carbon is approximately 12, hydrogen is approximately 1, and nitrogen is approximately 14. \n\nThus, the molecular weight of C7H13N3 can be calculated as: \n(7 * 12) + (13 * 1) + (3 * 14) = 84 + 13 + 42 = 139.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C7H13N3 is 139.",
