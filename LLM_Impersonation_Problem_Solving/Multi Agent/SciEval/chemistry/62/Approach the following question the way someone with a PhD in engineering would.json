    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CNC1CCCCCC1N2CCOCC2 is C14H26N2O. This can be determined by calculating the total number of atoms of each element in the molecule: 14 carbon atoms, 26 hydrogen atoms, 2 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. The formula is then simplified to the smallest whole number ratio, which gives us C14H26N2O as the molecular formula of the compound.",
