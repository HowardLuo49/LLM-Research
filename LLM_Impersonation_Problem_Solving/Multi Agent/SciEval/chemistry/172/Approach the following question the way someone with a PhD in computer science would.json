In this case, the compound has a pentane backbone with an amine group attached at the 2nd position. Additionally, there is an ethyl group attached to the nitrogen atom and three methyl groups attached to the third carbon atom. \n\nFrom this structural formula, we can determine the molecular formula by counting the number of each type of atom present in the compound. The pentane backbone consists of 5 carbon atoms, the amine group contains 1 nitrogen atom, and there are a total of 13 hydrogen atoms (9 from the pentane backbone, 3 from the methyl groups, and 1 from the ethyl group). \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of (2R)-N-ethyl-N,3,3-trimethylpentan-2-amine is C10H23N.",
