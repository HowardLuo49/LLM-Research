    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule is a linear notation that represents its structure in a concise and unambiguous way. In the case of C8H17N3O, we have a molecule with 8 carbon atoms, 17 hydrogen atoms, 3 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. \n\nTo determine the SMILES expression of this molecule, we need to consider the connectivity of the atoms and the arrangement of the bonds. In this case, the most likely structure for C8H17N3O is a linear chain of carbon atoms with nitrogen and oxygen atoms attached to some of the carbons. Therefore, one possible SMILES expression for C8H17N3O could be \"CCCNCCCNCC(NO)C\" where the parentheses indicate that the nitrogen and oxygen atoms are attached to a single carbon atom. \n\nIt is important to note that there may be multiple valid SMILES expressions for a given molecular formula depending on the specific arrangement of atoms and bonds. Validating the SMILES expression for C8H17N3O would require further analysis using computational tools or experimental data.",
