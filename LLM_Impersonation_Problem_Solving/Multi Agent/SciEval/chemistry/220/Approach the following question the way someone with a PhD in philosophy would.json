    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one;prop-1-ene can be determined by analyzing the structural formula of the compound. By identifying the elements present in the molecule and their respective ratios, one can derive the molecular formula, which represents the exact number and types of atoms in the compound. In this case, the molecular formula can be written as C7H12O3. This formula encapsulates the composition of the compound in terms of its constituent carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. However, it is important to note that the molecular formula alone does not convey the spatial arrangement or bonding structure of the molecule, which would require further analysis and interpretation.",
