    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of the chemical compound C8H14O can be represented as CC(CC)C(CC)CO. This notation system utilizes a linear string of characters to depict the atoms, bonds, and connectivity within a molecule, allowing for a concise and standardized representation of its structure. The given SMILES expression specifies the arrangement of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms in the compound in a defined and systematic manner, facilitating the analysis and comparison of chemical structures in a computational and theoretical context.",
