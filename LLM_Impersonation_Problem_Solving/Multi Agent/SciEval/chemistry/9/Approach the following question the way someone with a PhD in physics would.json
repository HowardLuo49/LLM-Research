In the case of C8H14O, which is a molecule composed of 8 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom, the SMILES expression would be written as CC(C)CCC(C)O. This notation indicates the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule by representing the carbon atoms as \"C\", the hydrogen atoms as implied by the absence of specific symbols, and the oxygen atom as \"O\". The branching structure of the molecule is also depicted, with the carbon atoms attached to each other in a specific order to form the molecular structure of C8H14O.",
