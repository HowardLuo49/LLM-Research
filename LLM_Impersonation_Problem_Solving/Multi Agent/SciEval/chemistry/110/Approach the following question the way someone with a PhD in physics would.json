    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula C8H9BrS corresponds to the compound 2-bromothiophene. Thiophenes are a class of aromatic heterocyclic compounds containing a five-membered ring of four carbon atoms and one sulfur atom. The presence of the bromine atom at the 2-position of the thiophene ring gives rise to the specific designation of 2-bromothiophene.",
