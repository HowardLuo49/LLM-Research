    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine is 204.34 g/mol. \n\nExplanation: To calculate the molecular weight of a compound, we need to sum the atomic weights of all the elements present in the compound. In this case, 1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine (C8H20N4) contains carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N) atoms. \n\nThe atomic weights of these elements are: \n- Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H) = 1.01 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N) = 14.01 g/mol \n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine can be calculated as: \n8(12.01) + 20(1.01) + 4(14.01) = 96.08 + 20.2 + 56.04 = 172.32 g/mol\n\nSo, the molecular weight of 1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine is 172.32 g/mol.",
