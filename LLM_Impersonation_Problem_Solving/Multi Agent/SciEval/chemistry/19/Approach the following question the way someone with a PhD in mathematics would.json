To determine the SMILES expression for C13H27NO, we first need to consider the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. \n\nBased on the molecular formula C13H27NO, we can infer that the molecule consists of 13 carbon atoms, 27 hydrogen atoms, one nitrogen atom, and one oxygen atom. To construct the SMILES expression, we need to arrange these atoms in a way that reflects the connectivity of the molecule.\n\nOne possible way to arrange the atoms in the molecule is to have a central nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl (C=O) group, with 13 carbon atoms attached to it. Each carbon atom can then be further bonded to hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valency requirements.\n\nOne possible SMILES expression for C13H27NO could be:\nN(C)(=O)C(C)(C)C(C)(C)C(C)(C)C(C)(C)C(C)(C)C(C)(C)C(C)CC\n\nThis SMILES expression represents a nitrogen atom bonded to a carbonyl group, with 13 carbon atoms attached to it in a linear chain, each bonded to hydrogen atoms.",
