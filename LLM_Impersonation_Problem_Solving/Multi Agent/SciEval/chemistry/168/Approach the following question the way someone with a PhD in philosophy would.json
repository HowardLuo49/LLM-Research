    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole can be deduced by examining the structural formula of the compound. This involves analyzing the arrangement of atoms within the molecule and determining the type and number of atoms present. The prefix \"5,6-dihydro\" indicates that the compound contains two hydrogen atoms added to the 5th and 6th carbon atoms in the pyrrolo ring. Additionally, the [3,2-c] notation in the compound name specifies the fused ring system of the pyrrolo and pyrazole rings. By analyzing the structure and applying principles of organic chemistry, one can determine that the molecular formula of 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole is C9H8N2.",
