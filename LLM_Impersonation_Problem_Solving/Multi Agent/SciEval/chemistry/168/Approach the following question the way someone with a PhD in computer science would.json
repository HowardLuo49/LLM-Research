    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole can be determined by first identifying the structural formula of the compound. In this case, the compound consists of a pyrrolo ring fused to a pyrazole ring, with an additional double bond between carbons 5 and 6 in the pyrrolo ring. \n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we need to consider the number and types of atoms present in the compound. The pyrrolo ring consists of 4 carbons and 1 nitrogen atom, while the pyrazole ring consists of 4 carbons and 2 nitrogen atoms. Therefore, the molecular formula of 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole is C\u2086H\u2087N\u2082.",
