        "C8H13NOS"
    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol can be elucidated by breaking down the compound into its constituent elements and their respective quantities. By analyzing the systematic nomenclature of the compound, we can discern that it consists of a chain of seven carbon atoms, two oxygen atoms, one nitrogen atom, one sulfur atom, and three hydrogen atoms. Thus, the molecular formula can be deduced as C10H15NO2S. This representation encapsulates the structural composition of the compound in a concise and accurate manner, facilitating further analysis and understanding of its properties and behaviors.",
