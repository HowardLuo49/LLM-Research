    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol can be deduced by examining the structure of the compound. This compound consists of a propanol group attached to a thiophen ring, with a methylamino group attached to the second carbon atom of the thiophen ring. By systematically assigning the atoms within the molecule and accounting for their connectivity, one can generate the molecular formula C12H17NOS.",
