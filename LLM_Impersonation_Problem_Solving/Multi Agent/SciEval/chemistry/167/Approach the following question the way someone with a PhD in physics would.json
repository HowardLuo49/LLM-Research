In this case, the compound contains chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), carbon (C), and hydrogen (H) atoms. \n\nBased on the name of the compound, we can determine the molecular formula as C2H3ClF4S. This is because there are 2 carbon atoms (C2), 3 hydrogen atoms (H3), 1 chlorine atom (Cl), 4 fluorine atoms (F4), and 1 sulfur atom (S) present in the compound. Therefore, the molecular formula of 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoro-1-methylsulfanylethane is C2H3ClF4S.",
