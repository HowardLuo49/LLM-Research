    "gpt_response": "The chemical compound C1CC(C1)C2=NOC(C2)N is known as 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-5,8-dione. This compound belongs to the class of heterocyclic compounds, specifically oxadiazinanes. The nomenclature is derived from the fusion of a bicyclic octane ring system with an oxadiazine ring system, where the 2-azabicyclo prefix denotes the presence of a nitrogen atom in the bicyclic ring system. The molecular structure and properties of this compound may be further analyzed and discussed within the context of organic chemistry and its applications.",
