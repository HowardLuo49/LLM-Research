In this case, the compound is a hydroperoxide with a double bond and a methyl group on the second carbon atom of the butene chain. The E in parentheses indicates the stereochemistry of the double bond.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we need to identify the number and type of atoms present in the compound. The molecular formula for the hydroperoxide group can be represented as CH3OO. The butene chain consists of four carbon atoms and one double bond. The presence of a methyl group on the second carbon atom indicates the presence of three hydrogen atoms on that carbon.\n\nPutting all this information together, the molecular formula of (E)-1-hydroperoxy-2-methylbut-1-ene can be determined as C5H10O2.",
