In this case, the compound is a hydroperoxide with a methyl group attached to the second carbon atom of a butene chain. The \"E\" designation refers to the stereochemistry of the double bond, indicating that the highest-priority substituents on each side of the double bond are on opposite sides. \n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we first need to count the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms present in the compound. The structural formula of (E)-1-hydroperoxy-2-methylbut-1-ene can be represented as CH3-CH(OOH)-CH=C-CH3. \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula for (E)-1-hydroperoxy-2-methylbut-1-ene is C5H10O2.",
