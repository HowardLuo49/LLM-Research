    "gpt_response": "146.23 grams/mole\n\nExplanation:\nTo calculate the molecular weight of a compound, we must first determine the atomic weight of each element present in the compound and then sum these atomic weights.\n\nFor C8H18O3:\nCarbon (C) atomic weight = 12.01 g/mol\nHydrogen (H) atomic weight = 1.01 g/mol\nOxygen (O) atomic weight = 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the molecular weight:\n8(C) + 18(H) + 3(O) = (8 * 12.01) + (18 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 96.08 + 18.18 + 48.00 = 146.23 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H18O3 is 146.23 grams/mole.",
