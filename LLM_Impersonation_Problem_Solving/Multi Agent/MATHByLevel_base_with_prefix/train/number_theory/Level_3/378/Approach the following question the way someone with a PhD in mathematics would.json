    "solution": "$\\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\\frac{18}{n}$. Thus, $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$. The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6. Their sum is $\\boxed{39}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ that satisfy the condition $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ being an integer, we can rewrite the expression as $1+\\frac{18}{n}$. For this expression to be an integer, $n$ must be a factor of $18$. Therefore, the possible values of $n$ are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\nTo calculate the sum of these values, we simply add them together: $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = 39$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ that satisfy the given condition is 39.",
