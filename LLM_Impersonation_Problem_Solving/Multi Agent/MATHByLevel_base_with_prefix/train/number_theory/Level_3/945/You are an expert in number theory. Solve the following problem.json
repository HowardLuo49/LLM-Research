    "solution": "Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime. The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors. The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4. It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.",
    "gpt_response": "If $a$ has exactly $3$ factors, then $a$ must be a prime number. The only prime numbers with $3$ factors are of the form $p^2$ where $p$ is a prime number. Therefore, we have $a = p^2$ for some prime number $p$.\n\nSince $b$ has $a=p^2$ factors and $b$ is divisible by $a$, this means that $b=p^{2k}$ for some positive integer $k$. Since $b$ must have $p^2$ factors, we must have $2k+1 = p^2$. \n\nThe smallest possible value for $p$ such that $p^2 - 1$ is an odd number is $p=3$. Therefore, the smallest possible value for $b$ is $b=3^2 = 9$. \n\nThus, the least possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{9}.$",
