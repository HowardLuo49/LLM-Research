    "solution": "Since $11065,11067,11069,\\ldots,11077$ are $7$ consecutive odd integers, they include exactly one integer from each of the residue classes $1,3,5,7,9,11,13\\pmod{14}$ (not necessarily in that order). Therefore, their sum is congruent $\\pmod{14}$ to $1+3+5+7+9+11+13=49$. The remainder of this sum $\\pmod{14}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum of these numbers is divided by $14$, we can first simplify the expression. \n\nThe sum of the given numbers is:\n$11065+11067+11069+11071+11073+11075+11077 = 77497$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $77497$ is divided by $14$. To do this, we can divide $77497$ by $14$ using long division or a calculator.\n\nUpon dividing $77497$ by $14$, we get a quotient of $5535$ with a remainder of $7$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $11065+11067+11069+11071+11073+11075+11077$ is divided by $14$ is $7$.",
