    "solution": "The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$. Therefore, we only need to consider these squares. Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$. Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$. No square begins and ends with $5$. One square begins and ends with $6: 676$. No square begins and ends with $9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. Since a square is the product of a number with itself, a palindrome square will have a palindromic square root.\n\nLet's consider a $3$-digit number whose square root is palindromic. We know that a $3$-digit number can range from $100$ to $999$, and a palindromic number in this range can be of the form $ABA$ where $A$ and $B$ are digits.\n\nSince the square root must also be $3$ digits, $A$ cannot be $0$. This restricts the values of $A$ to be $1$ to $9$. For each value of $A$, the number of palindromic squares will depend on the value of $B$.\n\nFor $A=1$, we have $1^2=1$.\nFor $A=2$, we have $2^2=4$.\nFor $A=3$, we have $3^2=9$.\nFor $A=4$, we have $4^2=16$.\nFor $A=5$, we have $5^2=25$.\nFor $A=6$, we have $6^2=36$.\nFor $A=7$, we have $7^2=49$.\nFor $A=8$, we have $8^2=64$.\nFor $A=9$, we have $9^2=81$.\n\nOut of these, $1$, $4$, and $9$ are palindromes.
