    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome?",
    "solution": "We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it. The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678.  The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678.  Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome. \n\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. In this case, we need to find a positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nLet $n$ be the resulting palindrome after adding $x$ to 5678. We can express $n$ as follows:\n\n$n = x + 5678$\n\nTo check if $n$ is a palindrome, we need to reverse the digits of $n$ and compare it to the original value. If they are the same, then $n$ is a palindrome.\n\nLet $m$ be the reversed digits of $n$. We can express $m$ as follows:\n\n$m = \\text{reverse}(n)$\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $n$ is a palindrome. This can be achieved by iterating through different values of $x$ and calculating $n$ and $m$ for each iteration until we find a value of $x$ that results in a palindrome.\n\nTherefore, to find the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome, we need to iteratively calculate $n$ and $m$ for different values of $x$.",
