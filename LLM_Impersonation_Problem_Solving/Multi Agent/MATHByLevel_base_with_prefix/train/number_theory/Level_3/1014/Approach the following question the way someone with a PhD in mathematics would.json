    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. We know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.  $Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.  $Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square, we first substitute the given expression for $Z$ into the equation for a perfect square. \n\nA perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. In general, a perfect square can be denoted as $N = m^2$, where $N$ is the number and $m$ is an integer.\n\nSo, in this case, we have $Z = K \\times K^2$. This simplifies to $Z = K^3$. We want to find the value of $K$ such that $Z$ is a perfect square, meaning $Z$ can be expressed as $m^2$.\n\nTherefore, we want to find an integer value of $K$ such that $K^3 = m^2$. This implies that $K$ must be a perfect cube to ensure that $Z$ is a perfect square. \n\nNow, considering the given range of $K$, we have $500 < Z < 1000 \\Rightarrow 500 < K^3 < 1000$. \n\nUpon finding the cube root within this range that results in a perfect cube, we get $K = 8$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square is $K = 8$.",
