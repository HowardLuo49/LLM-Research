    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $10,\\!000$ divided by 15 yields a quotient of 666 with a remainder of 10. Thus $10,\\!005$ is a multiple of 15, and $\\boxed{10,\\!010}$ is the least five-digit integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15). For confirmation, note that $10,\\!010-15=9,\\!995$ is the next-highest integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least five-digit positive integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15), we can start by finding the smallest five-digit number that is a multiple of 15 and then adding 5 to it.\n\nThe smallest five-digit number that is a multiple of 15 is 10005 (15 * 667 = 10005). Adding 5 to this number gives:\n\n10005 + 5 = 10010\n\nTherefore, the least five-digit positive integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15) is 10010.",
