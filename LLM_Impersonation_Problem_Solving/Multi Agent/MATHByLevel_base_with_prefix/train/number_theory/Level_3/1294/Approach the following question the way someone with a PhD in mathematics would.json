    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\\cdot189=2^3\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$. The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$. Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\\cdot3^2=(2\\cdot3)^2=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest perfect square factor of 1512, we first need to factorize 1512. \n\n1512 = 2^3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 7\n\nNow, we look for the perfect square factors in the prime factorization. The largest perfect square factor is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime factor that is a perfect square.\n\nIn this case, the prime factorization contains 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. The highest power of each prime factor that is a perfect square is 2^2 and 3^2. \n\nMultiplying these perfect square factors together, we get 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36.\n\nTherefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is 36.",
