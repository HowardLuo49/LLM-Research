    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $23^{23}$, we can first look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 23. \n\nWhen we calculate the units digit of $23^n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$, we find that the units digits cycle in the pattern 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, ... \n\nSince the units digits of powers of 23 repeat in a cycle of length 4, we can find the units digit of $23^{23}$ by finding the remainder when 23 is divided by 4. \n\n23 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3, so the units digit of $23^{23}$ is the third digit in the cycle, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is 7.",
