    "solution": "The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. They can be paired off into four pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 42:  \\begin{align*}\n\\{1&,42\\}, \\\\\n\\{2&, 21\\},\\\\\n\\{3&, 14\\}, \\text{and}\\\\\n\\{6&, 7\\}.\n\\end{align*}Thus $A=42^4=(2\\cdot3\\cdot7)^4=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4$ has $\\boxed{3}$ prime divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of $42$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. \n\nThe divisors of $42$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42$. \n\nThe product of these divisors is $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 42 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2$. \n\nTherefore, the product $A$ has $3$ distinct prime factors: $2, 3, 7$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 3?: The prime factorization of $42$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. \n\nThe divisors of $42$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42$. \n\nThe product of these divisors is $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 42 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^2$. \n\nTherefore, the product $A$ has $3$ distinct prime factors: $2, 3, 7$.",
