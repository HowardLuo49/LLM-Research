    "solution": "For every divisor $d$ of $50$, then $50/d$ is also a divisor of $50$. Their product is $d \\cdot (50/d) = 50$. It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $50$ such that their product is $50 = 2 \\cdot 5^2$. There are $(1+1)(2+1) = 6$ divisors of $50$: $1,2,5,10,25,50$. Thus, the answer is $50^{6/2} = 50^3 = \\boxed{125,\\!000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of the divisors of 50, we first find all the divisors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.\n\nThe product of these divisors is 1 x 2 x 5 x 10 x 25 x 50 = 250,000.\n\nTherefore, the product of the divisors of 50 is 250,000.",
