    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The time right now is exactly midnight. What time will it be in 1234 minutes?",
    "solution": "There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When $1234$ is divided by $60$, you get $20$ with a remainder of $34$. Therefore, the time in $1234$ minutes will be $\\boxed{20\\!:\\!34}$ or $\\boxed{8\\!:\\!34 \\text{ p.m.}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine what time it will be in 1234 minutes from now, we must first convert 1234 minutes into hours and minutes. \n\n1234 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour gives us 20 hours and 34 minutes. \n\nAdding 20 hours to the current time of midnight gives us a time of 8:00 PM the following day. Adding the remaining 34 minutes brings us to a final time of 8:34 PM. \n\nTherefore, it will be 8:34 PM in 1234 minutes from now.",
