    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. There is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.  What is the sum of those five prime numbers?",
    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, we can set up the following equation: \n\nLet the first prime number in the sequence be x. Thus, the five prime numbers are x, x+6, x+12, x+18, and x+24. \n\nSince all these numbers are prime, we can determine that x must be 5 (as it's the only prime number that can form a prime number when added to 6). \n\nTherefore, the five prime numbers are 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29. \n\nThe sum of these five prime numbers is 5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85. \n\nHence, the sum of the five prime numbers forming an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6 is 85.",
