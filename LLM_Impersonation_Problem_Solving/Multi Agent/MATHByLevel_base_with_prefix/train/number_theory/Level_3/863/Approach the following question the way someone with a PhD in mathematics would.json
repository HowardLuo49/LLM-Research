    "solution": "To be divisible by both 5 and 11, an integer must be a multiple of 55.  The smallest three-digit multiple of 55 is $2 \\cdot 55 = 110,$ and the largest three-digit multiple of 55 is $18 \\cdot 55 = 990$. So we can count the number of integers by the number of multiples, $2, 3, \\ldots , 17 , 18$, of which there are $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive three-digit integers that are divisible by both 11 and 5, we first need to find the multiples of 11 and 5 within the range of three-digit integers. \n\nFrom the multiples of 11, the smallest three-digit multiple is 99 and the largest is 990. Therefore, the set of three-digit multiples of 11 is {99, 110, 121, ..., 990}. \n\nFrom the multiples of 5, the smallest three-digit multiple is 100 and the largest is 995. Therefore, the set of three-digit multiples of 5 is {100, 105, 110, ..., 995}. \n\nTo find the common multiples of both 11 and 5, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 5, which is 55. Thus, the set of three-digit integers that are divisible by both 11 and 5 is {110, 165, 220, ..., 990}.\n\nTo calculate the total number of elements in this set, we need to find the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence starting from 110 to 990 with a common difference of 55. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\nNumber of terms = (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1\nNumber of terms = (990 - 110) / 55 + 1\nNumber of terms = 16 + 1\nNumber of terms = 17\n\nTherefore, there are 17 positive three-digit integers that are divisible by both 11 and 5.",
