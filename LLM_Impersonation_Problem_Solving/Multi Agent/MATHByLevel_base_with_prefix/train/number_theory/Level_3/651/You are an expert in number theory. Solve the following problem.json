    "gpt_response": "We can use the concept of modular arithmetic to solve this problem. \n\nFirst, note that $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, as $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nTherefore, $2^{19} = (2^3)^6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1^6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nThus, the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$ is $2$.",
