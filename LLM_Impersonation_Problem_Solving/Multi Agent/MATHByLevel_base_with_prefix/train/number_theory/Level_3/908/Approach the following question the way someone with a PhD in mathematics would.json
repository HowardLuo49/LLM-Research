    "solution": "First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. $5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all 6-digit multiples of 22 of the form $5d5,\\!22e$, we must first recognize that a number is divisible by 22 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. \n\nSince the number ends in 5, it must be divisible by 5. Additionally, in order for the number to be divisible by 2, the digit $e$ must be even. Therefore, the possible values for $e$ are 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNext, we check for divisibility by 11. The alternating sum of the digits in the number must be divisible by 11. So, $5+d+5-2-2-e$ must be divisible by 11, or $8-d-e$ must be divisible by 11. \n\nFrom this, we see that $d+e$ must be equivalent to $8$ mod $11$. The possible pairs for $(d,e)$ that satisfy this condition are $(1,7)$, $(2,6)$, $(3,5)$, $(4,4)$, $(5,3)$, $(6,2)$, $(7,1)$.\n\nHowever, we already know that $e$ can only take on the values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Therefore, among these pairs, only $(3,5)$ and $(5,3)$ are valid. \n\nTo find the maximum value of $d$, we look at the pair $(3,5)$. Therefore, the maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
