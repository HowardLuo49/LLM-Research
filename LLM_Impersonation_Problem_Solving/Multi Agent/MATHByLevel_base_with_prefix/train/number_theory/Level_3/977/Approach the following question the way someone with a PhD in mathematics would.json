    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.  In order for a number to be a perfect cube and a perfect square, it must be a perfect sixth power. Now we choose the smallest $a$ such that $n$ is four-digit: $2^6=64$, $3^6=729$, $4^6=4096$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{4096}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we first note that a perfect square is a number that can be written in the form n^2, where n is an integer, and a perfect cube is a number that can be written in the form n^3.\n\nTo find a four-digit number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we need to find a number that can be expressed as both n^2 and n^3, where n is an integer. In other words, we need to find a number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.\n\nSince the smallest four-digit whole number is 1000 and the largest four-digit whole number is 9999, we can start by trying to find the smallest four-digit number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. We can start by looking at the perfect squares between 1000 and 9999, which are the squares of integers from 31 to 99.\n\nAfter examining the perfect squares in this range, we find that the smallest four-digit number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 1728 = 12^3 = 36^2. Therefore, the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 1728.",
