    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Donna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts. Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.\n\nAfter eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
    "solution": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the number of doughnuts Donna has after eating one. Since $n$ boxes of doughnuts each have 13 doughnuts, we have $13n = x + 1$. \n\nAlso, we know that $x$ can be divided into bags of 9 doughnuts with none left over. This means $x$ is divisible by 9. \n\nFrom the first equation, we have $x = 13n - 1$. Since $x$ is divisible by 9, $13n - 1$ must also be divisible by 9. \n\nTherefore, $13n - 1$ is congruent to 0 (mod 9), which implies $13n$ is congruent to 1 (mod 9). Solving this congruence, we find $n$ is congruent to 4 (mod 9).\n\nThe smallest positive value of $n$ that satisfies this congruence is $\\boxed{4}$.",
