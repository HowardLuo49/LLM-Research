    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, we first need to count the perfect squares and perfect cubes separately.\n\nPerfect Squares:\nThere are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$, namely $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144$.\n\nPerfect Cubes:\nThere are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$, namely $1, 8, 27, 64, 125$.\n\nNow, to find the numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes (or both), we need to find the numbers that are repeated in both the lists. The numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes are $1$ and $64$.\n\nTherefore, the total numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes (or both) is $12 + 5 -2 = 15$.\n\nNow, the total numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes is $150 - 15 = 135$.\n\nSo, there are $135$ numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes.",
