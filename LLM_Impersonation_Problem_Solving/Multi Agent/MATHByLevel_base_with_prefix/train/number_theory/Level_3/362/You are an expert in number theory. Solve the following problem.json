    "solution": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer values of $x$ that will make $10 \\star x$ a positive integer, we need to solve the equation $10 \\star x = \\frac{10^2}{x}$. This expression will be a positive integer when $x$ evenly divides $10^2 = 100$.\n\nThe factors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{9}$ integer values of $x$ that will make $10 \\star x$ a positive integer.",
