    "solution": "The first ten positive composite integers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18. The desired quotient is $\\frac{4\\cdot6\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{12\\cdot14\\cdot15\\cdot16\\cdot18}$. After cancellation, we get $\\frac{1}{14\\cdot3}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{42}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to identify the first five positive composite integers, which are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The product of these integers is 4 x 6 x 8 x 9 x 10 = 17280.\n\nNext, we identify the next five composite integers after 10, which are 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. The product of these integers is 12 x 14 x 15 x 16 x 18 = 725760.\n\nTo find the desired ratio, we divide the product of the first five composite integers by the product of the next five composite integers:\n\n17280 / 725760 = 1 / 42\n\nTherefore, the answer expressed as a common fraction is 1/42.",
