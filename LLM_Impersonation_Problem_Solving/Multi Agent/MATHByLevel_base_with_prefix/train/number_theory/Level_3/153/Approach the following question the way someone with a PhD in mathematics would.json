    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77?",
    "solution": "Since $77=7\\cdot11$, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77. Their sum is $1+7+11+7\\cdot11=\\boxed{96}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77, we must first factorize 77 into its prime factors. 77 can be expressed as the product of 7 and 11, both of which are prime numbers.\n\nTo find the sum of all divisors, we can use the formula: (p^0 + p^1 + p^2 + ... + p^k) * (q^0 + q^1 + q^2 + ... + q^m) * ... * (r^0 + r^1 + r^2 + ... + r^n), where p,q,...,r are the prime factors of the number and the exponents k,m,...,n are the powers of the prime factors in the factorization.\n\nIn this case, the prime factorization of 77 is 7^1 * 11^1. Therefore, the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77 can be calculated as follows:\n\n(7^0 + 7^1) * (11^0 + 11^1) = (1 + 7) * (1 + 11) = 8 * 12 = 96\n\nSo, the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77 is 96.",
