    "solution": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting these two equations gives $99x = 42$, so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. Thus $a+b = 14+33 = \\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction that corresponds to the decimal $0.\\overline{42}$, we can let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting the original equation from this new one produces $99x = 42$, which simplifies to $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$.\n\nTherefore, the fraction corresponds to $0.\\overline{42}$ is $\\frac{14}{33}$. The sum of $a$ and $b$ is $14 + 33 = 47$.",
