    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, $a$ and $b$, we first need to find the prime factorization of both numbers. In this case, we have:\n\n$1729 = 7^3 \\cdot 13$\n$1768 = 2^3 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17$\n\nNext, we identify the common prime factors between the two numbers, which are $13$ in this case. To find the greatest common divisor, we take the product of these common prime factors raised to the smallest power they appear in each number. In this case, the greatest common divisor of $1729$ and $1768$ is $13$.",
