    "solution": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds. Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\\boxed{4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.}}$",
    "gpt_response": "Let us first determine how many seconds are in an hour: $60$ seconds in a minute $\\times 60$ minutes in an hour $= 3600$ seconds in an hour.\n\nSince $6666$ is greater than $3600$ but less than $7200$, we know that the time will not change by more than one hour.\n\nAfter $3600$ seconds, the time will be $4\\!:\\!00\\!:\\!00 \\text{ p.m.}$. \n\nTherefore, after an additional $6666 - 3600 = 3066$ seconds have passed, the time will be $4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06$. \n\nThus, the time will be $\\boxed{04:51:06}$.",
