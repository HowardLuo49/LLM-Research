    "solution": "First we convert to base 10, obtaining $427_8 = 4 \\cdot 8^2 + 2 \\cdot 8^1 + 7 \\cdot 8^0 = 279.$ Then we convert 279 to base 5 to get  \\begin{align*}\n279 &= 2 \\cdot 5^3 + 29 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 5^3 + 1 \\cdot 5^2 + 4 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 5^3 + 1 \\cdot 5^2 + 4 \\cdot 5^0 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2104_5}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $427_8$ to base 5, we first need to express $427_8$ in base 10. We can do this by calculating the value of each digit in the number:\n\n$4 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 7 \\times 8^0 = 256 + 16 + 7 = 279$\n\nNow that we have the decimal equivalent of $427_8$ as 279, we can convert this to base 5. To do this, we divide 279 by 5 and record the remainder at each step until the quotient becomes 0. \n\n279 divided by 5 is 55 with a remainder of 4, so the rightmost digit in the base 5 representation is 4. We then divide 55 by 5 to get a quotient of 11 and a remainder of 0. The next digit is 0. Finally, dividing 11 by 5 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1. The leftmost digit is 2. \n\nTherefore, $427_8$ in base 5 is $204_5$.",
