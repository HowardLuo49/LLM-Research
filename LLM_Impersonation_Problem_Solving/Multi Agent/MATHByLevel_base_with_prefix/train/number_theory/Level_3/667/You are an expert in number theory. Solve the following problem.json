    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A positive integer has exactly five distinct positive factors if and only if it is in the form of \\(p^4\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime number.\n\nTo find the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors, we need to find the smallest prime number raised to the power of 4. The smallest prime number is 2, so the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors is \\(2^4 = 16\\). \n\nTherefore, the answer is 16.",
