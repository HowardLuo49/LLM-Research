    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the prime factorization of an integer and its connection to the number of its distinct positive factors. \n\nAny positive integer can be expressed as the product of prime numbers raised to certain powers. Let's denote the prime factorization of an integer N as N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, where p1, p2, ..., pn are distinct prime numbers and a1, a2, ..., an are positive integers.\n\nThe number of distinct positive factors of N is given by (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)...(an + 1), which is derived from the multiplicative property of factors.\n\nFor an integer to have exactly five distinct positive factors, we need to find the prime factorization such that (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1) = 5.\n\nSince 5 is a prime number, we can express it as 5 = 1 * 5 = 5 * 1. This implies that the integer should be in the form of N = p1^0 * p2^4 or N = p1^4 * p2^0.\n\nIn either case, we have an integer with exactly five distinct positive factors. The smallest such integer can be obtained by choosing the smallest distinct prime numbers, which are 2 and 3. Therefore, the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors is 2^4 * 3^0 = 16.",
