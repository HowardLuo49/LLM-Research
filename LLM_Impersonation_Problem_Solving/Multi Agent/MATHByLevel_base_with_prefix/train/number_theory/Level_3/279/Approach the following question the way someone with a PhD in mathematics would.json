    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jenna collects stamps.  She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.  One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.  The other has 1008.  What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of stamps Jenna puts on each page.\n\nLet n be the number of pages in the stamp book with 840 stamps, and m be the number of pages in the stamp book with 1008 stamps.\n\nGiven that the total number of stamps in the book with 840 stamps is 840, we have the equation:\n\nn * x = 840\n\nSimilarly, for the book with 1008 stamps:\n\nm * x = 1008\n\nWe are looking for the largest possible value of x such that n and m are integers.\n\nWe can then find the factors of 840 and 1008 to determine the largest common factor. The largest common factor of 840 and 1008 is 168.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page is 168.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 168?: Let x be the number of stamps Jenna puts on each page.\n\nLet n be the number of pages in the stamp book with 840 stamps, and m be the number of pages in the stamp book with 1008 stamps.\n\nGiven that the total number of stamps in the book with 840 stamps is 840, we have the equation:\n\nn * x = 840\n\nSimilarly, for the book with 1008 stamps:\n\nm * x = 1008\n\nWe are looking for the largest possible value of x such that n and m are integers.\n\nWe can then find the factors of 840 and 1008 to determine the largest common factor.
