    "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, the problem amounts to finding the greatest multiple of $3\\cdot4=12$ less than 500. Since $500\\div12=41R8$, our answer is $12\\cdot41=\\boxed{492}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than 500 and also a multiple of 4, we need to find the largest number that is divisible by both 3 and 4.\n\nFirst, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4, which is 12. This means that any number that is divisible by both 3 and 4 will also be divisible by 12.\n\nNext, we find the greatest multiple of 12 that is less than 500. To do this, we divide 500 by 12 and round down to the nearest whole number:\n\n500 \u00f7 12 \u2248 41.6667\n\nTherefore, the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than 500 and is also a multiple of 4 is 12 x 41 = 492.\n\nSo, the answer is 492.",
