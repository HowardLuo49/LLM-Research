    "solution": "The least common multiple of these integers is $4\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$. Thus, a positive integer that is one more than a multiple of all the given integers is $60+1=\\boxed{61}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find a two-digit positive integer that satisfies the given conditions, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The LCM of these numbers is 60. \n\nSince we are looking for a number that is one more than a multiple of 60, we can express this as \\(60n + 1\\), where n is a positive integer. We need to find the smallest n that produces a two-digit positive integer.\n\nBy trial and error, we can find that when n = 1, 60(1) + 1 = 61 is the smallest two-digit positive integer that satisfies the conditions.
