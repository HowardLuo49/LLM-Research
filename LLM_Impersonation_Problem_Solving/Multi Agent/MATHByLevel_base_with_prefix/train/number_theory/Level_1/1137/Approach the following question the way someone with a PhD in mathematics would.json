    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A positive two-digit number is even and is a multiple of 11. The product of its digits is a perfect cube. What is this two-digit number?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two-digit number be denoted by N = 10a + b, where a and b represent the tens and units digits respectively. We are given that N is even, a multiple of 11, and that the product of its digits is a perfect cube.\n\nSince N is even, b must be even as well. This means that b can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nSince N is a multiple of 11, we have the equation N = 11k, where k is an integer. Substituting N = 10a + b into this equation gives 10a + b = 11k, which implies that b = 11k - 10a.\n\nNow, we know that the product of the digits a and b is a perfect cube. This means that ab = m^3, where m is an integer. Substituting b = 11k - 10a into this equation gives a(11k - 10a) = m^3, which simplifies to 11ak - 10a^2 = m^3.\n\nSince a is a digit, it must be between 1 and 9. By trial and error, we can find that a = 4, b = 8 satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the two-digit number we are looking for is 48.",
