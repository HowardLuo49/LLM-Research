    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 25\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 20\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 3\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 25+20+3 \\\\\n&= 48\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$. This remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the three integers, we can add the remainders: $25 + 20 + 3 = 48$.\n\nWe know that when a number is divided by 47, the remainder can be at most 46 (since 47 is the divisor). Therefore, the sum of the three integers has a remainder of 48 when divided by 47. \n\nHowever, since 48 is greater than 47, we need to find the remainder when 48 is divided by 47. \n\nDividing 48 by 47, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by 47 is $1$.",
