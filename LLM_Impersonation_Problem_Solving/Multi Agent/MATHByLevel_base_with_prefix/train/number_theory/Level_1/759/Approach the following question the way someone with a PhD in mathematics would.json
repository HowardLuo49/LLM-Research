    "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $3\\cdot4=12$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 30 and 40 is 120.  Since $\\boxed{120}$ is not divisible by 16, it is the smallest common multiple of 30 and 40 which is not divisible by 16.\n\nNote: Every common multiple of two integers is a multiple of their least common multiple.  Therefore, it is not possible that the least common multiple is divisible by 16 but some other common multiple is not.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 40. \n\nThe prime factorization of 30 is 2*3*5, while the prime factorization of 40 is 2*2*2*5. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number: 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the LCM of 30 and 40 is 120. \n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 120 but not a multiple of 16. \n\nSince 16 is a factor of 120 (120 = 8 * 15), any multiple of 120 will also be a multiple of 16. \n\nThus, there is no smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16, as any multiple of 120 will necessarily also be a multiple of 16.",
