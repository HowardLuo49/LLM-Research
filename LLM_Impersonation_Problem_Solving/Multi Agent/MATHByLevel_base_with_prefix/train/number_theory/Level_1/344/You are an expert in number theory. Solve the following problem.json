    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit multiple of 19, we need to find the largest multiple of 19 that is less than 1000. \n\nDividing 1000 by 19, we get 52 with a remainder of 12. This means that the largest multiple of 19 that is less than 1000 is 19*52 = 988. \n\nTherefore, the greatest three-digit multiple of 19 is 988.",
