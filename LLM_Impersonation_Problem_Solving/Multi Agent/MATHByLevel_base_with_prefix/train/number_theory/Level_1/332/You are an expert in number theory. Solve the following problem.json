    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit number which is a multiple of 13, we need to find the largest multiple of 13 that is less than 1000. \n\nDividing 1000 by 13 gives us a quotient of 76 with a remainder of 12. This means the largest multiple of 13 less than 1000 is 13 * 76 = 988.\n\nTherefore, the greatest three-digit number which is a multiple of 13 is 988.",
