    "solution": "Since 1001 is $7\\cdot11\\cdot13$, we know that 1001 is a multiple of 13.  The greatest 3-digit multiple of 13 is therefore \\[1001-13=\\boxed{988}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13, we first need to determine the largest three-digit number possible. The largest three-digit number is 999. \n\nTo find the largest multiple of 13 that is less than or equal to 999, we divide 999 by 13 and find the greatest integer that results in a whole number. \n\n999 \u00f7 13 = 76.84\n\nSince we're looking for the greatest integer, we round down to the nearest whole number: 76.\n\nWe then multiply 13 by 76 to find the largest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13:\n\n13 * 76 = 988\n\nTherefore, the greatest three-digit number that is a multiple of 13 is 988.",
