    "solution": "Notice that we can pair many of these terms: \\[1+7=2+6=3+5=8,\\]so the remainder we want is the same as the remainder when $4+9+10$ is divided by 8.  We also see that this is the remainder when  \\[4+1+2=7\\]is divided by 8, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8, we can first find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 and then find the remainder when this sum is divided by 8.\n\nThe sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is $\\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2} = 55$.\n\nNow, we divide 55 by 8. We find that 55 divided by 8 is 6 with a remainder of 7. Therefore, the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
