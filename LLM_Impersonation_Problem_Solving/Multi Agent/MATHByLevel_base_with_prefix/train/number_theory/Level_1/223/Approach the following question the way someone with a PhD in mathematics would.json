    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given. What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?",
    "solution": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the original number $n$ as $n=6k+1$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6. Substituting $n=6k+1$ into $n+2010$, we get:\n\n$n+2010 = 6k+1+2010$\n$n+2010 = 6k+2011$\n$n+2010 = 6(k+335)+1$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6 is 1.\n\nIn conclusion, when $n$ is divided by 6 with a remainder of 1, then $n+2010$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6.",
