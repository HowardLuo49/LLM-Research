Therefore, we need to check all numbers between 1 and 25 to see which ones meet this criteria.\n\nThe prime numbers between 1 and 25 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.\n\nThe smallest prime number on Cory's list is 2, and the largest is 23.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the smallest prime number (2) and the largest prime number (23) on Cory's list is 2 + 23 = 25.",
