    "solution": "Since $100=33\\cdot3+1$, the first $100$ letters are $33$ copies of the $3$ letters $ABC$ followed by an $A$.  The $100$th letter is $\\boxed{A}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The pattern repeats every 3 letters, so we need to find the remainder when 100 is divided by 3. \n\n100 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. \n\nTherefore, the 100th letter in the pattern is the 1st letter which is 'A'.",
