    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. When $a$ is divided by 45, the remainder is 37. This can be written as: $a \\equiv 37 \\pmod{45}$.\n\n2. When $b$ is divided by 30, the remainder is 9. This can be written as: $b \\equiv 9 \\pmod{30}$.\n\nNow we want to find the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 15. To do this, we can add the congruences for $a$ and $b$: \n$a + b \\equiv 37 + 9 \\equiv 46 \\pmod{45}$.\n\nNow, we can simplify $46 \\pmod{45}$ to get the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 15: $46 = 45 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{45}$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 15 is 1.",
