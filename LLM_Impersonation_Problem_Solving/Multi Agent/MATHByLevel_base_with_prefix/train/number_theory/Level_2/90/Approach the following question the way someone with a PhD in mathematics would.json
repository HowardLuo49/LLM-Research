    "solution": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the product $1734\\times 5389 \\times 80,607$ is divided by 10, we can consider the remainders of each individual factor when divided by 10.\n\nFirst, we find the remainder of each factor when divided by 10:\n$1734 \\mod 10 = 4$\n$5389 \\mod 10 = 9$\n$80,607 \\mod 10 = 7$\n\nNext, we find the product of these remainders:\n$4 \\times 9 \\times 7 = 252$\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 252 is divided by 10:\n$252 \\mod 10 = 2$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product $1734\\times 5389 \\times 80,\\!607$ is divided by 10 is 2.",
