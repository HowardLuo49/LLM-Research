    "solution": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the product $1734 \\times 5389 \\times 80,607$ is divided by 10, we can first find the remainder when each of the numbers is divided by 10 individually, and then multiply those remainders together.\n\nFirst, let's find the remainder when each number is divided by 10:\n$1734 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$\n$5389 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}$\n$80,607 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10}$\n\nNow, let's multiply the remainders together:\n$4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\equiv 252 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product $1734 \\times 5389 \\times 80,607$ is divided by 10 is 2.",
