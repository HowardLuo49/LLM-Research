    "solution": "The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $24$ is equal to $(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 3)$, as each factor of $24$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the sum of the factors of 24 is $(1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3) = (15)(4)$, or $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3. \n\nTo find the sum of the positive factors of 24, we can use the formula for the sum of divisors of a number.
