    "solution": "Consider the differences between consecutive prime numbers and look for the first difference of 6 or greater.  The first several prime numbers are \\[\n2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, 37,\\ldots,\n\\] and the differences between consecutive terms of this sequence are  \\[\n1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,\\ldots.\n\\] The first appearance of a difference of 6 or greater occurs between 23 and $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet's start by listing the natural numbers in ascending order:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...\n\nWe are looking for the smallest prime number that occurs after a sequence of five consecutive positive integers that are all nonprime.\n\nThe first five consecutive positive integers that are nonprime are:\n\n1, 4, 6, 8, 9\n\nAfter these numbers, the next number is 10, which is also nonprime. The next number after that is 11, which is the smallest prime number that occurs after the sequence of five consecutive positive integers that are all nonprime.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11.",
