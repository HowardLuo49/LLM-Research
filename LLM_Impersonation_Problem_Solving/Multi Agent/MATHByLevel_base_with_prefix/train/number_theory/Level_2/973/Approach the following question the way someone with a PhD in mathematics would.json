    "solution": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the time on a 12-hour clock 2004 hours from now, we must divide 2004 by 12 to account for each complete revolution of the clock. \n\n2004 \u00f7 12 = 167 with a remainder of 0. \n\nThis implies that after 167 full revolutions of the clock, the time will be the same as it is now. \n\nThus, the time on a 12-hour clock 2004 hours from now will be 9 o'clock.",
