    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $12$ are $2,3,5,7,11$. Since $2$ is the only even prime out of the five primes less than $12$, the answer is $\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{20}{100}=\\boxed{20\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime numbers less than 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Only one of these prime numbers, 2, is divisible by 2.\n\nTherefore, 1 out of 5 prime numbers less than 12 is divisible by 2.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we can calculate:\n(1/5) * 100% = 20%\n\nSo, 20% of the prime numbers less than 12 are divisible by 2.",
