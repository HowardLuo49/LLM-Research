    "solution": "Note that $16^2 = 256 < 273$ while $17^2 = 289 > 273$.  Since all other perfect squares are farther away from $273$, our answer is the closer of these two, $\\boxed{289}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the perfect square integer closest to 273, we first need to identify the perfect squares that are greater and less than 273. The square root of 273 is approximately 16.52, indicating that the perfect square closest to 273 is 17^2, which equals 289. Thus, the perfect square integer closest to 273 is 289.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 289?: To find the perfect square integer closest to 273, we first need to identify the perfect squares that are greater and less than 273. The square root of 273 is approximately 16.52, indicating that the perfect square closest to 273 is 17^2, which equals 289. Thus, the perfect square integer closest to 273 is 289.",
