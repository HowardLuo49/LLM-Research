    "solution": "Terminating decimals can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{10^b}$. So, we try to get our fraction in this form: $$\\frac{11}{125} = \\frac{11}{5^3} = \\frac{11}{5^3} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3} = \\frac{11\\cdot2^3}{10^3} = \\frac{88}{1000} = \\boxed{0.088}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the terminating decimal expansion of $\\frac{11}{125}$, we need to divide 11 by 125. \n\nStart by performing the long division:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|l l}\n0.088 & 11.000 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-3}\n& 1.0 & \\\\\n& -0.88 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-2}\n& 0.120 & \\\\\n& -0.125 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-2}\n& 0.0070 & \\\\\n& -0.0062 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-2}\n& 0.00080 & \\\\\n& -0.00075 & \\\\\n\\cline{2-2}\n& 0.000050 & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe division terminates when we get a remainder of 0.
