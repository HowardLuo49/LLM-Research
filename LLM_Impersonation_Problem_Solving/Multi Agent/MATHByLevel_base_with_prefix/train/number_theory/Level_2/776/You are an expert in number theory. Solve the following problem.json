    "solution": "An integer is a multiple of 15 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5.  The multiple of 5 closest to 2009 is 2010, and since $2+0+1+0$ is divisible by 3, $\\boxed{2010}$ is divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the multiple of 15 that is closest to 2009, we can divide 2009 by 15 and round to the nearest whole number. \n\n2009/15 \u2248 133.93333333\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get 134.\n\nTherefore, the multiple of 15 that is closest to 2009 is 15 x 134 = 2010.",
