    "solution": "The prime numbers are $23$ and $29$. Since $29-23=6$, the mean is $\\frac62=3$ numbers away from $23$ and from $29$. The mean is $\\boxed{26}$. We can also find the mean of $23$ and $29$ with $\\frac{29+23}{2}=\\frac{52}{2}=26$ or just by noticing that the number in the middle of $23$ and $29$ is $26$.",
