When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the number of dimes Natasha has. Since Natasha has more than $\\$1$, we know that $x > 10$. We can also express the value of Natasha's dimes in terms of cents, so the value of dimes Natasha has is $10x$ cents. Additionally, we know that $10x < 100$ since Natasha has less than $\\$10$ worth of dimes.\n\nGiven the conditions, we can set up the following system of congruences:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can combine these congruences to find the solution. \nFirst, we look for a number that satisfies the first two congruences:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe find that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$ is a solution. Next, we find a number that satisfies the third congruence:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{12} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe find that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{60}$ is a solution. Therefore, Natasha has $x = 1 \\mod{60}$ dimes. Since $10x$ cents is less than $100$ cents, we find that Natasha has $60 + 1 = 61$ dimes.",
