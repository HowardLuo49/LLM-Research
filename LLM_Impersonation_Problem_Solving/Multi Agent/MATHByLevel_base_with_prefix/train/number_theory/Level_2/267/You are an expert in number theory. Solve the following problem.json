    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's suppose there are x rows of 8 people and y rows of 7 people. \n\nSince each row seats 7 or 8 people, we have the equation:\nx + y = total number of rows\n\nAlso, since there are 46 people in total, we have:\n8x + 7y = 46\n\nNow we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.\n\nFrom the first equation x + y = total number of rows, we know that x = total number of rows - y.\n\nSubstitute x = total number of rows - y into the second equation:\n8(total number of rows - y) + 7y = 46\n8total number of rows - 8y + 7y = 46\n8total number of rows - y = 46\ny = 8total number of rows - 46\n\nSince y must be a whole number, there are no rows of 7 people if there are only 46 people seated. This means that there are no rows of 7 people and all rows seat exactly 8 people.\n\nTherefore, the number of rows that seat exactly 8 people is equal to the total number of rows. So, the answer is 46.",
