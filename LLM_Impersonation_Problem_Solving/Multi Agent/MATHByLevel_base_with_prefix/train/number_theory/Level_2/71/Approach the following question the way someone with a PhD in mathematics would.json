    "solution": "The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many two-digit numbers can be written in the form $2^n$, where $n$ is an integer, we must first consider the range of values that $n$ can take on. Since we are looking for two-digit numbers, the smallest possible value for $n$ would be when $2^n$ is just barely greater than 9 (the smallest two-digit number). This occurs when $n = 4$ because $2^4 = 16$. Similarly, the largest possible value for $n$ would be when $2^n$ is just barely less than 100 (the largest two-digit number). This occurs when $n = 6$ because $2^6 = 64$.\n\nTherefore, the range of valid values for $n$ is from 4 to 6, inclusive. This means that there are 3 possible values for $n$ (4, 5, and 6) for which $2^n$ results in a two-digit number. Hence, there are 3 two-digit numbers that can be written in the form $2^n$ where $n$ is an integer.",
