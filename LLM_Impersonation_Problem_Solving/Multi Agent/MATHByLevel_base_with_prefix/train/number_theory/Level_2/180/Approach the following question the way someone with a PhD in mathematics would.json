    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares?",
    "solution": "Squares of perfect squares are fourth powers. $1^4=1$, $2^4=16$, and $3^4=81$ are the only fourth powers less than 100. Their sum is $1+16+81=\\boxed{98}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to find the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares, we first need to identify which integers satisfy this condition. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. In this case, we are looking for numbers that are the squares of perfect squares, or numbers of the form (n^2)^2 = n^4, where n is an integer.\n\nThe perfect squares less than 10 are 1, 4, and 9. Squaring these perfect squares, we find that 1^4 = 1, 2^4 = 16, and 3^4 = 81. Therefore, the integers that are squares of perfect squares and less than 100 are 1, 16, and 81.\n\nTo find the sum of these numbers, we simply add them together: 1 + 16 + 81 = 98. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares is 98.",
