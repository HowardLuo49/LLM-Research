    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Every bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to understand the concept of division with remainders. When dividing a number by another number, the remainder is the amount left over after the division is completed.\n\nLet's denote the number of Dummies in one bag as $d$. Given that the Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, we have the equation:\n\n$d \\equiv 7 \\pmod 9$\n\nThis means that the number of Dummies in one bag leaves a remainder of $7$ when divided by $9$. In other words, we can express $d$ as:\n\n$d = 9k + 7$\n\nwhere $k$ is an integer representing the number of times $9$ divides $d$ perfectly with a remainder of $7$.\n\nNow, when dividing the Dummies in three bags equally among $9$ kids, we need to consider the total number of Dummies. This total number $3d$ must also satisfy the condition of leaving a remainder when divided by $9$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$3d = 3(9k + 7) = 27k + 21 \\equiv 21 \\pmod 9$\n\nThis tells us that when dividing the Dummies in three bags among $9$ kids, there will be $21$ Dummies left over. Therefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over is $\\boxed{21}$.",
