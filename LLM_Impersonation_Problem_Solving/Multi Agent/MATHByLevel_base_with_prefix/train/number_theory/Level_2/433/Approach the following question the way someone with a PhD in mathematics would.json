    "solution": "$4444_8=4\\cdot8^3+4\\cdot8^2+4\\cdot8^1+4\\cdot8^0=2048+256+32+4=2340_{10}$. Therefore, Kate will have $2340-1000=\\boxed{1340}$ dollars for lodging and food.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert the amount saved by Kate from base eight to base ten. \n\n$4444_8 = 4*8^3 + 4*8^2 + 4*8^1 + 4*8^0 = 2048 + 256 + 32 + 4 = 2340_{10}$ dollars saved by Kate.\n\nSubtracting the cost of the airline ticket from the amount saved:\n\n2340 - 1000 = 1340\n\nTherefore, Kate will have $1340_{10}$ dollars left for lodging and food after purchasing the round-trip airline ticket.",
