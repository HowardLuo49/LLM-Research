    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive factors does 30 have?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5. Thus, there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors of 30. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive factors of 30, we first factorize 30 as a product of its prime factors. \n\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n\nFor each prime factor, we have the option to include it or not in the calculation of divisors. Thus, the total number of factors of 30 can be calculated by multiplying the count of each prime factor's powers incremented by 1: \n\n(1+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, 30 has 8 positive factors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.",
