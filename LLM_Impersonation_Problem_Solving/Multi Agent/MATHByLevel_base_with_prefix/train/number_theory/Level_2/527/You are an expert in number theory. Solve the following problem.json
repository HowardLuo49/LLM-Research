    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. For the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.\n\nEvery 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\n\nEvery 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.\n\nThe stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game. How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 75, 30, and 50. \n\nThe LCM of 75, 30, and 50 is 150. This means that every 150th fan will receive all three free items.\n\nSince the stadium holds 4000 fans, we can calculate how many fans will receive all three free items by dividing 4000 by 150:\n\n4000 / 150 = 26.6666666...\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a fan, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means that 26 fans will receive all three free items at the game.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 26?: To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 75, 30, and 50. \n\nThe LCM of 75, 30, and 50 is 150.
