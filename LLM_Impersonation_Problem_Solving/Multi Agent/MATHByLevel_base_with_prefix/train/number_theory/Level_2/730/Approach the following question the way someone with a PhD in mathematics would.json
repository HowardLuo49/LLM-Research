    "solution": "For a base $b$ representation of $100_{10}$ to have exactly $5$ digits, the largest power of $b$ that is less than $100$ must be $4$. Therefore, we have the requirement that $b^4 \\le 100 < b^5$. We then realize that $b=3$ satisfies this requirement since $3^4 < 100 < 3^5$. We also realize that this is the only possible value of $b$ since if $b$ were equal to $2$, $b^5 = 2^5$ would be less than $100$ and if $b$ were equal to $4$, $b^4 = 4^4$ would be greater than $100$. Thus, our only solution is $b = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $b$ be the base in which the number $100_{10}$ has exactly $5$ digits. In base $b$, the number $100_{10}$ is represented as $1b^4 + 0b^3 + 0b^2 + 0b + 0 = b^4$. \n\nSince $b^4$ has exactly $5$ digits in base $b$, we have $b^4 \\geq b^4$, $b > 0$, and $b^{4} < b^5$. This implies that $b \\leq 9$. \n\nFurthermore, $b^4$ has exactly $5$ digits in base $b$ implies $b^4 < b^5$, which means $b < b^b$. By observation, $b = 2$ satisfies this inequality. \n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $2$.",
