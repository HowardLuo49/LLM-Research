    "solution": "We compute the powers of 5 modulo 1000: \\begin{align*}\n5^0&\\equiv1\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^1&\\equiv5\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^2&\\equiv25\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^3&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^4&\\equiv625\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^5&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\n\\end{align*} This pattern repeats every two terms starting at the 4th term.  In particular, when $n>2$, and $n$ is odd,  \\[5^n\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\\] Therefore the rightmost digit of $5^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{125}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$, we can first consider the patterns that emerge when taking powers of 5. We know that the units digit of any power of 5 will always be 5. To find the rightmost three digits, we can focus on finding the last three digits by looking at the powers of 5 modulo 1000.\n\nSince we are looking for the last three digits, we will consider the powers of 5 modulo 1000. We can start by calculating the powers of 5 modulo 1000:\n\n$5^1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{1000}$<br>\n$5^2 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{1000}$<br>\n$5^3 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 125 \\pmod{1000}$<br>\n$5^4 \\equiv 625 \\pmod{1000}$<br>\n$5^5 \\equiv 3125 \\equiv 125 \\pmod{1000}$<br>\n$5^6 \\equiv 625 \\pmod{1000}$<br>\n$5^7 \\equiv 3125 \\equiv 125 \\pmod{1000}$<br>\n\nWe can see that there is a pattern where the powers of 5 repeat every 4 steps. This is because of Euler's theorem, which states that for any base $a$ coprime to $m$, $a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$ where $\\phi(m)$ is the Euler's totient function.\n\nTo find the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$, we can express $1993$ as $4q + r$, where $q$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder when $1993$ is divided by $4$. In this case, $1993 = 4(498) + 1$, so we are looking for the remainder when $5^{1993}$ is divided by 1000.\n\nSince the remainder when dividing by 4 is 1, we need to find $5^1 = 5$ when divided by 1000. Therefore, the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$ are $005$.",
