    "solution": "We must check whether or not the difference between 40 and each of the prime numbers less than 20 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) is prime. We find that only $40-3=37$, $40-11=29$, and $40-17=23$ are prime. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ pairs of prime numbers have a sum of 40.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime numbers that add up to 40 are 3 and 37. However, since the question is asking for unordered pairs, the pair {3, 37} is the same as {37, 3}. Therefore, there is only one unordered pair of prime numbers that have a sum of 40.",

However, since the question is asking for unordered pairs, the pair {3, 37} is the same as {37, 3}. Therefore, there is only one unordered pair of prime numbers that have a sum of 40.",
