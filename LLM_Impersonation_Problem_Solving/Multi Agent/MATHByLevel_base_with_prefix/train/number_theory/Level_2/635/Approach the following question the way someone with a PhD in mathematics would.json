    "solution": "We must check whether or not the difference between 40 and each of the prime numbers less than 20 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) is prime. We find that only $40-3=37$, $40-11=29$, and $40-17=23$ are prime. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ pairs of prime numbers have a sum of 40.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the two prime numbers in the unordered pair as p and q. Since the sum of the two prime numbers is 40, we have the equation:\n\np + q = 40\n\nNow, since p and q are prime numbers, they must both be greater than 0. It is also known that both p and q must be odd numbers (since 2 is the only even prime number). \n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nq = 40 - p\n\nGiven that p and q are both prime numbers and q is an odd number, we can start by testing values of p starting from 3 (the smallest odd prime number) up to 37 (the largest prime number less than 40).\n\nBy plugging in the values of p from 3 to 37 into the equation q = 40 - p, we can find the corresponding values of q. Checking whether both p and q are prime numbers, we can identify the pairs of prime numbers that sum up to 40.\n\nAt the end of this process, we would have identified all the unordered pairs of prime numbers that satisfy the given conditions.",
