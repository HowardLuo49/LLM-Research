    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Winnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.  With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.  Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.  How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the total number of lollipops Winnie has: \n\n45 (cherry) + 116 (wintergreen) + 4 (grape) + 229 (shrimp cocktail) = 394 lollipops\n\nNext, we need to find out how many lollipops each friend receives: \n\n394 lollipops / 11 friends = 35 lollipops per friend\n\nSince each friend receives 35 lollipops, Winnie gives away:\n11 friends * 35 lollipops = 385 lollipops\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping:\n394 lollipops - 385 lollipops = 9 lollipops\n\nWinnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 9?: First, we need to find the total number of lollipops Winnie has: \n\n45 (cherry) + 116 (wintergreen) + 4 (grape) + 229 (shrimp cocktail) = 394 lollipops\n\nNext, we need to find out how many lollipops each friend receives: \n\n394 lollipops / 11 friends = 35 lollipops per friend\n\nSince each friend receives 35 lollipops, Winnie gives away:\n11 friends * 35 lollipops = 385 lollipops\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping:\n394 lollipops - 385 lollipops = 9 lollipops\n\nWinnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself.",
