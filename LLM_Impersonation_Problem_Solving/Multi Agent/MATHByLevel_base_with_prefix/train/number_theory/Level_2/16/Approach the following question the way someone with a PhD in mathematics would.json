    "solution": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of distinct, positive factors of the number 1100, we can factorize 1100 into its prime factors: $1100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 11$.\n\nA factor of 1100 must be of the form $2^a \\times 5^b \\times 11^c$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 2$, $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$, and $0 \\leq c \\leq 1$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct positive factors of 1100 can be calculated as $(2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 18$ factors.\n\nThus, there are 18 distinct positive factors of 1100.",
