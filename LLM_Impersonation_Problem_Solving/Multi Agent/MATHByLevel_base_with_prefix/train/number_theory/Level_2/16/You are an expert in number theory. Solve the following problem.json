    "solution": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct positive factors of 1100, we first prime factorize it. \n\n$1100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 11$\n\nTo find the number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and multiply the results together. \n\nTherefore, the number of distinct positive factors of 1100 is \n\n$(2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 18$ \n\nSo, 1100 has 18 distinct positive factors.",
