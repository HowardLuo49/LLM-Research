    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A Mersenne prime is defined to be a prime number of the form $2^n - 1$, where $n$ must itself be a prime. For example, since $2^3 - 1 = 7$, and 3 is a prime number, 7 is a Mersenne prime. What is the largest Mersenne prime less than 200?",
    "solution": "The largest Mersenne Prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = \\boxed{127}$. The next possible Mersenne Prime, $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$, is much too large (and is not prime).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest Mersenne prime less than 200, we need to test each potential Mersenne prime of the form $2^n - 1$ where $n$ is a prime less than 200. \n\nWe will start by generating a list of prime numbers less than 200, then for each prime $n$ in this list, we will compute $2^n - 1$ and check if the result is prime using a primality test such as the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\nCalculating the Mersenne primes for each prime $n$, we find that the largest Mersenne prime less than 200 is $2^{7} - 1 = 127$.
