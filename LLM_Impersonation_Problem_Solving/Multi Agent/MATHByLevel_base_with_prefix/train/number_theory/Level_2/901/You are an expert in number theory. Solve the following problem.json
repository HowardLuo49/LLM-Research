    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. How many distinct positive factors does 32 have?",
    "solution": "Since 32 is a power of 2, its only factors are the powers of 2 less than or equal to it.  These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, so there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive factors of 32.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of 32 is 2^5. \n\nTo find the number of distinct positive factors of 32, we add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization (in this case, 5) and multiply them all together. \n\nSo, the number of distinct positive factors of 32 is (5+1) = 6. \n\nTherefore, 32 has 6 distinct positive factors.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 6?: The prime factorization of 32 is 2^5. \n\nTo find the number of distinct positive factors of 32, we add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization (in this case, 5) and multiply them all together. \n\nSo, the number of distinct positive factors of 32 is (5+1) = 6. \n\nTherefore, 32 has 6 distinct positive factors.",
