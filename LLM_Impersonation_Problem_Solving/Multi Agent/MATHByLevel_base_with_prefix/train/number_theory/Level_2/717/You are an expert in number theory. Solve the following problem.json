A bag of grapes is to be distributed evenly to 5 kids in a class, and the grapes that are left over will be thrown out. If each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, what is the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out?",
    "solution": "If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number.  On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student.  So $\\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of grapes in the bag as \\(N\\). We want to find the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out.\n\nWe know that the grapes need to be distributed evenly among 5 kids, meaning that each student will receive \\(\\frac{N}{5}\\) grapes.\n\nIf each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, then the number of grapes left over must be the remainder when \\(N\\) is divided by 5.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out is the maximum remainder we can get when dividing \\(N\\) by 5.\n\nThe remainder can range from 0 to 4. To maximize the remainder, we choose the largest possible value of the remainder, which is 4.\n\nHence, the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out is 4 grapes.",
