    "solution": "Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$.  We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive two-digit integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8, we can use the formula for integer division: dividend = divisor * quotient + remainder.\n\nLet n be the two-digit integer that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8. Then we can express n as:\nn = 8q + 2,\n\nwhere q is the quotient when n is divided by 8.\n\nTo find the smallest two-digit integer that satisfies this condition, we plug in n = 10 (the smallest two-digit integer) into the equation:\n10 = 8q + 2,\n8q = 8,\nq = 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest two-digit integer that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8 is 10.\n\nTo find the largest two-digit integer that satisfies this condition, we plug in n = 99 (the largest two-digit integer) into the equation:\n99 = 8q + 2,\n8q = 97,\nq = 12.\n\nTherefore, the largest two-digit integer that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8 is 98.\n\nTherefore, the two-digit integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8 are: 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, 98. \n\nThere are a total of 12 positive two-digit integers that satisfy this condition.",
