    "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors, we will consider the prime factorization of a general positive integer. Let's denote this integer as n and represent its prime factorization as:\n\nn = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak\n\nwhere p1, p2, ..., pk are distinct prime numbers and a1, a2, ..., ak are positive integers.\n\nThe number of factors of n can be calculated using the formula:\n\n#(factors of n) = (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (ak + 1)\n\nGiven that we want exactly eight distinct positive factors, we have the following possibilities:\n\n1. a1 = 7\n    #(factors of n) = (7 + 1) = 8\n    n = p1^7\n\n2. a1 = 1, a2 = 3\n    #(factors of n) = (1 + 1) * (3 + 1) = 8\n    n = p1 * p2^3\n\n3. a1 = 1, a2 = 1, a3 = 1\n    #(factors of n) = (1 + 1) * (1 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 8\n    n = p1 * p2 * p3\n\nTherefore, considering the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5), the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors is:\n\nn = 2^3 * 3 = 24",
