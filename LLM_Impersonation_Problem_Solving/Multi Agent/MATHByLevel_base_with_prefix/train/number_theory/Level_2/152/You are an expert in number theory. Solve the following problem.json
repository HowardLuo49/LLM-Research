    "solution": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is $0.\\overline{324}$. When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\\left( 308\\div 3=102 \\ R2\\right)$. Therefore the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the second digit of $324$, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point when $\\frac{12}{37}$ is expressed as a decimal, we can do long division to compute the decimal expansion. \n\nLet's start by calculating the first few digits after the decimal point:\n\n$ 12 \\div 37 = 0.324\\dots$\n\nAfter calculating a few more digits, we see that there is a repeating decimal pattern of 3 digits: 243.\n\nNow, we need to find the position of the 308th digit in this repeating pattern. Since 308 is divisible by 3, the digit in the 308th position will be the same as the 3rd position.
