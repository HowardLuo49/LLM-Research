    "solution": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes, we can consider the prime numbers in ascending order starting from 2. \n\nThe first three distinct prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5. To find the least positive integer divisible by these three primes, we can simply multiply them together. \n\nThus, the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes is 2 x 3 x 5 = 30. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes is 30.",
