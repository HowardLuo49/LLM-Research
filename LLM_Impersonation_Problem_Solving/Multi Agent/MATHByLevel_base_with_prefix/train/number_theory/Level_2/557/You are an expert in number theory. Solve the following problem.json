    "solution": "The units digit of any positive integer power of 5 is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(Note: this claim may be proved by induction, since the units digit of $5n$ is 5 whenever the units digit of $n$ is 5.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $5^4$, we first need to calculate $5^4 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$.\n\nSince we are only interested in the units digit, we can ignore the hundreds and tens place and focus on the units digit. In this case, the units digit of $625$ is $5$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit when $5^4$ is multiplied out is $\\boxed{5}$.",
