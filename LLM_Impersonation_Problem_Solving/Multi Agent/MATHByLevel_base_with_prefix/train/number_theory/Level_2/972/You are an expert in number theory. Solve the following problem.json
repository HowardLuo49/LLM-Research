    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Fifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box. One card is randomly selected. What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to identify the primes between 1 and 50 that are multiples of 7. These primes are 7 and 43.\n\nSince there are 2 cards that meet our criteria and a total of 50 cards, the probability of randomly selecting a card that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is:\n\n2/50 = 1/25\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/25.",
