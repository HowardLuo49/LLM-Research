    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. It takes exactly 74 colored beads on a string to make a necklace. The beads are strung in the following order: one red, one orange, two yellow, one green, and one blue. Then the pattern repeats starting again with one red bead. If the first bead of the necklace is red, what is the color of the last bead used to make the necklace?",
    "solution": "The pattern repeats every $1+1+2+1+1=6$ beads. Since $72=6\\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern). The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\\boxed{\\text{orange}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the color of the last bead used to make the necklace, we need to find the residue of 74 divided by the total number of beads in the pattern, which is 6 beads (1 red + 1 orange + 2 yellow + 1 green + 1 blue).\n\n74 divided by 6 leaves a residue of 2. This means that after completing as many full cycles of the pattern as possible, there are 2 beads remaining at the end.\n\nStarting with the first bead being red, the pattern would go as follows:\n1. Red \n2. Orange\n3. Yellow\n4. Yellow\n5. Green\n6. Blue\n\nSince we have a residue of 2, the next two beads in the pattern would be:\n7. Red\n8.
