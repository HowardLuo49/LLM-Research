    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number, we need to find the smallest three-digit number such that the remainder when divided by 9 is greater than 5.\n\nStarting with the smallest three-digit number 100, we can calculate the remainder when divided by 9:\n100 % 9 = 1\n\nSince the remainder is 1, which is not greater than 5, we move on to the next three-digit number.\n\nThe next three-digit number is 101:\n101 % 9 = 2\n\nAgain, the remainder is not greater than 5, so we continue to the next number.\n\nWe continue this process until we find the smallest three-digit number for which the remainder when divided by 9 is greater than 5. The first such number we find is 105:\n105 % 9 = 6\n\nTherefore, the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number is 105.",
