    "solution": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.",
    "gpt_response": "To count the number of integers between $500$ and $1000$ that contain both the digits $3$ and $4$, we can use complementary counting. \n\nFirst, we find the total number of integers between 500 and 1000. There are $1000 - 500 + 1 = 501$ integers in this range. \n\nNext, we find the number of integers between 500 and 1000 that do not contain either the digit 3 or the digit 4. Integers in this range that do not contain the digit 3 are of the form $\\overline{5xy}$ where $x$ and $y$ can be any digit from 0 to 9, excluding 3. Similarly, integers in this range that do not contain the digit 4 are of the form $\\overline{x5y}$ where $x$ and $y$ can be any digit from 0 to 9, excluding 4. \n\nUsing the principle of multiplication, we have $8 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 800$ integers that do not contain the digit 3 or the digit 4. \n\nTherefore, the number of integers between 500 and 1000 that contain both the digits 3 and 4 is $501 - 800 = \\boxed{261}$.",
