    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old.",
    "gpt_response": "Let Jane's current age be x years. \n\nAccording to the problem, (x-1) must be a perfect square, and (x+1) must be a perfect cube.\n\nLet's express this algebraically:\n\n(x-1) = a^2\n(x+1) = b^3\n\nwhere a and b are integers.\n\nFrom the first equation:\nx = a^2 + 1\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\na^2 + 1 + 1 = b^3\na^2 + 2 = b^3\n\nLooking for possible values of a, we see that when a = 1, b = 2: \n1^2 + 2 = 2^3 \n\nTherefore, Jane is currently x = a^2 + 1 = 1^2 + 1 = 2 years old.",
