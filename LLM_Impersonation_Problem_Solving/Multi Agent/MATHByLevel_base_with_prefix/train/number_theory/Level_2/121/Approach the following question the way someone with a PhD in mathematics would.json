    "solution": "Notice that $121_5 \\times 11_5 = 121_5 \\times (10_5 + 1_5) = 1210_5 + 121_5 = \\boxed{1331}_5$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the base five product of the numbers $121_{5}$ and $11_{5}$, we first need to convert these numbers to base ten. \n\n$121_{5}$ is equal to $1*5^{2} + 2*5^{1} + 1*5^{0} = 25 + 10 + 1 = 36$ in base ten.\n\n$11_{5}$ is equal to $1*5^{1} + 1*5^{0} = 5 + 1 = 6$ in base ten.\n\nNow, to find the product of these numbers in base five, we simply multiply their base five representations in base ten:\n\n$36 * 6 = 216$\n\nNow, we need to convert 216 back to base five. To do this, we divide 216 by powers of five until we have no remainder.\n\n$216 \\div 5 = 43$ with a remainder of 1\n$43 \\div 5 = 8$ with a remainder of 3\n$8 \\div 5 = 1$ with a remainder of 3\n$1 \\div 5 = 0$ with a remainder of 1\n\nTherefore, the base five product of $121_{5}$ and $11_{5}$ is $1331_{5}$.",
