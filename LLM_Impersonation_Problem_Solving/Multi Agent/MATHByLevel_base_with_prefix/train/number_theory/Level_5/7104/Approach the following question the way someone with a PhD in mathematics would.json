    "solution": "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We start by noticing that for each of the $a_i$, there are 3 choices: $-1,0,1$. Since there are 8 $a_i$'s, there are a total of $3^8$ ways to choose all of the $a_i$'s. However, we need to find how many of these ways will result in a nonnegative integer.\n\nFor the number to be nonnegative, each $a_i$ must be less than or equal to 1 for all $0\\le i \\le 7$. This is equivalent to counting the number of integers in base 3 with 8 digits which are less than or equal to 1. There are $2^8 = 256$ integers in base 3 with 8 digits that are less than or equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, our answer is $256$, which is Option $\\textbf{(A)}$.",
