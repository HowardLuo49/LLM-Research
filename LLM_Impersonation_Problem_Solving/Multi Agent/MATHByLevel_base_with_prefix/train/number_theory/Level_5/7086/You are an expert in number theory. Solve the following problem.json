    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. For a positive integer $p$, define the positive integer $n$ to be $p$-safe if $n$ differs in absolute value by more than $2$ from all multiples of $p$. For example, the set of $10$-safe numbers is $\\{ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, \\ldots\\}$. Find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ which are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe.\n",
    "solution": "We see that a number $n$ is $p$-safe if and only if the residue of $n \\mod p$ is greater than $2$ and less than $p-2$; thus, there are $p-5$ residues $\\mod p$ that a $p$-safe number can have. Therefore, a number $n$ satisfying the conditions of the problem can have $2$ different residues $\\mod 7$, $6$ different residues $\\mod 11$, and $8$ different residues $\\mod 13$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for a number $x$ that is $a$ (mod b) $c$ (mod d) $e$ (mod f) has one solution if $gcd(b,d,f)=1$. For example, in our case, the number $n$ can be: 3 (mod 7) 3 (mod 11) 7 (mod 13) so since $gcd(7,11,13)$=1, there is 1 solution for n for this case of residues of $n$.\nThis means that by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $n$ can have $2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = 96$ different residues mod $7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 1001$. Thus, there are $960$ values of $n$ satisfying the conditions in the range $0 \\le n < 10010$. However, we must now remove any values greater than $10000$ that satisfy the conditions. By checking residues, we easily see that the only such values are $10006$ and $10007$, so there remain $\\boxed{958}$ values satisfying the conditions of the problem.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first consider what it means for a number to be $p$-safe for a particular prime $p$. A number $n$ is $p$-safe if it is not within $2$ units of any multiple of $p$. This means that $n$ must not be equivalent to $1, 2, p-1,$ or $p$ modulo $p$. In other words, $n$ must be congruent to $3$ modulo $p$ or $-3$ modulo $p$. \n\nNow, we want to find numbers that are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe. This means that the number must be $3$ or $-3$ modulo $7$, $11$, and $13$. \n\nSince all three primes are pairwise relatively prime, we can combine these requirements to find that the number must be $3$ or $-3$ modulo $7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 1001$.\n\nTherefore, the numbers we are looking for are those congruent to $3$ or $-3$ modulo $1001$. There are $2$ numbers in each residue class modulo $1001$ which satisfy this condition. \n\nSince $10000 = 9\\cdot 1001 + 901$, there are $9$ copies of each possible number modulo $1001$ up to $9000$. This means that there are $9 \\times 2 = \\boxed{18}$ numbers less than or equal to $10000$ that are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe.",
