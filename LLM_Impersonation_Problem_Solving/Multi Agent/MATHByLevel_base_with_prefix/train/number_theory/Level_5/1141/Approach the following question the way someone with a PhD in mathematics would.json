    "solution": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the integers for which $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal, we first note that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ can be expressed as $\\frac{n}{n+1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}$. \n\nSince $\\frac{1}{n+1}$ has a denominator of $n+1$, in order for the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n+1}$ to terminate, the denominator must only have prime factors of 2 and 5. This implies that $n+1$ can be expressed as $2^m5^k$ for some nonnegative integers $m$ and $k$.\n\nSubstituting $n+1 = 2^m5^k$ into $\\frac{n}{n+1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{n+1}$, we get $n = 2^m5^k - 1$. The number of possible values for $n$ is equivalent to the number of possible combinations of $m$ and $k$ such that $2^m5^k - 1 \\le 100$.\n\nTo find the desired integers, we can systematically compute the different values of $2^m5^k - 1$ for all possible values of $m$ and $k$. This will involve iterating over $m$ and $k$ from 0 to a certain maximum value that ensures $2^m5^k - 1$ does not exceed 100.\n\nIn summary, to determine the integers for which $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal for $1 \\le n \\le 100$, one must find the solutions to $n = 2^m5^k - 1$ where $m, k$ are nonnegative integers such that $2^m5^k - 1 \\le 100$.",
