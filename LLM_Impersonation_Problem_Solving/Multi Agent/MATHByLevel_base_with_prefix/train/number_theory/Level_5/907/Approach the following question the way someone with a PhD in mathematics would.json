    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $p$ be the largest prime with 2010 digits. What is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12?",
    "solution": "Let us iterate over larger and larger positive integers for $k$. If $k=1$, then $p^2-k = p^2-1 = (p+1)(p-1)$. Since $p$ is odd, both $p+1$ and $p-1$ are even, so therefore $p^2-1$ is divisible by 4. Also, since $p$ is not divisible by 3, then $p$ must either be one greater or two greater than a multiple of 3, which means that $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3, respectively. As a result, $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 4, so it is divisible by 12. Therefore, we have $\\boxed{k = 1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we must understand the properties of primes and divisibility by 12. Since $p$ is the largest prime with 2010 digits, we know it is extremely large and likely greater than 10^2010.\n\nFor $p^2 - k$ to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4. Since $p$ is a prime number, it cannot be divisible by 3. Therefore, we only need to concern ourselves with divisibility by 4.\n\nSince $p$ is a prime with 2010 digits, $p^2$ will have 4020 digits. If we subtract $k$, the number of digits may decrease slightly but will still be in the thousands. In order for a number of that size to be divisible by 4, we must look at the last two digits.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 4, we need to find a value of $k$ such that $p^2 \\equiv k \\pmod{4}$. Thus, $k$ must be equivalent to the square of the last two digits of $p$ modulo 4.\n\nGiven the constraints and properties of this problem, finding the exact value of $k$ may require complex calculations and possibly computer assistance due to the large size of $p$ and the intricacies involved in finding the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions.",
