    "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. First, let's notice that $7$ raised to any power greater than or equal to $3$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $1000$, i.e., $7^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$ for $n \\geq 3$.\n\nNow, the sum $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ can be simplified by noticing that it consists of $2005$ terms, and $2005 = 3 \\cdot 668 + 1$. Therefore, this sum can be written as:\n\n$1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = 1 + (7^3)^{668} = 1 + 7^{2004} \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the remainder when dividing $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ by $1000$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
