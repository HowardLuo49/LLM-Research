    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.\n\nTherefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$. We get \\begin{align*}\n23n+1&<-999 \\\\\n23n&<-1000\\\\\nn&<-\\frac{1000}{23} \\approx -43.48.\n\\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \\cdot -44 +1 =\\boxed{-1011}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$, we need to find the largest multiple of $23$ that is less than $-1000$.\n\nFirst, let's find the largest multiple of $23$ that is less than $0$. Since $23 \\cdot 44 = 1012$, we know that $23 \\cdot 43 = 989$ is the largest multiple of $23$ less than $0$.\n\nTo find the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$, we need to subtract $22$ from $989$ to get $967$. \n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is $\\boxed{-967}$.",
