For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",
    "solution": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many sets $S_i$ do not contain a perfect square, we first need to understand the pattern of perfect squares within each set. \n\nFor any integer $n$ in set $S_i$, the smallest perfect square greater than or equal to $100i$ is $(10i)^2=100i^2$. The largest perfect square less than $100(i+1)$ is $((10(i+1))-1)^2 = 100(i^2+2i)+1$. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of perfect squares in the interval $[100i, 100(i+1))$. This can be done by subtracting the smallest perfect square in the interval from the largest and adding 1. \n\nSo, the number of perfect squares in the interval $[100i, 100(i+1))$ is $100(i^2+2i)+1 - 100i^2 + 1 = 200i + 1$.\n\nSince $S_i$ contains $100$ integers, the number of non-perfect squares in $S_i$ is $100 - 200i - 1 = 99 - 200i$.\n\nFinally, to find the number of sets $S_i$ that do not contain a perfect square, we need to count the number of $i$ such that $99 - 200i > 0$. This means $i < \\frac{99}{200}$ in order for the set to not contain a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, the number of sets $S_i$ that do not contain a perfect square is the floor of $\\frac{99}{200}$, which is $0$.\n\nSo, none of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ contain a perfect square.",
