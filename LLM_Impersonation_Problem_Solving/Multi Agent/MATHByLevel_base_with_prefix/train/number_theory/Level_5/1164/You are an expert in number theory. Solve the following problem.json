    "solution": "If $n$ is divisible by both 2 and 5, then we can write $n$ in the form $10^a \\cdot 2^b$ or $10^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Since $10^a$ simply contributes trailing zeros, we can continue dividing by 10 until $n$ is a power of two or a power of 5. We generate a list of powers of 2. \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n2^3 &= 8 \\\\\n2^4 &= 16 \\\\\n2^5 &= 32 \\\\\n2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n2^7 &= 128 \\\\\n2^8 &= 256 \\\\\n2^9 &= 512 \\\\\n2^{10} &= 1024 \\\\\n2^{11} &= 2048 \\\\\n2^{12} &= 4096\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we can conclude that $n \\le 4096$. Looking at the powers of 5, we note that the first five powers of five do not contain the digit 9, and since $5^6 = 15625$, the smallest integer that works is $n = \\boxed{4096}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n}$. If $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal, that means $n$ can be written in the form $n = 2^a \\times 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers.\n\nIn order for $n$ to contain the digit 9, it must be a multiple of 9. If we look at the prime factorization of $n$, we see that $n$ must have at least one factor of 3 and one factor of 3 (to account for both the 3 and the 9).\n\nIf $n$ has a factor of 3, then $n$ must also have a factor of 2 to be a terminating decimal. Therefore, we can write $n = 2^a \\times 3 \\times 5^b$. Since $n$ is a multiple of 9, we can further simplify to $n = 2^a \\times 3^2 \\times 5^b$.\n\nTo find the smallest possible $n$ that satisfies these conditions and contains the digit 9, we set $a=0$ and $b=1$, giving us $n = 3^2 \\times 5 = 45$.
