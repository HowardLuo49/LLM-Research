    "solution": "If $n$ is divisible by both 2 and 5, then we can write $n$ in the form $10^a \\cdot 2^b$ or $10^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Since $10^a$ simply contributes trailing zeros, we can continue dividing by 10 until $n$ is a power of two or a power of 5. We generate a list of powers of 2. \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n2^3 &= 8 \\\\\n2^4 &= 16 \\\\\n2^5 &= 32 \\\\\n2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n2^7 &= 128 \\\\\n2^8 &= 256 \\\\\n2^9 &= 512 \\\\\n2^{10} &= 1024 \\\\\n2^{11} &= 2048 \\\\\n2^{12} &= 4096\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we can conclude that $n \\le 4096$. Looking at the powers of 5, we note that the first five powers of five do not contain the digit 9, and since $5^6 = 15625$, the smallest integer that works is $n = \\boxed{4096}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the given conditions, we first note that if $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n$ must be of the form $2^a5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers. This is because the prime factors of $n$ can only be 2 and 5 for the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{n}$ to terminate.\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ that contains the digit 9. Since $n$ can only consist of the digits 0-9, we can start by checking the smallest powers of 2 and 5 for the presence of the digit 9 in their decimal representations.\n\nThe first few powers of 2 are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, ...\n\nWe see that the first power of 2 that contains the digit 9 is 512.\n\nThe first few powers of 5 are: 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625, ...\n\nWe see that the first power of 5 that contains the digit 9 is 125.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions $\\frac{1}{n}$ being a terminating decimal and $n$ containing the digit 9 is $n = 512 \\times 125 = 64000$.",
