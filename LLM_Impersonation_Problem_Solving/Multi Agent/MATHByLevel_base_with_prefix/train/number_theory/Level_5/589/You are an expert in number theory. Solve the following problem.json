Use each of the five digits $2, 4, 6, 7$ and $9$ only once to form a three-digit integer and a two-digit integer which will be multiplied together. What is the three-digit integer that results in the greatest product?",
    "solution": "Let $\\underline{a}\\,\\underline{b}\\,\\underline{c}$ and $\\underline{d}\\,\\underline{e}$ be the two numbers.  The product of the numbers is  \\[\n(100a+10b+c)(10d+e) = 1000ad + 100(ae+bd) + 10 (cd+be) + ce\n\\] Clearly $ad$ should be as large as possible, so $a$ and $d$ should be 9 and 7 or vice versa.  Also, $c$ should be the smallest digit, since it only appears in the terms $10cd$ and $ce$.  Trying $a=9$ and $d=7$, we have a product of  \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(9e+7b) + 10 (14+be) + 2e = 63,\\!140+902e + 700b + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $e$ term is larger than that of the $b$ term, $e=6$ and $b=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $942\\times 76=71,\\!592$.  If $a=7$ and $d=9$, then the sum is \\[\n63,\\!000 + 100(7e+9b) + 10 (18+be) + 2e = 63,\\!180+900b + 702e + 10be.\n\\] Since the coefficient of the $b$ term is larger than that of the $e$ term, $b=6$ and $e=4$ maximizes the product in this case.  The maximum is $762\\times 94=71,\\!628$.  Since $71,\\!628>71,\\!592$, the three-digit integer yielding the maximum product is $\\boxed{762}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the three-digit integer that results in the greatest product when multiplied by a two-digit integer, we should consider finding the largest possible three-digit integer by using the digits $2, 4, 6, 7$ and $9$.\n\nSince we want the product to be as large as possible, the three-digit integer should have the largest possible hundredth place digit. The largest digit among the given options is $9$, so we should use $9$ as the hundredth place digit.\n\nNext, we should use the next largest digit for the tens place and the smallest digit for the units place to maximize the product. Among the remaining digits $2, 4, 6,$ and $7$, the largest digit is $7$, the next largest digit is $6$, and the smallest digit is $2$.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit integer is $976$ and the two-digit integer is $42$.\n\nMultiplying $976$ by $42$ gives $976 \\times 42 = 41016$.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit integer $976$ results in the greatest product when multiplied by a two-digit integer.",
