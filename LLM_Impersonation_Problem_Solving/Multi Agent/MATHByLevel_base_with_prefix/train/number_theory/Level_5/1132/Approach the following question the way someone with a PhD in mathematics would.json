    "solution": "Since $15 \\mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \\mid 15n$, so $15 \\mid n$. Say $n=15a$. Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square. Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \\le 1000$ or $a \\le \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.6$. The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square, we first need to factorize $15$ into its prime factors. $15 = 3 \\times 5$, so $15n = 3 \\times 5n$. Since $15n$ is a perfect square, this implies that $5n$ must also be a perfect square.\n\nNow considering $5n$, the prime factorization of $5$ is just $5$, so $5n$ must have an even power of 5 in its prime factorization in order for it to be a perfect square. Therefore, $n$ must have exactly one factor of 3 and an even power of 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nLet $n = 3^a \\times 5^{2b}$, where $a = 1, 2, 3, 4$ and $b = 0, 1, 2, 3$. Since $n \\le 1000$, we consider the values of $a$ and $b$ accordingly. \n\nIf $a = 1$, then there are 4 choices for $b$ (as $2b$ should be less than or equal to $\\log_5 1000 \\approx 4.29$), giving $4$ possibilities for $n$. If $a = 2$, then there are 3 choices for $b$ (as $2b$ should be less than or equal to $\\log_5 500 \\approx 3.74$), giving $3$ possibilities for $n$. Similarly, for $a = 3$ and $a = 4$, we get 2 and 1 possibility for $n$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square is $4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10$.",
