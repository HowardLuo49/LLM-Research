    "solution": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of zeros at the end of 236!, we must consider the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of the factorial. \n\nFirst, we note that a zero at the end of a number is only formed by the multiplication of 2 and 5 in the factors. As there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in the prime factorization of integers, we focus on counting the number of factors of 5.\n\nTo find the number of factors of 5 in 236!, we can use the formula for calculating the number of factors of a prime number p in n!:\n\nn/p + n/p^2 + n/p^3 + ...\n\nIn this case, p=5. So, we have:\n\n236/5 + 236/25 + 236/125 + ...\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n47 + 9 + 1 = 57\n\nTherefore, there are 57 factors of 5 in the prime factorization of 236!. This means there are 57 zeros at the end of 236! when expressed as an integer.",
