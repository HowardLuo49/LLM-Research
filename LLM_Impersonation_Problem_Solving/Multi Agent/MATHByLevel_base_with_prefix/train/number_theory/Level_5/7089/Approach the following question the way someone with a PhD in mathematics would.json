For positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",
    "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.",

Let $p$ be a prime number and $k$ be a positive integer. The number of positive divisors of $p^k$ is given by $(k+1)$. \n\nTherefore, for a positive integer $N$ to be $k$-nice, it must be expressible in the form $N = a^k$ for some positive integer $a$, and the number of positive divisors of $N$ must be equal to $(k+1)$. \n\nConsidering the cases of $k=7$ and $k=8$, we see that for $N$ to be $7$-nice or $8$-nice, it must be a perfect seventh or eighth power, respectively.\n\nTo find the numbers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice, we can proceed as follows:\n\n1.
