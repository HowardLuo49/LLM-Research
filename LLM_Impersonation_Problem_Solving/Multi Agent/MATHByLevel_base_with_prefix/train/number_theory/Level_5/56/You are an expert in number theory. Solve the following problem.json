    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the perfect squares as x^2 and (x+1)^2, where x is a positive integer less than 100.\n\nThe difference of these two consecutive perfect squares is (x+1)^2 - x^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = 2x + 1.\n\nIn order for this to be a perfect square, 2x + 1 must be a perfect square. Let's denote 2x + 1 as y^2, where y is a positive integer.\n\nSo we have 2x + 1 = y^2, or 2x = y^2 - 1.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that y must be an odd number in order for y^2 - 1 to be divisible by 2. Let's denote y = 2n+1, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nSubstitute y = 2n + 1 back into the equation, we get 2x = (2n+1)^2 - 1 = 4n^2 + 4n = 4n(n+1).\n\nThis means that 2x is a multiple of 4, and thus x must be an even number. So let's denote x = 2m, where m is a positive integer.\n\nSubstitute x = 2m back into the equation, we get 2(2m) = 4m = 4n(n+1), or m = n(n+1).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to express m as the product of two consecutive integers.\n\nSince m = n(n+1), this implies that n and n+1 must be factors of m. The only way this is possible is if one of n or n+1 is even and the other is odd. This gives us two cases:\n\nCase 1: n is even, n+1 is odd\nCase 2: n is odd, n+1 is even\n\nFor both cases, the product of n and n+1 is a perfect square less than 100. Since there are 10 perfect squares less than 100 (1^2, 2^2, ..., 9^2), there are a total of 10 possible values for m.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 perfect squares less than 10,000 that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares.",
