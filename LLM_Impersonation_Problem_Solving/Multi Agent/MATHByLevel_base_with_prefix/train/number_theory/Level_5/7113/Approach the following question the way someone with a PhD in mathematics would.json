Let $S$ be a subset of $\\{1,2,3,...,50\\}$ such that no pair of distinct elements in $S$ has a sum divisible by $7$. What is the maximum number of elements in $S$?\n$\\text{(A) } 6\\quad \\text{(B) } 7\\quad \\text{(C) } 14\\quad \\text{(D) } 22\\quad \\text{(E) } 23$\n",
    "solution": "The fact that $x \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\Rightarrow 7 \\mid x$ is assumed as common knowledge in this answer.\nFirst, note that there are $8$ possible numbers that are equivalent to $1 \\mod 7$, and there are $7$ possible numbers equivalent to each of $2$-$6 \\mod 7$.\nSecond, note that there can be no pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \\equiv -b$ mod $7$, because then $a+b | 7$. These pairs are $(0,0)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,4)$. Because $(0,0)$ is a pair, there can always be $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, and no more.\nTo maximize the amount of numbers in S, we will use $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, $8$ numbers equivalent to $1$, and $14$ numbers equivalent to $2$-$5$. This is obvious if you think for a moment. Therefore the answer is $1+8+14=\\boxed{23}$ numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $S=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\\}$ where $a_1<a_2<\\cdots <a_n$. Notice that for each element $a_i \\in S$, there exist at most 6 other elements in $S$ such that their sum with $a_i$ is divisible by 7. This is because if $a_i$ is congruent to $k$ modulo 7, then the other elements must be congruent to $-k \\pmod{7}$. Since $S$ contains at most one element of each congruence class modulo 7, we can have at most 7 elements in $S$ (one for each possible remainder modulo 7).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements in $S$ is $\\boxed{\\text{(B) } 7}$.",
