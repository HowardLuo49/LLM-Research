Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers satisfying the conditions\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ \\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ and\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m$ is not a multiple of $n.$\nFind the least possible value of $m+n.$\n",
    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's break down the information given in the problem. \n\nThe first condition states that the greatest common divisor of $m+n$ and $210$ is 1. Since $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, this implies that $m+n$ cannot be divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 individually. \n\nThe second condition states that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$. This means that $m$ can be written as $n^k$ for some positive integer $k$. \n\nThe third condition states that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$. Since $m$ can be written as $n^k$, this implies that $k\\neq1$. \n\nNow, we want to minimize $m+n$. Substituting $m=n^k$ into $m+n$, we get $n^k + n$. Notice that $n$ cannot be even (from the first condition). If $n = 3$, then $n$ is divisible by 3 but $m$ is not, in violation of the third condition. Therefore, the least possible value for $n$ is 5. \n\nWhen $n=5$, $m$ must be a multiple of $n$ raised to at least the 2nd power, so $m$ must be at least $25$. This gives $m=25$, $n=5$, and $m+n=30$ as the least possible value. \n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $\\boxed{30}$.",
