    "solution": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N = 10^k x + y$, where $x$ is the $k$-digit prefix of $N$ and $y$ is the last $k$ digits of $N$. Then, we have $N^2 = (10^k x + y)^2 = 10^{2k} x^2 + 2 \\cdot 10^k xy + y^2$, which ends in the same four digits $abcd$ as $N$. \n\nSince $N$ and $N^2$ end in the same four digits, we have $y^2 \\equiv y \\pmod{10^k}$. This implies $y(y-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10^k}$. Since $y$ and $y-1$ are relatively prime to $10$, we must have $y \\equiv 0, 1 \\pmod{10}$. \n\nCase 1: $y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$\nIn this case, $y = 0$, and so $N = 10^k x$.
