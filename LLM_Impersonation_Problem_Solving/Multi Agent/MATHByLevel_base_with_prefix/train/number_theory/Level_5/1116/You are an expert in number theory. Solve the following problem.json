    "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer. \n\nWe can rewrite the expression $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ as $\\frac{20}{2(n - \\frac{1}{2})}$. It will only be an integer if the denominator $2(n - \\frac{1}{2})$ divides $20$.\n\nSince $20 = 2^2 \\times 5$, the factors of $20$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10,$ and $20$.
