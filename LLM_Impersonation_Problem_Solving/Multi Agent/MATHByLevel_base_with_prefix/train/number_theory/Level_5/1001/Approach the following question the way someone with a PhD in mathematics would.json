    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.",

In order to find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square, we need to first analyze the prime factorization of $x$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $x$ can be simplified as follows:\n\n$4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^8$\n\n$6^6 = 2^6 * 3^6$\n\n$8^8 = (2^3)^8 = 2^{24}$\n\n$9^9 = 3^9$\n\nTherefore, we can simplify $x$ as:\n\n$x = 2^{23} * 3^{3} * 2^8 * 5^{5} * 2^6 * 3^6 * 7^{7} * 2^{24} * 3^9$\n\n$x = 2^{61} * 3^{18} * 5^{5} * 7^{7}$\n\nIn order for the product of $x$ and the smallest positive integer to be a perfect square, the exponents of all prime factors in the resulting product must be even.\n\nSince we already have $2^{61}$ and $3^{18}$ in $x$, we need to add an additional factor of $2^1$ and $3^1$ to make the exponents of $2$ and $3$ even. Thus, the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square is $2 * 3 = 6$.",
