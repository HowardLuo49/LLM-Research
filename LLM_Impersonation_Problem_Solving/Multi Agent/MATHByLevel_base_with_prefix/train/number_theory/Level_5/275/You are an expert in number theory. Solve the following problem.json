    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Recall that $a^{-1} \\pmod{n}$ is undefined if and only if $a$ and $n$ are not coprime. \n\nSince $a^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$ and $a^{-1}$ is also undefined $\\pmod{66}$, it follows that $a$ shares a common factor with both $55$ and $66$. \n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $\\text{gcd}(a, 55) \\neq 1$ and $\\text{gcd}(a, 66) \\neq 1$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $55$ is $5 \\times 11$ and the prime factorization of $66$ is $2 \\times 3 \\times 11$. \n\nTo find the smallest $a$ that is not coprime with both $55$ and $66$, we take the highest common factor of both $55$ and $66$, which is $11$. \n\nThus, the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$ and $a^{-1}$ is also undefined $\\pmod{66}$ is $\\boxed{11}$.",
