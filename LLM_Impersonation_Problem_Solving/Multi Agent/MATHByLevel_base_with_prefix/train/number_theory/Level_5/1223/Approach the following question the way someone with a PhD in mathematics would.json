Find the smallest positive integer $N$ with the following property: of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$, one of them is divisible by $2^2$, one of them is divisible by $3^2$, one is divisible by $5^2$, and one is divisible by $7^2$.",
    "solution": "The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$.  The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$.  But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98.  To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100.  Hence we should take $N=\\boxed{98}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by considering the smallest number that is divisible by $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. This number would be the LCM of $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. Therefore, $N = \\text{lcm}(2^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2$.\n\nNow we need to find which of the numbers $N+1$ and $N+2$ satisfies the properties given in the question. \n\nLet's consider $N+1$. Since $N$ is divisible by $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$, $N$ is also divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$. Therefore, $N+1$ is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. Hence, $N+1$ must be divisible by $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, or $7^2$. Since $N+1$ cannot be divisible by $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, or $7^2$, we conclude that $N+1$ is not the number that satisfies the conditions.\n\nNext, let's consider $N+2$. Since $N$ is divisible by $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$, $N$ is also divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, $N+2$ is divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, but not by $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, or $7^2$. \n\nFinally, we have found that the smallest positive integer $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2$ satisfies the given conditions.",
