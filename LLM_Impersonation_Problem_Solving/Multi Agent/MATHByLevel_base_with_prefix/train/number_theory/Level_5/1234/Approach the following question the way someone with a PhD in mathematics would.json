    "solution": "To find the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we can look at the first few power of 17 modulo 100: \\begin{align*}\n17^0 &\\equiv 1, \\\\\n17^1 &\\equiv 17, \\\\\n17^2 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 17 \\equiv 289 \\equiv 89, \\\\\n17^3 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 89 \\equiv 1513 \\equiv 13, \\\\\n17^4 &\\equiv 17 \\cdot 13 \\equiv 221 \\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe know that if we find a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, then the last two digits in the power of 17 become periodic at that point.  We don't have that in $17^4$, but the units digit in $17^4$ is 1.  We have matched the units digit, so let's use powers of $17^4$: \\begin{align*}\n17^4 &\\equiv 21, \\\\\n17^8 &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 21 \\equiv 441 \\equiv 41, \\\\\n17^{12} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 41 \\equiv 861 \\equiv 61, \\\\\n17^{16} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 61 \\equiv 1281 \\equiv 81, \\\\\n17^{20} &\\equiv 21 \\cdot 81 \\equiv 1701 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*} We found a power of 17 whose last two digits are 01, so the last two digits are periodic, with period 20.\n\nSince $1993 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{20}$, \\[17^{1993} \\equiv 17^{13} \\pmod{100}.\\] Then \\begin{align*}\n17^{13} &\\equiv 17^{12} \\cdot 17 \\\\\n&\\equiv 61 \\cdot 17 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1037 \\\\\n&\\equiv 37 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the tens digit of $17^{1993}$, we can apply the concept of modular arithmetic. We can observe that the tens digit of a number is the remainder when divided by 100 and is the same as the remainder when divided by 10.\n\nFirst, note that the tens digit of $17^n$ repeats in cycles of 2 for $n\\ge 2$ since $17^2 = 289 \\equiv 89 (\\text{mod } 100)$, $17^3 \\equiv 9 (\\text{mod } 10)$, $17^4 \\equiv 13 (\\text{mod } 100)$, $17^5 \\equiv 21 (\\text{mod } 100)$, and so on.\n\nNow, since $17^{1993} = (17^2)^{996} \\cdot 17$, we know that the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ will be the same as the tens digit of $17^1$, which is simply 7.\n\nTherefore, the tens digit of $17^{1993}$ is 7.",
