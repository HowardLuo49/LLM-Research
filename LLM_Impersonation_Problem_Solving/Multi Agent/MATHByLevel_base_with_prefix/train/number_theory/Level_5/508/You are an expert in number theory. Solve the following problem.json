    "solution": "We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$. Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. If we multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10. Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10. If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10. For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10. Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.\n\nAs a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$. The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \\le x \\le 2010$. There are $\\boxed{2011}$ such integers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the answer, we first observe that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point if and only if $10^n \\leq k < 10^{n+1}$. This means that $k$ must be a multiple of $10^n$.\n\nTherefore, we have $f(n) = 10^n$.\n\nNow, for $f(2010)$, we have $f(2010) = 10^{2010}$.\n\nThe positive integer divisors of $10^{2010}$ are of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 2010$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 2010$.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integer divisors of $f(2010)$ is $(2010 + 1) \\cdot (2010 + 1) = 4044121$.\n\nThus, $f(2010)$ has $\\boxed{4044121}$ positive integer divisors.",
