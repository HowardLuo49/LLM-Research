    "solution": "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the greatest number of positive factors that $b^n$ can have, we first need to express $b^n$ as its prime factorization. \n\nLet $b = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ are positive integers. \n\nThen $b^n = p_1^{a_1n} \\cdot p_2^{a_2n} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_kn}$. \n\nNow, the greatest number of positive factors $b^n$ can have is obtained by forming products of different combinations of the prime factorization of $b^n$. To do this, we consider each prime factor $p_i$ and its possible exponents $0$ to $a_in$. \n\nThe number of positive factors of $b^n$ is given by $(a_1n+1)(a_2n+1)...(a_kn+1)$. To maximize this product, we want to maximize each term $(a_in+1)$.\n\nSince $a_i$ is a positive integer less than or equal to 15, the maximum value of $a_in+1$ is achieved when $a_i = 15$ and $n = 1$.
