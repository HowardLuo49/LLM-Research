    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A relatively prime date is a date for which the number of the month and the number of the day are relatively prime. For example, June 17 is a relatively prime date because the greatest common factor of 6 and 17 is 1. How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates?",
    "solution": "Since exactly 1 in every $n$ consecutive dates is divisible by $n$, the month with the fewest relatively prime days is the month with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors. This reasoning gives us June ($6=2\\cdot3$) and December ($12=2^2\\cdot3$). December, however, has one more relatively prime day, namely December 31, than does June, which has only 30 days. Therefore, June has the fewest relatively prime days. To count how many relatively prime days June has, we must count the number of days that are divisible neither by 2 nor by 3. Out of its 30 days, $\\frac{30}{2}=15$ are divisible by 2 and $\\frac{30}{3}=10$ are divisible by 3. We are double counting the number of days that are divisible by 6, $\\frac{30}{6}=5$ days. Thus, June has $30-(15+10-5)=30-20=\\boxed{10}$ relatively prime days.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the month with the fewest relatively prime dates, we must calculate the number of relatively prime dates for each month. \n\nTo do this, we need to consider all possible pairs of numbers (m, d) where m is the number of the month and d is the number of the day. We then need to determine the greatest common factor (GCD) of each pair. \n\nBy doing this for every day of each month, we can calculate the total number of relatively prime dates for each month. The month with the fewest relatively prime dates will have the least amount of pairs where the GCD is equal to 1. \n\nOnce we have determined the month with the fewest relatively prime dates, we can then calculate the total number of relatively prime dates for that month. This will give us the answer to the question. \n\nThis process requires a thorough enumeration and calculation of all possible pairs of dates for each month, as well as an understanding of number theory and the concept of relatively prime numbers.",
