    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ are multiples of 24?",
    "solution": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24, we first need to determine which perfect squares are multiples of 24.\n\nSince 24 can be factored into $2^3 \\times 3$, a perfect square that is a multiple of 24 must have even powers of 2 and at least one power of 3 in its prime factorization.\n\nLet's denote a perfect square as $n^2$, where $n$ is a positive integer. The prime factorization of $n^2$ can be written as $(2^a \\times 3^b)^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n\nFor $n^2$ to be a multiple of 24, we need $a$ to be even and $b$ to be at least 1. Since $a$ must be even, we can rewrite it as $2c$, where $c$ is an integer.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of $n^2$ becomes $(2^{2c} \\times 3^b)^2 = 2^{4c} \\times 3^{2b}$.\n\nFor $n^2$ to be less than $10^6$, we have the following inequality:\n\n$2^{4c} \\times 3^{2b} < 10^6$\n\nSolving this inequality and taking into consideration that $a$ and $b$ are integers, we can find all possible values of $c$ and $b$ that satisfy the condition. The number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24 can then be determined.",
