    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $g(n)$ be the product of the proper positive integer divisors of $n$. (Recall that a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor other than $n$.) For how many values of $n$ does $n$ not divide $g(n)$, given that $2 \\le n \\le 50$?",
    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the prime factorization of $n$, which can be written as $n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct primes and $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ are positive integers. \n\nThe product of the proper positive divisors of $n$ can be expressed as $g(n) = p_1p_2\\cdots p_k$. \n\nNow, for $n$ to not divide $g(n)$, there must exist a prime factor $p_i$ such that $p_i$ does not appear in the prime factorization of $g(n)$. This implies that $p_i$ appears an odd number of times in the prime factorization of $n$, because if it appeared an even number of times, it would also appear in the prime factorization of $g(n)$.\n\nTherefore, for each prime factor $p_i$ of $n$, there are two possibilities: \n1. $p_i$ does not appear in the prime factorization of $g(n)$, which occurs when $p_i$ appears an odd number of times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n2. $p_i$ appears in the prime factorization of $g(n)$, which occurs when $p_i$ appears an even number of times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\nSince we are considering $n$ from 2 to 50, and each prime number $p_i$ can be represented as $p_i^{1}$, $p_i^{2}$, $p_i^{3}$, etc., the condition for $n$ to not divide $g(n)$ is equivalent to the condition that $n$ has an odd number of prime factors. \n\nThe only prime numbers up to 50 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. \n\nTherefore, the count of positive integers $n$ such that $n$ does not divide $g(n)$ is equivalent to the count of odd numbers of prime factors that can be formed using the primes up to 50. \n\nTo calculate this, we consider the combinations of odd numbers of prime factors from the set of primes up to 50, thus considering the combinations of 1, 3, and 5 prime factors. I would determine these combinations mathematically to arrive at the final answer.",
