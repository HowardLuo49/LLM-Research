    "solution": "Let the three integers be $a, b, c$. $N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$. Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\\{a, b\\}$ is one of $\\{1, 12\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\\cdot 13 = 156, 12\\cdot 8 = 96, 12\\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \\boxed{336}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $a+b$. We are given that $N=6(a+b+a+b+b)=12(2a+3b)=24a+36b$.\n\nWe are also given that $N=ab(a+b)=a^2b+ab^2$. \n\nSetting $N=24a+36b$ equal to $a^2b+ab^2$ gives us $24a+36b=a^2b+ab^2$. \n\nRearranging this equation gives $a^2b-24a+ab^2-36b=0$.
