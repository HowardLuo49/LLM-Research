    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $9^0 = 1$, $9^1 = 9$, $9^2 = 81$, $9^3 = 729$, $9^4 = 6561$, and so on. We observe that as long as the exponent is greater than 0, the leftmost digit of $9^k$ will always be 9.\n\nTherefore, out of the 4001 elements in set $T$, 4000 of them have 9 as their leftmost digit.",
