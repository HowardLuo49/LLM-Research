    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we first need to calculate $F_{1000}$. \n\nThe formula for the $n^{th}$ Fermat number is $F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1$. Therefore, $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$. \n\nNow, we need to determine the value of $2^{2^{1000}}$. Calculating this directly is not feasible due to the extremely large exponent. However, we can find a pattern in the units digit of powers of 2 to simplify the calculation. \n\nThe units digit of powers of 2 follows a cycle: 2, 4, 8, 6. For example, $2^1$ has a units digit of 2, $2^2$ has a units digit of 4, $2^3$ has a units digit of 8, and $2^4$ has a units digit of 6. \n\nThe exponent $2^{1000}$ can be expressed as $2^{4k+r}$, where $4k$ is the closest multiple of 4 less than 1000, and $r$ is the remainder when 1000 is divided by 4. Since $2^4$ has a units digit of 6, $2^{4k+r}$ will have the same units digit as $2^r$. \n\nSince the remainder when 1000 is divided by 4 is 0, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is the same as the units digit of $2^0 + 1 = 1 + 1$. Therefore, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is 2. \n\nThus, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is 2.",
