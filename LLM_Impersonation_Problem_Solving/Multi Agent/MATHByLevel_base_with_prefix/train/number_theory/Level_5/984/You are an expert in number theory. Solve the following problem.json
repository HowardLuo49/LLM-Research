    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Natural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to first notice a pattern in the units digit of Fermat numbers.\n\nThe units digit of $2^{2^n}$ cycles in a pattern: $2^1$ has a units digit of 2, $2^2$ has a units digit of 4, $2^3$ has a units digit of 8, and $2^4$ has a units digit of 6. Therefore, $2^{2^n}$ has a units digit of 6 when $n$ is congruent to 0 modulo 4.\n\nSince $n = 1000$ is congruent to 0 modulo 4, the units digit of $F_{1000} = 2^{2^{1000}} + 1$ is the same as $2^{2^{1000}}$. And since $2^{2^{1000}}$ has a units digit of 6, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is 7 (6+1), given the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
