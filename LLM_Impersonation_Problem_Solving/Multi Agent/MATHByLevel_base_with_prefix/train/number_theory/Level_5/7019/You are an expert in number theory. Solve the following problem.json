    "solution": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \\cdot 5^2} = 16 \\cdot 27 = \\boxed{432}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first factorize $75$ into its prime factors: \n\n$75 = 3 \\times 5^2$\n\nNow, let's consider the number of divisors for a number in the form of $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers. The number of divisors for this number is given by $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1)$.\n\nSince we want to find the smallest number that has $75$ divisors, this number should be in the form $p_1^{2} \\cdot p_2^{4}$.
