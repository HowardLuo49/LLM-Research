    "solution": "Let us investigate the first few powers of 19: \\begin{align*}\n19^1 &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^2 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^3 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^4 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^5 &\\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}.\n\\end{align*} At this point, we see that $19^5 \\equiv 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ hence $19^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}.$ That means that $19^{1999} = 19^9 \\cdot (19^{10})^{199} \\equiv 19^9 \\pmod {25}.$\n\nSince $19^4 \\equiv 21 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ then $19^{1999} \\equiv 19^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{4}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of $19^{1999}$ when divided by 25, we can use Euler's theorem. \n\nWe know that $19$ and $25$ are relatively prime, so Euler's theorem states that $19^{\\phi(25)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ where $\\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function which gives the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. \n\nIn this case, $\\phi(25) = 20$ because the numbers relatively prime to 25 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21, 22, 23, and 24. \n\nTherefore, $19^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$\n\nNow, we need to find the $1999 \\pmod{20}$, which gives us $1999 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{20}$\n\nSo, $19^{1999} \\equiv 19^{19} \\pmod{25}$\n\nNow we can use modular exponentiation to find $19^{19} \\pmod{25}$:\n$19^{19} = (19 \\cdot 19^{2})^{2} = (19 \\cdot 361)^{2} = (19 \\cdot 11)^{2} = 209^{2} = 24 \\pmod{25}$\n\nTherefore, the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by 25 is 24.",
