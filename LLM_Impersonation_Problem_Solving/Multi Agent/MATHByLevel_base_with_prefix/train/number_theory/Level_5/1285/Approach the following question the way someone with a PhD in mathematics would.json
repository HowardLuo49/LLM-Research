    "solution": "If $n$ is a two-digit number, then we can write $n$ in the form $10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits.  Then the last digit of $n^2$ is the same as the last digit of $b^2$.\n\nThe last digit of $n^2$ is 1.  We know that $b$ is a digit from 0 to 9.  Checking these digits, we find that the units digit of $b^2$ is 1 only for $b = 1$ and $b = 9$.\n\nIf $b = 1$, then $n = 10a + 1$, so \\[n^2 = 100a^2 + 20a + 1.\\] The last two digits of $100a^2$ are 00, so we want the last two digits of $20a$ to be 00.  This occurs only for the digits $a = 0$ and $a = 5$, but we reject $a = 0$ because we want a two-digit number.  This leads to the solution $n = 51$.\n\nIf $b = 9$, then $n = 10a + 9$, so \\[n^2 = 100a^2 + 180a + 81 = 100a^2 + 100a + 80a + 81.\\] The last two digits of $100a^2 + 100a$ are 00, so we want the last two digits of $80a + 81$ to be 01.  In other words, we want the last digit of $8a + 8$ to be 0.  This only occurs for the digits $a = 4$ and $a = 9$.  This leads to the solutions $n = 49$ and $n = 99$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all two-digit positive integers whose squares end with the digits 01 is $51 + 49 + 99 = \\boxed{199}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote a two-digit positive integer as AB, where A is the tens digit and B is the units digit. For the square of AB to end with the digits 01, we must have (10A + B)^2 = 100A + B. This can be expanded as 100A^2 + 20AB + B^2 = 100A + B.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get 100A^2 + 20AB + B^2 - 100A - B = 0. Rearranging terms, we have 100(A^2 - A) + 20AB + (B^2 - B) = 0. This can be further simplified as 100(A)(A - 1) + B(20A + B - 1) = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find all two-digit positive integers AB where this equation holds true. Since AB is a two-digit number, we have 10 \u2264 A \u2264 9 and 0 \u2264 B \u2264 9. Therefore, the possible values for A are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nFor each value of A, we can determine the corresponding values of B that satisfy the equation. For example, when A = 2, we have 100(2)(2 - 1) + B(20(2) + B - 1) = 0. Solving this equation gives us B = 9.\n\nTherefore, the two-digit positive integers whose squares end with the digits 01 are 29, 33, 57, and 81. The sum of these integers is 29 + 33 + 57 + 81 = 200.\n\nIn conclusion, the sum of all two-digit positive integers whose squares end with the digits 01 is 200.",
