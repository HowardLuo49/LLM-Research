    "solution": "Let $23a$ be the multiple we seek. Thus $$23a\\equiv 4\\pmod{89}.$$ Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$, then reducing modulo $89$, gives: \\begin{align*}\n92a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89} \\\\\n3a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} Multiplying both sides by $30$, then reducing again, gives: \\begin{align*}\n90a &\\equiv 480 \\pmod{89} \\\\\na &\\equiv 480-445 = 35 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} All of these steps are reversible, so $35$ is the unique solution $\\pmod{89}$ to the original congruence. The smallest positive solution is $a=35$, giving $23a=\\boxed{805}$. (Indeed, we can check that $805 = 9\\cdot 89 + 4$.)",

Rearranging this equation, we have\n\n$$23k - 89m = 4$$\n\nThis is a linear Diophantine equation, which can be solved using the Euclidean algorithm. We find that the greatest common divisor of $23$ and $89$ is $1$, so there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $23x + 89y = 1$. We can then multiply both sides of this equation by $4$ to get $23(4x) + 89(4y) = 4$. \n\nThus, one solution to the equation $23k - 89m = 4$ is $k = 4x$ and $m = 4y$. Since $n = 23k$, the smallest positive multiple of $23$ that is $4$ more than a multiple of $89$ is $n = 23(4x) = 92x$, where $x$ is some integer. Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of $23$ that is $4$ more than a multiple of $89$ is $92$.",
