    "solution": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$ for all composite integers $n$, we can express this difference as $n - n^3 = n(1 - n^2)$.\n\nSince $1 - n^2$ can be factored as $(1 - n)(1 + n)$, we can see that $n(1 - n^2)$ is equal to $n(1 - n)(1 + n)$. \n\nFor composite integers $n$, either $n$ or $1 - n$ or $1 + n$ will be divisible by 2. If $n$ is even, then it is already divisible by 2, and if $n$ is odd, then $1 + n$ will be divisible by 2. Thus, 2 will always divide into $n(1 - n)(1 + n)$ for composite integers $n$.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$ for all composite integers $n$ is 2.",
