    "solution": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$.",
    "gpt_response": "We have $8! = 8 \\times 7!$, so we are looking for divisors of $8!$ that are greater than $7!$.\n\nLet $d$ be a divisor of $8!$ that is greater than $7!$. Since $d$ divides $8!$ and $8! = 8 \\times 7!$, we must have $d = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\times 7^d$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 3$, $0 \\leq b \\leq 1$, $0 \\leq c \\leq 1$, and $0 \\leq d \\leq 1$. Furthermore, since $d$ is greater than $7! = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$, we must have $a \\geq 3$.\n\nSo, there are $(4)(2)(2)(2) = 32$ choices for the exponents $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{32}$ divisors of $8!$ that are greater than $7!$.",
