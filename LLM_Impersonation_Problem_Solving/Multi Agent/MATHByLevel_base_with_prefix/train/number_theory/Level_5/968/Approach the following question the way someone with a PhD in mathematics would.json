    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we first need to understand how the total number of factors of a given number can be calculated. \n\nLet's denote the prime factorization of a number as $N = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_n^{a_n}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_i$ are their respective powers. \n\nThe total number of factors of $N$ is given by $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\cdots (a_n+1)$.\n\nNow, given $x$, $y$, and $z$ each have exactly three natural number factors, their prime factorizations would be of the form:\n$x=p^{2}$, $y=q^{2}$, $z=r^{2}$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ would be $(p^{2})^{2}(q^{2})^{3}(r^{2})^{4}$ \n\nThis simplifies to $p^{4}q^{6}r^{8}$\n\nNow, the total number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ would be $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1) = 5 \\times 7 \\times 9 = 315$\n\nHence, $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ has 315 factors.",
