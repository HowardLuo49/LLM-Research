Let $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first understand that if $n$ is a multiple of 15, then $n$ must contain at least one factor of 3 and one factor of 5 in its prime factorization. Also, since $f(n)$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$, we need to consider the highest powers of 3 and 5 in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of $15 = 3 \\times 5$. Since we are looking for the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$, we can consider $n = 3 \\times 5 = 15$ as the starting point.\n\nFor $n = 15$, we have $f(15) = 5$ because $5! = 120$ is divisible by 15. Here, $f(15) = 5$ is already greater than 15, so we need to consider larger values of $n$.\n\nFor $n = 30$, we have $f(30) = 6$ because $6! = 720$ is divisible by 30.
