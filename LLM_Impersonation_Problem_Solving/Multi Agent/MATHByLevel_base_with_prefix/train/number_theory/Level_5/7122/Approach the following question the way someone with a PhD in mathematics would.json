    "solution": "We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits. Every one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \\cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits. Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\\cdots+9)(72) \\times 100 = 45 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 100 = 324000$.\nEvery one of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it. Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$). Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 10 = 28800$.\nThe same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 1 = 2880$. Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\\boxed{680}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To compute the sum $S$ of all three-digit positive integers with three distinct digits, we need to consider the possible combinations of digits. \n\nThere are $9$ choices for the hundreds digit (cannot be zero), $9$ choices for the tens digit (cannot be the same as the hundreds digit or zero), and $8$ choices for the units digit (cannot be the same as the hundreds or tens digit). Therefore, there are $9 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 648$ three-digit positive integers with distinct digits.\n\nThe sum $S$ is then given by:\n$S = 100(1+2+3+ \\ldots + 9) + 10(1+2+3+ \\ldots + 9) + 1(1+2+3+ \\ldots + 8)$\n$S = 100 \\times 45 + 10 \\times 45 + 1 \\times 36$\n$S = 4500 + 450 + 36$\n$S = 4986$\n\nTo find the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$, we divide $4986$ by $1000$:\n$4986 = 4 \\times 1000 + 986$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{986}$.",
