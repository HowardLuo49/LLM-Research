    "solution": "We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits. Every one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \\cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits. Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\\cdots+9)(72) \\times 100 = 45 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 100 = 324000$.\nEvery one of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it. Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$). Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 10 = 28800$.\nThe same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 1 = 2880$. Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\\boxed{680}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum $S$, we can consider the possible combinations of the three distinct digits in a three-digit number.\n\nThere are $\\binom{9}{3}$ ways to choose the three distinct digits for the hundreds, tens, and units places. The sum of all the digits from $0$ to $9$ is $0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45$. So, the sum of the three distinct digits in a three-digit number is $45 - x - y - z$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the three digits. Since the digits cannot be $0$, the sum of the three digits will always be at least $14$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all three-digit numbers with three distinct digits is \n$100(14 + 15 + 16 + \\ldots + 23) = 100(230)$\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when $23000$ is divided by $1000$.\n$23000 \\div 1000 = 23$ remainder $0$\n\nSo, the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",
