    "solution": "Let $m = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $n = 2^{1989}-1$. Then, $2^9n = 2^9(2^{1989}-1) = 2^{1998} - 2^9 = m - (2^9 - 1)$. By the Euclidean algorithm, it follows that \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(m,n) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,m-2^9n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,2^9-1). \\\\\n\\end{align*}Since $9$ divides $1998$, by the difference of odd powers factorization, it follows that $2^{1989}-1$ is divisible by $2^9 - 1$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is $2^9 - 1 = \\boxed{511}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nFirst, we divide $2^{1998}-1$ by $2^{1989}-1$ to get the remainder:\n$$2^{1998}-1 = (2^{1989}-1)(2^9+1) + (2^9-1)$$\n\nNext, we divide $2^{1989}-1$ by $(2^9-1)$:\n$$2^{1989}-1 = (2^9-1)(2^{1980}+2^{1971}+...+2^{18}+1)$$\n\nSince $2^9-1$ divides $2^9-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$, the greatest common divisor of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$ is $2^9-1$, which equals $511$. \n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$ is $511$.",
