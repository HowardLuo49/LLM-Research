    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000, we need to find the largest possible number that is a multiple of 8, has no repeating digits, and consists of different digits.\n\nNote that for a number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must form a number that is divisible by 8. Let's consider the divisibility by 8 rule:\n\n1. Take the last three digits of the number, which we will be trying to form into a multiple of 8.\n2. If this number is divisible by 8, then the original number is divisible by 8.\n\nNow, we need to construct the largest number using different digits that is a multiple of 8. Starting with the last three digits, we need to find the largest multiple of 8 that satisfies the condition.\n\nThe largest multiple of 8 with distinct digits that we can form by arranging any of the six digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} in any order is 864.

To maximize the number, we should arrange them in descending order, giving us the number 654321.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer multiple of 8 with distinct digits is 654,321, which means when divided by 1000, the remainder is $\\boxed{321}$.",
