    "solution": "If $n^2 + 12n - 2007 = m^2$, we can complete the square on the left-hand side to get $n^2 + 12n + 36 = m^2 + 2043$ so $(n+6)^2 = m^2 + 2043$. Subtracting $m^2$ and factoring the left-hand side, we get $(n + m + 6)(n - m + 6) = 2043$. $2043 = 3^2 \\cdot 227$, which can be split into two factors in 3 ways, $2043 \\cdot 1 = 3 \\cdot 681 = 227 \\cdot 9$. This gives us three pairs of equations to solve for $n$:\n$n + m + 6 = 2043$ and $n - m + 6 = 1$ give $2n + 12 = 2044$ and $n = 1016$.\n$n + m + 6 = 681$ and $n - m + 6 = 3$ give $2n + 12 = 684$ and $n = 336$.\n$n + m + 6 = 227$ and $n - m + 6 = 9$ give $2n + 12 = 236$ and $n = 112$.\nFinally, $1016 + 336 + 112 = 1464$, so the answer is $\\boxed{464}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum $S$ of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2+12n-2007$ is a perfect square, we can first rewrite the expression $n^2+12n-2007$ as $k^2$ for some integer $k$. This gives us the equation $n^2+12n-2007=k^2$. \n\nNow, we can complete the square on the left side of the equation to simplify it. We add $(12/2)^2 = 36$ to both sides to get $(n+6)^2=k^2+2043$. \n\nRearranging the equation, we get $(n+6)^2-k^2=2043$. This is a difference of squares, which can be factored as $(n+6+k)(n+6-k)=2043$. \n\nSince $2043=3*3*227$, we can consider all possible factor pairs of $2043$ and solve for $n$. \n\nOne possible factor pair is $(n+6+k,n+6-k)=(1,2043)$, which gives $n=-2020$ or $n=-2048$. Since we are looking for positive integers $n$, these solutions are not valid.\n\nThe other possible factor pair is $(n+6+k,n+6-k)=(3,681)$, which gives $n=675$.\n\nTherefore, the sum $S = 675$. To find the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$, we simply take $675 \\equiv 675 \\mod 1000$. \n\nSo, the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{675}$.",
