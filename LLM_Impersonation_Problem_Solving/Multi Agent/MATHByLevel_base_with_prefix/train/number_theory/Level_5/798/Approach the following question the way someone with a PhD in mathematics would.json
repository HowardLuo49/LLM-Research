    "solution": "We use the property that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\n$333 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$, therefore $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333} \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $3^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, we get that $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333}=3^{5 \\cdot 66 +3}=(3^5)^{66} \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv 1^{66} \\cdot 27 \\equiv \\boxed{5} \\pmod{11}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any prime number $p$ and any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nSince $11$ is a prime number and $333$ is not divisible by $11$, we have:\n$333^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n$333^{333} = (333^{10})^{33} \\cdot 333^{3} \\equiv 1^{33} \\cdot 27 \\pmod{11}$.\n$333^{333} \\equiv 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$ is $5$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 5?: To find the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any prime number $p$ and any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nSince $11$ is a prime number and $333$ is not divisible by $11$, we have:\n$333^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n$333^{333} = (333^{10})^{33} \\cdot 333^{3} \\equiv 1^{33} \\cdot 27 \\pmod{11}$.\n$333^{333} \\equiv 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$ is $5$.",
