    "solution": "Looking at the $d$'s place, we see that $A_d + A_d = 16_d = d + 6$ or $A_d + A_d + 1 = 16_d = d + 6$ (if there is carry-over). Re-arranging and solving for $A_d$, we find that $A_d = \\frac{d + 6}2$ or $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. In either case, since $d > 6$, it follows that $A_d > 2$. Thus, when we add the units digits $B_d + A_d$, there must be carry-over, so $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. It follows that $$B_d + A_d = d + 2 \\Longrightarrow B_d = d+2 - \\frac{d + 5}2 = \\frac d2 - \\frac 12.$$Thus, $A_d - B_d = \\frac{d + 5}2 - \\frac{d-1}{2} = \\boxed{3}_d$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can write the given equation as $d^2A + dB + dA + A = d^2 + 6d + 2$. This simplifies to $d(dA + B + A) = d^2 + 6d + 2$. Since $d > 6$, we know that $d^2 > 36d$ and $d^2 + 6d + 2 > 36d$ as well, which implies that $dA + B + A = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $A + A + B = 1$, which means that $2A + B = 1$. Since $A$ and $B$ are digits in base $d$, we know that $A < d$ and $B < d$. Since $2A + B = 1$, we have $B = 1 - 2A$. Since $B < d$, $1 - 2A < d$, which implies that $A > \\frac{1-d}{2}$.
