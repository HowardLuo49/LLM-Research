    "solution": "Looking at the $d$'s place, we see that $A_d + A_d = 16_d = d + 6$ or $A_d + A_d + 1 = 16_d = d + 6$ (if there is carry-over). Re-arranging and solving for $A_d$, we find that $A_d = \\frac{d + 6}2$ or $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. In either case, since $d > 6$, it follows that $A_d > 2$. Thus, when we add the units digits $B_d + A_d$, there must be carry-over, so $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. It follows that $$B_d + A_d = d + 2 \\Longrightarrow B_d = d+2 - \\frac{d + 5}2 = \\frac d2 - \\frac 12.$$Thus, $A_d - B_d = \\frac{d + 5}2 - \\frac{d-1}{2} = \\boxed{3}_d$.",
    "gpt_response": "We begin by expressing the given equation in terms of the base $d$ representation of the numbers:\n\n$$dA + B + dA = 1 \\cdot d^2 + 6 \\cdot d + 2.$$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$$2dA + B = d^2 + 6d + 2.$$\n\nSince $6 < d$, it follows that $d > 6 \\Rightarrow d \\geq 7$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$d^2 + 6d + 2 = d(d+6) + 2 < d(d+d) + 2 = 2d^2$$\n\nThis implies that $2dA + B = d^2 + 6d + 2 < 2d^2$, which means $2dA + B$ must be a one-digit number in base $d$. Therefore, $2dA + B = d + 1$.\n\nHowever, our goal is to find $A_d - B_d$, which we can calculate as:\n\n$$A_d - B_d = A \\cdot d + B - B = A \\cdot d.$$\n\nTherefore, from our previous equation, we can determine that $A \\cdot d = \\frac{d+1}{2}$.
