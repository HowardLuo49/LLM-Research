    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ be the prime factorization of $n$, where $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$ are distinct primes. \n\nWe know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)\\cdot\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n,100)}=100\\cdot\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n,100)}$, so we have $$100\\cdot\\frac{n}{\\gcd(n,100)} = \\gcd(n,100)+450.$$We can simplify this equation by noting that $\\gcd(n,100)$ divides $n$ and 100, so it must also divide the right hand side. Since 450=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^2, we have $2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^2$ divides $\\gcd(n,100)+450$. This tells us that $\\gcd(n,100)\\equiv 2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^2\\equiv0\\pmod{100}$.\n\nIt follows that $n$ must also be divisible by 100 for the above equation to hold. Let $n=100m$. Substituting this into the equation gives us $$100\\cdot\\frac{100m}{\\gcd(100m,100)} = \\gcd(100m,100)+450.$$Simplifying this equation, we get $100\\cdot m = \\gcd(m,1)+450$, or $100m = 1+450$. This implies $m=5$. Therefore, the positive integers that satisfy the original equation are of the form $n=100\\cdot5=500$, and the sum of all such integers is $\\boxed{500}$.",
