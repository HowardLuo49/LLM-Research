    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive perfect square integers are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$?",
    "solution": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the given product, we need to consider the exponents of the prime factors in the product.\n\nThe given product is $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$. In order for a number to be a perfect square, each prime factor that appears in the number must have an even exponent.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, the possible even exponents are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. This gives us a total of 6 options for the exponent of 2.\n\nFor the prime factor 3, the possible even exponents are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. This gives us a total of 7 options for the exponent of 3.\n\nFor the prime factor 5, the possible even exponents are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. This gives us a total of 8 options for the exponent of 5.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the given product is the product of the number of options for each prime factor, which is $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = 336$.\n\nSo, there are 336 positive perfect square integers that are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.",
