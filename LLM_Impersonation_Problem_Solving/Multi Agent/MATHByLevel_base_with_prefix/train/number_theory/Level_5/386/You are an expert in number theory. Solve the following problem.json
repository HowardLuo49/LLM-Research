    "solution": "We first need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$. There are $8$ even numbers less than or equal to $16$, which contribute a power of $2^8$; of these, $4$ are divisible by $4$ and contribute an additional power of $2^4$; two are divisible by $8$ and contributes an additional power of $2^2$; and finally, one is divisible by $16$ and contributes an additional power of $2$. In total, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16!$ is equal to $2^{8+4+2+1} = 2^{15}$.\n\nChecking the ones digits of the powers of $2$, we see that the ones digit of $2^1$ is $2$, of $2^2$ is $4$, of $2^3$ is $8$, of $2^4$ is $6$, and of $2^5$ is $2$. Thus, the ones digit will repeat every $4$ exponents, and the ones digit of $2^{15} = 2^{4 \\times 3 + 3}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$, we need to find the largest power of $2$ that appears in the prime factorization of $(2^4)!$.\n\nThe largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is equal to the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $(2^4)!$. We can find this by summing up the powers of $2$ in the prime factorization of each number from $1$ to $2^4$.\n\nThe powers of $2$ that appear in the prime factorization of each number from $1$ to $2^4$ are as follows:\n\n$1$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$2$ has $1$ factor of $2$.\n\n$3$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$4$ has $2$ factors of $2$.\n\n$5$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$6$ has $1$ factor of $2$.\n\n$7$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$8$ has $3$ factors of $2$.\n\n$9$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$10$ has $1$ factor of $2$.\n\n$11$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$12$ has $2$ factors of $2$.\n\n$13$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$14$ has $1$ factor of $2$.\n\n$15$ has $0$ factors of $2$.\n\n$16$ has $4$ factors of $2$.\n\nAdding up all the factors of $2$ from $1$ to $16$, we get $1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 18$. Therefore, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is $2^{18}$.\n\nThe ones digit of $2^{18}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^8$ because the cycle of the ones digits of powers of $2$ repeats every $4$ powers. Therefore, the ones digit of $2^{18}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^2$, which is $4$.\n\nSo the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
