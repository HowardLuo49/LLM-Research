    "solution": "The prime factorization of $1001 = 7\\times 11\\times 13$. We have $7\\times 11\\times 13\\times k = 10^j - 10^i = 10^i(10^{j - i} - 1)$. Since $\\text{gcd}\\,(10^i = 2^i \\times 5^i, 7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 1$, we require that $1001 = 10^3 + 1 | 10^{j-i} - 1$. From the factorization $10^6 - 1 = (10^3 + 1)(10^{3} - 1)$, we see that $j-i = 6$ works; also, $a-b | a^n - b^n$ implies that $10^{6} - 1 | 10^{6k} - 1$, and so any $\\boxed{j-i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}}$ will work.\nTo show that no other possibilities work, suppose $j-i \\equiv a \\pmod{6},\\ 1 \\le a \\le 5$, and let $j-i-a = 6k$. Then we can write $10^{j-i} - 1 = 10^{a} (10^{6k} - 1) + (10^{a} - 1)$, and we can easily verify that $10^6 - 1 \\nmid 10^a - 1$ for $1 \\le a \\le 5$.\nIf $j - i = 6, j\\leq 99$, then we can have solutions of $10^6 - 10^0, 10^7 - 10^1, \\dots\\implies 94$ ways. If $j - i = 12$, we can have the solutions of $10^{12} - 10^{0},\\dots\\implies 94 - 6 = 88$, and so forth. Therefore, the answer is $94 + 88 + 82 + \\dots + 4\\implies 16\\left(\\dfrac{98}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{784}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question, we first note that $1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$. We can express $10^{j} - 10^{i}$ as $10^{i} (10^{j-i} - 1)$. \n\nSince $1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$, we know that $10^{1001} \\equiv 10^{13} \\pmod{1001}$ due to Fermat's Little Theorem. This implies that $10^{13} - 1$ is a multiple of $1001$.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $10^{k} \\equiv 1 \\pmod {1001}$. This will give us the number of possible $j - i$ combinations for which $10^{j-i} - 1$ is divisible by $1001$.\n\nIt is known that $10^{k} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$ if and only if $k$ is a multiple of the order of $10$ mod $1001$. \n\nIn this case, we need to find the order of $10$ with respect to $1001$. This can be calculated by finding the smallest $k$ such that $10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$. By calculating the powers of $10$ modulo $1001$, we find that the order of $10$ modulo $1001$ is $60$.\n\nTherefore, there are $60$ distinct values for $j-i$ that satisfy the condition $10^{j} - 10^{i} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1001}$, and hence there are $60$ positive integer multiples of $1001$ that can be expressed in the given form.",
