An internal diagonal of this solid passes through the interiors of how many of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes?\n",
    "solution": "Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$. The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ respectively. We proceed by using PIE.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\\frac{d}{324}$. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324)$ times. Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\\gcd(375, 150)$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ are equal. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.\nThe total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\\gcd(150, 324)+\\gcd(324, 375)+\\gcd(375, 150))] + \\gcd(150, 324, 375) = \\boxed{768}$",
    "gpt_response": "The internal diagonal of the rectangular solid passes through the three pairs of opposite vertices of the solid. Each pair of opposite vertices determines a line segment that passes through the interiors of some of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes.\n\nTo find how many cubes the diagonal passes through, we can find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the dimensions of the solid. In this case, the gcd of 150, 324, and 375 is 3.\n\nSince the diagonal passes through each cube with edges parallel to the main diagonal once, the number of cubes it passes through is equal to the length of the main diagonal divided by the gcd of the dimensions. The length of the main diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$\\sqrt{150^2 + 324^2 + 375^2} = \\sqrt{22500 + 104976 + 140625} = \\sqrt{267101} \\approx 516.908$\n\nTherefore, the internal diagonal of the solid passes through 516 cubes.",
