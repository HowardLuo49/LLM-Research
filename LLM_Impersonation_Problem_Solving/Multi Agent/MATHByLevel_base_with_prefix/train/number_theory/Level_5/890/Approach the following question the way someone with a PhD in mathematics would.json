    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A book has 136 pages. Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it. The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203. How many words are on each page?",
    "solution": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we can denote the number of words on each page as x. Since there are 136 pages in total, the total number of words in the book is 136x.\n\nAccording to the given information, the total number of words in the book (136x) is congruent to 184 modulo 203. This can be represented as:\n\n136x \u2261 184 (mod 203)\n\nTo solve for x, we need to find an integer value of x that satisfies this congruence relation.\n\nBy solving this congruence relation, we get:\n136x \u2261 184 (mod 203)\n68x \u2261 92 (mod 203)\n17x \u2261 23 (mod 203)\n\nNow, we need to find an integer value of x such that 17x \u2261 23 (mod 203).
