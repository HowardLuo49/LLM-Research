    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the possible range of $b$. The smallest three-digit number in base $b$ is $100_b$, which is equivalent to $b^2$. The largest three-digit number in base $b$ is $999_b$, which is equivalent to $9b^2 + 9b + 9$.\n\nSince we are looking for exactly 100 three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct, we need to find the integers $b$ for which the difference between the largest and smallest three-digit numbers in base $b$ (i.e., $9b^2 + 9b + 9 - b^2$) is equal to 99. Therefore, we have the following equation:\n\\[9b^2 + 9b + 9 - b^2 = 99\\]\n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\\[8b^2 + 9b - 90 = 0\\]\n\\[(8b + 45)(b - 2) = 0\\]\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $b$ are $b = 2$ or $b = -\\frac{45}{8}$.
