    "solution": "It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.\n$6^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12}$\nThe LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\\max(24,a)}3^{\\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \\le a \\le 24$, there are $\\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the prime factorization of $6^6$ and $8^8$.\n\n$6^6 = 2^6 * 3^6$\n\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n\nNow, we want $12^{12}$ to be the least common multiple of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$. This means that the prime factorization of $k$ must only contain factors of 2 and 3, and the powers of 2 and 3 in $k$ must be less than or equal to the powers in $12^{12} = 2^{24} * 3^{12}$.\n\nSince $k$ must have factors of 2 and 3, the powers of 2 in $k$ could be $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^{23}$. Similarly, the powers of 3 in $k$ could be $3^0, 3^1, 3^2, ..., 3^{11}$.\n\nTherefore, there are $24*12 = 288$ possible values of $k$ that satisfy the conditions.
