    "solution": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired.",
    "gpt_response": "We can rewrite the expression as $(3^{-1} + 3^{-2}) \\mod{25}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the modular inverse of 3 modulo 25. We are looking for an integer $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$. We see that $3 \\cdot 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$, so the modular inverse of 3 modulo 25 is 17. Therefore, $3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nNow we can substitute this into our expression: $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 17 + (3^{-1})^2 \\equiv 17 + 17^2 \\mod{25}$.\n\nWe calculate $17^2 \\equiv 289 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{25}$. Therefore, $17 + 17^2 \\equiv 17 + 14 \\equiv 31 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$.\n\nThus, $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$. The answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
