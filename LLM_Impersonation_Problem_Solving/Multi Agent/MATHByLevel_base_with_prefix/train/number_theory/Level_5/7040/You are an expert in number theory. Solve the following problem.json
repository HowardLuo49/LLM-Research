Call a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ as $a_na_{n-1}a_{n-2}...a_1a_0$, where $a_i$ are digits in base-$7$.\n\nWe have that $N = a_7 \\cdot 7^7 + a_6 \\cdot 7^6 + ... + a_1 \\cdot 7 + a_0$. Since we want the base-$10$ representation of the digits to be twice $N$, we have that:\n\n$2N = 2(a_7 \\cdot 7^7 + a_6 \\cdot 7^6 + ... + a_1 \\cdot 7 + a_0)$\n$ = 2a_7 \\cdot 7^8 + 2a_6 \\cdot 7^7 + ... + 2a_1 \\cdot 7^2 + 2a_0 \\cdot 7$\n\nThis means that the last digit of $2N$ must be $2a_0$, and the second to last digit must be $2a_1$, and so on. We see that the carry-overs will be in the base-$10$ representation of $N$, which requires that $a_0, a_1, a_2...a_6 < 5$ in order for no carry-over to occur.\n\nTherefore, the largest digit in base-$7$ possible for this problem is $4$, and the largest 7-10 double is $444444$, which is equal to $260824$ in base-$10$.",
