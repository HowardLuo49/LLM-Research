    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of members in the band as x. We can then form the following equations based on the given information:\n\n8r = x - 2, where r is the number of columns\n9s = x - 3, where s is the number of columns\n\nWe can simplify these equations to:\nx = 8r + 2\nx = 9s + 3\n\nSince x is the same in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:\n8r + 2 = 9s + 3\n8r - 9s = 1\n\nWe are looking for the value of x that is between 100 and 200, so we can substitute the first equation into this inequality:\n8r + 2 > 100\n8r > 98\nr > 12.25\n\n8r + 2 < 200\n8r < 198\nr < 24.75\n\nSince r is an integer representing the number of columns, we have that 13 \u2264 r \u2264 24.\n\nPlugging these values back into the equation 8r - 9s = 1, we find that the only values of r that satisfy the equation for integer values of s are r = 17 and s = 15. This gives us x = 146.\n\nTherefore, the band has 146 members.",
