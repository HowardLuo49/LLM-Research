Define a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\n",
    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's consider the factors of $2$ and $5$ in the prime factorization of $m!$. Since $m!$ ends with $n$ zeroes, there must be at least $n$ factors of $5$ in the prime factorization of $m!$. Since there are more factors of $2$ than factors of $5$ in any number $m!$, we only need to consider the number of factors of $5$ in the prime factorization of $m!$. \n\nLet's consider the number of factors of $5$ in the prime factorization of $m!$.

This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers less than $1992$ where the number of factors of $5$ in their prime factorization is less than the number of zeroes required at the end of the factorial.\n\nThe largest power of $5$ that is less than $1992$ is $5^4=625$, so we consider numbers up to $625$.\n\nThe number of positive integers less than or equal to $625$ that are factorial tails is $$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{625}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{625}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{625}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{625}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 125 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 156.$$ \n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails is $1992 - 156 = 1836$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{1836}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
