    "solution": "Let $n$ be the other integer, so \\[\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n]}{\\gcd(45,n)} = 33.\\]We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, so \\[\\gcd(45,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n] = 45n.\\]Dividing this equation by the previous equation, we get \\[[\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = \\frac{45n}{33} = \\frac{15n}{11},\\]so $11 [\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = 15n$.\n\nSince 11 divides the left-hand side, 11 also divides the right-hand side, which means $n$ is divisible by 11.  Also, 15 divides the right-hand side, so 15 divides the left-hand side, which means $\\gcd(45,n)$ is divisible by 15.  Since $45 = 3 \\cdot 15$, $n$ is divisible by 15.  Hence, $n$ must be divisible by $11 \\cdot 15 = 165$.\n\nNote that $\\gcd(45,165) = 15$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,165] = 495$, and $495/15 = 33$, so $n=165$ is achievable and the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{165}$.",
