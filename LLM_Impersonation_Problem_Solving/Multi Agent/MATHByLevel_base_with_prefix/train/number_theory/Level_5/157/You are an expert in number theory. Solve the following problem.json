    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ have?",
    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",
    "gpt_response": "A perfect square factor will have each exponent in the prime factorization of the number be even.\n\nIn order for a factor of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ to be even, the exponent of 2 must be even. This means the possible exponents for 2 in the factor are 0, 2, or 4. \n\nIn order for the factor to be a perfect square, the exponent of 7 must also be even. This means the possible exponents for 7 in the factor are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nThere are 3 choices for the exponent of 2 and 5 choices for the exponent of 7, so the total number of even perfect square factors is $3 \\times 5 = 15$. \n\nTherefore, $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ has 15 even perfect square factors.",
