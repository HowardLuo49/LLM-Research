    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer $N$ whose square has exactly 3 digits when written in base 9, we need to consider that the largest 3-digit number in base 9 is $728_9$ (which is equivalent to $7*9^2 + 2*9 + 8 = 567$ in base 10). \n\nWe are looking for the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to $728_9$ when converted to base 10. Let's denote $N$ as a 3-digit number in base 9, i.e., $N = abc_9$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits in the range from 0 to 8.\n\nWhen squared, the largest value of $N$ in base 9 would be $N^2 = 728_9$.
