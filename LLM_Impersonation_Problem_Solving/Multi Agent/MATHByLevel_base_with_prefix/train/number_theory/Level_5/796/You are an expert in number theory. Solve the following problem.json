    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N$ be the largest integer whose square has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9. \n\nLet $N-1 = 9^k + 9^{k-1} + \\dots + 9^1 + 9^0$ for some integer $k$. Then, $N = 9^k + 9^{k-1} + \\dots + 9^1 + 9^0 + 1$. \n\nWe know that the square of $N$ can be expressed as $(9^k + 9^{k-1} + \\dots + 9^1 + 9^0 + 1)^2$. Expanding this expression, we get:\n\n$N^2 = 9^{2k} + 2*9^{2k-1} + 3*9^{2k-2} + \\dots + 18*9^1 + 10$\n\nWe want $N^2$ to have exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9. This means that $9^2k > 1000$. Solving for $k$, we find $2k > \\log_9(1000) \\implies k > \\log_9(1000)/2 \\approx 3.67$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the largest possible value for $k$ is $4$. \n\nTherefore, $N = 9^4 + 9^3 + 9^2 + 9 + 1 = 59049 + 6561 + 729 + 9 + 1 = 66649$ in base 10.\n\nConverting $66649$ to base 9 yields $\\boxed{100101211}$.",
