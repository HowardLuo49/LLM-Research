    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$ given that the product of $x$, $y$, and $z$ is 2004, we need to consider the factors of 2004. \n\nFirst, we prime factorize 2004: $2004 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 167$. \n\nSince we want to minimize the sum $x + y + z$, we want to distribute the factors as equally as possible among $x$, $y$, and $z$. This means that we want to have $x$, $y$, and $z$ as close to each other as possible, while still keeping their product equal to 2004. \n\nConsidering the factors of 2004, the closest we can distribute the factors evenly is to have $x = 2^2 = 4$, $y = 3$, and $z = 167$. This results in $x + y + z = 4 + 3 + 167 = 174$. \n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$ when the product of $x$, $y$, and $z$ equals 2004 is 174.",
