    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. To express 20 as a sum of different powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$. If 400 were expressed as a sum of at least two distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 400 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 400 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 400 is $2^8=256$.  The difference between 400 and 256 is 144. The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7=128$.  The difference between 144 and 128 is 16.  Since $16=2^4$, we have found that $400=2^8+2^7+2^4$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{19}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express 400 as a sum of different powers of 2, we would first need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 400. The largest power of 2 less than 400 is $2^8 = 256$. We can then express the remaining difference, which is 400 - 256 = 144, as a sum of distinct powers of 2.\n\nNext, we find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 144. The largest power of 2 less than 144 is $2^7 = 128$. The remaining difference is 144 - 128 = 16, which can be expressed as a combination of distinct powers of 2.\n\nWe see that 16 can be expressed as 16 = $2^4$.\n\nTherefore, the expression of 400 as a sum of distinct powers of 2 is $400 = 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^4$, and the sum of the exponents of these powers is $8 + 7 + 4 = 19$. So, the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers is 19.",
