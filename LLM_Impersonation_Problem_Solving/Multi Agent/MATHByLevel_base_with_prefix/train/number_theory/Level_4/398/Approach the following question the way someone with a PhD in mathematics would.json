    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of $159137$?",
    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 159137: $159137=11\\cdot14467=11\\cdot17\\cdot851=11\\cdot17\\cdot23\\cdot37$. The positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is therefore $37-23=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the two largest prime factors of 159137, we first need to factorize 159137 as the product of its prime factors. \n\nUsing trial division, we find that 159137 = 379 * 419.\n\nTherefore, the two largest prime factors of 159137 are 379 and 419. \n\nThe positive difference between these two prime factors is |419 - 379| = 40. \n\nHence, the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is 40.",
