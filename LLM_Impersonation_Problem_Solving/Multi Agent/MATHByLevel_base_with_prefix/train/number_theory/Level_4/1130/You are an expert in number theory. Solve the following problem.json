    "solution": "Any factor of $8000=2^6\\cdot5^3$ is in the form $2^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le3$. To count the number of perfect square factors, we must count the factors of $2^6\\cdot5^3$ that have $a=0$, $2$, $4$ or $6$ and $b=0$ or $2$. This gives $4\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ perfect square factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of 8000 that are perfect squares, we first need to prime factorize 8000. \n\n8000 = 2^6 * 5^3\n\nNow, to find the factors that are perfect squares, we need to consider the exponents of the prime factors. For a factor to be a perfect square, all its prime factors must have even exponents.\n\nFor 2, the possible exponents are 0, 2, 4, and 6. This gives us 4 choices.\n\nFor 5, the possible exponents are 0 and 2. This gives us 2 choices.\n\nMultiplying these choices together, we get a total of 4 * 2 = 8 factors of 8000 that are perfect squares. \n\nTherefore, there are 8 factors of 8000 that are perfect squares.",
