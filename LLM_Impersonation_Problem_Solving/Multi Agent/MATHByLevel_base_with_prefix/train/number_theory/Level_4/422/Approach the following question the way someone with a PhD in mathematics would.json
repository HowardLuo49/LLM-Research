    "solution": "The two-digit primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. For each prime on this list whose tens digit is odd, check whether or not the number formed when the digits are reversed is also prime. (Note that if the tens digit is even, then the ``reversed'' number is even and hence not prime.) The palindromic primes less than 50 are 11, 13, 17, 31, and 37, whose sum is $\\boxed{109}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first identify all the two-digit prime numbers that are palindromic primes. Then we will sum up these numbers to find the total sum.\n\nLet's list out all the two-digit prime numbers:\n11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47\n\nAmong these numbers, we can see that the palindromic primes are 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, and 41.\n\nSumming these numbers:\n11 + 13 + 17 + 31 + 37 + 41 = 150\n\nTherefore, the sum of all palindromic primes less than 50 is 150.",
