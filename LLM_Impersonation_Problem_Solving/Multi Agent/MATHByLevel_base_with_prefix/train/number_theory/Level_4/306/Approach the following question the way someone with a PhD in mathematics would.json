    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$. The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four-letter list we are looking for be denoted as $WXYZ$. The product of this list is given by $(W)(X)(Y)(Z)$. We are given that the product of the list $ADGI$ is 252, which means $(A)(D)(G)(I) = 252 = (1)(4)(7)(9)$. Since we are looking for a list that has the same product as $PQRS$, we have $(P)(Q)(R)(S) = (W)(X)(Y)(Z)$. \n\nNow, we can rewrite the products of the lists $PQRS$ and $WXYZ$ as follows: \n$PQRS = (16)(17)(18)(19)$\n$WXYZ = (W)(X)(Y)(Z)$\n\nSince we know that the product of the lists are equal, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n$(16)(17)(18)(19) = (W)(X)(Y)(Z)$\n\nWe can then proceed by determining the prime factorizations of both sides and comparing them in order to find the values of $W$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. \n\nBy calculating the prime factorization of both sides, we find that:\n$(16)(17)(18)(19) = (2^4)(17)(2)(3^2)(19) = (2^2)(3^2)(17)(19)$\n\nTherefore, the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$ is $CITY$, where $C=3$, $I=9$, $T=20$, $Y=25$.",
