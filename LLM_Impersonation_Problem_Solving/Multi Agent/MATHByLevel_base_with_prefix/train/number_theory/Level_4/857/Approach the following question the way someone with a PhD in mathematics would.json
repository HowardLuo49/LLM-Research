    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A day can be evenly divided into 86,400 periods of 1 second; 43,200 periods of each 2 seconds; or in many other ways. In total, how many ways are there to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers?",
    "solution": "A day has $86,\\!400$ seconds. $86,\\!400=2^7\\cdot3^3\\cdot5^2$, so 86,400 has $(7+1)(3+1)(2+1)=96$ positive factors. Thus there are $96/2=48$ (unordered) pairs of factors each of whose product is $86,\\!400.$ Since ``$n$ periods of $m$ seconds'' is different from ``$m$ periods of $n$ seconds,'' we need to multiply $48$ by $2$ to get our final answer of $\\boxed{96}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the total number of ways to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, we can consider the problem in terms of partitions. \n\nLet's denote the total number of seconds in a day as $T = 86400$. We are looking for the number of ways to partition $T$ into $n$ parts, each of size $m$.\n\nThis can be represented as finding the number of solutions to the equation $nm = T$. Since we are considering integers, we can rewrite this as finding the number of solutions of non-negative integers $(n, m)$ to the equation $nm = T$.\n\nIt is well-known that the number of solutions to this equation can be found through its prime factorization. In this case, $T$ has prime factorization $2^7 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^2$. Therefore, the total number of solutions can be determined by the formula $\\tau(T) = (7+1)(3+1)(2+1) = 96$.\n\nHence, there are a total of 96 ways to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers.",
