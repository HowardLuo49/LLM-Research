    "solution": "$285_{10}$ is only four digits for bases 5 and 6, since only these two bases satisfy $b^{4}>285_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. Testing each of our two cases, we find that $285_{10}= 2120_{5} = 1153_{6}$, so only base $\\boxed{6}$ yields a four-digit representation with an odd units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's represent the number $285_{10}$ in base $b$ as $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the digits in the base $b$ representation.\n\nUsing the definition of base conversion, we have:\n$$285 = a \\cdot b^2 + b \\cdot b^1 + c \\cdot b^0$$\n$$285 = a \\cdot b^2 + b \\cdot b + c$$\n$$285 = a \\cdot b^2 + b^2 + c$$\n$$285 = (a+1) \\cdot b^2 + c$$\n\nSince the base $b$ representation of $285_{10}$ is a four digit number, $a$ must be less than or equal to 7.
