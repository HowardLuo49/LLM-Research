    "solution": "Adding $-13$ to both sides of $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ gives $x \\equiv 55-13 \\pmod{34}$. We find $55-13 = 42 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{34}$, so $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{34}$. Thus the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given congruence is $x = 8$, and all the other solutions can be obtained by a multiple of 34 to 8. The next three such integers are 42, 76, and 110. Since 110 is greater than 100, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers less than 100 that satisfy the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of solutions for the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$, we first rewrite it as $x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{34}$.\n\nWe can simplify this further by finding the residue of 42 modulo 34, which is 8. Therefore, the congruence can be written as $x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{34}$.\n\nTo find the solutions, we need to look for all integers $x$ that satisfy the congruence. Since $x$ is a positive integer less than 100, we can list out the possible values of $x$ that satisfy the congruence:\n\n8, 42, 76\n\nTherefore, the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$ has 3 solutions for $x$ in the given range.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 3?: To determine the number of solutions for the congruence $x + 13 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{34}$, we first rewrite it as $x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{34}$.\n\nWe can simplify this further by finding the residue of 42 modulo 34, which is 8.
