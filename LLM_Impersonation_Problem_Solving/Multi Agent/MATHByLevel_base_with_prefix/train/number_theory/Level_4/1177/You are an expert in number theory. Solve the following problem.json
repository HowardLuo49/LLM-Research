    "gpt_response": "We can start by rewriting the given congruence as $-200 \\equiv n \\pmod{19}$ as $n \\equiv -200 \\pmod{19}$. Therefore, we need to find an integer $n$ such that when $-200$ is divided by $19$, the remainder is $n$.\n\nWe can start by finding the remainder when $200$ is divided by $19$. We have $200 = 19 \\cdot 10 + 10$, so the remainder is $10$. Since we are dealing with negative numbers, the remainder would be $19-10=9$.
