    "solution": "Note that  $13^{51}$ is $(10 + 3)^{51}$. Any term in the expansion that involves the 10 will be 0 modulo 5, so it suffices to consider $3^{51} \\pmod{5}$. We look for a pattern in powers of 3. \\begin{align*}\n3^1 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^3 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\\\\n3^4 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*}Since $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5},$ we see that $3^{51} \\equiv 3^3 \\cdot (3^4)^{12} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $13^{51}$ is divided by 5, we can use the property of congruence in modular arithmetic.\n\nFirst, notice that $13 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, which means that $13$ is congruent to $3$ when divided by 5.\n\nNext, we can raise both sides of the congruence to the power of 51:\n$13^{51} \\equiv 3^{51} \\pmod{5}$\n\nNow, we can simplify $3^{51} \\pmod{5}$ using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is not divisible by $p$.\n\nSince 5 is a prime number and 3 is not divisible by 5, we have:\n$3^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nTherefore, $3^{51} = 3^{4 \\times 12 + 3} = (3^{4})^{12} \\times 3^3 \\equiv 1^{12} \\times 27 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $13^{51}$ is divided by 5 is 2.",
