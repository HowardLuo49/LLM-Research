    "solution": "$$ \\text{gcd}(7560, 8400) = 840 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1 $$The common divisors of 7560 and 8400 are the divisors of their GCD: $$ t(840) = (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = \\boxed{32}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive divisors of a number, we need to factorize the number into its prime factors and then determine all the possible combinations of these prime factors that can be multiplied together to give a divisor of the number.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 8400 and 7560:\n\n8400 = 2^4 * 3 * 5^2 * 7\n7560 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5 * 7\n\nNow, to find the positive divisors of each number, we need to consider all possible ways of choosing exponents for each prime factor. For 8400, the total number of positive divisors is calculated as (4+1)(1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 60. For 7560, the total number of positive divisors is calculated as (3+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 64.\n\nTo find the number of positive divisors that 8400 and 7560 have in common, we need to consider the common prime factors and their respective exponents in both numbers. Since both 8400 and 7560 have prime factors 2, 3, 5, and 7, we need to find the common exponents for each prime factor.\n\nFor 2: The minimum exponent for 2 in both numbers is 3, so we have (3+1) = 4 choices.\nFor 3: The minimum exponent for 3 in both numbers is 1, so we have (1+1) = 2 choices.\nFor 5: The minimum exponent for 5 in both numbers is 1, so we have (1+1) = 2 choices.\nFor 7: The minimum exponent for 7 in both numbers is 1, so we have (1+1) = 2 choices.\n\nThus, the number of positive divisors that 8400 and 7560 have in common is calculated as 4*2*2*2 = 32.",
