    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. How many three-digit perfect squares are palindromes?",
    "solution": "The possible units digits of a perfect square are 0 ($0^2$), 1 ($1^2$, $9^2$), 4 ($2^2$, $8^2$), 9 ($3^2$, $7^2$), 6 ($4^2$, $6^2$), and 5 ($5^2$). Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0. The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ perfect squares that are palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us represent a three-digit palindrome as $ABA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits. Since the number is a perfect square, it must be of the form $100A+10B+A=101A+10B$. \n\nFor a perfect square to be a three-digit number, we must have $1 \\leq A \\leq 9$. If $A = 1$, then $101+10B$ must be a perfect square, and the only perfect square that satisfies this condition is $121$. Therefore, we have one palindrome: $121$.\n\nIf $A=2$, then $202+10B$ must be a perfect square. The only perfect square that satisfies this condition is $4^2=16$, which is not a three-digit number.\n\nIf $A=3$, then $303+10B$ must be a perfect square. The only perfect square that satisfies this condition is $9^2=81$, which is not a three-digit number.\n\nIf $A=4$, then $404+10B$ must be a perfect square. The only perfect square that satisfies this condition is $4^2=16$, which is again not a three-digit number.\n\nIf $A=5$, then $505+10B$ must be a perfect square. The perfect square that satisfies this condition is $25^2=625$, which is a three-digit number.\n\nIf $A=6$, then $606+10B$ must be a perfect square. The only perfect square that satisfies this condition is $36^2=1296$, which is not a three-digit number.\n\nIf $A=7$, then $707+10B$ must be a perfect square. The only perfect square that satisfies this condition is $49^2=2401$, which is not a three-digit number.\n\nIf $A=8$, then $808+10B$ must be a perfect square.
