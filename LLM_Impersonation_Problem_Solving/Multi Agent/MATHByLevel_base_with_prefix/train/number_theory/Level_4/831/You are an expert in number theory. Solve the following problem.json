    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can rewrite the sum as:\n\\[ S = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (2009 - 2010) = -1 - 1 - \\cdots - 1 = -1005 \\]\nSince we are looking for the residue of $S$ modulo 2010, we find that\n\\[ S \\equiv -1005 \\equiv 1005 \\pmod{2010} \\]\nTherefore, the residue of $S$ modulo 2010 is $\\boxed{1005}$.",
