    "solution": "$1995=5\\cdot399=3\\cdot5\\cdot133=3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot19$. Since $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=105$ has three digits, in any expression of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers, $19$ must be a proper factor of one of them. $19\\cdot3=57$ and $19\\cdot5=95$ are two-digit numbers that are divisible by $19$ and divide $1995$, but $19\\cdot7=133$ and $19\\cdot3\\cdot5=285$ are three digits, so the only possible expressions of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers are $57\\cdot35$ and $95\\cdot21$. So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such factorizations.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways in which 1995 can be factored as a product of two two-digit numbers, we must first express 1995 as a product of its prime factors. \n\nThe prime factorization of 1995 is: $1995 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 19$.\n\nNext, we need to consider the possible combinations of the prime factors that can form two two-digit numbers. \n\nSince both factors must be two-digit numbers, they must each have two prime factors. There are 4 prime factors of 1995, so there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose 2 out of 4 prime factors to form each of the two numbers.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the order of the two factors does not matter (i.e., $a \\cdot b$ is considered the same as $b \\cdot a$). Therefore, we must divide by 2 to account for this symmetry.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to factor 1995 as a product of two two-digit numbers is $\\frac{6}{2} = 3$. \n\nTherefore, there are 3 ways in which 1995 can be factored as a product of two two-digit numbers, considering that two factorizations of the form $a \\cdot b$ and $b \\cdot a$ are considered the same.",
