    "solution": "The value of 121 base $n$ is $1\\cdot n^2+2\\cdot n^1+1\\cdot n^0=n^2+2n+1$.  Since $n^2+2n+1=(n+1)^2$, the digit string 121 is a perfect square in any base except binary (where the digit 2 is not allowed).  There are $10-3+1=\\boxed{8}$ integers between 3 and 10 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the values of $n$ such that $121_n$ is a perfect square, we must first convert $121_n$ into base 10. \n\n$121_n = 1n^2 + 2n^1 + 1n^0 = n^2 + 2n + 1$\n\nNow we are looking for values of $n$ such that $n^2 + 2n + 1$ is a perfect square. Let us call this perfect square $m^2$.\n\nSo we have $n^2 + 2n + 1 = m^2$.\n\nRearranging the equation gives us $n^2 + 2n + 1 - m^2 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $n$, which can be solved using the quadratic formula. The discriminant of this quadratic is $(2)^2 - (4)(1)(1-m^2) = 4m^2 - 4 = 4(m^2 - 1) = 4(m+1)(m-1)$.\n\nFor this quadratic to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $m+1$ and $m-1$ must be consecutive integers that are both divisible by 4.\n\nSince $3 \\leq n \\leq 10$, we must consider the values of $m$ that are between $\\sqrt{n^2 + 2n + 1}$ and $\\sqrt{n^2 + 2n + 1}+1$.\n\nBy considering all the values of $n$ within the specified range and checking for which $m$ values the conditions are satisfied, we can determine the total number of integers $n$ that satisfy the given conditions.",

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "In this case, the final solution is not explicitly provided in the response. The response outlines the process for finding the values of $n$ such that $121_n$ is a perfect square by converting to base 10, setting up a quadratic equation, and determining conditions for the discriminant to be a perfect square. To determine if the final solution obtained is 8, additional calculations and analysis would need to be performed based on the given information.
