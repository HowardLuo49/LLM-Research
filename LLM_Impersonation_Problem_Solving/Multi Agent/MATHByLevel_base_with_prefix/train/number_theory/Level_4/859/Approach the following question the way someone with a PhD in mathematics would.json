    "solution": "If the prime factorization of an integer is given as $p_1^{a_1}\\cdot p_2^{a_2}\\cdot p_3^{a_3}\\cdot...$ the number of divisors will be: $$(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)...$$ So, we need to factor 14 in a similar manner to the expression above.  We can write: $$14=(13+1)=(1+1)(6+1)$$ The smallest integer in the first case will be $2^{13}$, and the smallest in the second case will be $2^6\\cdot 3^1=192$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{192}$ is clearly the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let n be a positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors. The number of divisors of a positive integer n can be found by factoring n into its prime factors and using the formula for the number of divisors of n in terms of the exponents of its prime factorization.\n\nLet n = p\u2081^a\u2081 * p\u2082^a\u2082 * ... * p\u2096^a\u2096, where p\u2081, p\u2082, ..., p\u2096 are distinct prime factors and a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2096 are their corresponding exponents. Then the number of divisors of n is given by the formula (a\u2081+1)(a\u2082+1)...(a\u2096+1).\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors, we want to minimize n. This can be achieved by setting n = 2^13, as this will give us exactly 14 divisors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, and 8192).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors is 2^13 = 8192.",
