    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check only composite numbers:\n\n$\\bullet$ For $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $6$, $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $12$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest abundant number, we must first understand what it means for a number to be abundant. A natural number n is considered abundant if the sum of its proper divisors (excluding n itself) is greater than n.\n\nMathematically, we can express this as follows:\nLet \u03c3(n) denote the sum of the proper divisors of n (excluding n itself). Then n is abundant if \u03c3(n) > n.\n\nTo find the smallest abundant number, we can start by examining small numbers and calculating their proper divisors. For example, let's consider the number 12:\nThe proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\nTherefore, \u03c3(12) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16.\n\nSince \u03c3(12) = 16 > 12, we see that 12 is an abundant number.\n\nContinuing this process for smaller numbers, we can determine that the smallest abundant number is 12.",
