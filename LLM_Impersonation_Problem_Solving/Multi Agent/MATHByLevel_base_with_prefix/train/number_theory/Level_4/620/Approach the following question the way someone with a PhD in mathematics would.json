    "solution": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits, we need to consider the possible values of $b$.\n\nGiven that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ as $abc$, where a, b, and c are digits in base $b$, we have:\n\n$62 = ab^2 + bc + c$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$62 = b^2a + bc + c$\n\nSince we want to use only three digits to represent 62 in base $b$, the maximum value of each digit is $(b-1)$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$(b-1)b^2 + (b-1)b + (b-1) = 62$\n\nExpanding the equation and simplifying further, we get:\n\n$b^3 - b^2 + b^2 - b + b - 1 = 62$\n\n$b^3 - 1 = 62$\n\n$b^3 = 63$\n\n$b = 3$\n\nTherefore, the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits is 3.",
