    "solution": "Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8.  Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the perfect squares less than 1000 that have a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4, we can first note that the perfect squares must also end in 2, 3, or 4. \n\nWe know that a perfect square can only end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Since we are looking for perfect squares that end in 2, 3, or 4, we can see that only 4 satisfies the requirement. This means that in order for a perfect square to have a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4, it must end in 2 (since the square of a number ending in 3 or 4 will not end in those digits).\n\nNext, we can consider the possible units digits of the square root of the perfect squares that end in 2. The units digit of a square root must be 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 since the square of these digits yield 2 as the units digit (1^2 = 1, 4^2 = 16, 5^2 = 25, 6^2 = 36, 9^2 = 81). \n\nSince we are looking for perfect squares that end in 2 and have a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4, we can see that there are no perfect squares that satisfy this condition. Therefore, the number of perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4 is 0.",
