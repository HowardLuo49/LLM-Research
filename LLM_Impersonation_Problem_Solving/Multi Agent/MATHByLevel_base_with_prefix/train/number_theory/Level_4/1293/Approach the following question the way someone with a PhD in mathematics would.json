    "solution": "Each member in the set is of the form $(x-1)+x+(x+1)=3x$. Since $x$ can be any positive integer, the greatest common divisor of all these members is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of all numbers in set $A$, we first need to characterize the elements in $A$.\n\nLet's denote the first number in the triplet of consecutive positive integers as $n$. Therefore, the numbers in set $A$ can be represented as $n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n+1)$.\n\nThus, every number in set $A$ is a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of all numbers in set $A$ is 3.",
