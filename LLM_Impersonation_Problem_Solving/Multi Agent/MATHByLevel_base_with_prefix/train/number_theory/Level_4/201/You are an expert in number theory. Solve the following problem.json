    "solution": "Write $3^{2004}$ as $(3^{4})^{501}$.  Since the units digit of $3^4=81$ is 1, the units digit of any power of $3^4$ is $\\boxed{1}$ as well.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $3^{2004}$, we need to consider the pattern of units digits of powers of 3. The units digits of powers of 3 repeat in cycles of 4: 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, ...\n\nSince 2004 is divisible by 4 (2004 = 4 * 501), the units digit of $3^{2004}$ will be the same as the units digit of $3^4$, which is 1.\n\nThus, the units digit of $3^{2004}$ is 1.",
