    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.  Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the number of packs of hot dogs Phil bought be denoted by x and the number of packs of hot dog buns he bought be denoted by y.\n\nWe know that each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs and each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.\n\nSo the total number of hot dogs Phil has is 10x and the total number of buns he has is 8y.\n\nAccording to the problem, Phil has 4 hot dogs left over. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n10x = 8y + 4\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n10x - 4 = 8y\n\nThis means that 10x - 4 is divisible by 8.\n\nNow, let's check the possible values of x:\n\nFor x = 1, we have: 10*1 - 4 = 6 which is not divisible by 8.\nFor x = 2, we have: 10*2 - 4 = 16 which is divisible by 8.\nFor x = 3, we have: 10*3 - 4 = 26 which is not divisible by 8.\nFor x = 4, we have: 10*4 - 4 = 36 which is not divisible by 8.\nFor x = 5, we have: 10*5 - 4 = 46 which is not divisible by 8.\nFor x = 6, we have: 10*6 - 4 = 56 which is divisible by 8.\n\nTherefore, the second smallest number of packs of hot dogs Phil could have bought is 6.",
