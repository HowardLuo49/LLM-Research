There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.  For how many values of $m$ can this be done?",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the number of marbles in each box. Since each box contains an equal number of marbles, $m$ must divide 600. Additionally, since there is more than one box, $m>1$. This means $m$ can take on any divisor of 600 greater than 1.\n\nTo find the number of divisors of 600, we prime factorize 600 as $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. The number of divisors of 600 is then given by $(3+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 24$. However, we have to exclude the cases where there is only one box or only one marble in each box.\n\nExcluding the case where there is only one box, we have 23 possibilities for $m$. Excluding the case where each box contains only one marble, we also have 23 possibilities for $m$. Since we overcounted the case where both conditions are violated (ie. there is only one box and it contains only one marble), we need to add back 1. Therefore, there are $23+23-1 = \\boxed{45}$ possible values of $m$.",
