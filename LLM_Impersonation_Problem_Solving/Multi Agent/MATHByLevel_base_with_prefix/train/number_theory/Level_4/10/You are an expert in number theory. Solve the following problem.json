    "solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert $AAA_4$ into base 10 and then find a base $b$ such that it is equal to 33 in that base. \n\n$AAA_4 = A \\cdot 4^2 + A \\cdot 4 + A = 16A + 4A + A = 21A$\n\nSince $AAA_4$ can be expressed as $33_b$, we can represent $33_b$ as $3 \\cdot b^1 + 3 \\cdot b^0 = 3b + 3$\n\nTherefore, we have $21A = 3b + 3$\n\nSolving for $A$, we get $A = \\frac{3b+3}{21} = \\frac{b+1}{7}$\n\nSince $A$ is a digit in base 4, it must be less than 4. Therefore, we have $\\frac{b+1}{7} < 4$ which implies $b+1 < 28$ which further implies $b < 27$\n\nThe smallest base $b$ satisfying this constraint is $b=6$.
