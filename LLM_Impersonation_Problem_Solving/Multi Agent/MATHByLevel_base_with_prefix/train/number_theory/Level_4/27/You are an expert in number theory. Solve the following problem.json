    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24,a+4) \\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24-(a+5)(a+4),a+4)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24-(a^2+9a+20),a+4)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(4,a+4).\n\\end{align*} Since $4$ is a factor of $a$ and thus $a+4$, the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{4}$.",
