The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA particular fortune cookie lists four two-digit positive integers as your lucky numbers.The first three are 57, 13, and 72, but you got sauce on the last one and can't read it.If the sum of the digits of all four numbers equals $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, what is the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number?\nIt seems that the numbers provided in the problem are not included in the list of lucky numbers. Let's look at the original three lucky numbers given: 57, 13, and 72. \n\nIf we sum up these three numbers: 57 + 13 + 72 = 142. Now let's find the mean of these numbers by dividing the sum by 3: 142 / 3 = 47.33.\n\nSince the mean of the original three lucky numbers is 47.33, and the mean of the new four numbers is 63.75, there seems to be an inconsistency. \n\nIt might be worth looking into the difference between the sums and means of the original and new numbers to try and find a pattern or relationship that could reveal the missing lucky number.",
    "solution": "The sum of the first three numbers is $57+13+72=142$. If we let $10a+b$ represent the last number, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively, then the sum of the four numbers is $142+10a+b$. The sum of the digits of the first three numbers is $5+7+1+3+7+2=25$, so the total sum of the digits is $25+a+b$. If we multiply the sum of the digits by 5, we should get the sum of the four numbers. \\begin{align*}\n142+10a+b&=5(25+a+b)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=125+5a+5b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n17+5a&=4b\n\\end{align*} We notice that if we add a multiple of 5 to 17, the ones digit will either be 2 or 7. The next multiple of 4 that is greater than 17 and ends with a 2 or 7 is 32. That means $b=8$, while $17+5a=32$, so $5a=15$ and $a=3$. So the last number is $\\boxed{38}$.",
