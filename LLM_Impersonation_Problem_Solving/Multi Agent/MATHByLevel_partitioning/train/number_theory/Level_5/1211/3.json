    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation.When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation.When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied.How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?\n$r \\times c = (8 \\times 8) - 2$\n\n$c \\times 8 = 62$\n\nNow, let's use the information that when the band members are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied to form a similar equation. We have $9 \\times c = (9 \\times 8) - 3 = 69$.\n\nNext, we will substitute the value of $c=69$ into the equation $c \\times 8 = 62$ to find the total number of band members.",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "$c \\times 8 = 62$\n\n$69 \\times 8 = 552$\n\nTherefore, the total number of band members is 552.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 150?: $c \\times 8 = 62$\n\n$69 \\times 8 = 552$\n\nTherefore, the total number of band members is 552.",
