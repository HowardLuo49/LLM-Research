    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nDefine a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes.How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\nIn order to find a factorial tail, we need to find the number of factors of 5 in $m!$ since each factor of 5 and 2 will create a zero at the end of the number when multiplied together. Let's start by counting the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $m!$.",
    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "From the equation $m! = 1992(5k)$, we can determine that the highest possible value for $k$ is $398$ since $1992 \\times 5 = 9960$ which is greater than $m = 5$. \nNext, we find the number of terms less than $m = 398$ that are divisible by $5$, which is $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{398}{5} \\right \\rfloor = 79$. \nSince the question is asking for integers less than $1992$ which are not factorial tails, we need to subtract this value from $1991$ (inclusive). \nTherefore, the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails is $1991 - 79 = \\boxed{1912}$.",
