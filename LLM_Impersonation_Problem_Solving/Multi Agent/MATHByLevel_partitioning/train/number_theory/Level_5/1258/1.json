You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSquare each integer $n$ in the range $1\\le n\\le 10$ and find the remainders when the squares are divided by $11$.Add up all the distinct results and call it $m$.\nGiven the range $1\\le n\\le 10$, we need to square each integer and find the remainder when divided by $11$. Let's calculate this:\n1. $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n2. $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$\n3. $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$\n4. $4^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$\n5. $5^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\n6. $6^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\n7. $7^2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$\n8. $8^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$\n9. $9^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$\n10. $10^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n\nNow, based on the calculated remainders, we notice some interesting patterns. Let's try to formulate a general statement or rule for the next person to determine the pattern.",
    "solution": "First notice that $(11-n)^2=11^2-2\\cdot 11+n^2\\equiv n^2\\pmod{11}$, and since we're asked to find distinct results, we only need to compute the squares of $n=1,2,3,4,5$. Respectively, $n^2\\equiv 1,4,9,5,3\\pmod{11}$. Thus, $1+4+9+5+3=22=11\\cdot\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Looking at the remainders obtained when squaring the numbers $1$ to $10$ and dividing by $11$, we notice that the remainders are repeating - specifically, $1, 4, 9, 5, 3$, which then repeat again. This suggests a pattern in the remainders. Let's verify this pattern by squaring the remaining numbers exceeding $10$ to see if the pattern holds. For example, calculate $11^2$, $12^2$, and so on, and determine if the remainders follow the established pattern.",
