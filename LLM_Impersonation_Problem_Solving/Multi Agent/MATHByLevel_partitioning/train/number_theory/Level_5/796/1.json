    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $N$ be the largest integer whose square has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9.What is $N$, expressed in base 9?\nGiven that $N$ has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9, we know that $9^2 \\leq N < 10^2$, since $9^2$ has $3$ digits and $10^2$ has $4$ digits in base 9. This means $81 \\leq N < 100$.\n\nTo find the largest integer $N$ such that $N^2$ has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9, we can start by finding the largest integer whose square is less than $1000$ in base 9 and then converting it back to base 10. \n\nLet's take the highest possible value for $N$ in base 9, which is $99_9$. Converting this back to base 10, we get $N = 9 \\cdot 9 + 9 = 90 + 9 = 99$. Thus, $N = 99$.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer $N$ whose square has exactly $3$ digits when written in base 9 is $99$.",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
