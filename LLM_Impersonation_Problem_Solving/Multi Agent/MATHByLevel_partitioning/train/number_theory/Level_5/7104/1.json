The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nHow many nonnegative integers can be written in the form\\[a_7\\cdot3^7+a_6\\cdot3^6+a_5\\cdot3^5+a_4\\cdot3^4+a_3\\cdot3^3+a_2\\cdot3^2+a_1\\cdot3^1+a_0\\cdot3^0,\\]where $a_i\\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ for $0\\le i \\le 7$?$\\textbf{(A) } 512 \\qquad  \\textbf{(B) } 729 \\qquad  \\textbf{(C) } 1094 \\qquad  \\textbf{(D) } 3281 \\qquad  \\textbf{(E) } 59,048$\nLet's first consider how many possible values each $a_i$ can take: $a_7$ can be $-1, 0, 1$ which gives us 3 choices, $a_6$ can be $-1, 0, 1$ which gives us 3 choices, and similarly, all the way to $a_0$. This means that there are $3^8 = 6561$ total combinations of the $a_i$'s.",
    "solution": "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The restriction given is that each $a_i$ can be $-1, 0,$ or $1.$ Since there are $8$ $a_i$'s, there are $3$ choices for each, leading to $\\boxed{6561}$ total combinations.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 3281?: The restriction given is that each $a_i$ can be $-1, 0,$ or $1.$ Since there are $8$ $a_i$'s, there are $3$ choices for each, leading to $\\boxed{6561}$ total combinations.",
