You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nGiven that $8^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}$, find $64^{-1} \\pmod{97}$, as a residue modulo 97.\n",
    "solution": "Since $8^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}$, $64^{-1} \\equiv (8^2)^{-1} \\equiv (8^{-1})^2 \\equiv 85^2 \\equiv \\boxed{47} \\pmod{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find $64^{-1} \\pmod{97}$, we can use the fact that if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, then $a^{-1} \\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod{m}$. So, if $8^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}$, then we can find $64^{-1} \\pmod{97}$ by squaring $85 \\pmod{97}$.\nLet's calculate $85^2 \\pmod{97}$. $85^2 = 7225$, and $7225 \\equiv 42 \\pmod{97}$. So, $64^{-1} \\equiv 42 \\pmod{97}$.",
