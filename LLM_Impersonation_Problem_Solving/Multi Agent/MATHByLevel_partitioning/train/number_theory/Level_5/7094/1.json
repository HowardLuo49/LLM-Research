The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $\\tau (n)$ denote the number of positive integer divisors of $n$ (including $1$ and $n$).Find the sum of the six least positive integers $n$ that are solutions to $\\tau (n) + \\tau (n+1) = 7$.\nPrevious work/message:\nLet's define $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are the prime factors of $n$ and $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_k$ are their respective exponents.\nThe formula for $\\tau(n)$ can be expressed as $\\tau(n) = (e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_k+1)$.\n\nPlan:\n1. Since the problem requires us to calculate $\\tau(n)$, we will need to find the prime factorization of $n$.\n2. Let's start by factoring the given number $n$ into its prime factors and their respective exponents $p_1, e_1, p_2, e_2, ..., p_k, e_k$.\n3. Once the prime factorization is obtained, we can use the formula $\\tau(n) = (e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_k+1)$ to calculate the number of positive integer divisors of $n$.",
    "solution": "In order to obtain a sum of $7$, we must have:\neither a number with $5$ divisors (a fourth power of a prime) and a number with $2$ divisors (a prime), or\na number with $4$ divisors (a semiprime or a cube of a prime) and a number with $3$ divisors (a square of a prime). (No integer greater than $1$ can have fewer than $2$ divisors.)\nSince both of these cases contain a number with an odd number of divisors, that number must be an even power of a prime. These can come in the form of a square-like $3^2$ with $3$ divisors, or a fourth power like $2^4$ with $5$ divisors. We then find the smallest such values by hand.\n$2^2$ has two possibilities: $3$ and $4$ or $4$ and $5$. Neither works.\n$3^2$ has two possibilities: $8$ and $9$ or $9$ and $10$. $(8,9)$ and $(9,10)$ both work.\n$2^4$ has two possibilities: $15$ and $16$ or $16$ and $17$. Only $(16,17)$ works.\n$5^2$ has two possibilities: $24$ and $25$ or $25$ and $26$. Only $(25,26)$ works.\n$7^2$ has two possibilities: $48$ and $49$ or $49$ and $50$. Neither works.\n$3^4$ has two possibilities: $80$ and $81$ or $81$ and $82$. Neither works.\n$11^2$ has two possibilities: $120$ and $121$ or $121$ and $122$. Only $(121,122)$ works.\n$13^2$ has two possibilities: $168$ and $169$ or $169$ and $170$. Neither works.\n$17^2$ has two possibilities: $288$ and $289$ or $289$ and $290$. Neither works.\n$19^2$ has two possibilities: $360$ and $361$ or $361$ and $362$. Only $(361,362)$ works.\nHaving computed the working possibilities, we take the sum of the corresponding values of $n$: $8+9+16+25+121+361 = \\boxed{540}$.",

Next, we can consider the numbers $n$ and $n+1$ to find their prime factorizations and calculate their respective number of positive integer divisors using the formula $\\tau(n) = (e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_k+1)$.\n5.
