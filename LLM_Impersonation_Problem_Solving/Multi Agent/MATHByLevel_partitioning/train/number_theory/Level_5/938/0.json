    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe Lucas numbers $L_n$ are given by the recursion $L_0 = 2, L_1 = 1$, and $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$.\n",
    "solution": "First, we need to find $L_{10}$. We find that \\begin{align*}L_2 &= L_1 + L_0 = 3,\\\\ L_3 &= L_2 + L_1 = 4,\\\\ L_4 &= 7,\\\\ L_5 &= 11,\\\\ L_6 &= 18,\\\\ L_7 &= 29,\\\\ L_8 &= 47,\\\\ L_9 &= 76,\\\\ L_{10} &= 123\\end{align*}Thus, $L_{L_{10}} = L_{123}$. To find its units digit, we continue listing more values in the sequence until we reach a pattern: the units digit of $L_{11}$ is that of $123 + 76$, and so is $9$; that of $L_{12}$ is $2$; and that of $L_{13}$ is $1$. Hence, the units digit repeats starting from here, with a period of $12$. As $123 = 12 \\times 10 + 3$, then the units digit of $L_{123}$ is the same as that of $L_3$, or $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the Lucas numbers $L_n$, the first few terms are $2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, ...$.\n\nTo find an explicit formula for the Lucas numbers, we can consider the characteristic equation of the recursion $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$.\n\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 = r + 1$, which simplifies to $r^2 - r - 1 = 0$.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots of the characteristic equation to be $r = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\n\nThus, the explicit formula for the Lucas numbers is $L_n = a\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n + b\\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n$ for constants $a$ and $b$.",
