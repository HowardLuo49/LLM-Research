The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$.Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$.(Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$.The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).\nThe pair $(A, B)$ values to consider are $(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5), (5, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (3, 5), (5, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4)$. Calculate $C$ values for each pair to see if any of them satisfy the given equations.",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",

This implies $12 + C = 6$ in base 10, so $C = 6 - 12 = -6$, which is not a valid digit.\n\nFor $(2,1)$, we have $21_6 + C_6 = C0_6$.
