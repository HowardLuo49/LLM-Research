    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits less than $6$, and suppose we have ${AB_6}+{C_6}={C}0_6$ and ${AB_6}+{BA_6}={CC_6}$.\n",
    "solution": "Dealing with the second condition, it is set up in the following manner. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&&C_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&0_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Because $B+C$ can not equal $0$, we must carry in this column. Therefore, we arrive at two equations. $B+C-6=0$ and $A+1=C$ Looking at the third condition: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &&A&B_6\\\\ &+&B&A_6\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &&C&C_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$We can determine that no carrying occurs. Therefore, $A+B=C$. We now have a system of equations for our three variables. \\[B+C-6=0\\]\\[A+1=C\\]\\[A+B=C\\]Subtracting the third equation from the second, $1-B=0$, or $B=1$. Plugging that into our first equation we can determine that $C=5$. $A$ must then equal $4$. Thus, $\\overline{ABC}$ is $\\boxed{415}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the information provided, let's first convert the numbers from base $6$ to base $10$ to make it easier to work with. \n\nConverting ${AB_6}$ to base $10$, we get $6A+B$.\n\nConverting ${C_6}$ to base $10$, we get $C$.\n\nConverting ${BA_6}$ to base $10$, we get $6B+A$.\n\nConverting ${CC_6}$ to base $10$, we get $C \\cdot 6 + C = 6C + C = 7C$.\n\nSo the equations become $6A + B + C = 6C$, and $6A + B + 6B + A = 7C$.",
