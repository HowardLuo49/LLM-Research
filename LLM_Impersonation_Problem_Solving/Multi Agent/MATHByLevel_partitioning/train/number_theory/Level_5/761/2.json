The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $m$ be the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$.Find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $4!$.(Here $n!$ denotes $1\\times\\cdots\\times n$ for each positive integer $n$.)\nThe product of these numbers is $ \\text{lcm}(1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23) =  \\text{lcm}(1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23) = 78145 $. \n\nThus, we need to find the remainder when $78145$ is divided by $24$.",
