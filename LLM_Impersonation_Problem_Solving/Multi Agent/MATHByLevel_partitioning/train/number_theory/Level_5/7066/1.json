The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $P$ be the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers.Find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k .$\nGiven that $P$ is the product of the first 100 positive odd integers, we can express it as $P = 1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\ldots \\times 199$. \n\nTo approach this problem, one strategy could be to break down $P$ into prime factors to simplify the calculation. Let's start by factoring out the powers of 2 in the product of the first 100 positive odd integers. \n\nThe part of the product corresponding to the powers of 2 can be expressed as $2^{50} \\times Q$, where $Q$ is the product of the remaining odd integers. \n\nTo calculate the remaining product $Q$, we can utilize properties of exponents and prime factorization to simplify the problem further. \n\nNow, let's work on evaluating $Q$ by factoring out the remaining prime factors and considering their powers in the product. \n\nAfter calculating the prime factorization of the remaining odd integers and simplifying the product, we can obtain the value of $P$.",
