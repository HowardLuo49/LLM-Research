    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe numbers in the sequence $101$, $104$, $109$, $116$,$\\ldots$ are of the form $a_n=100+n^2$, where $n=1,2,3,\\ldots$ For each $n$, let $d_n$ be the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$.\n",
    "solution": "If $(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, then we have $d_n=(a_n,a_{n+1})=(100+n^2,100+n^2+2n+1)$. Now assuming that $d_n$ divides $100+n^2$, it must divide $2n+1$ if it is going to divide the entire expression $100+n^2+2n+1$.\nThus the equation turns into $d_n=(100+n^2,2n+1)$. Now note that since $2n+1$ is odd for integral $n$, we can multiply the left integer, $100+n^2$, by a power of two without affecting the greatest common divisor. Since the $n^2$ term is quite restrictive, let's multiply by $4$ so that we can get a $(2n+1)^2$ in there.\nSo $d_n=(4n^2+400,2n+1)=((2n+1)^2-4n+399,2n+1)=(-4n+399,2n+1)$. It simplified the way we wanted it to! Now using similar techniques we can write $d_n=(-2(2n+1)+401,2n+1)=(401,2n+1)$. Thus $d_n$ must divide $\\boxed{401}$ for every single $n$. This means the largest possible value for $d_n$ is $401$, and we see that it can be achieved when $n = 200$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the form of the numbers in the sequence, we have $a_n = 100 + n^2$. Let's calculate the first few values of $d_n$ to look for a pattern. \n\nFor $n=1$, $a_1 = 100 + 1^2 = 101$ and $a_2 = 100 + 2^2 = 104$. Calculating the greatest common divisor of 101 and 104, we have $d_1 = \\text{gcd}(101, 104) = 1$.\n\nFor $n=2$, $a_2 = 100 + 2^2 = 104$ and $a_3 = 100 + 3^2 = 109$. Calculating the greatest common divisor of 104 and 109, we have $d_2 = \\text{gcd}(104, 109) = 1$. \n\nLet's continue this pattern and observe if there is a relationship between $d_n$ and $n$ that we can use to find a general formula for $d_n$.",
