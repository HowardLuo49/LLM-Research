    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nNatural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers.In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime.(The conjecture was later shown to be false.)What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?\nTo find the next Fermat number, we can calculate $F_5$ using the formula $F_{n+1} = 2^{2^{n+1}} + 1$.\n$F_5 = 2^{2^5} + 1 = 2^{32} + 1$. We need to calculate $2^{32}$.\n$2^{32} = (2^{16})^2 = 65536^2 = 4294967296$.\nTherefore, $F_5 = 4294967296 + 1 = 4294967297$.  The next Fermat number is $4294967297$.",
    "solution": "Let's first try to find the cycle of units digits of $2^n$, starting with $n=1$: $2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $2^n$ is 4 digits long: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of $2^n$, for any positive integer $n$, we simply need to find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 2, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 4, etc.) Since $2^{1000}\\div4=2^{998}$ without remainder, the units digit of $2^{2^{1000}}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $F_n=2^{2^{1000}}+1$ is $6+1=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The units digit of $F_{1000}$ can be found by looking for patterns in the units digits of the first few Fermat numbers. Using modular arithmetic, we can determine that the units digit of $F_5$ is 7. \nSince the units digit of $2^{32}$ is 6, the units digit of $F_5$ is $6+1 = 7$. \nSince the pattern in units digits of Fermat numbers repeats every four terms, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is the same as the units digit of $F_{4}$. \nTherefore, the units digit of $F_{1000}$ is 7.",
