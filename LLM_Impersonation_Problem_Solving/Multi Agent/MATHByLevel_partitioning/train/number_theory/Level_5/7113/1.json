    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be a subset of $\\{1,2,3,...,50\\}$ such that no pair of distinct elements in $S$ has a sum divisible by $7$.What is the maximum number of elements in $S$?\nLet's start by identifying the pairs of numbers whose sum is divisible by 7.\nPairs with a sum divisible by 7:\n(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (7, 0), (8, 49), (9, 48), (10, 47), (11, 46), (12, 45), (13, 44), (14, 43), (15, 42), (16, 41), (17, 40), (18, 39), (19, 38), (20, 37), (21, 36), (22, 35), (23, 34), (24, 33), (25, 32), (26, 31), (27, 30)\nSo the pairs to avoid are: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (7, 0)",
    "solution": "The fact that $x \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\Rightarrow 7 \\mid x$ is assumed as common knowledge in this answer.\nFirst, note that there are $8$ possible numbers that are equivalent to $1 \\mod 7$, and there are $7$ possible numbers equivalent to each of $2$-$6 \\mod 7$.\nSecond, note that there can be no pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a \\equiv -b$ mod $7$, because then $a+b | 7$. These pairs are $(0,0)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,4)$. Because $(0,0)$ is a pair, there can always be $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, and no more.\nTo maximize the amount of numbers in S, we will use $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, $8$ numbers equivalent to $1$, and $14$ numbers equivalent to $2$-$5$. This is obvious if you think for a moment. Therefore the answer is $1+8+14=\\boxed{23}$ numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's focus on one half of this process: from 1 to 7. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and since 7 is the sum that starts the second half, we won't encounter it in the pairs to avoid in the first half calculation. The pairs in the first half that we need to avoid are (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4). Let's think about how to strategically select numbers from 1 to 7 based on this information. Additionally, consider how the rest of the numbers up to 50 play into this strategy.",
