The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA subset of the integers $1,2,\\cdots,100$ has the property that none of its members is 3 times another.What is the largest number of members such a subset can have?$\\text{(A) } 50\\quad \\text{(B) } 66\\quad \\text{(C) } 67\\quad \\text{(D) } 76\\quad \\text{(E) } 78$\nIn order to maximize the number of elements in the subset, we should include as many numbers as possible that are not multiples of 3.\n\nWe can also include numbers that are multiples of 3, as long as they are not 3 times another number in the subset.\n\nLet's explore the possibilities for constructing the subset further to see if we can maximize the number of elements in it.",
    "solution": "Notice that inclusion of the integers from $34$ to $100$ is allowed as long as no integer between $11$ and $33$ inclusive is within the set. This provides a total of $100 - 34 + 1$ = 67 solutions.\nFurther analyzation of the remaining integers between $1$ and $10$, we notice that we can include all the numbers except $3$ (as including $3$ would force us to remove both $9$ and $1$) to obtain the maximum number of $9$ solutions.\nThus, $67 + 9 = \\boxed{76}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize the number of elements in the subset, we should include all numbers that are not multiples of 3, which is 67 numbers. Additionally, we can include one more number for each pair of numbers where one is 3 times the other. This gives us a maximum of 67 + 11 = \\boxed{78} elements in the subset.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 76?: To maximize the number of elements in the subset, we should include all numbers that are not multiples of 3, which is 67 numbers.
