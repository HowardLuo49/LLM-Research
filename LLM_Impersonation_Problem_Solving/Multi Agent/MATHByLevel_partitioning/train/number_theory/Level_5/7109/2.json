The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor some positive integer $n$, the number $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, including $1$ and the number $110n^3$.How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?$\\textbf{(A) }110\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }191\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }261\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }325\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }425$\nExpanding the equation gives $(2)(2)(2)(4) = 32$ as the total number of factors of $110n^3$.\nSince we have an error in the number of factors we calculated for $110n^3$, we need to correct that mistake.\nWe can do this by finding the prime factorization of $110n^3$ again to determine the correct number of factors.\nLet's recount the factors of $110n^3$ by prime factorizing $110n^3$ correctly and plugging it back into the formula for the number of factors to ensure accuracy.",
    "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.",
