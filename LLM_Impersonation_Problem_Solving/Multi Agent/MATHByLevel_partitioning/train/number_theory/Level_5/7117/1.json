    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nYou are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$.Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence.\nThe product of prime numbers less than or equal to $61$ can be calculated using $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 19 \\times 23 \\times 29 \\times 31 \\times 37 \\times 41 \\times 43 \\times 47 \\times 53 \\times 59 = 2305567963945518424753102147331756070$.\n\nThe given sequence has $58$ terms, each in the form $P+n$, where $n$ ranges from $2$ to $59$.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to calculate the smallest positive integers that have no common divisibility with any of the terms in the sequence.",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "One approach to finding the smallest positive integers that have no common divisibility with any of the terms in the sequence is to consider the primes that appear in $P$. Since the product of all primes less than or equal to $61$ is known to us, the next step could be to go through the terms in the sequence $P+n$ and identify which primes appear in each term. This analysis will help in determining the prime factors that need to be avoided in the smallest positive integer.",
