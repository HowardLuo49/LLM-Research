    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number.This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained.What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\nLet's consider the possible values of a, b, c, d, and e for the five-digit number. Since a = 1, the number takes the form 1bcd0e. We need to find the pairs (ab, cde) such that ab * cde = 9 * (ab * cde). One approach could be to start with a = 1, list all possible values of b, c, d, and e, and then find the pairs that satisfy the condition. Another approach could be to start with the five-digit number range and work backward to find the pairs that satisfy the condition. Let's try one of these approaches and continue from there.",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$.",
