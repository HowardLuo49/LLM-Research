    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nOne of Euler's conjectures was disproved in the 1960s by three American mathematicians when they showed there was a positive integer such that $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^{5}$.\n",
    "solution": "Note that $n$ is even, since the $LHS$ consists of two odd and two even numbers. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know ${n^{5}}$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5. Hence,\n$3 + 0 + 4 + 2 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\n$4 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\nContinuing, we examine the equation modulo 3,\n$1 - 1 + 0 + 0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\n$0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\nThus, $n$ is divisible by three and leaves a remainder of four when divided by 5. It's obvious that $n>133$, so the only possibilities are $n = 144$ or $n \\geq 174$. It quickly becomes apparent that 174 is much too large, so $n$ must be $\\boxed{144}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the sum of the fifth powers of the given numbers: $133^5 + 110^5 + 84^5 + 27^5$. Let's denote this sum as $S$.\nCalculating $133^5$: $133^5 = 3486784401$\nCalculating $110^5$: $110^5 = 1610510000$\nCalculating $84^5$: $84^5 = 482680900$\nCalculating $27^5$: $27^5 = 14348907$\nAdding these values together to get $S = 3486784401 + 1610510000 + 482680900 + 14348907 = 5157150208$.",
