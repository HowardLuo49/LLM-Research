The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAn eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer.For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form.What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?\nWe can further express $n$ as $1001000a + 1000b + 100c + d$.",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer, let the four-digit integer be $abcd$. Thus, the eight-digit integer can be represented as $1000abcd + abcd = 1001abcd$.\n\nFrom the above expression, we can see that the eight-digit integer is divisible by 1001. The greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form will be the greatest common divisor of 1001 and any four-digit integer $abcd$.\n\nWe can factorize $1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$. Since $abcd$ can be any four-digit integer, the greatest common divisor of 1001 and $abcd$ will be $7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = \\boxed{1001}$.",
