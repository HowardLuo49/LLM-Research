    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor each positive integer $n$, let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the digits of $n$.For how many values of $n$ is $n+S(n)+S(S(n))=2007$?\nFrom the information given, we know that $S(100) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$ and $S(2019) = 2 + 0 + 1 + 9 = 12$.\n\nTo make some progress, let's try to find some patterns by calculating $S(n)$ for a few more values of $n$.\n\nLet's calculate $S(1)$, $S(2)$, $S(3)$, $S(4)$, $S(5)$, $S(6)$, $S(7)$, $S(8)$, $S(9)$, and see if we can notice any patterns or relationships between the sums of the digits of these numbers.\n\nOnce we have calculated the sum of digits for these single-digit numbers, we can look for any patterns or relationships that can help us derive a general formula or rule for $S(n)$.",
    "solution": "If $n\\leq 2007$, then $S(n)\\leq S(1999)=28$. If $n\\leq\n28$, then $S(n)\\leq S(28)=10$. Therefore if $n$ satisfies the required condition it must also satisfy \\[\nn\\geq 2007-28-10=1969.\n\\] In addition, $n,S(n),\\text{ and }S(S(n))$ all leave the same remainder when divided by 9. Because 2007 is a multiple of 9, it follows that $n,S(n),\\text{ and }S(S(n))$ must all be multiples of 3. The required condition is satisfied by $\\boxed{4}$ multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007, namely 1977, 1980, 1983, and 2001.\n\nNote: There appear to be many cases to check, that is, all the multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007. However, for $1987\\leq n\\leq 1999$, we have $n+S(n)\\geq 1990+19=2009$, so these numbers are eliminated. Thus we need only check 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 2001, and 2004.",
