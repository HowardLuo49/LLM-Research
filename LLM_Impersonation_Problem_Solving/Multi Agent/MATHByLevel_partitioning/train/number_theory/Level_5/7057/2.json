    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions.If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over.The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over.\nSince each side of the square formation has 8 members, there are 8! ways to arrange the members of each side. \nTherefore, the total number of possible formations for the marching band with 40 members in a square formation with 8 members on each side is (8!)^4. \n\nYour task is to calculate (8!)^4 to find the total number of possible formations for the marching band. If that number does not equal 40!, then there may be a mistake in the calculations.",
    "solution": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.",

Now, we need to compare this with 40! to see if there was a mistake in the calculations. Let's calculate 40!.",
