The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor $k > 0$, let $I_k = 10\\ldots 064$, where there are $k$ zeros between the $1$ and the $6$.Let $N(k)$ be the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$.What is the maximum value of $N(k)$?$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 9\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 10$\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of $N(k)$, which is the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$.\n\nFrom the previous steps, we know that to maximize $N(k)$, $k$ must be an even number.\n\nNext, we will express $N(k)$ in terms of $k$, and find a pattern that will help us determine the maximum value of $N(k)$ for even $k$. \n\nLet's write down the prime factorization of $I_k = 10\\ldots 064$ using the number of zeros in $k$, and express it in terms of $2$.\n\nThen, we will determine the maximum value of $N(k)$ by looking at the powers of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$ for even $k$.",
    "solution": "The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.\nFor $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \\left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \\right)$. The first value in the parentheses is odd, the second one is even, hence their sum is odd and we have $N(k)=k+2\\leq 5$.\nFor $k>4$ we have $I_k=2^6 \\left( 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k-4} + 1 \\right)$. For $k>4$ the value in the parentheses is odd, hence $N(k)=6$.\nThis leaves the case $k=4$. We have $I_4 = 2^6 \\left( 5^6 + 1 \\right)$. The value $5^6 + 1$ is obviously even. And as $5\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and therefore $5^6 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \\boxed{7}$.",

This means that the prime factorization of $I_k$ has $k+2$ factors of $2$.\n\nSince $k$ must be even to maximize $N(k)$, the maximum value of $N(k)$ occurs when $k = 10$, where $N(k) = 10+2 = 12$.
