    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the odd integers $1,3,5,\\ldots,99$ in increasing order.Each row below the first has one fewer entry than the row above it, and the bottom row has a single entry.Each entry in any row after the top row equals the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the row immediately above it.How many entries in the array are multiples of $67$?\nSince we know the first term $a_1 = 1$ and the last term $a_n = 99$, and the common difference $d = 2$ since the array consists of odd numbers, we can plug these values into the formula $n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1$ to find the total number of terms.\n$n = \\frac{99 - 1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{98}{2} + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50$\nTherefore, there are a total of 50 terms in the triangular array.",
    "solution": "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$.",
