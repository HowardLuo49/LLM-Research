You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$.What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?\nLet's start by finding $11^4$.\n$11^4 = (10 + 1)^4=10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1 = 14641$.\nThe sum of the digits of 14641 is 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16.\nHence, the statement that the sum of the digits of $11^4$ is $16=2^4$ is true.\nPlan: Explore other powers of 11 to see if there is a pattern regarding the sum of their digits.",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's find $11^1$, $11^2$, $11^3$, and $11^5$.\n$11^1 = 11$.\n$11^2 = 121$.\n$11^3 = 1331$.\n$11^5 = 161051$.\nThere doesn't seem to be a clear pattern based only on these few calculated powers of 11. Let's try a few more powers to see if there's a more obvious pattern.",
