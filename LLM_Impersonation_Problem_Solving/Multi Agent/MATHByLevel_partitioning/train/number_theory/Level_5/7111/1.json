    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe number $2017$ is prime.Let $S = \\sum \\limits_{k=0}^{62} \\dbinom{2014}{k}$.\n1. Verify if the number 2017 is actually prime by checking if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - Calculate the square root of 2017 to see if there are any divisors smaller than or equal to the square root.\n   - Check divisibility by numbers 2 and odd numbers up to the square root of 2017.\n\n2. If the number 2017 is confirmed to be prime, consider its properties and relationships with other numbers.\n   - Look for patterns in prime numbers around 2017.\n   - Investigate the factors of 2017 - 1 and 2017 + 1.\n  \n3. Calculate the sum of the digits of 2017.\n   - Add the individual digits of 2017 together to get the sum.\n  \n4. Calculate the prime factorization of 2017.\n   - Express 2017 as a product of prime numbers.\n  \n5. Evaluate the last two digits of 2017 to find if there is a recognizable pattern.\n   - Find a relationship between the last two digits of powers of 3 and the last two digits of 2017 to look for patterns.",
    "solution": "Note that $2014\\equiv -3 \\mod2017$. We have for $k\\ge1$\\[\\dbinom{2014}{k}\\equiv \\frac{(-3)(-4)(-5)....(-2-k)}{k!}\\mod 2017\\]\\[\\equiv (-1)^k\\dbinom{k+2}{k} \\mod 2017\\]\\[\\equiv (-1)^k\\dbinom{k+2}{2} \\mod 2017\\]Therefore\\[\\sum \\limits_{k=0}^{62} \\dbinom{2014}{k}\\equiv \\sum \\limits_{k=0}^{62}(-1)^k\\dbinom{k+2}{2} \\mod 2017\\]This is simply an alternating series of triangular numbers that goes like this: $1-3+6-10+15-21....$ After finding the first few sums of the series, it becomes apparent that\\[\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^k\\dbinom{k+2}{2}\\equiv -\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2} \\right) \\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}+1 \\right) \\mod 2017 \\textnormal{  if n is odd}\\]and\\[\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^k\\dbinom{k+2}{2}\\equiv \\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1 \\right)^2 \\mod 2017 \\textnormal{  if n is even}\\]Obviously, $62$ falls in the second category, so our desired value is\\[\\left(\\frac{62}{2}+1 \\right)^2 = 32^2 = \\boxed{1024}\\]",
