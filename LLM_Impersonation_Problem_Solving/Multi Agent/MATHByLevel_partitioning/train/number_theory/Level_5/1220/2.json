    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $a_n$ be the integer obtained by writing all the integers from $1$ to $n$ from left to right.For example, $a_3 = 123$ and $a_{11} = 1234567891011$.Compute the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $45$.\n1. Calculate the sum of all integers from $1$ to $2022$ using the formula: $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ where $n = 2022$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 2022$.\n   Sum = $\\frac{2022}{2} (1 + 2022)$.\n\n2. Compute the sum.\n   Sum = $\\frac{2022}{2} (1 + 2022) = 1011 \\times 2023$.\n\n3. Find the remainder when the sum is divided by $11$ to determine $a_{2022} \\mod 11$.\n   $a_{2022} \\mod 11 = (1011 \\times 2023) \\mod 11$.",
    "solution": "We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows: We will compute the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$. The remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 will be the residue (mod 45) which leaves the same remainders when divided by 5 and 9 as $a_{44}$ does. Since $a_{44}$ ends in $4$, it gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.\n\nFor the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 9, note that  \\begin{align*}\na_{44}&=44+43\\cdot 10^2 + 42 \\cdot 10^4+41\\cdot 10^6+\\cdots+10\\cdot10^{68}\\\\\n&\\qquad+9\\cdot 10^{70}+8\\cdot 10^{71}+\\cdots + 1\\cdot 10^{78} \\\\ &\\equiv 44+43+42+\\cdots+1\\pmod{9},\n\\end{align*}since $10^n\\equiv 1^n\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. In words, this calculation shows that we can sum groups of digits in any way we choose to check for divisibility by 9. For example, 1233 is divisible by 9 since $12+33=45$ is divisible by 9. This is a generalization of the rule that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Getting back to the problem at hand, we sum $44+43+\\cdots+1$ using the formula $1+2+\\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$ to find that $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.\n\nWe are looking for a multiple of $9$ that gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$. Nine satisfies this condition, so the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 is $\\boxed{9}$.",
