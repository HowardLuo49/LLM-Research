    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x, y <m$.To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence.For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.The graph of $$3x\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}$$has a single $x$-intercept $(x_0,0)$ and a single $y$-intercept $(0,y_0)$, where $0\\le x_0,y_0<35$.\nThe first step is to examine the case when $p=2$. Since we know that $p^2=4$, each modulo $m=2^r$ graph paper will have $4$ points in total. Let's compute the number of points in the set $x+y \\equiv k \\pmod{4}$ for all possible values of $k$ when $p=2$.",
    "solution": "To find the $x$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $y$ and solve $$3x\\equiv 4(0)-1 \\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $12$, we get $$36x \\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$$and thus $x\\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$. Translating this to the interval $0\\le x<35$, we have $x\\equiv 23\\pmod{35}$, so the $x$-intercept on our graph is at $(23,0)$.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $x$ and solve $$3(0)\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}.$$We can rewrite this as $$1\\equiv 4y\\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $9$, we get $$9\\equiv 36y\\pmod{35},$$and thus $y\\equiv 9\\pmod{35}$. So the $y$-intercept is at $(0,9)$.\n\nWe have $x_0+y_0 = 23+9 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate this, we need to consider all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ modulo 4. Since $m=2^r=4$, we have four possible residues for each $x$ and $y$, namely 0, 1, 2, and 3.\nThen we calculate the sum $x+y$ modulo 4 for each pair of residues. This creates all possible congruences of the form $x+y\\equiv k \\pmod 4$.\nThe next step is to list out all these congruences explicitly. By analyzing the list, we can start looking for patterns in the number of points that satisfy each congruence.",
