    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEach of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is $25.$ One marble is taken out of each box randomly.The probability that both marbles are black is $27/50,$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\nLet's say the number of black marbles in the first box is $x$ and the number of white marbles is $25-x$.\nSimilarly, let's say the number of black marbles in the second box is $y$ and the number of white marbles is $25-y$.",
    "solution": "If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.\nLet $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$. Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$. It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.\nCase 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second. Then, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.\nCase 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both. Thus, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{1}{25}$. $m + n = 26$.\nThus, $m + n = \\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The probability that both marbles are black when one marble is taken from each box is $\\frac{x}{25} \\cdot \\frac{y}{25}$.\nSo, we have $\\frac{x}{25} \\cdot \\frac{y}{25} = \\frac{27}{50}$.\nThis means $xy = \\frac{27}{2}$.\n\nThe probability that both marbles are white when one marble is taken from each box is $\\frac{25-x}{25} \\cdot \\frac{25-y}{25}$.\nWe want to express this in terms of $m$ and $n$ in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$. \nIn order to solve for this, we can first determine the value of $x$ and $y, then use the equation obtained above to solve for the requested probability in terms of $m$ and $n$.",
