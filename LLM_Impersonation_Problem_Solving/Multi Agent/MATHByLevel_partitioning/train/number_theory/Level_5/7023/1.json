    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $S$ be the set of all rational numbers $r$, $0<r<1$, that have a repeating decimal expansion in the form $0.abcabcabc\\ldots=0.\\overline{abc}$, where the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ are not necessarily distinct.To write the elements of $S$ as fractions in lowest terms, how many different numerators are required?\nWork left by the previous person: Let $x = 0.\\overline{abc}$, then we have $1000x = abc.\\overline{abc}$ and $1000x - x = abc.\\overline{abc} - 0.\\overline{abc} = abc$, so $999x = abc$, which means $x = \\frac{abc}{999}$.\n\nTo find all the rational numbers in $S$, we need to find all $a, b, c$ such that $0 < \\frac{abc}{999} < 1$ and $\\frac{abc}{999}$ is in lowest terms.",
    "solution": "We consider the method in which repeating decimals are normally converted to fractions with an example:\n$x=0.\\overline{176}$\n$\\Rightarrow 1000x=176.\\overline{176}$\n$\\Rightarrow 999x=1000x-x=176$\n$\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{176}{999}$\nThus, let $x=0.\\overline{abc}$\n$\\Rightarrow 1000x=abc.\\overline{abc}$\n$\\Rightarrow 999x=1000x-x=abc$\n$\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{abc}{999}$\nIf $abc$ is not divisible by $3$ or $37$, then this is in lowest terms. Let us consider the other multiples: $333$ multiples of $3$, $27$ of $37$, and $9$ of $3$ and $37$, so $999-333-27+9 = 648$, which is the amount that are neither. The $12$ numbers that are multiples of $81$ reduce to multiples of $3$. We have to count these since it will reduce to a multiple of $3$ which we have removed from $999$, but, this cannot be removed since the numerator cannot cancel the $3$.There aren't any numbers which are multiples of $37^2$, so we can't get numerators which are multiples of $37$. Therefore $648 + 12 = \\boxed{660}$.",
