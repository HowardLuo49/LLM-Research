The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $N=123456789101112\\dots4344$ be the $79$-digit number that is formed by writing the integers from $1$ to $44$ in order, one after the other.What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $45$?$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 9\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 18\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 44$\nTo calculate the sum of the digits of $N$, we can find the sum of the digits from $1$ to $9$, $10$ to $19$, up to $40$ to $44$.\n- The sum of digits from $1$ to $9$: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45$.\n- The sum of digits from $10$ to $19$: $1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 9 = 55$.\n- Continue this process for the other ranges of digits.",

To calculate the number $\\bmod\\ 9$, note that\n\\[123456\\cdots 4344 \\equiv 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+(1+0)+(1+1)+\\cdots+(4+3)+(4+4) \\equiv 1+2+\\cdots+44 \\bmod\\ 9,\\]\nso it is equivalent to\n\\[\\frac{44\\cdot 45}{2} = 22\\cdot 45 \\equiv 0\\bmod\\ 9.\\]\nLet $x$ be the remainder when this number is divided by $45$. We know that $x\\equiv 0 \\pmod {9}$ and $x\\equiv 4 \\pmod {5}$, so by the Chinese remainder theorem, since $9(-1)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, $x\\equiv 5(0)+9(-1)(4) \\pmod {5\\cdot 9}$, or $x\\equiv -36 \\equiv \\boxed{9} \\pmod {45}$.",
