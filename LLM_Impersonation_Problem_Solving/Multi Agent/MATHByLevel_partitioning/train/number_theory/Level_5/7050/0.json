    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe digits of a positive integer $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right.\n",
    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that the digits of $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order, we can express $n$ using the form $10A + 10(B - 1) + 10(C - 2) + 10(D - 3)$, where $A, B, C, D$ are the four consecutive integers.\n\nLet's denote the sum of the digits of $n$ as $S$, which is equal to $A + B + C + D$. \n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, we know that $A$ is not equal to zero.\n\nWe also know that $n$ is divisible by the sum of its digits $S$, so we have $n = kS$, for some integer $k$. \n\nBased on this information, the next person can derive equations to solve for the possible values of $n$.",
