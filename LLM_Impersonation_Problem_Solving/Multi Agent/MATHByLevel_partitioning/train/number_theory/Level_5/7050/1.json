The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe digits of a positive integer $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right.What is the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$?\nGiven that the digits of $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order, we can express $n$ using the form $10A + 10(B - 1) + 10(C - 2) + 10(D - 3)$, where $A, B, C, D$ are the four consecutive integers.\n\nLet's denote the sum of the digits of $n$ as $S$, which is equal to $A + B + C + D$. \n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, we know that $A$ is not equal to zero.\n\nWe also know that $n$ is divisible by the sum of its digits $S$, so we have $n = kS$, for some integer $k$. \n\nBased on this information, the next person can derive equations to solve for the possible values of $n$.",
    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",

Since $S = A + B + C + D$, and $A, B, C, D$ are consecutive integers, we have $S = A + (A+1) + (A+2) + (A+3) = 4A + 6$.\n\nWe also know that $n = 10A + 10(B - 1) + 10(C - 2) + 10(D - 3) = 10A + 10A + 10 + 10A + 20 + 10A + 30 = 40A + 60 = 40(A + 1.5)$.\n\nSince $n = kS$, we have $40(A + 1.5) = k(4A + 6)$, which simplifies to $10(A + 1.5) = k(A + 1.5)$.\n\nTherefore, possible values of $k$ are multiples of 10, and the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by 37 are the remainders obtained by dividing the possible values of $n$ by 37.",
