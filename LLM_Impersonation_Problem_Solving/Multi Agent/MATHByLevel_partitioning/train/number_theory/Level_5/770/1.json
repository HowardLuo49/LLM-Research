The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen the least common multiple of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor, the result is 33.If one integer is 45, what is the smallest possible value of the other integer?\nGiven that the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers is 33 times their greatest common divisor (GCD), we can express the relationship between the two integers as:\n\nLCM(x, y) = 33 * GCD(x, y)\n\nLet's assume the two integers are x and y. We can express LCM(x,y) and GCD(x,y) in terms of x and y using their prime factorizations. Let's denote the prime factorization of x as p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... and the prime factorization of y as p1^b1 * p2^b2 * ..., where pi are prime factors and ai, bi are their respective powers.",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the other integer, so \\[\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n]}{\\gcd(45,n)} = 33.\\]We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, so \\[\\gcd(45,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n] = 45n.\\]Dividing this equation by the previous equation, we get \\[[\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = \\frac{45n}{33} = \\frac{15n}{11},\\]so $11 [\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = 15n$.\n\nSince 11 divides the left-hand side, 11 also divides the right-hand side, which means $n$ is divisible by 11.  Also, 15 divides the right-hand side, so 15 divides the left-hand side, which means $\\gcd(45,n)$ is divisible by 15.  Since $45 = 3 \\cdot 15$, $n$ is divisible by 15.  Hence, $n$ must be divisible by $11 \\cdot 15 = 165$.\n\nNote that $\\gcd(45,165) = 15$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,165] = 495$, and $495/15 = 33$, so $n=165$ is achievable and the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{165}$.",
