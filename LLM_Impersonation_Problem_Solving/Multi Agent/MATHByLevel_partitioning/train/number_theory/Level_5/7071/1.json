    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nEd and Sue bike at equal and constant rates.Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates.\nLet the speed of Ed be denoted as $E$ and the speed of Sue be denoted as $S$. \n\nSince they bike at equal and constant rates, we have $E = S$. \n\nLet the total distance they bike be denoted as $D$. \n\nLet the time it takes for Ed to bike the entire distance be denoted as $T_E$ and the time it takes for Sue to bike the entire distance be denoted as $T_S$. \n\nWe know that $D = E \\cdot T_E = S \\cdot T_S$. \n\nTherefore, we can write the equation $D = E \\cdot T_E = S \\cdot T_S$ as $D = E \\cdot \\frac{D}{E} = S \\cdot \\frac{D}{S}$. \n\nSince $E = S$, we have $D = D = D$, which doesn't give us any new information.",
    "solution": "Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.\nWe have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$. Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$. Mod 4, we need $s\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To make progress on this problem, we can introduce the speed at which they jog and swim. Let the jogging speeds of Ed and Sue be denoted as $J_E$ and $J_S$ respectively, and the swimming speeds as $W_E$ and $W_S$. \n\nSince they jog at equal and constant rates, we have $J_E = J_S$. \n\nSimilarly, since they swim at equal and constant rates, we have $W_E = W_S$. \n\nLet the distances they jog and swim be denoted as $D_j$ and $D_s$ respectively. \n\nThe time it takes for Ed to jog the entire distance is $T_{J_E}$ and for Sue it's $T_{J_S}$, and similarly for swimming. \n\nWe have $D = (J_E \\cdot T_{J_E}) + (W_E \\cdot T_{W_E})$. \n\nSubstitute in the given information and use the fact that $E = S$ to derive new equations.",
