    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1.\n",
    "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since the sequence consists of positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1, we can first list out the positive multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, ...\n\nNext, we can identify the multiples of 3 that contain the digit 1: 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, ...\n\nWe can observe that the pattern follows after each multiple of 90, with a \"1\" in the tens place. Let's check the answer once we reach the end of the problem statement.",
