The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nKaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9.What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27?Express your answer as a common fraction.\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of the numbers deemed possible clever integers: 27, 45, 63, and 81.\nPrime factorization of 27: $27 = 3^3$\nPrime factorization of 45: $45 = 3^2 \\times 5$\nPrime factorization of 63: $63 = 3^2 \\times 7$\nPrime factorization of 81: $81 = 3^4$",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Out of the possible clever integers, only 27 and 81 are divisible by 27. \nSo the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response \\frac{2?: Out of the possible clever integers, only 27 and 81 are divisible by 27. \nSo the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
