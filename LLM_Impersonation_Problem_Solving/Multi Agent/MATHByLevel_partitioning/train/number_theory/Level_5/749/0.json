You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x<m$.\n",
    "solution": "We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $y\\equiv 5x+2$ and $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. Thus, the $x$-coordinates in all such pairs satisfy $$5x+2 \\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}.$$Subtracting $5x+2$ from both sides of this congruence, we have $$0 \\equiv 6x+10\\pmod{16},$$which is equivalent to $$0 \\equiv 6x-6\\pmod{16}$$(since $10\\equiv -6\\pmod{16}$).\n\nThus the solutions we seek are values $x$ in the range $0\\le x<16$ such that $16$ divides $6(x-1)$. The solutions are $x=1,$ $x=9,$ so the sum of $x$-coordinates is $1+9=\\boxed{10}$.\n\n(As a check, note that the pairs $(1,7)$ and $(9,15)$ satisfy both of the original congruences, so these are the points shared by the two graphs.)",
