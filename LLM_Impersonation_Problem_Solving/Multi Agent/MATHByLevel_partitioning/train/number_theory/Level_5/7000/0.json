You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $a_n=6^{n}+8^{n}$.\n",
    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
