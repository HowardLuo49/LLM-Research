    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor a positive integer $p$, define the positive integer $n$ to be $p$-safe if $n$ differs in absolute value by more than $2$ from all multiples of $p$.For example, the set of $10$-safe numbers is $\\{ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, \\ldots\\}$.Find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ which are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe.\nSince $n$ is $p$-safe, we know that $|n-kp| > 2$ for all integers $k$. So, for $n = 0$, this means $|-kp| > 2$ for all integers $k$, which is equivalent to $kp < -2$ or $kp > 2$.",
    "solution": "We see that a number $n$ is $p$-safe if and only if the residue of $n \\mod p$ is greater than $2$ and less than $p-2$; thus, there are $p-5$ residues $\\mod p$ that a $p$-safe number can have. Therefore, a number $n$ satisfying the conditions of the problem can have $2$ different residues $\\mod 7$, $6$ different residues $\\mod 11$, and $8$ different residues $\\mod 13$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for a number $x$ that is $a$ (mod b) $c$ (mod d) $e$ (mod f) has one solution if $gcd(b,d,f)=1$. For example, in our case, the number $n$ can be: 3 (mod 7) 3 (mod 11) 7 (mod 13) so since $gcd(7,11,13)$=1, there is 1 solution for n for this case of residues of $n$.\nThis means that by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $n$ can have $2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = 96$ different residues mod $7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 1001$. Thus, there are $960$ values of $n$ satisfying the conditions in the range $0 \\le n < 10010$. However, we must now remove any values greater than $10000$ that satisfy the conditions. By checking residues, we easily see that the only such values are $10006$ and $10007$, so there remain $\\boxed{958}$ values satisfying the conditions of the problem.",
    "gpt_response": "The inequality $kp < -2$ can be rewritten as $k < -\\frac{2}{p}$ and $kp > 2$ can be rewritten as $k > \\frac{2}{p}$.

Therefore, the number of integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe is equal to the number of integers that of the form $7k = 11k = 13k$ for $-\\frac{2}{13} < k < \\frac{2}{13}$. \n\nThe greatest common divisor of $7$, $11$, and $13$ is $1$, so we are looking for the number of integers of the form $7 \\cdot 11 x = 13 y$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Since $7$ and $11$ are coprime to $13$, there exists an integer $z$ such that $77z \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. Multiplying both sides by $77$ gives $77^2 z \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.
