The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the greatest prime factor of $12!+ 14!$?(Reminder: If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n!$ stands for the product $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\cdots \\cdot (n-1)\\cdot n$.)\nNext, we can consider the expression $14!$. Since $14! = 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!$, we can factor out $12!$ from the expression to get $14! = 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!$. Substituting the prime factorization of $12!$ in, we have $14! = 14 \\times 13 \\times 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11$.",
    "solution": "Factor out $12!$ from both terms: $12!+14!=12!(1+13\\cdot 14)=12!\\cdot 183$.  Factor $183=3\\cdot 61$.  Since $12!$ has no prime factors greater than 11, $\\boxed{61}$ is the greatest prime factor of $12!+14!$.",
    "gpt_response": "Now we can add $12!$ and $14!$ to get $12!+14! = 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 + 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 14$. Factoring out the common factors, we get $12!+14! = 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times (1 + 14)$. Simplifying further, we get $12!+14! = 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 15 = 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 3 \\times 5$. The greatest prime factor of $12!+14!$ is $\\boxed{11}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 61?: Now we can add $12!$ and $14!$ to get $12!+14! = 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 + 2^{10} \\times 3^5 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 14$.
