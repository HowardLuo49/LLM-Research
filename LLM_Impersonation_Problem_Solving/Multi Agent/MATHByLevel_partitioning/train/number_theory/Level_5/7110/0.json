You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe zeroes of the function $f(x)=x^2-ax+2a$ are integers.\n",
    "solution": "By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.\nBecause the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$. Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields\\[(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.\\]Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and\\[((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.\\]Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \\dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \\dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$. Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$. These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the discriminant of the quadratic equation $f(x)=x^2-ax+2a$ by using the formula $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$.\nSince the discriminant has to be a perfect square to have integer roots, we can set it equal to $k^2$ where $k$ is an integer. So, $\\Delta = a^2 - 4\\cdot2a = a^2 - 8a$.\nSetting $a^2 - 8a = k^2$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^2 - 8a - k^2 = 0$.\nNow, we need to find integer solutions for $a$ and $k$.",
