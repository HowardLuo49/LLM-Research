    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe American Mathematics College is holding its orientation for incoming freshmen.The incoming freshman class contains fewer than $500$ people.When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $23$, $22$ people are in the last column.\nSince we are dealing with a positive integer \\(n\\), we can start by looking at its divisibility properties. Let's check if \\(n\\) is divisible by any specific numbers or if it is a prime number.\nLet's attempt to find the prime factorization of \\(n\\) to see if there are any interesting patterns that emerge which could help us in solving the problem.\nOne way to represent a positive integer is as a sum of consecutive numbers, so maybe we can explore \\(n\\) in that regard and see if there are any relationships we can exploit.\nTo better understand \\(n\\), let's compare it to multiples of \\(n\\) and other related numbers like its factors, multiples, and powers to see if there are any significant observations.\nLastly, we should explore any relevant number theory theorems or principles that may apply to the properties of \\(n\\) in order to make progress with the problem.",
    "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's calculate the remainder when \\( n \\) is divided by 23 and 22 to see if that gives us any information about the value of \\( n \\).\nWe know that when the freshmen line up in columns of 23, 22 people are in the last column. This means that the number of people must be 1 less than a multiple of 23.\nLet's denote the number of freshmen as \\( n \\). By the information provided, we have the congruences \\( n \\equiv 22 \\pmod{23} \\) and \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{22} \\).\nNow, we can combine these congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a unique solution for \\( n \\) modulo some number.",
