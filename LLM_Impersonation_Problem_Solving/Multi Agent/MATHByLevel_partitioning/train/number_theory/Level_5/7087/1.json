    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe positive integers $N$ and $N^2$ both end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$, where digit a is not zero.Find the three-digit number $abc$.\nGiven that $N$ ends in the sequence of four digits $abcd$, we can express $N$ as $10000k + abcd$ for some positive integer $k$. \nNext, we know that $N^2$ will end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$. \nExpanding $(10000k + abcd)^2 = 100000000k^2 + 200000k \\cdot abcd + abcd \\cdot abcd$, \nwe can simplify it to $10000(10000k^2 + 2k \\cdot abcd) + abcd \\cdot abcd$. \n\nNow, we can observe that the last four digits of $N^2$, which is $abcd$, must be equal to $abcd \\cdot abcd$ in mod $10000$. \n\nThe plan for the next person is to determine the possible values of $abcd$ such that $abcd \\cdot abcd \\equiv abcd \\pmod{10000}$ and then find the corresponding values of $N$.",
    "solution": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.",

Therefore, $abcd = 9999$, which implies $N = 10000k + 9999$. \nHowever, since $N$ is a four-digit number, $10000k + 9999$ must be greater than or equal to 1000. \nThis leads to $k \\geq 1$.\n\nAs a result, the only possible three-digit number $abc$ is $\\boxed{999}$.",
