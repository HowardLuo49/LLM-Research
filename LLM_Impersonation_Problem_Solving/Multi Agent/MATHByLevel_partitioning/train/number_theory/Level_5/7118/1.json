The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $m$ and $n$ be any two odd numbers, with $n$ less than $m$.The largest integer which divides all possible numbers of the form $m^2-n^2$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 16$\nFirst, let's find the product of $m$ and $n$. Next, calculate the difference between the square of $m$ and the square of $n$. Finally, find the greatest common divisor of the two values calculated in the previous steps. This should lead to an interesting result.",
    "solution": "First, factor the difference of squares.\\[(m+n)(m-n)\\]Since $m$ and $n$ are odd numbers, let $m=2a+1$ and $n=2b+1$, where $a$ and $b$ can be any integer.\\[(2a+2b+2)(2a-2b)\\]Factor the resulting expression.\\[4(a+b+1)(a-b)\\]If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a-b$ is even. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a-b$ is even as well. If $a$ is odd and $b$ is even (or vise versa), then $a+b+1$ is even. Therefore, in all cases, $8$ can be divided into all numbers with the form $m^2-n^2$.\nThis can be confirmed by setting $m=3$ and $n=1$, making $m^2-n^2=9-1=8$. Since $8$ is not a multiple of $3$ and is less than $16$, we can confirm that the answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The product of $m$ and $n$ is $mn$. \nThe difference between the square of $m$ and the square of $n$ is $m^2-n^2=(m+n)(m-n)$. \nThe greatest common divisor of $mn$ and $(m+n)(m-n)$ is $\\boxed{2}$. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2$.",
