    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe decimal representation of $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n,$ contains the digits $2, 5$, and $1$ consecutively, and in that order.\n",
    "solution": "To find the smallest value of $n$, we consider when the first three digits after the decimal point are $0.251\\ldots$.\nOtherwise, suppose the number is in the form of $\\frac{m}{n} = 0.X251 \\ldots$, where $X$ is a string of $k$ digits and $n$ is small as possible. Then $10^k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} - X = \\frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = 0.251 \\ldots$. Since $10^k m - nX$ is an integer and $\\frac{10^k m - nX}{n}$ is a fraction between $0$ and $1$, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $q \\le n$. Then the fraction $\\frac pq = 0.251 \\ldots$ suffices.\nThus we have $\\frac{m}{n} = 0.251\\ldots$, or\n$\\frac{251}{1000} \\le \\frac{m}{n} < \\frac{252}{1000} \\Longleftrightarrow 251n \\le 1000m < 252n \\Longleftrightarrow n \\le 250(4m-n) < 2n.$\nAs $4m > n$, we know that the minimum value of $4m - n$ is $1$; hence we need $250 < 2n \\Longrightarrow 125 < n$. Since $4m - n = 1$, we need $n + 1$ to be divisible by $4$, and this first occurs when $n = \\boxed{127}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the conditions of the problem, we know that the decimal representation of the fraction will be of the form $\\frac{a25}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $a < b.$ To start off, let's set up the inequality $10a < b \\leq 10a + 9$ to generate possible values for $b$ in terms of $a$. \n\nNext, calculate all possible values for $b$ using the inequality $10a < b \\leq 10a + 9$ for different values of $a$ to determine valid denominators.\n\nOnce you have a list of possible values for $b$ in terms of $a$, check which of these values satisfy the condition that $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1. \n\nAfter determining the set of valid denominators, for each valid $b$, calculate the corresponding numerator $m$ by finding the first occurrence of $251$ in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{a25}{b}$. \n\nCheck if the numerator $m$ and denominator $b$ are relatively prime. If they are, then we have found a solution; if not, move on to the next valid $b$ and repeat the process.\n\nIf you are unable to make any progress or encounter any issues, please state them clearly for the next person to work on.",
