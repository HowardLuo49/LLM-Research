    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe solution of $8x+1\\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}$ is $x\\equiv a\\pmod{m}$ for some positive integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a<m$.Find $a+m$.\nGiven the equation $8x+1\\equiv 5\\pmod{12}$, we first simplify the equation by subtracting 1 from both sides to get $8x\\equiv 4\\pmod{12}$. \n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4 to get $2x\\equiv 1\\pmod{3}$. \n\nThis simplifies further to $x\\equiv 2^{-1}\\pmod{3}$. \n\nWe can find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3 by checking which number when multiplied by 2 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. \n\nThus, the next step would be to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3.",
    "solution": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$.",
    "gpt_response": "The modular inverse of 2 modulo 3 is 2 itself because $2*2\\equiv 4\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. \n\nTherefore, $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. \n\nSince $2<3$, $a=2$ and $m=3$.\n\nTherefore, $a+m=2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
