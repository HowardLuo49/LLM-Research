    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTom's graduating class has 288 students.At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row.If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row.\nNext, we need to determine how many different ways we can distribute these 288 students into an equal number of students in each row.",
    "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many students can be in each row, we need to find the factors of 288.\nThe prime factorization of 288 is $2^5 \\times 3^2$. \nThis means the total number of factors of 288 is $(5+1)(2+1) = 18$.\nNow, we need to find the factors of 288 that are greater than or equal to 15, as this is the minimum number of students in each row.",
