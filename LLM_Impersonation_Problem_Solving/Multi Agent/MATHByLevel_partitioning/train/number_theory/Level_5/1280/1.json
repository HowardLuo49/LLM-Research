The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $n$ is a positive integer such that in base $7$, then $n$ can be expressed as $\\overline{ABC}_7$, and in base $11$, then $n$ can be expressed as $\\overline{CBA}_{11}$.Find the largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$.\nLet's first convert the base $7$ and base $11$ representations of $n$ to base $10$ to make it easier to work with. \nIn base $7$, $n = A \\cdot 7^2 + B \\cdot 7^1 + C \\cdot 7^0$.\nIn base $10$, $n = 49A + 7B + C$.\nIn base $11$, $n = C \\cdot 11^2 + B \\cdot 11^1 + A \\cdot 11^0$.\nIn base $10$, $n = 121C + 11B + A$.\nNow, we can set $121C + 11B + A = 49A + 7B + C$ and solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n$121C + 11B + A = 49A + 7B + C$\n$120C = 48A + 4B$\n$30C = 12A + B$",
    "solution": "We convert $n$ to base $10$. The base $7$ expression implies that $n = 49A + 7B + C$, and the base $11$ expression implies that $n = 121C + 11B + A$. Setting the two expressions equal to each other yields that $$n = 49A + 7B + C = 121C + 11B + A \\Longrightarrow 48A - 4B - 120C = 0.$$Isolating $B$, we get $$B = \\frac{48A - 120C}{4} = 12A - 30C = 6(2A - 5C).$$It follows that $B$ is divisible by $6$, and since $B$ is a base $7$ digit, then $B$ is either $0$ or $6$. If $B$ is equal to $0$, then $2A - 5C = 0 \\Longrightarrow 2A = 5C$, so $A$ must be divisible by $5$ and hence must be either $0$ or $5$. Since $n$ is a three-digit number in base $7$, then $A \\neq 0$, so $A = 5$ and $C = 2$. Thus, $n = 502_7 = 5 \\cdot 7^2 + 2 = 247$.\n\nIf $B$ is equal to $6$, then $2A - 5C = 1$, so $2A - 1 = 5C$ and $2A - 1$ must be divisible by 5. Since $A$ is a base $7$ digit, it follows that $A = 3$ and $C = 1$. This yields the value $n = 361_7 = 3 \\cdot 7^2 + 6 \\cdot 7 + 1 = 190$. The largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$ is $\\boxed{247}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$, we need to maximize the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ while ensuring they are valid digits in base $7$ and base $11$.\n\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all non-negative integers, we need to find integers $A$, $B$, and $C$ that satisfy the equation $120C = 48A + 4B$ and are valid digits in base $7$ and base $11$.\n\nWe can observe that $C$ must be in the range $0-6$ (inclusive) to be a valid digit in base $7$ and that $B$ must be in the range $0-10$ (inclusive) to be a valid digit in base $11$. Since $B$ must also be non-negative, $B$ can range from $0-6$ to ensure $30C = 12A + B$ is satisfied.\n\nBy trying different combinations of $A$, $B$, and $C$ within the valid ranges, we find that the largest possible value of $n$ in base 10 is when $A = 6$, $B = 6$, and $C = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $n$ in base 10 is $49(6) + 7(6) + 4 = \\boxed{343}$.",
