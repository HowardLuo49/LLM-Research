You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $n$ is a positive integer such that in base $7$, then $n$ can be expressed as $\\overline{ABC}_7$, and in base $11$, then $n$ can be expressed as $\\overline{CBA}_{11}$.\n",
    "solution": "We convert $n$ to base $10$. The base $7$ expression implies that $n = 49A + 7B + C$, and the base $11$ expression implies that $n = 121C + 11B + A$. Setting the two expressions equal to each other yields that $$n = 49A + 7B + C = 121C + 11B + A \\Longrightarrow 48A - 4B - 120C = 0.$$Isolating $B$, we get $$B = \\frac{48A - 120C}{4} = 12A - 30C = 6(2A - 5C).$$It follows that $B$ is divisible by $6$, and since $B$ is a base $7$ digit, then $B$ is either $0$ or $6$. If $B$ is equal to $0$, then $2A - 5C = 0 \\Longrightarrow 2A = 5C$, so $A$ must be divisible by $5$ and hence must be either $0$ or $5$. Since $n$ is a three-digit number in base $7$, then $A \\neq 0$, so $A = 5$ and $C = 2$. Thus, $n = 502_7 = 5 \\cdot 7^2 + 2 = 247$.\n\nIf $B$ is equal to $6$, then $2A - 5C = 1$, so $2A - 1 = 5C$ and $2A - 1$ must be divisible by 5. Since $A$ is a base $7$ digit, it follows that $A = 3$ and $C = 1$. This yields the value $n = 361_7 = 3 \\cdot 7^2 + 6 \\cdot 7 + 1 = 190$. The largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$ is $\\boxed{247}$.",
