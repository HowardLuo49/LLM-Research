You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind $2^{-1} \\pmod{185}$, as a residue modulo 185.\n",

    "gpt_response": "Let's start by finding the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185. \n\nWe want to find $x$ such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{185}$.\n\nTo do this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor and the coefficients of Bezout's identity. \n\nLet's apply the extended Euclidean algorithm to 2 and 185. \n\nStarting with 185 = 2*92 + 1, the remainder is 1 so the previous remainder, 1 is the GCD.\n\nGoing back through the calculations, we can determine the coefficients for 1 = 185 + (-92)2. This gives us 1 = 185 - 92*2. \n\nTherefore, the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185 is -92, or 93 in modulo 185.",
