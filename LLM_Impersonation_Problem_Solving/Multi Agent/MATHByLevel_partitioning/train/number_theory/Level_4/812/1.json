    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAdd $175_{9} + 714_{9} + 61_9$.Express your answer in base $9$.\nTo add $175_{9} + 714_{9} + 61_9$, we first need to convert each number to base 10. \n\n$175_{9} = 1*9^2 + 7*9^1 + 5*9^0 = 1*81 + 7*9 + 5*1 = 81 + 63 + 5 = 149$\n\n$714_{9} = 7*9^2 + 1*9^1 + 4*9^0 = 7*81 + 9 + 4*1 = 567 + 9 + 4 = 580$\n\n$61_{9} = 6*9^1 + 1*9^0 = 6*9 + 1 = 54 + 1 = 55$\n\nNow we add the numbers in base 10: $149 + 580 + 55 = 784$\n\nTherefore, $175_{9} + 714_{9} + 61_9 = 784$. \n\nNext step: Convert 784 back to base 9.",
    "solution": "When summing these three numbers, we notice that $5 + 4 + 1$ leaves a residue of $1$ when divided by $9$, so it follows that the sum has a rightmost digit of $1$ and that carry-over must occur. After carrying over to the next digit, we must find the sum of $1 + 7 + 1 + 6 = 16_9$, which leaves a residue of $6$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we write down $6$ as the next digit and carry-over another $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we must find the sum of $1+1+7 = 10_9$, which leaves a residue of $0$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we must carry-over one more time, yielding that: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{1} & \\stackrel{1}{7} & \\stackrel{}{5}_{9} \\\\ & & & 7 & 1 & 4_{9} \\\\ &+ & & & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} && 1 & 0 & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\end{array} $$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{1061_{9}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can notice that $175_9 + 714_9 = 1000_9$, so $1000_9 + 61_9 = 1061_9$.",
