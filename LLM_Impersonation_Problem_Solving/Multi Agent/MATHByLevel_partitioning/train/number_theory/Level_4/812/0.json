You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nAdd $175_{9} + 714_{9} + 61_9$.\n",
    "solution": "When summing these three numbers, we notice that $5 + 4 + 1$ leaves a residue of $1$ when divided by $9$, so it follows that the sum has a rightmost digit of $1$ and that carry-over must occur. After carrying over to the next digit, we must find the sum of $1 + 7 + 1 + 6 = 16_9$, which leaves a residue of $6$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we write down $6$ as the next digit and carry-over another $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we must find the sum of $1+1+7 = 10_9$, which leaves a residue of $0$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we must carry-over one more time, yielding that: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{1} & \\stackrel{1}{7} & \\stackrel{}{5}_{9} \\\\ & & & 7 & 1 & 4_{9} \\\\ &+ & & & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} && 1 & 0 & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\end{array} $$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{1061_{9}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can notice that $175_9 + 714_9 = 1000_9$, so $1000_9 + 61_9 = 1061_9$.",
    "gpt_response": "To add $175_{9} + 714_{9} + 61_9$, we first need to convert each number to base 10. \n\n$175_{9} = 1*9^2 + 7*9^1 + 5*9^0 = 1*81 + 7*9 + 5*1 = 81 + 63 + 5 = 149$\n\n$714_{9} = 7*9^2 + 1*9^1 + 4*9^0 = 7*81 + 9 + 4*1 = 567 + 9 + 4 = 580$\n\n$61_{9} = 6*9^1 + 1*9^0 = 6*9 + 1 = 54 + 1 = 55$\n\nNow we add the numbers in base 10: $149 + 580 + 55 = 784$\n\nTherefore, $175_{9} + 714_{9} + 61_9 = 784$. \n\nNext step: Convert 784 back to base 9.",
