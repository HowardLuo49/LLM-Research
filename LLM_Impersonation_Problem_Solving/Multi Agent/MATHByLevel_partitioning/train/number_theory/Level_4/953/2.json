The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $a_n = \\frac{10^n-1}{9}$.Define $d_n$ to be the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$.What is the maximum possible value that $d_n$ can take on?\nThe next few terms should be:\nFor $n=4$, $a_4 = \\frac{10^4-1}{9} = \\frac{9999}{9} = 1111$.\nFor $n=5$, $a_5 = \\frac{10^5-1}{9} = \\frac{99999}{9} = 11111$.",
