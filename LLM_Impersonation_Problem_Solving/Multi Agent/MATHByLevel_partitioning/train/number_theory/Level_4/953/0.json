You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $a_n = \\frac{10^n-1}{9}$.\n",
    "solution": "From the Euclidean Algorithm,\n\\[\n\\gcd(a_{n}, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1} - 10a_n).\n\\]We compute $a_{n+1} - 10a_n = \\frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9} - \\frac{10^{n+1}-10}{9} = 1$. Therefore, $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$ share no common factors and $d_n$ is always $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $a_n = \\frac{10^n-1}{9}$, we can start by finding the first few terms of the sequence. \nFor $n=1$, $a_1 = \\frac{10^1-1}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} = 1$.\nFor $n=2$, $a_2 = \\frac{10^2-1}{9} = \\frac{99}{9} = 11$.\nFor $n=3$, $a_3 = \\frac{10^3-1}{9} = \\frac{999}{9} = 111$. \nThe pattern seems to be that $a_n$ is equal to $1$ followed by $n$ ones.",
