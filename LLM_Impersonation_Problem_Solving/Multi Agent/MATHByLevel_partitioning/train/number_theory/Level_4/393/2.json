    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAn arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ has a common difference of $6$.A second sequence begins with $4$ and has a common difference of $7$.In the range of $1$ to $100$, what is the largest number common to both sequences?\nTo find the $10$th term of the second arithmetic sequence that begins with $4$ and has a common difference of $7$, we will use the formula: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting the values $a_1 = 4$, $n = 10$, and $d = 7$ into the formula, we get $10$th term of second sequence $= 4 + (10-1) \\cdot 7 = 4 + 63 = 67$. \n\nBased on the calculations above, we have now determined the $10$th term of the second arithmetic sequence, which is $67$. \n\nThe next person can proceed by calculating the difference between the $10$th terms of both arithmetic sequences and using that information to propose a question or problem for others to solve.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smallest common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\\\\na & \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} We see that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+6n$. Substituting this into $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$ yields \\[1+6n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $4$. Then $n\\ge 4\\implies a=1+6n\\ge 25$. We see that $25$ satisfies both congruences so $a=25$. If $b$ is any common term, subtracting $25$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-25 & \\equiv -24\\equiv 0\\pmod 6 \\\\\nb-25 & \\equiv -21\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(6,7)=1$, we have $b-25\\equiv 0\\pmod {6\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 25\\pmod{42}.$ So $b=25+42m$ for some integer $m$. The largest such number less than $100$ is $\\boxed{67}$, which happens to satisfies the original congruences.",
    "gpt_response": "The $10$th term of the first arithmetic sequence, with a first term of $1$ and common difference of $6$, can be found using the same formula: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $a_1 = 1$, $n = 10$, and $d = 6$, the $10$th term of the first sequence is $1 + 9 \\cdot 6 = 1 + 54 = 55$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the difference between the $10$th terms of both arithmetic sequences: $67 - 55 = 12$.\n\nTherefore, the largest number common to both sequences in the range of $1$ to $100$ is a number that is a multiple of this difference, as it must appear in both sequences.
