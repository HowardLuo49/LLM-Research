    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIn a certain base $b$, the square of $22_b$ is $514_b$.\n",
    "solution": "We have that $22_b = 2b + 2$ and $514_b = 5b^2 + b + 4$.  Hence, $(2b + 2)^2 = 5b^2 + b + 4$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 7b = 0$.  This equation factors as $b(b - 7) = 0$, so $b = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $22_b$ squared is equal to $514_b$, we can write this equation as $2b + 2 = 5b^2 + 1b + 4$. \n\nExpanding both sides, we get $4b^2 + 4b + 1 = 5b^2 + b + 4$. \n\nRearranging the terms, we have $b^2 - 3b - 3 = 0$. \n\nNext, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $b$: $b = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)}$.\n\nSolving for $b$, we find $b = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 12}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}$. \n\nThus, the values of $b$ that are possible for this base are $b = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}$.",
