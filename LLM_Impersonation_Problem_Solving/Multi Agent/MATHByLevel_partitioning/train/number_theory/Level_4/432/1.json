    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.How many three-digit perfect squares are palindromes?\nGiven that the number is a palindrome, we can represent it as an n-digit number in the form \"abcba\" where a, b, and c represent digits. \nSince the number is a palindrome, we can express it as 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10b + a = 10001a + 1010b + 100c\nThis can be simplified to 10001a + 1010b + 100c = 11(909a + 10b + 9c)\nThus, the palindrome number must be divisible by 11.",
    "solution": "The possible units digits of a perfect square are 0 ($0^2$), 1 ($1^2$, $9^2$), 4 ($2^2$, $8^2$), 9 ($3^2$, $7^2$), 6 ($4^2$, $6^2$), and 5 ($5^2$). Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0. The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ perfect squares that are palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the three-digit palindromic perfect squares that are divisible by 11, we can try the possible values of a, b, and c. Since the number is a perfect square, we know that a must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 to get a 3-digit number.\n\nFor each value of a, we can find possible values of b and c by checking if 11 divides 11(909a + 10b + 9c). We can start with a = 1:\n\nWhen a = 1, we have 11(909*1 + 10b + 9c) = 9999 + 110b + 99c\nSince the number must be a 3-digit number, b can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, and c can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.\n\nWe can continue this process for a = 2 to a = 9 and count the number of three-digit palindromic perfect squares that are divisible by 11.",
