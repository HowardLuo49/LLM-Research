    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nKarlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.For how many values of $m$ can this be done?\nTo find the number of ways to distribute 600 marbles into boxes where each box has an equal number of marbles, we need to find the number of factors of 600 as each factor represents the number of marble boxes. \n\nThe prime factorization of 600 is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$ \n\nTo calculate the number of factors of 600, we use the formula based on its prime factorization. \n\nLet the prime factorization of $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$. The number of factors of $n$ is given by $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1)$. \n\nSo, for 600, the number of factors would be $(3+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 24$. \n\nThis means there are 24 ways to distribute 600 marbles into boxes where each box has an equal number of marbles.",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
