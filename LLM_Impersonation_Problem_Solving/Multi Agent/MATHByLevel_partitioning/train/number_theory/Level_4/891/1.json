    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nKarlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.\nSince each box contains the same number of marbles, let $x$ be the number of marbles in each box.\n\nThus, $600 = mx.$\n\nSolving for $x$, we have $x = \\frac{600}{m}.$\n\nNext, since $x$ must be an integer (since we cannot have a fraction of a marble), this means that $m$ must be a factor of 600.\n\nTherefore, the problem at hand is to find the number of ways we can distribute 600 marbles into boxes such that each box has an equal number of marbles.",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ways to distribute 600 marbles into boxes where each box has an equal number of marbles, we need to find the number of factors of 600 as each factor represents the number of marble boxes. \n\nThe prime factorization of 600 is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$ \n\nTo calculate the number of factors of 600, we use the formula based on its prime factorization. \n\nLet the prime factorization of $n = p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$. The number of factors of $n$ is given by $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1)$. \n\nSo, for 600, the number of factors would be $(3+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 24$. \n\nThis means there are 24 ways to distribute 600 marbles into boxes where each box has an equal number of marbles.",
