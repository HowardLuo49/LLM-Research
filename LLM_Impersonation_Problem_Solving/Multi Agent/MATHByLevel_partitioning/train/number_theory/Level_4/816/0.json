You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nExpress $249_{11}+3AB_{12}$ as a base 10 integer.\n",
    "solution": "We have that \\begin{align*} 249_{11} &= 2(11^2)+ 4(11^1) +9(11^0) \\\\\n&= 2(121)+4(11)+9(1)\\\\\n&= 242 + 44 + 9\\\\\n&= 295\\\\\n3AB_{12} &= 3(12^2)+ 10(12^1) +11(12^0) \\\\\n&= 3(144)+10(12)+11(1)\\\\\n&= 432 + 120 + 11\\\\\n&= 563\n\\end{align*}So, $249_{11}+3AB_{12}=295+563=\\boxed{858}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $249_{11} = 2(11^2) + 4(11^1) + 9(11^0)$, we can calculate that $249_{11} = 2(121) + 4(11) + 9(1) = 242 + 44 + 9 = 295$.\n\nLet's convert $3AB_{12}$ to base 10. Since $A$ represents the number 10 in base 10, we have $3AB_{12} = 3(12^2) + 10(12^1) + B(12^0)$.\n\nSolving further, $3(12^2) + 10(12^1) + B(12^0) = 432 + 120 + B = 552 + B$.\n\nSo, the expression $249_{11}+3AB_{12} = 295 + 552 + B$.",
