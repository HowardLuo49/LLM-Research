There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe letters of the alphabet are given numeric values based on the two conditions below.$\\bullet$  Only the numeric values of $-2,$ $-1,$ $0,$ $1$ and $2$ are used.$\\bullet$  Starting with A and going through Z, a numeric value is assigned to each letter according to the following pattern: $$\n1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0,\\ldots\n$$\n\nTwo complete cycles of the pattern are shown above.The letter A has a value of $1,$ B has a value of $2,$ F has a value of $-2$ and Z has a value of $2.$ What is the sum of the numeric values of the letters in the word ``numeric''?\n| Letter | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| A      | 1     |\n| B      | 2     |\n| C      | 1     |\n| D      | 0     |\n| E      | -1    |\n| F      | -2    |\n| G      | -1    |\n| H      | 0     |\n| I      | 1     |\n| J      | 2     |\n| K      | 1     |\n| L      | 0     |\n| M      | -1    |\n| N      | -2    |\n| O      | -1    |\n| P      | 0     |\n| Q      | 1     |\n| R      | 2     |\n| S      | 1     |\n| T      | 0     |\n| U      | -1    |\n| V      | -2    |\n| W      | -1    |\n| X      | 0     |\n| Y      | 1     |\n| Z      | 2     |",
    "solution": "The cycle has length $8$. So the numeric value of a letter is determined by its position within the alphabet, modulo $8$. So we determine the positions of all the letters in the word and use them to find the values:\n\nn is the $14$th letter. $14\\pmod 8=6$, so its value is $-2$.\n\nu is the $21$st letter. $21\\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.\n\nm is the $13$th letter. $13\\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.\n\ne is the $5$th letter. $5\\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.\n\nr is the $18$th letter. $18\\pmod 8=2$, so its value is $2$.\n\ni is the $9$th letter. $9\\pmod 8=1$, so its value is $1$.\n\nc is the $3$rd letter. $3\\pmod 8=3$, so its value is $1$.\n\nThe sum is $(-2)+(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+2+1+1=\\boxed{-1}$.",
