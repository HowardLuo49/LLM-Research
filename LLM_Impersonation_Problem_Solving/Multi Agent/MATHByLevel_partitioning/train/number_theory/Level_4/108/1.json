The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind the product of $1011_2 \\cdot 101_2$.Express your answer in base 2.\nGiven $1011_2$ and $101_2$, we need to multiply them together.\n\nConverting both numbers to base 10:\n$1011_2 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 0 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11$\n\n$101_2 = 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5$\n\nTo multiply $11 \\cdot 5$ in base 10 to get the final product.",
    "solution": "We carry out the multiplication as we carry out multiplication in base $10$. Fortunately, we do not have to worry about carrying over, since we are only multiplying by digits of $0$ or $1$. Thus:  $$ \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1_2 \\\\\n& & & \\times & 1 & 0 & 1_2 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1_2 \\\\\n& & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0_2 \\\\\n+ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0_2 \\\\ \\cline{1-7}\n& 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1_2 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$When summing, we need to carry-over for the second digit from the left. Thus, the sum is equal to $\\boxed{110111}_2$.",
