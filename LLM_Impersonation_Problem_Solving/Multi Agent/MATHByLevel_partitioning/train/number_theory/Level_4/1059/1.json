The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor what base-6 digit $d$ is $2dd5_6$ divisible by the base 10 number 11?(Here $2dd5_6$ represents a base-6 number whose first digit is 2, whose last digit is 5, and whose middle two digits are both equal to $d$).\nTo determine if $2dd5_6$ is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11 which states that the alternating sum of the digits should be divisible by 11. \nSo we have $2 - d + d - 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ which simplifies to $-3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This is not true, so the previous calculation was incorrect. Let's reassess the divisibility of $2dd5_6$ by 11.",
    "solution": "We write $2dd5_6$ in base 10 to get $2dd5_6=2\\cdot 6^3+d\\cdot 6^2 +d\\cdot 6 + 5= 437 + 42d$. We can subtract $39\\cdot 11$ from this quantity without changing whether it is divisible by 11. This subtraction yields $437 + 42d-429 = 8 + 42d$. We can subtract $33d$ from this quantity, again not changing whether it is divisible by 11, leaving $8+9d$. Now we try the possible values $d=0,1,2,3,4,5$ for a base-6 digit, and we find that only $d=\\boxed{4}$ results in a number which is divisible by 11.",
