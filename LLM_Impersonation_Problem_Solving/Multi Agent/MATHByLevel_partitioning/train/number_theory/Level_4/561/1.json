The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe product of positive integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ equals 2004.What is the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$?\nThe first step is to prime factorize 2004: $2004 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 167$. \n\nNext, we can consider the possible values for $x$, $y$, and $z$ based on the prime factorization. \n\nSince the product of $x$, $y$, and $z$ is 2004, we know that they must all be factors of 2004. \n\nLet's continue by listing out all the factors of 2004 and see if we can form any triples that multiply to 2004.",
    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",
