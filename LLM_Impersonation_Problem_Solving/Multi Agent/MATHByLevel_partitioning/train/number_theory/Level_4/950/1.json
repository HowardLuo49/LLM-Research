The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe greatest common divisor of two integers is $(x+2)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+2)$, where $x$ is a positive integer.If one of the integers is 24, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?\nFrom the given information, we can write the two integers as $a = k(x+2)$ and $b = kx(x+2)$ where $k$ is an integer.\nNext, we can use the formula for the product of GCD and LCM of two numbers, which is $ab = \\text{GCD}(a,b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a,b)$, to solve for $k$ in terms of $x$.\nSetting $ab = (x+2) \\cdot x(x+2)$, we get $k(x+2) \\cdot kx(x+2) = (x+2) \\cdot x(x+2)$.\nSolving this equation will give us the relationship between $x$ and $k$.",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 2) \\cdot x(x + 2)}{24} = \\frac{x(x + 2)^2}{24}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, or 3, but when $x = 4$, this expression is $4 \\cdot 6^2/24 = 6$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 6 and 24 is 6, and $x + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$.  The least common multiple is 24, and $x(x + 2) = 4 \\cdot (4 + 2) = 24$, so $x = 4$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{6}$.",

The smallest possible value of the other integer is when $x = 24$, which gives us $k = 1$ and the other integer as $b = 24 \\times 24 \\times 1 = 576$.",
