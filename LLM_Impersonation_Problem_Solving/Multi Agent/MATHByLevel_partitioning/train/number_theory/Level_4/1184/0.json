You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe Lucas sequence is the sequence 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, $\\ldots$ where the first term is 1, the second term is 3 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms.\n",
    "solution": "We can look at the terms of the Lucas sequence modulo 8.   \\begin{align*}\nL_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_2 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_3 &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_4 &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_5 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_6 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_7 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_8 &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_9 &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{10} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{11} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{12} &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{13} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{14} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{15} &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{16} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}.\n\\end{align*}Since $L_{13}=1$ and $L_{14}=3$, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms.  Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $L_{100}\\equiv L_4\\pmod 8$.  Therefore the remainder when $L_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since we are dealing with the Lucas sequence, we know that the recursive formula for the sequence is $L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}$ where $L_1 = 1$ and $L_2 = 3$. \n\nTo find the next term in the Lucas sequence after 11, we can calculate $L_6$ by finding the sum of $L_5$ and $L_4$. \n\nWe have $L_4 = L_3 + L_2 = 7 + 3 = 10$ and $L_5 = L_4 + L_3 = 10 + 7 = 17$. \n\nTherefore, $L_6 = L_5 + L_4 = 17 + 10 = \\boxed{27}$.",
