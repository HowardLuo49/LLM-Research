    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe number $0.428125$ can be written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.When this fraction is in simplest terms, what is $a+b$?\nSince $0.428125 = 428125 \\times 10^{-6} = \\frac{428125}{1000000}$, we have $a = 428125$ and $b = 1000000$.\nFind the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ to simplify the fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$.",
    "solution": "We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Note that $428,\\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$. Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 3425}{125 \\cdot 8000}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3425}{8000}.\n\\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{3425}{8000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5^2\\cdot 137}{5^2\\cdot 320} \\\\\n&= \\frac{137}{320}.\n\\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The greatest common divisor of 428125 and 1000000 is 3125. To simplify the fraction $\\frac{428125}{1000000}$, divide both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor:\n$\\frac{428125}{1000000} = \\frac{428125 \\div 3125}{1000000 \\div 3125} = \\frac{137}{320}$.\n\nTherefore, the simplest form of $\\frac{a}{b}$ is $\\frac{137}{320}$, so $a=137$ and $b=320$. The sum $a+b$ is $137+320=\\boxed{457}$.",
