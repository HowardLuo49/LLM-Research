    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe integers 195 and 61 are expressed in base 4 and added.What is the resulting sum, expressed in base 4?\n1. Let's convert 195 and 61 to base 10 to make it easier to add them together. \n\nConverting 195 from base 4 to base 10:\n1*(4^2) + 9*(4^1) + 5*(4^0) = 16 + 36 + 5 = 57\n\nConverting 61 from base 4 to base 10:\n6*(4^1) + 1*(4^0) = 24 + 1 = 25\n\nAdding the two numbers together:\n57 + 25 = 82\n\n2. The sum of 195 and 61 in base 4 is equal to 82 in base 10.\n\n3. Now, let's convert the decimal number 82 back to base 4 to find the result in base 4. \n\nConverting 82 from base 10 to base 4:\n82 / 4 = 20 remainder 2\n20 / 4 = 5 remainder 0\n5 / 4 = 1 remainder 1\n1 / 4 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading the remainders backwards, we get the result in base 4: 1012\n\n4. The sum of 195 and 61 in base 4 is 1012.",
    "solution": "Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61.  Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\\boxed{10000}$.",
