    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe integers 195 and 61 are expressed in base 4 and added.\n",
    "solution": "Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61.  Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\\boxed{10000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "1. Let's convert 195 and 61 to base 10 to make it easier to add them together. \n\nConverting 195 from base 4 to base 10:\n1*(4^2) + 9*(4^1) + 5*(4^0) = 16 + 36 + 5 = 57\n\nConverting 61 from base 4 to base 10:\n6*(4^1) + 1*(4^0) = 24 + 1 = 25\n\nAdding the two numbers together:\n57 + 25 = 82\n\n2. The sum of 195 and 61 in base 4 is equal to 82 in base 10.\n\n3. Now, let's convert the decimal number 82 back to base 4 to find the result in base 4. \n\nConverting 82 from base 10 to base 4:\n82 / 4 = 20 remainder 2\n20 / 4 = 5 remainder 0\n5 / 4 = 1 remainder 1\n1 / 4 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading the remainders backwards, we get the result in base 4: 1012\n\n4. The sum of 195 and 61 in base 4 is 1012.",
