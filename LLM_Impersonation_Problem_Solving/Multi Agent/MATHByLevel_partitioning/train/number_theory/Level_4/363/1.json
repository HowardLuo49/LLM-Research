The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen $x$ is divided by each of $4$, $5$, and $6$, remainders of $3$, $4$, and $5$ (respectively) are obtained.What is the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$?\nGiven that $x$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$, $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. \n\nTherefore, we can express $x$ as $x = 4a + 3$ for some integer $a$. \n\nWhen $x$ is divided by $5$, a remainder of $4$ is obtained, so $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nSubstitute $x = 4a + 3$ into $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ to get $4a + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, so $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nTherefore, $a = 5b + 4$ for some integer $b$. \n\nSubstitute $a = 5b + 4$ into $x = 4a + 3$ to express $x$ in terms of $b$. \n\nThis gives $x = 4(5b + 4) + 3 = 20b + 19$.\n\nNow we can use the fact that when $x$ is divided by $6$, a remainder of $5$ is obtained.",
    "solution": "Note that $x+1$ is divisible by $4$, $5$, and $6$. Therefore, it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is $60$. Therefore, the smallest value for $x+1$ is $60$ and the smallest possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
    "gpt_response": "When $x$ is divided by $6$, we have $x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$. \n\nSubstitute $x = 20b + 19$ into $x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$ to get $20b + 19 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$. \n\nThis simplifies to $2b \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6}$, so $b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. \n\nTherefore, $b = 3c + 1$ for some integer $c$. \n\nSubstitute $b = 3c + 1$ into $x = 20b + 19$ to express $x$ in terms of $c$. \n\nThis gives $x = 20(3c + 1) + 19 = 60c + 39$. \n\nThus, the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$ is $60c + 39$. \n\nTo minimize this value, we set $c = 0$: \n\n$x = 60(0) + 39 = 39$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$ is $\\boxed{39}$.",
