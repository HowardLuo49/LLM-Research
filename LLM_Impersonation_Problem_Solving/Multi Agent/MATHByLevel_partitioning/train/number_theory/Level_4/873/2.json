    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTo express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$.The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$.If 1562 were expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?\nThe previous work appears to have a mistake. Starting with $2^3 = 8$ as the largest power less than 20 is correct, but then $20 - 8 = 12$, and from there we should use $2^3$ again rather than going to $2^2$. \n\nTo correct the mistake, we can start again with $2^4 = 16$, resulting in $20 - 16 = 4$. \n\nThen, use $2^2 = 4$, which gives us 0, so $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$ is one way to express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2.  \n\nNow, we need to find another way to express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Let's try a different approach: \n\nWe know that 20 can be represented as 10100 in binary. Let's use this binary representation to find the sum. \n\nStarting from left to right in the binary representation of 20, we see that we have 16 + 4 = 20. \n\nTherefore, another way to express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2 is $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. \n\nThere may be more ways to express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, so the next step is to try to find any additional combinations.",
    "solution": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 1562 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 1562 is $2^{10}=1024$.  The difference between 1024 and 1562 is $538$. The largest power of 2 less than 538 is $2^9=512$.  The difference between 538 and 512 is 26.  The largest power of 2 less than 26 is $2^4=16$, which leaves us with $26-16=10$. Continuing the process, we get $2^3=8$ and $2^1=2$. So, we have found that $1562=2^{10}+2^9+2^4+2^3+2^1$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{27}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $1562$ is a much larger number, it is not practical to use a brute force method to check all possible combinations. Instead, let's use a similar approach to the binary representation.\n\nThe binary representation of $1562$ is $11000010010$. Reading from left to right, this is equal to $2^{10} + 2^7 + 2^2 = 1024 + 128 + 4 = 1156$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the exponents of these powers is $10 + 7 + 2 = 19$. \n\nThus, the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers to express $1562$ as a sum of distinct powers of $2$ is $19$.",
