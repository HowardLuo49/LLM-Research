The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFind the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$.Express your answer in base 9.\nTo multiply $218_9$ by $5_9$, we first convert both numbers to base 10. \n\n$218_9 = 2 \\cdot 9^2 + 1 \\cdot 9^1 + 8 \\cdot 9^0 = 2 \\cdot 81 + 1 \\cdot 9 + 8 \\cdot 1 = 162 + 9 + 8 = 179$\n$5_9 = 5 \\cdot 9^0 = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5$\n\nNow we multiply $179$ by $5$ in base 10 to find the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$.",
    "solution": "We begin by multiplying the units digit: $8_9 \\times 5_9 = 40_{10} = 44_9$. So, we write down a $4$ and carry-over another $4$. Moving on to the next digit, we need to evaluate $1_9 \\times 5_9 + 4_9 = 9_{10} = 10_{9}$. Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and a $1$ is carried over. Finally, the leftmost digits are given by the operation $2_9 \\times 5_9 + 1_9 = 11_{10} = 12_9$. Writing this out, we have  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & \\stackrel{1}{2} & \\stackrel{4}{1} & \\stackrel{}{8}_9 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 5_9 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & 1 & 2 & 0 & 4_9 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$So our final answer is $\\boxed{1204_9}$.",
