You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$.\n",
    "solution": "We begin by multiplying the units digit: $8_9 \\times 5_9 = 40_{10} = 44_9$. So, we write down a $4$ and carry-over another $4$. Moving on to the next digit, we need to evaluate $1_9 \\times 5_9 + 4_9 = 9_{10} = 10_{9}$. Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and a $1$ is carried over. Finally, the leftmost digits are given by the operation $2_9 \\times 5_9 + 1_9 = 11_{10} = 12_9$. Writing this out, we have  $$\\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & & & \\stackrel{1}{2} & \\stackrel{4}{1} & \\stackrel{}{8}_9 \\\\\n& & & \\times & & & 5_9 \\\\\n\\cline{4-7} & & & 1 & 2 & 0 & 4_9 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$So our final answer is $\\boxed{1204_9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To multiply $218_9$ by $5_9$, we first convert both numbers to base 10. \n\n$218_9 = 2 \\cdot 9^2 + 1 \\cdot 9^1 + 8 \\cdot 9^0 = 2 \\cdot 81 + 1 \\cdot 9 + 8 \\cdot 1 = 162 + 9 + 8 = 179$\n$5_9 = 5 \\cdot 9^0 = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5$\n\nNow we multiply $179$ by $5$ in base 10 to find the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$.",
