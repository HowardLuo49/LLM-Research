    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe arithmetic progressions $\\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\ldots\\}$ and $\\{3, 10, 17, 24, \\ldots \\}$ have some common values.What is the largest value less than 500 that they have in common?\nThe common difference for the first arithmetic progression is $3$, and for the second arithmetic progression is $7$. \n\nNext steps:\n1. Find the formula for each arithmetic progression.\n2. Set the formulas equal to each other and solve for the common values.",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",
