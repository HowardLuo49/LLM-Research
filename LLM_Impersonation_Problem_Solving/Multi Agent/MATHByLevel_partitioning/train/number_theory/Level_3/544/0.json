    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining.\n",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given this information, let's denote the total number of cupcakes Claire has as $x$. \nWe can set up the following system of congruences:\n$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$\n$x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We know that $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$ implies $x = 5k + 3$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $5k + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\nSolving this congruence equation will give us the total number of cupcakes Claire has.",
