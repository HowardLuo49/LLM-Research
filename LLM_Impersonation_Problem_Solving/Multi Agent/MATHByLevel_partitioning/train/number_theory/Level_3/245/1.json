The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $N$ be the product of all odd primes less than $2^4$.What remainder does $N$ leave when divided by $2^4$?\nGiven that $N$ is the product of all odd primes less than $2^4$, we can start by listing out the odd primes less than $2^4$ which are $3, 5, 7, 11, 13$ and $N = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nCalculating the product, we get $N = 15015$.\n\nSince $N$ is relatively small, we can find the prime factorization of $N$ to better understand its properties.\n\nWe can prime factorize $N = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$ to get $N = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\nNext steps could involve analyzing the prime factorization of $N$ to find patterns or relationships that may help in solving the number theory problem fully.",
