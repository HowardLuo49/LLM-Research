The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSolve the congruence $11n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{43}$, as a residue modulo 43.(Give an answer between 0 and 42.)\nGiven the congruence $11n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{43}$, we can start by finding the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 43.\nTo find the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 mod 43, we need to find a number x such that (11 * x) mod 43 = 1.\nWe can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 mod 43:  \n43 = 3 * 11 + 10    \n11 = 10 * 1 + 1    \nThus, the modular multiplicative inverse of 11 mod 43 is 1.",
