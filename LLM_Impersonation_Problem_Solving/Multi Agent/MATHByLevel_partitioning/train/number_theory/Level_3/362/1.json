    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe operation $\\star$ is defined as $a \\star b = a^2 \\div b$.For how many integer values of $x$ will the value of $10 \\star x$ be a positive integer?\nGiven the operation $\\star$ defined as $a \\star b = a^2 \\div b$, the expression $7 \\star (4 \\star 2)$ can be simplified by substituting the operation with its definition. \n\nSo, $7 \\star (4 \\star 2) = 7 \\star (4^2 \\div 2)$.\n\nNext, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses to get $7 \\star (16 \\div 2)$.\n\nNow, we have $7 \\star 8$.",
    "solution": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $7 \\star 8$, we simply substitute the values into the definition of the operation $\\star$, which gives us $7^2 \\div 8 = 49 \\div 8 = 6.125$. Since $6.125$ is not an integer, the value of $7 \\star (4 \\star 2)$ is not a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 0 integer values of $x$ will make the expression $10 \\star x$ a positive integer.",
