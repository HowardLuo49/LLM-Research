    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nDonna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts.Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.After eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over.What is the smallest possible value of $n$?\n3. The difference between the total number of doughnuts Donna has and the number she gave away can be calculated as $13n - 91 - 91$.\n4. Simplifying the expression, we get $13n - 182$. This represents the new total number of doughnuts after giving away 91 to friends.",
    "solution": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of $n$, we need to find the smallest positive integer value of $n$ such that $13n - 182$ is divisible by 9. \n\nWe can rewrite $13n - 182$ as $13n - 13 \\times 14 = 13(n-14)$. For $13(n-14)$ to be divisible by 9, $n-14$ must be divisible by 9. The smallest positive integer value of $n$ that satisfies this is $n=23$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{23}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 7?: To find the smallest possible value of $n$, we need to find the smallest positive integer value of $n$ such that $13n - 182$ is divisible by 9. \n\nWe can rewrite $13n - 182$ as $13n - 13 \\times 14 = 13(n-14)$.
