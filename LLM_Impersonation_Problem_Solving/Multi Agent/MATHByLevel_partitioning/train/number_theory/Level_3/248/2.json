You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nDonna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts.Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.After eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over.\nAdditional information provided:\n- Suppose Donna gives away 7 boxes of doughnuts to her friends.\n- Each friend receives 4 doughnuts.\n\nGiven the new information, let's first find the total number of doughnuts Donna gave away:\n1. Since Donna gave away 7 boxes, she gave away a total of $7 \\times 13 = 91$ doughnuts.\n\nNow, let's find the number of doughnuts Donna has left:\n1. If Donna initially had $n$ boxes of doughnuts and she gave away 7 boxes, then the number of boxes she has left is $n - 7$.\n2. The total number of doughnuts she has left is the number of doughnuts in the remaining boxes:\n$$(n-7) \\times 13 = 13n - 91$$\n\nThe next steps would be\n3. Calculate the difference between the total number of doughnuts Donna has and the number she gave away to determine the new total.",
    "solution": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$.",
    "gpt_response": "3. The difference between the total number of doughnuts Donna has and the number she gave away can be calculated as $13n - 91 - 91$.\n4. Simplifying the expression, we get $13n - 182$. This represents the new total number of doughnuts after giving away 91 to friends.",
