The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the largest base-4 number that has four digits?Express your answer in base 10.\nGiven a base-4 number system, the largest four-digit number would be in the form:\n3333\nConverting this base-4 number to base-10, we get:\n3*4^3 + 3*4^2 + 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 192 + 48 + 12 + 3 = 255\nSo, the largest base-4 number that has four digits is 255.",
    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
