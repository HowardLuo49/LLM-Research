    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor what value of $n$ is the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ divisible by 33?(Note: the underlining is meant to indicate that the number should be interpreted as a five-digit number whose ten thousands digit is 7, whose thousands digit is $n$, and so on).\nGiven that a number is divisible by 33 if it is divisible by both 3 and 11, we know that the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3 and the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11.\nThe sum of the digits in $\\underline{7n933}$ is $7 + n + 9 + 3 + 3 = 22 + n$.\nTo be divisible by 3, $22 + n$ must be divisible by 3, meaning $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nThe alternating sum in $\\underline{7n933}$ is $7 - n + 9 - 3 + 3 = 16 - n$.\nTo be divisible by 11, $16 - n$ must be divisible by 11, leading to the congruence $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod {11}$.",
    "solution": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of n that satisfies both congruences $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod {11}$, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. \nFrom the first congruence, we know that $n = 3k + 1$. \nSubstituting this into the second congruence, we get $(3k + 1) \\equiv 5 \\pmod {11}$.\nSolving this congruence gives $3k \\equiv 4 \\pmod {11}$. \nMultiplying by the inverse of 3 modulo 11, we get $k \\equiv 9 \\pmod {11}$.\nTherefore, $k = 11m + 9$ for some integer m.\nSubstitute this back into $n = 3k + 1$ to get $n = 33m + 28$.\nSince n is a digit, the only possible value for n is $\\boxed{8}$.",
