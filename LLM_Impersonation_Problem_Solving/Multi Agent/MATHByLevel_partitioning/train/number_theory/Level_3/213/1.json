The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ be a  positive integer and $a$ be an integer such that $a$ is its own inverse modulo $n$.What is the remainder when $a^2$ is divided by $n$?\nPrevious work/message: Let's note that $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, which means $n \\mid (a^2 - 1)$. \n\nPlan for the next person: \n1. Expand $(a + 1)(a - 1)$ and see if that provides any insights.\n2. Consider the cases where $n$ is prime and composite separately to see if there are any patterns or restrictions on $a$. \n3. Explore the properties of the totient function $\\phi(n)$ and how it relates to the problem.\n4. Investigate the Chinese Remainder Theorem to see if it can provide any additional information about $a$ and $n$.",
    "solution": "Since $a$ is its own inverse modulo $n$, $a\\equiv a^{-1}\\pmod n$. Then \\[a^2\\equiv a\\cdot a\\equiv a\\cdot a^{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{1}\\pmod n.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "Expanding $(a+1)(a-1)$, we get $a^2 - 1$. Since $n$ divides $a^2 - 1$, we have $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. This means that $a^2$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when divided by $n$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: Expanding $(a+1)(a-1)$, we get $a^2 - 1$. Since $n$ divides $a^2 - 1$, we have $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$. This means that $a^2$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when divided by $n$.",
