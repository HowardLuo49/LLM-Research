The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA $\\textit{composite number}$ is a number that has two or more prime factors.The number 87 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers in many ways.What is the minimum positive difference between two such numbers?\nLet's take the next composite number, 21, and find its prime factors:\n\n$21 = 3 \\times 7$\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 21 are 3 and 7.\n\nContinuing with this pattern, let's find prime factors for more composite numbers and list them out accordingly to see if there is a way to represent 87 as the sum of two composite numbers.",
    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's take the next composite number, 33, and find its prime factors:\n\n$33 = 3 \\times 11$\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 33 are 3 and 11.\n\nNow, let's find the prime factors of 87 and list out the prime factors of other composite numbers to see if there is a way to represent 87 as the sum of two composite numbers.\n\n$87 = 3 \\times 29$\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 87 are 3 and 29.\n\nNow, looking at the prime factors we found, we can see that both 33 and 87 have 3 as one of their prime factors. This means we can represent 87 as the sum of two composite numbers: 33 and 54.\n\nThe minimum positive difference between 33 and 54 is $54 - 33 = 21$. \n\nTherefore, the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that sum up to 87 is $\\boxed{21}$.",
