You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nA pirate is counting the loot he has stolen from S.S. AOPS, on which everything is counted in base 5.A treasure chest contains $3124_{5}$ dollars worth of jewelry, $3122_{5}$ dollars worth of gold coins, and $124_{5}$ dollars worth of rubbing alcohol.What is the total dollar amount that this pirate has accumulated?\nThe next person can find the prime factorization of 85 by dividing it by the smallest prime numbers and continue dividing until all factors are prime.\n\nPrime factorization of 85:\n85 \u00f7 5 = 17\n17 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the largest prime factor of 85 is 17.",
