    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nJenna collects stamps.She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.The other has 1008.\nLet's say Jenna puts x stamps on each page. \nIf she has a total of 840 stamps in one book, then the number of pages in that book would be 840 / x.",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's write an equation using the information given in the problem: 840 = x * (840 / x). \n\nSimplify the equation to solve for x: 840 = 840.\n\nThere seems to be an error in the simplification of the equation. Let's reexamine the equation and try to correctly simplify it to find the value of x.",
