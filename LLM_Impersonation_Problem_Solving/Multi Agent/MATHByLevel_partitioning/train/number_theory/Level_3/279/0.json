    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nJenna collects stamps.\n",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The problem is about determining the number of stamps Jenna has, given a specific condition or pattern related to the number of stamps. \n\nPlan: \n1. Let's assume that Jenna has x stamps.\n2. Based on the pattern or condition provided in the problem, we can set up an equation or inequality that represents the relationship between x and the number of stamps Jenna has.\n3. Once we have the equation or inequality, we can solve it to find the value of x, which represents the total number of stamps Jenna has. \n\nNext steps: \nCalculate the value of x based on the provided equation or inequality. If there are multiple possible solutions, consider any additional constraints given in the problem to narrow down the possibilities.",
