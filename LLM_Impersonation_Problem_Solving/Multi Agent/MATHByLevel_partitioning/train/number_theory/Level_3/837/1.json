    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe time right now is exactly midnight.What time will it be in 1234 minutes?\nTo solve the problem, I will first need to consider the prime factorization of the number given.",
    "solution": "There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When $1234$ is divided by $60$, you get $20$ with a remainder of $34$. Therefore, the time in $1234$ minutes will be $\\boxed{20\\!:\\!34}$ or $\\boxed{8\\!:\\!34 \\text{ p.m.}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "1234 minutes can be written as 20 hours and 34 minutes. Since the current time is midnight, adding 20 hours will bring us to 8:00 PM. Adding an additional 34 minutes will give us the final time, which is 8:34 PM.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 20\\!:\\!34?: 1234 minutes can be written as 20 hours and 34 minutes. Since the current time is midnight, adding 20 hours will bring us to 8:00 PM. Adding an additional 34 minutes will give us the final time, which is 8:34 PM.",
