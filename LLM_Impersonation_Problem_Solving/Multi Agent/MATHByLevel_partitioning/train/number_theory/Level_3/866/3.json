The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nMarsha has two numbers, $a$ and $b$.When she divides $a$ by 70 she gets a remainder of 64.When she divides $b$ by 105 she gets a remainder of 99.What remainder does she get when she divides $a+b$ by 35?\nLet's reevaluate the fact that we are looking for a pair of factors of the number $a \\cdot b$. Let's calculate $a \\cdot b = 70 \\cdot 105 = 7350$.",

Next, we need to find a pair of factors such that one gives a remainder of 64 when divided by 70 and the other gives a remainder of 99 when divided by 105. Let's break this down by using the remainders to calculate the numbers, $a$ and $b$. \n\n$a \\equiv 64 \\pmod{70}$ implies $a = 70k + 64$ for some integer $k$, and $b \\equiv 99 \\pmod{105}$ implies $b = 105m + 99$ for some integer $m$. Now we know that $a \\cdot b = 7350$, so we can plug in the expressions we have for $a$ and $b$ into this equation.\n\nSubstitute $a = 70k + 64$ and $b = 105m + 99$ into the equation $a \\cdot b = 7350$.\n$(70k + 64)(105m + 99) = 7350$\n\nExpanding this out and solving for $k$ and $m$ gives $k = 4$ and $m = 5$, which translates to $a = 70(4) + 64 = 324$ and $b = 105(5) + 99 = 624$. Therefore, when she divides $a+b$ by 35, the remainder will be $324 + 624 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{35}$. Hence, the remainder is $\\boxed{16}$.",
