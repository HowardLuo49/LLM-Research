The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nSuppose that $3\\triangle_4=\\triangle2_{11}$, where $\\triangle$ represents a digit 0-9.What is the value of the missing digit?\nLet's start by converting the numbers in base 4 and base 11 to base 10 to make it easier to work with. \n\n$3\\triangle_4 = 3 + \\triangle = 4 \\triangle $\n\nWe know that $4 \\triangle = 11^2 + 2 = 121 + 2 = 123.$\n\nSo, $\\triangle = 123 - 4 = 119.$\n\nTherefore, $\\triangle = 9$ in base 10. \n\nNow, we can plug this back into the equation $3\\triangle_4 = \\triangle2_{11}.$\n\nSo $39_4 = 92_{11}$.",
