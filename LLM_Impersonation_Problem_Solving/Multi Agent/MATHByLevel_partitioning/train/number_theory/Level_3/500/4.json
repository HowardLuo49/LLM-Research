The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA roll of quarters contains $40$ quarters and a roll of dimes contains $50$ dimes.James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes.James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible.In dollars, how much are the leftover quarters and dimes worth?\nTo begin solving this problem, we first need to calculate the total value of the quarters and dimes that James and Lindsay have in their jars separately. \n\nFor James: $83$ quarters = $83 \\times 0.25 = \\$ 20.75$ and $159$ dimes = $159 \\times 0.10 = \\$ 15.90$.\nFor Lindsay: $129$ quarters = $129 \\times 0.25 = \\$ 32.25$ and $266$ dimes = $266 \\times 0.10 = \\$ 26.60$. \n\nNext, we can calculate the total value of the nickels in 6 rolls and use that information along with the given total value and total number of coins in 6 rolls to come up with a plan for solving the overall problem.",
