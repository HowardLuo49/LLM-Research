    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen a class of math students lined up for a class picture on Picture Day, they found that when they stood in rows of four there was one person left over.When they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students, and when they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over.What is the fewest number of students possible in this class?\nTo solve the problem, we have:\nN = 4n + 1\nN = 6m + 1\n\nSetting these two expressions equal to each other gives:\n4n + 1 = 6m + 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n4n = 6m\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n2n = 3m\n\nThis means that the total number of students N must be of the form 4n + 1 and 6m + 1, where 2n = 3m. Let's denote N = lcm(4, 6)k + 1 = 12k + 1, where k is an integer. This will give us a more specific form for the total number of students.\n\nWe need to find a k such that N = 12k + 1 satisfies the conditions given in the problem. We can start by trying out different values of k and checking each time if the conditions are met, such as having 1 person left over when lining up in rows of 4, 5, 6, and 7. Good luck with solving the problem!",
    "solution": "The first two pieces of information imply that the number of students is 1 more than a multiple of 4 and 2 more than a multiple of 5. Checking numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 5, we find that 2, 7, and 12 are not 1 more than a multiple of 4, but 17 does satisfy this condition. Moreover, 17 is also three more than a multiple of 7. Thus $\\boxed{17}$ is the least positive integer satisfying all three conditions.\n\nRemark: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers satisfying the given conditions are of the form $17 + \\text{lcm}(4,5,7)k = 17+140k$, where $k$ is an integer.",
