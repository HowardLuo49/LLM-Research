    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe positive integers $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers.\n",
    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers, we know that they must all be odd primes since $2$ is the only even prime number. Let's denote $A = 2x + 1$ and $B = 2y + 1$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. \n\nNext, we can use the fact that $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime numbers to derive some constraints. Since $A-B$ and $A+B$ are prime, they cannot be divisible by 2. This means $A-B$ and $A+B$ must be odd primes.\n\nNow, we know that $A$ and $B$ are both odd primes, which means $A-B = (2x + 1) - (2y + 1) = 2(x - y)$ and $A+B = (2x + 1) + (2y + 1) = 2(x + y) + 2$ are both even integers. Therefore, $A-B$ and $A+B$ differ by $2$, which implies that one of them must be $2$ and the other must be a prime number. \n\nBased on the above analysis, the possible values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the given conditions are when $A = 3$ and $B = 5$, or $A = 5$ and $B = 3$.",
