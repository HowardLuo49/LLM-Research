You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nLet $f(x) = x^2 - x + 2010$.\n",

    "gpt_response": "Our goal is to find integer solutions to the equation $f(x) = p$, where $p$ is a prime number.\nLet's start by setting $f(x) = p$ and then rearranging the equation to make $x$ the subject.\nTherefore, $x^2 - x + 2010 = p$ can be rewritten as $x^2 - x = p - 2010$.\nNext, complete the square on the left side of the equation to make it easier to solve for $x$.\nTo complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$ inside the brackets, so the left side becomes $\\left(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$.\nSubstitute this back into the equation to get $\\left(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = p - 2010$ for the next person to solve.",
