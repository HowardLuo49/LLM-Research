You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nTwo distinct positive integers $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36.\n",
    "solution": "We begin by listing all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8... 8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4. We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36. $\\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product.",
