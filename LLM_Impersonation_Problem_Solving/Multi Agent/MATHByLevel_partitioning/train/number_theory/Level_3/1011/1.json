The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nLet $n$ be a positive integer and $a,b$ be invertible integers modulo $n$ such that $a\\equiv b^{-1}\\pmod n$.What is the remainder when $ab$ is divided by $n$?\nGiven $a\\equiv b^{-1}\\pmod n$, we can rewrite this as $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod n$.\nThis implies that $ab = kn + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nWe also know that $a$ and $b$ are invertible modulo $n$, meaning $a$ and $b$ are coprime to $n$.\nThis implies that $\\gcd(a,n) = \\gcd(b,n) = 1$.",
