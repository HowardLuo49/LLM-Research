You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nFind the modular inverse of $4$, modulo $21$.\n",
    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $4a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 21. One approach is to check integers of the form $21k+1$, where $k\\geq 0$ is an integer, for divisibility by 4. We find that 22 and 43 are not divisible by 4, but $21(3)+1=64$ is equal to $4\\times 16$. Thus $\\boxed{16}$ times 4 is congruent to 1 modulo 21.",
    "gpt_response": "So the problem is asking us to find a number $x$ such that $4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$.\nFirst, let's find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $4$ and $21$ using the Euclidean algorithm.\n$21 = 5(4) + 1$\n$4 = 4(1) + 0$\nThe gcd is $1$ which means that $4$ is invertible modulo $21$. \n\nNext, let's express $1$ as a linear combination of $4$ and $21$ using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n$1 = 21 - 5(4)$\nThis means that the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ is $-5 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{21}$.\nTherefore, the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ is $16$.",
