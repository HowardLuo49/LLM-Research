The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFor each positive integer $n$, let $n!$ denote the product $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot\\,\\cdots\\,\\cdot (n-1)\\cdot n$.What is the remainder when $9!$ is divided by $11$?\nLet's begin by examining the factorial of the number $5$ which is $5! = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120$. Let's consider the prime factorization of $120$. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5$.",
