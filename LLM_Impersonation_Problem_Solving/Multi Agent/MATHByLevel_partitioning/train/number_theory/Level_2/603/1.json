The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThe number of students in Teresa's graduating class is more than 50 and fewer than 100 and is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5.How many students are in Teresa's graduating class?\nGiven that the number of students is 1 less than a multiple of 3, we can write the number of students as 3n - 1, where n is a positive integer.\n\nSince the number of students is also 2 less than a multiple of 4, we can write the number of students as 4m - 2, where m is a positive integer.\n\nSimilarly, since the number of students is 3 less than a multiple of 5, we can write the number of students as 5k - 3, where k is a positive integer.\n\nTo find the common value for n, m, and k, we can set the three expressions equal to each other: 3n - 1 = 4m - 2 = 5k - 3.\n\nSolving the equations simultaneously will allow us to determine the number of students in Teresa's graduating class.",
    "solution": "Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv -1\\equiv 2\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv -2\\equiv 2\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv -3\\equiv 2\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv 2\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 2\\pmod{60}$. Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\\boxed{62}$.",
