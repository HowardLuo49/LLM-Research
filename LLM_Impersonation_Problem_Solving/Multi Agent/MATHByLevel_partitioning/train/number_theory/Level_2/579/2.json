    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWinnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.\nNext, I will determine the number of balloons each of Winnie's 8 nearest and dearest friends receive. \nNumber of balloons each friend receives = Total number of balloons / Number of friends\nNumber of balloons each friend receives = 198 / 8\nNumber of balloons each friend receives = 24.75 \nSince we cannot give a fraction of a balloon to each friend, we will need to reassess the distribution of balloons among Winnie's friends or make some adjustments.",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can adjust the number of balloons distributed to each friend by rounding down to the nearest whole number. This means that each of Winnie's 8 nearest and dearest friends will receive 24 balloons. Additionally, we should check if there are any remaining balloons after distributing 24 balloons to each friend in order to make sure we have accounted for all of Winnie's balloons.",
