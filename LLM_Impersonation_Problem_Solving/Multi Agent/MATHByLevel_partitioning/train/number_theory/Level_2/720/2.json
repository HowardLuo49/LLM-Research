    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWinnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.\nThe total number of lollipops Winnie has is 394.\nLet's start by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of each type of lollipop: GCD(45, 116, 4, 229) = 1.\nNow, since the GCD is 1, there are no common factors among the number of each type of lollipop. \nNext, let's examine the relationship between the different types of lollipops and see if there are any noticeable patterns.",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "Based on the fact that the GCD of the number of each type of lollipop is 1, and there are no common factors among them, we should focus on finding a common divisor between the total number of lollipops and the number of friends Winnie has (11).\nTo do this, we will calculate the remainder when the total number of lollipops (394) is divided by the number of friends (11). This will help us determine if each friend can indeed receive an equal number of lollipops. If the remainder is 0, then it is possible for each friend to receive an equal number of lollipops.",
