The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nOne digit of the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is randomly selected.What is the probability that the digit is a 4?Express your answer as a common fraction.\nTo calculate the probability of selecting the digit 4, we need to see how many 4s are in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$. \n\nLooking at the decimal expansion $0.7142857142857143\\ldots$, the digit 4 occurs 0 times.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting the digit 4 from the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is 0.",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since there are no 4s in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$, the probability of selecting the digit 4 is 0. \n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response \\frac{1?: Since there are no 4s in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$, the probability of selecting the digit 4 is 0. \n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",
