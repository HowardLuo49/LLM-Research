You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nOne digit of the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is randomly selected.\n",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
