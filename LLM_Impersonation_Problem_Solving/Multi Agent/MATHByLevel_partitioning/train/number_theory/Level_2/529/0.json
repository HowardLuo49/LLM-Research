    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nUse each of the digits 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 exactly once to create the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6.\n",
    "solution": "A multiple of 6 is a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3, and a multiple of 2, which means its units digit is even. We note that 4, 6, and 8 are even and that $3+4+6+8+9=30=3(10)$, so indeed it is possible to create a multiple of 6. Choose the smallest even number on the list, 4, for the units digit and arrange the rest of the digits in decreasing order to maximize the multiple of 6: $\\boxed{98,634}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given the digits 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, we need to form the greatest five-digit multiple of 6 using each digit exactly once.\n\nFirst, we note that for a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. \n\nTo maximize the number, we need to place the largest digits in the leftmost positions.\n\nWe can start by arranging the digits from largest to smallest: 9, 8, 6, 4, 3.\n\nNext, since the number must be divisible by 2, the last digit must be even. So, we can place 4 in the units place.\n\nNow, the sum of the digits of the number should be a multiple of 3 for the entire number to be divisible by 3.\n\nCalculating the sum of the digits 9 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 4 = 30, which is a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, we can place 9 in the ten-thousands place, 8 in the thousands place, 6 in the hundreds place, and 3 in the tens place to form the greatest possible five-digit multiple of 6: 98,634.",
