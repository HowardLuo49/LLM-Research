    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nJason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard.His parents have agreed to let him work off his debt by babysitting under the following conditions: his first hour of babysitting is worth $\\$1$, the second hour worth $\\$2$, the third hour $\\$3$, the fourth hour $\\$4$, the fifth hour $\\$5$, the sixth hour $\\$6$, the seventh hour $\\$1$, the eighth hour $\\$2$, etc.If he repays his debt by babysitting for 39 hours, how many dollars did he borrow?\nGiven that Jason borrowed x dollars and is paying p dollars each month, we set up the equation x = p \\cdot n, where n represents the total number of months it will take to repay the loan. \n\nSince p must be an integer, we know from Jason's payment plan that the sum of the first n integers ($1+2+3+...+n$) must be divisible by n. \n\nUsing the formula for the sum of the first n integers, we have $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, which must be divisible by n. \n\nTherefore, for the next person, find all positive integers n such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is divisible by n. List all possible values of p.",
    "solution": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find all positive integers n such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is divisible by n, we need to consider the factors of n. \n\nSince $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ must be divisible by n, this means that n must be a factor of $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. \n\nSo, the only solution for n is when n is equal to 1. \n\nTherefore, the only possible value for p is 1. \n\nTherefore, Jason borrowed $\\boxed{39}$ dollars.",
