    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nFifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box.One card is randomly selected.What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7?Express your answer as a common fraction.\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of cards that are both prime and multiples of 7 between 1 and 50. We can start off by listing down prime numbers less than 50: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47. Next, identify which of these are multiples of 7.",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime numbers that are multiples of 7 are 7, 13, 19, 23, 37, 43. There are a total of 6 cards that meet the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a card that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 6/50, which simplifies to 3/25.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response \\frac{1?: The prime numbers that are multiples of 7 are 7, 13, 19, 23, 37, 43. There are a total of 6 cards that meet the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a card that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 6/50, which simplifies to 3/25.",
