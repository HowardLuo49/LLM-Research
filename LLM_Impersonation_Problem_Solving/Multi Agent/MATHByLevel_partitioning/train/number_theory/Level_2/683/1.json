The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nAn octopus told me that his underwater cave is $245_{8}$ years old.How many years is this in base ten?\nGiven that the octopus mentioned his cave is $245_{8}$ years old, the next step would be to convert this number to base 10 to get a better understanding of the age of the cave. \n\nConverting $245_{8}$ to base 10, we get:\n$2 \\times 8^{2} + 4 \\times 8^{1} + 5 \\times 8^{0} = 2 \\times 64 + 4 \\times 8 + 5 \\times 1 = 128 + 32 + 5 = 165$ years old.\n\nSo, the octopus's underwater cave is actually 165 years old in base 10.",
