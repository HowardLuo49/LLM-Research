You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhat is the greatest common divisor of $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}?$ Express your answer as an integer.\nTo find the GCD of $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}$, we need to calculate the prime factorization of each factorial.\nThe prime factorization of $5!$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\nCalculating the prime factorization of $8!$ gives $2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. \nThe prime factorization of $3!$ is $2 \\cdot 3$. This means the prime factorization of $\\frac{8!}{3!}$ is $2^6 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.\nSo, the next step is to find the common factors between $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}$.",
    "solution": "First, we factor $5!$ into primes: \\begin{align*} 5! &= 5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1\\\\ &= 2^{3}\\cdot3\\cdot5. \\end{align*} Then, we factor $\\frac{8!}{3!}.$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{8!}{3!} &= 8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\\\ &= 2^{6}\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7. \\end{align*} We can find the greatest common factor by taking the lowest exponent of each common prime factor. We get $2^{3}\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{120}.$",
    "gpt_response": "The common factors between $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}$ are $2^3, 3, 5$. \nThe highest power of each common prime factor in the two numbers are $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. \nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $5!$ and $\\frac{8!}{3!}$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$. \n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{120}$.",
