There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nTwo different prime numbers between $4$ and $18$ are chosen.When their sum is subtracted from their product, which of the following numbers could be obtained?$$\n\\text A.\\ \\ 21 \\qquad \\text B.\\ \\ 60 \\qquad \\text C. \\ \\ 119 \\qquad \\text D. \\ \\ 180 \\qquad \\text E. \\ \\ 231\n$$\nTo check if 119 is an option in the answer choices, we need to look at the answer choices given and see if 119 is among them. \n\nNow, let's think about a different pair of prime numbers that could help us get a different number from the list of answer choices.",
    "solution": "There are five prime numbers between $4$ and $18:$ namely $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ and $17.$ Hence the product of any two of these is odd and the sum is even. Because $$xy-(x+y)=(x-1)(y-1)-1$$increases as either $x$ or $y$ increases (since both $x$ and $y$ are bigger than $1$), the answer must be an odd number that is no smaller than $$23=5\\cdot 7-(5+7)$$and no larger than $$191=13\\cdot 17-(13+17).$$The only possibility among the options is $\\boxed{119},$ and indeed $119=11\\cdot 13-(11+13).$",
