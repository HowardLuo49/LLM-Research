    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to solve a number theory problem. The problem was revealed one sentence at a time. You are on the last sentence have the entire problem now. The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nThere is a unique two-digit positive integer $t$ for which the last two digits of $11\\cdot t$ are $36$.What is $t$?\nTo find integer $t$, we can write $t$ as $10a+b$ where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits of $t$, respectively.\nThen, $11(10a+b) = 110a + 11b = 100a + 10b + 16$ since the last two digits are $36$.",
    "solution": "We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\\cdot t \\equiv 36\\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\\cdot t \\equiv 324 \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \\equiv -24\\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\\boxed{76}$. Indeed, we can check that $11\\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can simplify this equation to $10a = -b + 16$. Since $a$ and $b$ are both digits, we know that $a$ must be between 0 and 10, and $b$ must be between 0 and 9. \n\nWe can now plug in values for $a$ from 0 to 10 and find the corresponding value of $b$ such that $10a = -b + 16$ is satisfied. \n\nWhen $a = 2$, $b = 6$, the equation is satisfied. Therefore, $t = 10a + b = 26$. \n\nThus, the unique two-digit positive integer $t$ for which the last two digits of $11\\cdot t$ are $36$ is $26$.",
