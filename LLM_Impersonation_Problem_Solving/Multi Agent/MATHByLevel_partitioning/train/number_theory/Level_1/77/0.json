    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nThe integer $m$ is between $30$ and $80$ and is a multiple of $6$.\n",
    "solution": "According to the problem statement, we have the system of linear congruences \\begin{align*}\nm &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*} It follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{40}$. The only number that satisfies this criterion for $30 \\le m \\le 80$ is $m = \\boxed{42}$, which is indeed divisible by $6$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that $m$ is a multiple of 6, we can express $m$ as $6k$ where $k$ is an integer. Then, we have $30 \\leq 6k \\leq 80$. Simplifying this inequality, we get $5 \\leq k \\leq 13.33$ which means $k$ can take on the values $5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13$. Let's find the possible values of $m$ based on these values of $k$.",
