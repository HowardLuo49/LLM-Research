    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nIn 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.\n",
    "solution": "The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1. So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing the year 2010 as $1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the digits of the year. \n\nSince the sum of the year's digits is 3, we have $a + b + c + d = 3$. \n\nWe can also express the year 2010 as $2010 = 1000(2) + 100(0) + 10(1) + 0$, which means $a=2$, $b=0$, $c=1$, and $d=0$. \n\nNext, we can look for relationships between the variables to help us solve the problem further. \n\nIt seems like we have made good progress so far and have all the necessary information to solve the problem. \n\nLet's find the product of the digits of the year 2010.",
