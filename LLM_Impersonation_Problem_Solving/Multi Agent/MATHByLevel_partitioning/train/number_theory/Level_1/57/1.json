The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nWhen three positive integers are divided by $24$, the remainders are $10,$ $4,$ and $12,$ respectively.When the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, what is the remainder?\nGiven the information provided:\nLet the three positive integers be $a, b, c$.\nWe can express $a, b, c$ as:\n$a = 24k + 10$\n$b = 24m + 4$\n$c = 24n + 12$\nwhere $k, m, n$ are integers.",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
