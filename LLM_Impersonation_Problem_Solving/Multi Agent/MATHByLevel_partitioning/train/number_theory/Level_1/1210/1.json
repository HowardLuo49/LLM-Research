The following is as much of the problem you have revealed, and the work done so far. There may be errors in the work done so far, so fix them if necessary.\nA whole number, $N$, is chosen so that $\\frac{N}{3}$ is strictly between 7.5 and 8.What is the value of $N$ ?\nGiven that $\\frac{N}{3}$ lies strictly between 7.5 and 8, we can set up the following inequality: $7.5 < \\frac{N}{3} < 8$. Multiplying all parts by 3, we get $22.5 < N < 24$. This means $N$ could be 23. In order to ensure that this is the correct solution, we should check that $\\frac{N}{3}$ is indeed strictly between 7.5 and 8. This can be done by plugging in $N=23$ into the expression $\\frac{N}{3}$ and comparing it to 7.5 and 8. If it is indeed strictly between 7.5 and 8, then our solution is correct. The next steps for the person solving this problem is to do this check and confirm if $N=23$ is the correct choice.",
