    "problem_prompt": "Your job is to consider a number theory problem, and leave a plan for the next person to solve it. The problem will be revealed one sentence at a time. You do not have the entire problem yet, thus just do whatever calcluations/planning you think will be useful for the next person. If you don't think you can make any progress, say so. The following is a portion of the entire problem, and the work/progress/message the previous person left for you. There may be errors in the provided work that was previously done and left for you, so check and fix them if necessary.\nWhen three positive integers are divided by $12$, the remainders are $7,$ $9,$ and $10,$ respectively.\n",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 7\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 9\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 10\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 7+9+10 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $12$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Given that when three positive integers, $a$, $b$, and $c$, are divided by $12$, the remainders are $7$, $9$, and $10$ respectively, we can express the integers in terms of their remainders as follows: \\begin{align*}\na &= 12k + 7 \\\\\nb &= 12m + 9 \\\\\nc &= 12n + 10,\n\\end{align*} where $k$, $m$, and $n$ are the quotients when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are divided by $12$. \n\nTo find the possible values of $a+b+c$, we can add the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$: \\begin{align*}\na + b + c &= (12k + 7) + (12m + 9) + (12n + 10) \\\\\n&= 12(k + m + n) + 26.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will be of the form $12(k + m + n) + 26$, where $k$, $m$, and $n$ are integers. \n\nThe plan for the next person is to see if any restrictions on $k$, $m$, and $n$ can be determined from the information given, in order to find possible values for the sum $a+b+c$.",
