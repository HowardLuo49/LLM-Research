    "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, then $2n - 1$ must be a divisor of 20. The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. Setting $2n - 1$ equal to each of these divisors, we have:\n\n$2n - 1 = 1 \\Rightarrow n = 1$\n$2n - 1 = 2 \\Rightarrow n = 3/2$\n$2n - 1 = 4 \\Rightarrow n = 5/2$\n$2n - 1 = 5 \\Rightarrow n = 3$\n$2n - 1 = 10 \\Rightarrow n = 11/2$\n$2n - 1 = 20 \\Rightarrow n = 21/2$\n\nThe only integer values are $n = 1, 3, 5$. \n\nThus, the sum of all integer values of $n$ is $1 + 3 + 5 = \\boxed{9}$.",
