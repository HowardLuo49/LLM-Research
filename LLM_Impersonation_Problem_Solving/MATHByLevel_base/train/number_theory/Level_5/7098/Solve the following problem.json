    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. For each positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-four representation of $n$ and let $g(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-eight representation of $f(n)$. For example, $f(2020) = f(133210_{\\text{4}}) = 10 = 12_{\\text{8}}$, and $g(2020) = \\text{the digit sum of }12_{\\text{8}} = 3$. Let $N$ be the least value of $n$ such that the base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "solution": "Let's work backwards. The minimum base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ that cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$ is $A_{16}$, which is equal to $10$ in base 10. Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-eight representation of the sum of the digits of $f(n)$ is $10$. The minimum value for which this is achieved is $37_8$. We have that $37_8 = 31$. Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-four representation of $n$ is $31$. The minimum value for which this is achieved is $13,333,333,333_4$. We just need this value in base 10 modulo 1000. We get $13,333,333,333_4 = 3(1 + 4 + 4^2 + \\dots + 4^8 + 4^9) + 4^{10} = 3\\left(\\dfrac{4^{10} - 1}{3}\\right) + 4^{10} = 2*4^{10} - 1$. Taking this value modulo $1000$, we get the final answer of $\\boxed{151}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We start by looking at $f(n)$. The largest possible value of $f(n)$ is $3+3+3...+3=3^k - 1$, where there are $k$ 3's. This corresponds to $n=333...3$ in base four, which is equivalent to $4^k - 1$ in base ten. Correspondingly, the largest possible sum of the digits of $f(n)$ in base eight is $3k$, which can be achieved when the base eight number is $777...7$ with $k$ 7's. This means the largest possible value of $g(n)$ is $3k$.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $g(n)$ in base sixteen cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$. We know that the largest value of $g(n)$ is $3k$, so its base sixteen representation has at most $\\frac{3k}{15} = \\frac{k}{5}$ digits. \n\nConsidering the smallest cases, $g(1) = 1$ in base sixteen, $g(2) = 2$, $g(3) = 3$, $g(4) = 4$, $g(5) = 5$, $g(6) = 6$, $g(7) = 7$, $g(8) = 10$, $g(9) = 11$, $g(10) = 12$, $g(11) = 13$, $g(12) = 14$, $g(13) = 15$, $g(14) = 20$, $g(15) = 21$, $g(16) = 22$, $g(17) = 23$, and $g(18) = 24$. Thus, $g(18) = 24$ has two digits in base sixteen, making it the smallest value for which $g(n)$ cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $18 \\equiv \\boxed{018} \\pmod{1000}$.",
