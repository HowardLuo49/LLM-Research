    "solution": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, we can set up the equation:\n47 = 5 (mod n)\nwhere n is the counting number we are looking for.\n\nTo solve this equation, we can start by finding the multiples of n that are close to 47 by adding 5:\n47 + 5 = 52\n47 + 5(2) = 57\n47 + 5(3) = 62\n\nNext, we can divide these numbers by n to see if there is no remainder:\n52 \u00f7 n = 10 R 2\n57 \u00f7 n = 11 R 2\n62 \u00f7 n = 12 R 2\n\nWe see that 52 and 62 do not leave a remainder when divided by n, so the counting number we are looking for is 57.\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 counting number that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, and that number is 57.",
