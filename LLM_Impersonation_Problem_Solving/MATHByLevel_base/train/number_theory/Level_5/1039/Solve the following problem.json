    "gpt_response": "We know that any number raised to the power of an even number is congruent to 1 modulo 6, and any number raised to the power of an odd number is congruent to itself modulo 6.\n\nTherefore, $35^{1723}$ is congruent to $5^{1723}$ modulo 6, which is congruent to 5 since 1723 is an odd number.\n\nSimilarly, $16^{1723}$ is congruent to $4^{1723}$ modulo 6, which is congruent to 4 since 1723 is an odd number.\n\nTherefore, $35^{1723} - 16^{1723}$ is congruent to $5 - 4 = 1$ modulo 6.\n\nSo, $35^{1723} - 16^{1723} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$.",
