    "solution": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can write the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$ as $2^{10} \\cdot 3^{12} \\cdot 5^{15}$.\n\nTo find the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of this product, we need to consider the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 separately.\n\nFor 2, the possible exponents for a perfect square integer are even numbers between 0 and 10 inclusive. This gives us 6 possibilities: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.\n\nFor 3, the possible exponents for a perfect square integer are even numbers between 0 and 12 inclusive. This gives us 7 possibilities: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n\nFor 5, the possible exponents for a perfect square integer are even numbers between 0 and 15 inclusive.
