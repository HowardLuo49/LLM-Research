There are $4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{32}$ choices for $a$, $b$, and $c$, giving the number of positive divisors of 3240 that are multiples of 3.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find the prime factorization of 3240:\n\n3240 = 2^3 * 3^4 * 5\n\nTo find the total number of divisors of 3240, we add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiply the results together:\n\n(3+1)(4+1)(1+1) = 4 * 5 * 2 = 40\n\nSo, there are 40 positive divisors of 3240.\n\nNext, let's find how many of these divisors are multiples of 3. Since 3240 already has a factor of 3 raised to the power of 4, any divisor of 3240 that is a multiple of 3 can have exponents from 0 to 4 for the prime factor 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 choices for the exponent of 3 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) for each factor of 3. For each of the other prime factors (2 and 5), we have 4 choices (0, 1, 2, 3) for the exponents.\n\nSo, there are a total of 5 * 4 * 2 = 40 divisors that are multiples of 3.\n\nTherefore, out of the 40 positive divisors of 3240, all 40 of them are multiples of 3.",
