    "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits, and that its first digit is 9. This means that $9^{3999}$ has 3816 digits, so the maximum possible value of $9^{k}$ while still having a leading digit of 9 is $9^{3999}$.\n\nLet's consider the powers of 9 from $9^1$ to $9^{3999}$. We know that $9^1$ to $9^9$ all have 1 digit, $9^{10}$ to $9^{99}$ all have 2 digits, ..., $9^{1000}$ to $9^{3999}$ all have 1000 digits. So there are 3990 numbers in total with 9 as their leading digit: $9^1$ to $9^{3999}$ minus the 9 values that have less than 4 digits (9^1 to 9^8). \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3990}$ elements of $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit.",
