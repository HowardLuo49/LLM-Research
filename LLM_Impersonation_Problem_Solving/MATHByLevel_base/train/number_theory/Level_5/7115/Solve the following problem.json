    "solution": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $p$ be a prime number greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$. We know that $n!+1$ is not divisible by any integer greater than 1 and less than $n$, so $p$ must be greater than or equal to $n$.\n\nAlso, note that $p$ must be less than or equal to $n!+n$. Since $p$ is greater than or equal to $n$, it follows that $n!+n$ is less than or equal to $n!+n$. Therefore, $p$ must be equal to $n$.\n\nTherefore, there is only one prime number greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$, namely $n$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{(B) 1}$.",
