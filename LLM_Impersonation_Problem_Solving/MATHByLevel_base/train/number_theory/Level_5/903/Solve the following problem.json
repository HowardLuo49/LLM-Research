    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "gpt_response": "Since we are looking for the largest number that is certain to divide $P$, we are essentially looking for the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the five numbers that are visible after the die is rolled.\n\nThe numbers that can be visible on a standard six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The gcd of any set of numbers will always be divisible by the gcd of any subset of those numbers.\n\nLooking at the set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we can see that the gcd of any subset of these numbers will be guaranteed to be divisible by 1. Therefore, 1 is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$.",
