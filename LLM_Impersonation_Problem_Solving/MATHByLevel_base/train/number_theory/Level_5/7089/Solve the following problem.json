For positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",
    "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first address the reasoning behind the number of divisors a perfect power of a prime number has. If $a=p^k$ is a perfect power of a prime number, then $a$ has $k+1$ factors. This is because to form a factor of $a$, one must choose a power of $p$ less than or equal to $k$.\n\nNow, let's represent $N$ as $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_m^{a_m}$. Then, $N$ has $t$ factors where $t = (a_1+1)(a_2+1) \\cdots (a_m+1)$. We can take $N$ to be the $k$-th power of $a$ where $a = p_1^{c_1} p_2^{c_2} \\cdots p_m^{c_m}$ and $c_i = \\lceil \\frac{a_i}{k} \\rceil$. Thus, the $k$-th power of $a$ has $t =  (kc_1+1)(kc_2+1) \\cdots (kc_m+1)$ factors.\n\nBack to the problem, we now search for any $n$ such that there exists no $a$ where $a^7$ or $a^8$ has a number of factors equal to $n$. Since $n$ must have a multiple of $7$ or $8$, then $n$ has no relation to $\\lceil \\frac{a_i}{7} \\rceil$ or $\\lceil \\frac{a_i}{8} \\rceil$. The product of the two equations should also not be less than $1000$. This means that $n$ must be covered by the prime factors $7$ and $8$ and less than $1000$. The prime factors of $n$ can be any $7^a 8^b$ where $a+k$ and $b+m$ are less than or equal to 3. We need to solve $$2 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 2 - 1 = 7$$ The numbers of $n$ are found to be $37$ and there are $\\boxed{37}$ such numbers.",
