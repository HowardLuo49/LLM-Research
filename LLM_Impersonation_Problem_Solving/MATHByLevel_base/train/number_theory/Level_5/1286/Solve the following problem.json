    "solution": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the number $90$ has the divisors $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90$. \n\nSince $90$ and $m$ share exactly three divisors, $m$ must have these divisors as well. Thus, we are looking for three divisors of $m$ that are also divisors of $90$. \n\nThe three greatest common divisors of $90$ and $m$ are $30, 45,$ and $90$. \n\nTherefore, the greatest of these three common divisors is $\\boxed{90}$.",
