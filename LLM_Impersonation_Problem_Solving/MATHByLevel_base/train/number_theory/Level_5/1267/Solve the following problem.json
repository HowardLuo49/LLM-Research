    "solution": "We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^4$. A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4. There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$. In total, there are $9\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{135}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "We can write the given number as $2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4$. \n\nTo find the number of factors, we find the exponents of the prime factors and add 1 to each. Then we multiply these numbers together.\n\nThe number of factors is $(8+1)(2+1)(4+1) = 9 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{135}$.",
