    "solution": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $8! = 8 \\times 7!$, which means that $7!$ divides evenly into $8!$. Thus, the divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$ are simply the divisors of $8!$ that are not divisors of $7!$.\n\nSince $8!$ includes all of the divisors of $7!$, except for $7!$ itself, there are $8$ extra divisors of $8!$ that are not divisors of $7!$. So, there are $\\boxed{8}$ divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 7?: We know that $8! = 8 \\times 7!$, which means that $7!$ divides evenly into $8!$. Thus, the divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$ are simply the divisors of $8!$ that are not divisors of $7!$.\n\nSince $8!$ includes all of the divisors of $7!$, except for $7!$ itself, there are $8$ extra divisors of $8!$ that are not divisors of $7!$.
