A set $\\mathcal{S}$ of distinct positive integers has the following property: for every integer $x$ in $\\mathcal{S},$ the arithmetic mean of the set of values obtained by deleting $x$ from $\\mathcal{S}$ is an integer. Given that 1 belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$ and that 2002 is the largest element of $\\mathcal{S},$ what is the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have?\n",
    "solution": "Let the sum of the integers in $\\mathcal{S}$ be $N$, and let the size of $|\\mathcal{S}|$ be $n+1$. After any element $x$ is removed, we are given that $n|N-x$, so $x\\equiv N\\pmod{n}$. Since $1\\in\\mathcal{S}$, $N\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and all elements are congruent to 1 mod $n$. Since they are positive integers, the largest element is at least $n^2+1$, the $(n+1)$th positive integer congruent to 1 mod $n$.\nWe are also given that this largest member is 2002, so $2002\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and $n|2001=3\\cdot23\\cdot29$. Also, we have $n^2+1\\le2002$, so $n<45$. The largest factor of 2001 less than 45 is 29, so $n=29$ and $n+1$ $\\Rightarrow{\\boxed{30}}$ is the largest possible. This can be achieved with $\\mathcal{S}=\\{1,30,59,88,\\ldots,813,2002\\}$, for instance.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the set $\\mathcal{S}$ have $n$ elements, with $n \\geq 2.$ Let the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ be $S.$\n\nSince 1 belongs to $\\mathcal{S},$ deleting 1 from $\\mathcal{S}$ gives an arithmetic mean of $S/(n-1),$ which must be an integer. This implies that $n-1$ divides $S.$\n\nSimilarly, deleting 2002 from $\\mathcal{S}$ gives an arithmetic mean of $S-2002,$ which must be an integer. This implies that $S-2002$ is a multiple of $n.$\n\nCombining the two conditions, we have that $n-1$ divides $S$ and $n$ divides $S-2002.$ \n\nNow notice that $S-2002 > S/2,$ so $n$ must be at least 4. Since $n-1$ divides $S,$ and $n$ divides $S-2002,$ we can test values of $n$ starting from 4 to see if both conditions are satisfied. \n\nWhen $n=4,$ the sum $S$ must be a multiple of 3, and $S-2002$ must be a multiple of 4. The largest multiple of 3 less than 2002 is 2001, which is not a multiple of 4. So $n=4$ does not work.\n\nWhen $n=5,$ the sum $S$ must be a multiple of 4, and $S-2002$ must be a multiple of 5.
