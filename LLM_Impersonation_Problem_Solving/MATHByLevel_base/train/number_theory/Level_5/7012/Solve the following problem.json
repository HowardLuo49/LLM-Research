    "solution": "If we move the $x^2$ term to the left side, it is factorable:\n\\[(3x^2 + 1)(y^2 - 10) = 517 - 10\\]\n$507$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 13^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $3x^2 + 1$ cannot equal a multiple of three. $169$ doesn't work either, so $3x^2 + 1 = 13$, and $x^2 = 4$. This leaves $y^2 - 10 = 39$, so $y^2 = 49$. Thus, $3x^2 y^2 = 3 \\times 4 \\times 49 = \\boxed{588}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first rewrite the given equation in a slightly different form:\n\n$y^2(1 + 3x^2) = 30x^2 + 517$\n\nNow, notice that $1 + 3x^2$ is a perfect square. Let $1 + 3x^2 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$y^2k^2 = 30x^2 + 517$\n\nSolving $1 + 3x^2 = k^2$, we get $k^2 - 3x^2 = 1$, which is a Pell equation.
