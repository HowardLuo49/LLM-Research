    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",
