    "solution": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the possible values for $n$, we need to first figure out for which values of $n$ does $n^2 - n$ have a common factor with at least one number from $1$ to $n$.\n\nFactoring out $n(n-1)$ from $n^2 - n$ gives us $n(n-1)$.\n\nThis expression will have a common factor with at least one number from $1$ to $n$ if $n$ and $n-1$ share a common factor. Therefore, $n$ and $n-1$ must not be coprime.\n\nThe only way for $n$ and $n-1$ to have a common factor is if $n$ is not a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
