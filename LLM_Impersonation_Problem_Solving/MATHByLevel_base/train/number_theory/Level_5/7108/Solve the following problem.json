Which of the following could be the value of $S(n+1)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 12\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1265$\n",
    "solution": "Note that $n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{9}$. This can be seen from the fact that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n}10^{k}a_k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k \\pmod{9}$. Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$, then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$, and thus $n+1 \\equiv S(n+1) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$. The only answer choice that is $6 \\pmod{9}$ is $\\boxed{1239}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The sum of the digits of a number increases by $1$ every time the number increases by $9$. Since $1274$ is $1$ less than a multiple of $9$, the possible values of $S(n+1)$ are $1$ less than the possible multiples of $9$ greater than $1274$. The multiples of $9$ that are greater than $1274$ are $1278$, $1287$, $1296$, $1305$, $1314$, $\\cdots$, $1254$. Therefore, the possible values of $S(n+1)$ are $1277$, $1286$, $1295$, $1304$, $1313$.
