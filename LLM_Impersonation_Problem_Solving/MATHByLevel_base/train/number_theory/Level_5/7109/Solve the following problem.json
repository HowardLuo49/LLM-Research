How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?\n$\\textbf{(A) }110\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }191\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }261\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }325\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }425$\n",
    "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "We prime factorize $110 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 11$ and $81 = 3^4$. \n\nTherefore, the number $110n^3$ has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 = 16$ divisors.\n\nSince $110n^3$ is supposed to have $110$ divisors, we need $7$ factors of 2 and $2$ factors of 11. In order to do this, $n = 2 \\cdot 3^{6} \\cdot 11^1$.\n\nTherefore, $81n^4 = 3^4 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^{6} \\cdot 11^1)^4 = 3^4 \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 3^{24} \\cdot 11^4 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^{28} \\cdot 11^4$. \n\nThe number of positive integer divisors of $81n^4$ is $(4+1)(28+1)(4+1) = 5 \\times 29 \\times 5 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 325}$.",
