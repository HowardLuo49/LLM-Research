    "solution": "We first need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$. There are $8$ even numbers less than or equal to $16$, which contribute a power of $2^8$; of these, $4$ are divisible by $4$ and contribute an additional power of $2^4$; two are divisible by $8$ and contributes an additional power of $2^2$; and finally, one is divisible by $16$ and contributes an additional power of $2$. In total, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16!$ is equal to $2^{8+4+2+1} = 2^{15}$.\n\nChecking the ones digits of the powers of $2$, we see that the ones digit of $2^1$ is $2$, of $2^2$ is $4$, of $2^3$ is $8$, of $2^4$ is $6$, and of $2^5$ is $2$. Thus, the ones digit will repeat every $4$ exponents, and the ones digit of $2^{15} = 2^{4 \\times 3 + 3}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$, we need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$.\n\nWe know that the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is equal to the highest power of $2$ that is a factor of the product of all positive integers up to $2^4$. \n\nSince $2^4 = 16$, we need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into the product of all positive integers up to $16$.\n\nThe highest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is determined by the number of factor pairs of $2$ in the prime factorization of $(2^4)!$. To find this number, we can count the number of factors of $2$ that occurs in each multiple of $2$ up to $16$.\n\nSince the multiples of $2$ are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16$, we have $1+2+1+3+1+2+1+4 = 15$ factors of $2$.\n\nThus, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is $2^{15}$.\n\nHence, the ones digit of this power of $2$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
