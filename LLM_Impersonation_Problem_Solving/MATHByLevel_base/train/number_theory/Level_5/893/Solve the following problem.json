    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Every 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator. He changed them the first time in May. In what month will they be changed the 25th time?",
    "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out when the batteries will be changed the 25th time, we can calculate how many months 25 battery changes would equal.\n\nSince Hal changes the batteries every 5 months, we can set up an equation:\n\n5 months * number of battery changes = total number of months\n\nSolving for the total number of months:\n\n5 * 25 = 125\n\nSince Hal changed the batteries for the first time in May, we need to count 125 months from May to find out when the 25th battery change will occur. \n\n125 months is equivalent to 10 years and 5 months.\n\nTherefore, the batteries will be changed for the 25th time in October.",
