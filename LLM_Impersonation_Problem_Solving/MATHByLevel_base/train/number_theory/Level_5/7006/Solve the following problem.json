    "solution": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can rewrite the given expression as:\n\n$n^3 + 100 = (n+10)(n^2 - 10n + 100) - 900$\n\nSince $(n+10)(n^2 - 10n + 100)$ is divisible by $n+10$, we need the remainder $-900$ to also be divisible by $n+10$. This means that $n+10$ must be a factor of $900$. The largest factor of $900$ that is less than $900$ is $450$. So the largest possible value for $n$ is $450 - 10 = 440$. \n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3 + 100$ is divisible by $n+10$ is $\\boxed{440}$.",
