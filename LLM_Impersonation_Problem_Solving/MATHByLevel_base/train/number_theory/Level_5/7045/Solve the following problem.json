    "solution": "We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$. From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).",
    "gpt_response": "Let's represent $x$ as $100a + 10b + c$ and $y$ as $100c+10b+a$, where $a,b,c$ are the digits of $x$ and $y$ respectively.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are between 100 and 999, we know that $a,b,c$ are all between 1 and 9. \n\nFrom condition (2), $y$ is the number formed by reversing the digits of $x$, so $100a + 10b + c = 100c + 10b + a$. Simplifying this equation gives us $99a = 99c$, which means that $a = c$.\n\nNow let's consider the values of $z = |x-y|$. Since $a=c$, we can write $z$ as $|100a + 10b + c - (100c +10b + a)| = |99(a-c)| = |99(a-a)| = |0| = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of $z$ is 0. \n\nHence, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ distinct value of $z$ possible.",
