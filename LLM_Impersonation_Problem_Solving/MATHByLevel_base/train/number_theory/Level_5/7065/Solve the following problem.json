    "solution": "Let $K = \\sum_{i=1}^{9}{\\frac{1}{i}}$. Examining the terms in $S_1$, we see that $S_1 = K + 1$ since each digit $n$ appears once and 1 appears an extra time. Now consider writing out $S_2$. Each term of $K$ will appear 10 times in the units place and 10 times in the tens place (plus one extra 1 will appear), so $S_2 = 20K + 1$.\nIn general, we will have that\n$S_n = (n10^{n-1})K + 1$\nbecause each digit will appear $10^{n - 1}$ times in each place in the numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, 10^{n} - 1$, and there are $n$ total places.\nThe denominator of $K$ is $D = 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$. For $S_n$ to be an integer, $n10^{n-1}$ must be divisible by $D$. Since $10^{n-1}$ only contains the factors $2$ and $5$ (but will contain enough of them when $n \\geq 3$), we must choose $n$ to be divisible by $3^2\\cdot 7$. Since we're looking for the smallest such $n$, the answer is $\\boxed{63}$.",
