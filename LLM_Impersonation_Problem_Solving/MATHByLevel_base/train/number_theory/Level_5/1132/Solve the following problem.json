    "solution": "Since $15 \\mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \\mid 15n$, so $15 \\mid n$. Say $n=15a$. Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square. Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \\le 1000$ or $a \\le \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.6$. The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$).",
    "gpt_response": "Let $15n = k^2$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Since $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$ and perfect squares can only have even powers of prime factors, the prime factorization of $k$ must be of the form $k = 3^a \\cdot 5^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers.\n\nSubstitute $k = 3^a \\cdot 5^b$ into $15n = k^2$ to get $15n = 3^{2a} \\cdot 5^{2b}$.\n\nWe want to find the number of positive integers $n \\leq 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square. Let $n = 3^c \\cdot 5^d \\cdot m$, where $c$ and $d$ are non-negative integers, and $m$ is an integer not divisible by $3$ or $5$.\n\nAfter substitution and simplification, we have $3^{2a} \\cdot 5^{2b - 1} \\cdot m = 3^c \\cdot 5^d$.\n\nThis implies $2a = c$ and $2b - 1 = d$.
