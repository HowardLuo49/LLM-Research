    "solution": "This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$, which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The possible values for each $a_i$ are $-1, 0, 1$, giving us a total of $3^8=6561$ combinations. However, we need nonnegative integers, so we need to subtract the number of combinations where $a_7=-1$. There are $3^7=2187$ combinations for that case. Thus, the total number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the given form is $6561-2187=\\boxed{4374}$.",
