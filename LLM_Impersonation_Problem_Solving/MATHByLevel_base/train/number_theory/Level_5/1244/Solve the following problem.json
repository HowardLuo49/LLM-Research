    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "In order for the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ to terminate, $475$ must be divisible by all of the prime factors of $n$. We prime factorize $475$ as $5^2 \\times 19$. \n\nThus, for the integer values of $n$ to have a terminating decimal representation, $n$ must be of the form $5^a \\times 19^b$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 2$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 1$. There are $3$ choices for $a$ and $2$ choices for $b$, so there are a total of $3 \\times 2 = \\boxed{6}$ integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive such that the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates.",
