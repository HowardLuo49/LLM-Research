    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. You are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$. Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\n",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $Q = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots 61$. Then, each term of the sequence will leave a different remainder upon division by $Q$, since all terms have distinct second parts. \nOnce we have $Q$ consecutive values, the sequence will start repeating since there are only $Q$ possible remainders upon division by $Q$ for each term of the sequence. \nWe must find the least positive $k$ such that $58$ is $k$ greater than a multiple of $Q$ since $2 + 58$ is the first term in the sequence. \nObviously, testing $k = 1, 2, \\dots$ is impractical, so we must search for a smarter method. Since $Q = 2q \\neq 60$, it follows that we are looking for the least positive $k$ such that $2 + 58 \\equiv k \\pmod{61}$ (note that this is equivalent to $2k \\equiv 58 \\pmod{Q}$). \nIt is easy to get that this occurs when $k = 29$, since $2 \\cdot 29 \\equiv 58 \\pmod{61}$. \nAs a result, the answer is $Q - 1 = \\boxed{(D) \\text{ } 57}$.",
