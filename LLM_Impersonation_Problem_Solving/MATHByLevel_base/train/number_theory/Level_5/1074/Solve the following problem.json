    "solution": "Note that $60$ is divisible by $3$, but $20$ is not divisible by $3$. Therefore, if $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$, then $\\nu$ must be divisible by 3 and we may write $\\nu=3n$ (where $n$ is a positive integer).\n\nThus we have $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]=60$, and since the $3n$ contributes the factor of $3$ to $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]$, it follows that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,20]=\\frac{60}{3}=20$. This is true if and only if $n$ is a divisor of $20$. Therefore, the possible values of $\\nu$ are $3$ times the positive divisors of $20$: $$\\nu = 3,6,12,15,30,\\,\\text{or}\\,60.$$The sum of these values is $\\boxed{126}$.",

Therefore, we have $\\frac{20\\nu}{\\gcd(\\nu,20)}=60$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\gcd(\\nu,20)$, we get $20\\nu = 60\\gcd(\\nu,20)$ or $\\nu = 3\\gcd(\\nu,20)$.\n\nLet $\\gcd(\\nu,20) = d$.

Since $d$ must divide 20, the possible values for $d$ are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, or 20.\n\nSubstitute these values for $d$ back into $\\nu = 3d$ to find the corresponding values for $\\nu$:\n\nIf $d = 1$, then $\\nu = 3$.\nIf $d = 2$, then $\\nu = 6$.\nIf $d = 4$, then $\\nu = 12$.\nIf $d = 5$, then $\\nu = 15$.\nIf $d = 10$, then $\\nu = 30$.\nIf $d = 20$, then $\\nu = 60$.\n\nThe sum of all positive integers $\\nu$ for which $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$ is $3 + 6 + 12 + 15 + 30 + 60 = \\boxed{126}$.",
