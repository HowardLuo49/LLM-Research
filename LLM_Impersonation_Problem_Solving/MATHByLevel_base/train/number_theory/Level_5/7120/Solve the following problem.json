    "solution": "Rewrite the expression as\\[4(5x + 1)(5x + 3)(5x+5)\\]Since $x$ is odd, let $x = 2n-1$. The expression becomes\\[4(10n-4)(10n-2)(10n)=32(5n-2)(5n-1)(5n)\\]Consider just the product of the last three terms, $5n-2,5n-1,5n$, which are consecutive. At least one term must be divisible by $2$ and one term must be divisible by $3$ then. Also, since there is the $5n$ term, the expression must be divisible by $5$. Therefore, the minimum integer that always divides the expression must be $32 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{960}$.\nTo prove that the number is the largest integer to work, consider when $x=1$ and $x = 5$. These respectively evaluate to be $1920,\\ 87360$; their greatest common factor is indeed $960$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $x$ is an odd number, we can write $x$ as $2n+1$ for some integer $n$. Substituting in $x=2n+1$ into the given expression, we have\\[(10(2n+1)+2)(10(2n+1)+6)(5(2n+1)+5)=(20n+12)(20n+16)(10n+6).\\]Now, we can factor out a $4$ from the first two terms and a $2$ from the last term to get\\[(4(5n+3))(4(5n+4))(2(5n+3)).\\]Notice that the expression $5n+3$ and $5n+4$ are consecutive integers, meaning one of them is always even and the other is always odd. Thus, at least one of $(5n+3)$ or $(5n+4)$ is divisible by $2$.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that always divides the expression is $\\boxed{8}$, since we can factor out a $4$ from two of the terms and a $2$ from the third term.",
