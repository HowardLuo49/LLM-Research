    "solution": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the integer in question. We can express $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ as a decimal by long division. We start by dividing $n$ by $n+1$:\n\n$n = k(n+1) + r$\n\nwhere $k$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder. Since $0 \\le r \\le n$, $k$ must be an integer between 0 and $n-1$ inclusive.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{n}{n+1} = \\frac{k(n+1)+r}{n+1} = k + \\frac{r}{n+1}$. Since $0 \\le r \\le n$, the repeating part of the decimal must be less than $1$. This means that $\\frac{r}{n+1} < 1 \\Rightarrow r < n+1$. Each integer $r$ from 0 to $n$ corresponds to a different repeating decimal. So, there are $n+1$ integers $r$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal for a total of $\\boxed{101}$ integers $n$ between $1$ and $100$.",
