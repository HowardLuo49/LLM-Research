    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $f(n) = n+1$. If $n+1$ is prime, then $n$ must be even. Therefore, the only prime value of $n$ for which $n+1$ is prime is $n = 2$. If $n = p^a$ for some prime $p$ and an integer $a > 1$, then $f(n) = \\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}$. This value is not guaranteed to be composite, so we must check all powers of primes. Checking powers of $2$ first, $f(4) = 7$, $f(8) = 15$, and $f(16) = 31$. Two of these powers of 2 work. Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works. Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works. Finally, if $n$ is any other composite integer, it can be written as the product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Since $n \\le 25$, $n$ cannot be the product of three distinct primes, so $n = p^aq^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$. As a result, $f(n) = \\left(\\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{q^{b+1}-1}{q-1}\\right)$, but then $f(n)$ is the product of two integers which are greater than $1$, so $f(n)$ is composite. Therefore, there are $2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{5}$ values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ is prime.",
    "gpt_response": "We can break this problem down into cases based on the value of $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is a prime number\nIf $n$ is a prime number, then $f(n) = 1 + n$, since the divisors of a prime number are 1 and the number itself. If $f(n)$ is to be prime, then $1+n$ must be prime. The only prime numbers less than or equal to 25 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. Among these, 2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23 can be expressed as $1 + n$ for some $n$ between 1 and 25.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not a prime number\nIf $n$ is not a prime number, then $f(n) = \\sum_{d|n, d>1} d$, where $d$ represents the divisors of $n$ other than 1.
