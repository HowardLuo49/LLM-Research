    "solution": "By the Chicken McNugget theorem, the least possible value of $n$ such that $91$ cents cannot be formed satisfies $5n - (5 + n) = 91 \\implies n = 24$, so $n$ must be at least $24$.\nFor a value of $n$ to work, we must not only be unable to form the value $91$, but we must also be able to form the values $92$ through $96$, as with these five values, we can form any value greater than $96$ by using additional $5$ cent stamps.\nNotice that we must form the value $96$ without forming the value $91$. If we use any $5$ cent stamps when forming $96$, we could simply remove one to get $91$. This means that we must obtain the value $96$ using only stamps of denominations $n$ and $n+1$.\nRecalling that $n \\geq 24$, we can easily figure out the working $(n,n+1)$ pairs that can used to obtain $96$, as we can use at most $\\frac{96}{24}=4$ stamps without going over. The potential sets are $(24, 25), (31, 32), (32, 33), (47, 48), (48, 49), (95, 96)$, and $(96, 97)$.\nThe last two obviously do not work, since they are too large to form the values $92$ through $94$, and by a little testing, only $(24, 25)$ and $(47, 48)$ can form the necessary values, so $n \\in \\{24, 47\\}$. $24 + 47 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $S$ denote the set of all possible amounts of postage that can be formed using stamps of denominations $5$, $n$, and $n+1$ cents. We are looking for the largest integer $N$ such that $N \\in S$ and $N+1 \\in S$.\n\nIt is clear that $0,1,2,3,4$ are all in $S$, since they can be formed with combinations of $n$ and $n+1$ stamps. Additionally, all numbers from $5$ to $n-1$ are in $S$ as well, since they can be formed with combinations of $n$ and $5$ stamps. \n\nNow, if $n$ were in $S$, then $n+1$ would be in $S$ as well, since it can be formed by using one $n$ stamp and some $5$ stamps. Therefore, the largest integer that cannot be formed using $n$ and $n+1$ stamps is $n-1$. \n\nSince $91$ is the greatest number that cannot be formed using $n$ and $n+1$ stamps, we must have $n-1 = 90$ or $n = 91$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy the conditions is $\\boxed{91}$.",
