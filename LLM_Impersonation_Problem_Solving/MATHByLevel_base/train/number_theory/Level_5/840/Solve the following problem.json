    "solution": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order for $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ to be defined, $n$ must be relatively prime to $1050$. So we are looking for the smallest integer greater than $1$ that is relatively prime to $1050$.\n\n$1050 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$.\n\nThe smallest integer greater than $1$ that is relatively prime to $1050$ is $11$, as it is not divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $n$ such that $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ is defined is $n=\\boxed{11}$.",
