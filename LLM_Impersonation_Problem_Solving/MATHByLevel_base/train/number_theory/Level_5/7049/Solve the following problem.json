    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first consider the possible digits that can be used to form $N$. Since $N$ must be the greatest integer multiple of 8 with no repeating digits, the largest digit possible for each place value must be used. This means we must use the digits 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in descending order.\n\nWe want to form a number such that it is divisible by 8, which means that the last three digits must form a multiple of 8. Checking the possible combinations of the last three digits from the given digits, we see that 936 is the largest multiple of 8 we can form with those digits.\n\nTherefore, the greatest integer multiple of 8 with no repeating digits is 98736.\n\nTo find the remainder when 98736 is divided by 1000, we can calculate $98736 \\equiv 736 \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{736}$.",
