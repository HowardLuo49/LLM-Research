    "solution": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Since $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors, it must be of the form $n=p^{10}$ where $p$ is a prime number. \n\nThus, $8n^3 = 8p^{30}$. To find the number of positive divisors of $8p^{30}$, we first factor $8$ and $30$ as $8=2^3$ and $30=2\\times 3\\times 5$. \n\nSo, $8p^{30} = 2^3\\cdot p^{30}$. \n\nThe number of positive divisors of $8p^{30}$ is then $(3+1)(30+1) = 4\\cdot 31 = \\boxed{124}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 124?: Since $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors, it must be of the form $n=p^{10}$ where $p$ is a prime number. \n\nThus, $8n^3 = 8p^{30}$.
