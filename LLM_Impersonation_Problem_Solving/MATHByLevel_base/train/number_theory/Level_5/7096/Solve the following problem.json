    "solution": "Every 20-pretty integer can be written in form $n = 2^a 5^b k$, where $a \\ge 2$, $b \\ge 1$, $\\gcd(k,10) = 1$, and $d(n) = 20$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Thus, we have $20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k)$, using the fact that the divisor function is multiplicative. As $(a+1)(b+1)$ must be a divisor of 20, there are not many cases to check.\nIf $a+1 = 4$, then $b+1 = 5$. But this leads to no solutions, as $(a,b) = (3,4)$ gives $2^3 5^4 > 2019$.\nIf $a+1 = 5$, then $b+1 = 2$ or $4$. The first case gives $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime other than 2 or 5. Thus we have $80p < 2019 \\implies p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$. The sum of all such $n$ is $80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) = 7440$. In the second case $b+1 = 4$ and $d(k) = 1$, and there is one solution $n = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3 = 2000$.\nIf $a+1 = 10$, then $b+1 = 2$, but this gives $2^9 \\cdot 5^1 > 2019$. No other values for $a+1$ work.\nThen we have $\\frac{S}{20} = \\frac{80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) + 2000}{20} = 372 + 100 = \\boxed{472}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a $20$-pretty number. Notice that if $n$ is divisible by $20$, then $n$ is divisible by $4$. Hence, $n$ must have exactly $20$ positive divisors, which implies that $n$ is in the form $p_{1}^{3}p_{2}^{7}$, where $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are distinct prime numbers. Also, $7+1=8$ divides $20$, so $8|n$ as well. Therefore, $n=p_{1}^{3}p_{2}^{7}$ must be divisible by $8$\n\\begin{align*} v_{2}(n) &\\geq 3 \\\\ v_{2}(p_{1})\\cdot 3 + v_{2}(p_{2})\\cdot 7 &\\geq 3 \\\\ v_{2}(p_{2})\\cdot 7 &\\geq 3. \\end{align*}\nHence, $v_{2}(p_{2})=1, 2$.
