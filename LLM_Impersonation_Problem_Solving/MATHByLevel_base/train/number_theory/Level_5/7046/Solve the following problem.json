    "solution": "$\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.\nSince $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 15 \\pmod{16}$.\nIf $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k$. If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$. If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.\nThus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\\pmod{3}$.\nIt is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$. So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 24, 12 \\pmod{25}$.\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \\equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \\pmod{400}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\\boxed{112}$.",

Therefore, either $k$, $k+1$, or $2k+1$ must be a multiple of $6$.\n\n1. If $k$ is a multiple of $6$, then $k = 6m$ for some positive integer $m$. Substituting into the equation gives $6m(6m+1)(12m+1) = 1200n$. Simplifying gives $72m(72m+1) = 200n$. Since $72m$ is already divisible by $4$, we need to check when $72m+1$ is divisible by $5$. The smallest such $m$ is when $m = 4$, so $k = 24$ is a solution.\n\n2. If $k+1$ is a multiple of $6$, then $k = 6m - 1$. Substituting gives $(6m-1)(6m)(12m-1) = 1200n$, which simplifies to $72m(72m-1) = 200n$. The smallest $m$ that works is $5$, so $k = 29$ is a solution.\n\n3. If $2k+1$ is a multiple of $6$, then $k = 3m$ for some positive integer $m$. Substituting gives $3m(3m+1)(6m+1) = 1200n$, which simplifies to $9m(9m+1) = 200n$. The smallest $m$ that works is $5$, so $k = 15$ is a solution.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
