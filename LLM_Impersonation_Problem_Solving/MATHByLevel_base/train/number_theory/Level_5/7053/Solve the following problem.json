When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
    "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.",

Then the total number of cubes used in the block is $abc$, and the number of cubes visible is $(a-2)(b-2)c$. Since $231$ cubes are invisible, we have\n$$abc - (a-2)(b-2)c = 231$$\n$$2(ab+bc+ca) - 4(a+b+c) = 231$$\n$$2(a+b)(b+c) + 2a(c-b) - 4a - 4b = 231$$\n$$(2a+2c-4)(b+1) - 4(a+b) = 231$$\nSince $b\\geq c$, we want to minimize $abc = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = (a+1)(b+1)(ab/4 + 1)$.
