Each of the remaining nine crates is placed, in turn, flat on top of the previous crate, and the orientation of each crate is chosen at random. Let $\\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that the stack of crates is exactly $41\\mathrm{ft}$ tall, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m$.\n",
    "solution": "Only the heights matter, and each crate is either 3, 4, or 6 feet tall with equal probability. We have the following:\n\\begin{align*}3a + 4b + 6c &= 41\\\\ a + b + c &= 10\\end{align*}\nSubtracting 3 times the second from the first gives $b + 3c = 11$, or $(b,c) = (2,3),(5,2),(8,1),(11,0)$. The last doesn't work, obviously. This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$. In terms of choosing which goes where, the first two solutions are analogous.\nFor $(5,2,3),(3,5,2)$, we see that there are $2\\cdot\\dfrac{10!}{5!2!3!} = 10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7$ ways to stack the crates. For $(1,8,1)$, there are $2\\dbinom{10}{2} = 90$. Also, there are $3^{10}$ total ways to stack the crates to any height.\nThus, our probability is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 90}{3^{10}} = \\dfrac{10\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 10}{3^{8}} = \\dfrac{570}{3^8} = \\dfrac{190}{3^{7}}$. Our answer is the numerator, $\\boxed{190}$.",
