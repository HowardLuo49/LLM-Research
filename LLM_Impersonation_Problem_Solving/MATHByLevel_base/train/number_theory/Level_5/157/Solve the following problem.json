    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",
    "gpt_response": "A perfect square factor of a number is a number that can be squared to get that number. \n\nIn order for a factor to be an even perfect square, it must be the square of an even number. \n\nThe prime factorization of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ is $2^4\\cdot7^9$. To find all the factors of this number, we need to consider each power of $2$ and $7$ separately.\n\nFor the number of even perfect square factors, we only need to consider the even powers of $2$. \n\nFor $2^4$, the even powers are $2^0$, $2^2$, and $2^4$. Thus, there are $3$ even perfect square factors of $2^4$.\n\nFor $7^9$, all powers of $7$ are odd, so there are no even perfect square factors of $7^9$. \n\nMultiplying the number of even perfect square factors of $2^4$ by the number of even perfect square factors of $7^9$, we get $3 \\times 1 =\\boxed{3}$. \n\nTherefore, the number of even perfect square factors that $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ has is $3$.",
