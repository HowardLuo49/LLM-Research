    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined modulo $55$ and $66$, we need to find an $a$ that is not coprime to both $55$ and $66$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $55$ and $66$ are $55 = 5 \\cdot 11$ and $66 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of $55$ and $66$ is $11$. Therefore, any number that is divisible by $11$ will not have an inverse modulo $55$ and $66$. \n\nThe smallest positive integer $a$ that is divisible by $11$ is $\\boxed{11}$.",
