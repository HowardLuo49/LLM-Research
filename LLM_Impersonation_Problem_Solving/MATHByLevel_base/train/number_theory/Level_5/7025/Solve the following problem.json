    "solution": "Let our answer be $n$. Write $n = 42a + b$, where $a, b$ are positive integers and $0 \\leq b < 42$. Then note that $b, b + 42, ... , b + 42(a-1)$ are all primes.\nIf $b$ is $0\\mod{5}$, then $b = 5$ because $5$ is the only prime divisible by $5$. We get $n = 215$ as our largest possibility in this case.\nIf $b$ is $1\\mod{5}$, then $b + 2 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 2$. Thus, $n \\leq 3 \\times 42 = 126 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $2\\mod{5}$, then $b + 4 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 4$. Thus, $n \\leq 5 \\times 42 = 210 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $3\\mod{5}$, then $b + 1 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a = 1$. Thus, $n \\leq 2 \\times 42 = 84 < 215$.\nIf $b$ is $4\\mod{5}$, then $b + 3 \\times 42$ is divisible by $5$ and thus $a \\leq 3$. Thus, $n \\leq 4 \\times 42 = 168 < 215$.\nOur answer is $\\boxed{215}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the largest positive integer that is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer. \n\nLet's first consider the case when $n$ is a composite integer. In this case, $n$ can be expressed as $n = a \\cdot b$ where $a,b > 1$. Since $n$ cannot be the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer, then both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by $42$. However, this means that $n$ itself must also be divisible by $42$, which contradicts the assumption that $n$ is a composite integer. \n\nTherefore, $n$ must be a prime number. Let $p$ be the largest prime number that is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and another positive composite integer. \n\nSince $42 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$, any number that is a multiple of $42$ is also a multiple of $2$, $3$, or $7$. \n\nIf $p$ is $2$, $3$, or $7$, then it can be expressed as the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and another composite integer. For example, $42 = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7$, so $42 + 2 = 44$, which is composite. \n\nTherefore, the largest prime number $p$ that satisfies the condition is $p = 5$. \n\nThus, the largest positive integer that is not the sum of a positive integral multiple of $42$ and a positive composite integer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
