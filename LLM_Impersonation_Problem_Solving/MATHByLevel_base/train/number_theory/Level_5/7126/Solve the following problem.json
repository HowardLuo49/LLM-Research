    "solution": "Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$. Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\cdots 5^{2003}\\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \\boxed{604}$.",

Notice that for $k\\geq 1$, the first digit of $5^k$ is $1$ if and only if the first digit of $5^{k-1}$ is $2$ or larger. This is because when we multiply by $5$, the first digit of the result will be either the same as the first digit of $5^{k-1}$ or one greater.\n\nSince $5^0 = 1$, the number of elements in $S$ that start with the digit $1$ is equal to the number of non-negative integers $k$ such that the first digit of $5^k$ is $1$. Since $5^{2004}$ starts with $5$, it follows that $5^{2005}$ will start with $2$, resulting in $2004$ integers between $0$ and $2004$ that start with $1$.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in $S$ that begin with the digit $1$ is $\\boxed{2004}$.",
