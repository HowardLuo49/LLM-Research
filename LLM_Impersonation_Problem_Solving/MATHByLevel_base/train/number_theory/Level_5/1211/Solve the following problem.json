When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",

Since the moduli 8 and 9 are relatively prime, we can find a unique solution modulo 72 (8 * 9).\n\nBy solving the system of congruences, we get x \u2261 59 (mod 72).\n\nTherefore, the possible values for x are 59, 131, 203, etc.\n\nSince the membership is between 100 and 200, the number of members in the band is 131.",
