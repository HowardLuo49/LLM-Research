    "solution": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the integer be $x$.\n\nIn base $8$, a $4$-digit integer ranges from $8^3 = 512$ to $8^4 - 1 = 4095$. Therefore, $512 \\leq x \\leq 4095$.\n\nIn base $2$, $d$ digits means that $2^{d-1} \\leq x \\leq 2^d - 1$. \n\nTo find the possible values of $d$, we will first need to find the powers of $2$ that lie within the range of $x$.\n\n$2^9 = 512 \\leq x \\leq 4095 = 2^{12} - 1$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $d$ are $10, 11,$ and $12$, and the sum of all possible values of $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
