    "solution": "By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.\nBecause the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$. Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields\\[(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.\\]Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and\\[((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.\\]Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \\dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \\dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$. Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$. These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the quadratic $f(x) = x^2 - ax + 2a$ is equal to $a$. Since the roots are integers, the possible values of $a$ are factors of $2a$.\n\nThe factors of $2a$ are $1, 2, a, 2a$. Thus, the sum of the possible values of $a$ is $1+2+a+2a = 3a + 3 = 3(a+1)$. Since $a$ is an integer, the possible values of $a$ are $0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, \\ldots$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible values of $a$ is $0+2+4+6+8+10+12+14+16 = \\boxed{70}$.\n\nAlternatively, we observe that since $a$ must be a sum of the roots, and we are looking for a sum, the options presented to us are significantly small, thus it could be easier to list out possible values of $a$.",
