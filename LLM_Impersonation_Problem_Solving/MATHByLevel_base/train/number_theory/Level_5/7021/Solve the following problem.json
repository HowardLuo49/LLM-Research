    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the number of zeroes at the end of the decimal representation of a factorial $m!$ is determined by the number of factors of $5$ in the prime factorization of $m!$. Since there are more factors of $2$ than factors of $5$ in $m!$, we only need to count the number of factors of $5$.\n\nThe largest power of $5$ less than $1992$ is $5^4 = 625$. Thus, all factorials $m!$ where $m \\geq 625$ will have at least $4$ zeroes at the end. This means that all integers $m \\geq 625$ are factorial tails.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails. This is equivalent to finding the complement of the set of factorial tails less than $1992$.\n\nTo find the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are factorial tails, we need to count the multiples of $5$, $25$, $125$, and $625$ less than $1992$.\n\nMultiples of $5$: There are $398$ multiples of $5$ less than $1992$.\nMultiples of $25$: There are $79$ multiples of $25$ less than $1992$.\nMultiples of $125$: There are $15$ multiples of $125$ less than $1992$.\nMultiples of $625$: There are $3$ multiples of $625$ less than $1992$.\n\nAdding these up, we get $398+79+15+3 = 495$. So, there are $495$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are factorial tails.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails is $1992 - 495 = \\boxed{1497}$.",
