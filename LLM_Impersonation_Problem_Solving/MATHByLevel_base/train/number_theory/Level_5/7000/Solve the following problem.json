    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we notice that $a_n=6^{n}+8^{n}$ can be written as $a_n=(2^{n}3^{n})+(2^{3n})$. \n\nWe want to find the remainder when $a_{83}$ is divided by $49$. This is equivalent to finding the remainder when $a_{83}$ is divided by $7\\cdot 7$. \n\nSince $2^{3}\\equiv 1\\pmod{7}$, we have $8^{27}\\equiv 1^{27} \\equiv 1\\pmod{7}$. \n\nTherefore, $a_{83}=(2^{83}3^{83})+(2^{3\\cdot 83})\\equiv (2^{6}3^{6})+(2^{3})\\pmod{49}$\n\nNow, since $2^{6}\\equiv 1\\pmod{7}$ and $3^{6}\\equiv 1\\pmod{7}$, we have $a_{83}\\equiv 1+2\\equiv 3\\pmod{49}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder upon dividing $a_{83}$ by $49$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
