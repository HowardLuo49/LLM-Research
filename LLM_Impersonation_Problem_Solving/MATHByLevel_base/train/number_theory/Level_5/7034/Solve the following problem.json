    "solution": "It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.\n$6^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12}$\nThe LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\\max(24,a)}3^{\\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \\le a \\le 24$, there are $\\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.",
    "gpt_response": "We begin by finding the prime factorizations of $6^6$ and $8^8$:\n\n$6^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n\nThe least common multiple of $6^6$ and $8^8$ will be the highest power of each prime that appears in either of their prime factorizations. Therefore, the least common multiple will be $2^{24} \\cdot 3^6 = 12^{12}$.\n\nThus, $k$ can be any positive integer whose prime factorization does not contain any primes other than 2 and 3. This means $k$ can be expressed as $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ for some nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nTherefore, there are an infinite number of values for $k$.",
