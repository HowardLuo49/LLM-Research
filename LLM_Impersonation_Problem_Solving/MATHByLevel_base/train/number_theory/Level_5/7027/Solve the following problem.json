    "solution": "We know that $n^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$ must have $(62+1)\\times (38+1)$ factors by its prime factorization. If we group all of these factors (excluding $n$) into pairs that multiply to $n^2$, then one factor per pair is less than $n$, and so there are $\\frac{63\\times 39-1}{2} = 1228$ factors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$. There are $32\\times20-1 = 639$ factors of $n$, which clearly are less than $n$, but are still factors of $n$. Therefore, using complementary counting, there are $1228-639=\\boxed{589}$ factors of $n^2$ that do not divide $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the prime factorization of $n^2$ is $2^{62}3^{38}$. \n\nLet $d$ be a positive integer divisor of $n^2$ such that $d<n$ and $d$ does not divide $n$. \n\nSince $d$ is a divisor of $n^2$, we can express $d$ in the form $2^a3^b$ where $0\\le a \\le 62$ and $0\\le b \\le 38$. \n\nSince $d$ does not divide $n$, $d$ must contain at least one factor of $2$ and one factor of $3$. \n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integer divisors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$ is $(1+1+1)(1+1+1)-1=26$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{26}$ positive integer divisors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$.",
