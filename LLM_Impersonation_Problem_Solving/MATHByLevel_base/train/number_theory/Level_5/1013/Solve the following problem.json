    "solution": "The sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is the sum of the digits of the integer $\\frac{10^n}{5^{{}^n}} = 2^n$, since multiplying by $10^n$ simply shifts all the digits $n$ places to the left. As a result, we start computing powers of 2, looking for an integer which has digits summing to a number greater than 10. \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n2^3 &= 8 \\\\\n2^4 &= 16 \\\\\n2^5 &= 32 \\\\\n2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n2^7 &= 128\n\\end{align*}The sum of the digits in 128 is 11. The smallest positive integer $n$ such that the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is greater than 10 is $n = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^n}$ to the right of the decimal point, we first need to find the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{5^n}$. \n\nSince $\\frac{1}{5^n} = 5^{-n}$, we know that $5^{-n}$ will have a decimal representation that repeats after $n$ digits. \n\nFor example, if $n = 4$, then $\\frac{1}{5^4} = 0.0016$. We can see that the decimal representation will begin with 0.00 and then repeat 16.\n\nThus, if $n = 4$ the sum of the digits is $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\nContinuing to check for $n=5,6,7$, we find that $n=7$ is the smallest positive integer such that $f(n)>10$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
