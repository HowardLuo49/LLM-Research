    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ occurs when the two numbers are as close to each other as possible. In this case, we want the two numbers to be as close to $\\frac{1001}{2} = 500.5$ as possible.\n\nSince the numbers must be positive integers, the two numbers that are closest to 500.5 are 500 and 501. Their sum is indeed 1001.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{1}$ because 500 and 501 are coprime.",
