    "solution": "Let us iterate over larger and larger positive integers for $k$. If $k=1$, then $p^2-k = p^2-1 = (p+1)(p-1)$. Since $p$ is odd, both $p+1$ and $p-1$ are even, so therefore $p^2-1$ is divisible by 4. Also, since $p$ is not divisible by 3, then $p$ must either be one greater or two greater than a multiple of 3, which means that $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3, respectively. As a result, $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 4, so it is divisible by 12. Therefore, we have $\\boxed{k = 1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N = 10^{2010} - 1$. Then $N$ is the largest integer with 2010 digits, and it is divisible by 3, 4, and 9. Therefore, $N$ is divisible by 3, 4, 9, and 12, which means that $N$ is divisible by 36.\n\nLet $p$ be the largest prime with 2010 digits, and let $q$ be the next largest prime with 2010 digits. Then $p$ is odd, so $p^2$ is 1 modulo 4, and $p^2$ is also 1 modulo 3. Since $p^2$ is 1 modulo 3 and 4, it is 1 modulo 12. Therefore, $q = p + 2$ is divisible by 12, and $q = p + 2 = N + 1$ is divisible by 36. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12 is $k = p^2 - N = N + 1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
