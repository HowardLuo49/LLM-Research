    "solution": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We consider the prime factorizations of 18 and 640, which are $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$ and $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$. \n\nSince $n^2$ is divisible by 18, then $n$ must contain at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3. \nSince $n^3$ is divisible by 640, then $n$ must contain at least two factors of 2 and one factor of 5.\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies these conditions is $n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n^2$ is divisible by 18 and $n^3$ is divisible by 640 is $\\boxed{60}$.",
