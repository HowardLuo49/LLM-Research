    "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the prime factorization of $n$. Since $n = a^b$ and $b$ is odd, all the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ must be odd. This means that for a prime $p$ such that $p^k$ divides $n$, $k$ must be odd. So, $n$ is oddly powerful if and only if the exponent of each prime in the prime factorization of $n$ is odd.\n\nGiven that $2010 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 67$, we need to find the number of oddly powerful integers that can be made using the primes $2$, $3$, $5$, and $67$. For each prime, we have two choices for the exponent - either keep it odd or make it even by multiplying by another factor of the prime. Thus, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible combinations of the exponents for these primes, but we cannot use the combination with all exponents equal to $1$ (which gives us $1$ as the number). Therefore, there are $16 - 1 = 15$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$. \n\nHence, there are $\\boxed{15}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
