    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminate?",
    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $\\frac{n}{350}$ can be written as $\\frac{n}{2}\\times\\frac{n}{5}\\times\\frac{1}{7}$, in order for the decimal representation to terminate, only the prime factors of the denominator of $\\frac{n}{350}$ can be present in the denominator. Since $350=2\\times5^2\\times7$, $n$ can only include factors of 2, 5, and 7 in order for the decimal representation to terminate. \n\nThere are 2 choices for the factor of 2 ($2^0$ and $2^1$), 3 choices for the factor of 5 ($5^0$, $5^1$, and $5^2$), and 2 choices for the factor of 7 ($7^0$ and $7^1$). Therefore, there are $2\\times3\\times2=\\boxed{12}$ integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive that have terminating decimal representations.",
