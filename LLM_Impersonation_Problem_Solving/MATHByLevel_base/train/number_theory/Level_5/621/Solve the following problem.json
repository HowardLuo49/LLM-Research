    "solution": "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to maximize the number of factors of $b^n$, we want to make $b^n$ a perfect power, meaning that $n$ is a multiple of the largest possible power of a prime number. Since $b$ and $n$ are both less than or equal to 15, the largest possible power of a prime number less than 15 is $11^2 = 121$. Thus, the largest possible value of $b^n$ is $121^{15} = 11^{30}$.\n\nThe number of factors of a number $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}...p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)...(e_k+1)$. Since $11^{30}$ has only one prime factor, the number of factors it can have is $30 + 1 = 31$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of positive factors $b^n$ can have is $\\boxed{31}$.",
