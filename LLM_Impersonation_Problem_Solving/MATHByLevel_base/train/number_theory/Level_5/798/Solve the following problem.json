    "solution": "We use the property that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\n$333 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$, therefore $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333} \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $3^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, we get that $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333}=3^{5 \\cdot 66 +3}=(3^5)^{66} \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv 1^{66} \\cdot 27 \\equiv \\boxed{5} \\pmod{11}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can use Fermat's Little Theorem to solve this problem. \n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nSince $11$ is prime and $333$ is not divisible by $11$, we have:\n$$333^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$$\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$. Notice that $333^{333} = (333^{10})^{33} \\cdot 333^3$. \n\nSince $333^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, we have:\n$$333^{333} \\equiv (1)^{33} \\cdot 333^3 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $333^{333}$ is divided by $11$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
