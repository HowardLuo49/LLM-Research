    "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can rewrite the sum as a geometric series with first term $1$ and common ratio $7$. The sum of a geometric series is given by $\\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms. \n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $r = 7$, and $n = 2005$. So the sum is $\\frac{1(1-7^{2005})}{1-7} = \\frac{1-7^{2005}}{-6}$.\n\nTo find the remainder when dividing by $1000$, we need to find the value modulo $1000$. By Euler's totient theorem, $7^{400} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$. Therefore, $7^{2005} \\equiv 7^5 \\equiv 343 \\pmod{1000}$.\n\nSo the sum is $\\frac{1-343}{-6} = \\frac{-342}{-6} = 57$.\n\nThus, the remainder when $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{57}$.",
