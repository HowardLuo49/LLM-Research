If a number is chosen at random from $S,$ the probability that it is divisible by $9$ is $p/q,$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.$\n",
    "solution": "A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \\neq k$ nonnegative integers. Thus, the set $S$ is equal to the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n = 2^j + 2^k \\,\\mathrm{ and }\\, 0 \\leq j < k \\leq 39\\}$. (The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \\neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.\nNow, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \\equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \\equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \\equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\nIt's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like. If one is of the form $6n$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 3$ (7 choices). If one is of the form $6n + 1$ (7 choices) the other must be of the form $6n + 4$ (6 choices). And if one is of the form $6n + 2$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 5$ (6 choices). This means that there are $7\\cdot 7 + 7\\cdot 6 + 7\\cdot 6 = 49 + 42 +42 = 133$ total \"good\" numbers.\nThe probability is $\\frac{133}{780}$, and the answer is $133 + 780 = \\boxed{913}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of digits in $2^{40}$ as $D = 40$. We wish to now find the number of cases where a number in set $S$ is divisible by $9$.\nRecall that the divisibility rule for $9$ is that the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$. Here, since we have exactly two $1$s, this either means that the two $1$s both must be in some place where the place contains a power of $2$ $n$ away from $2^D$, or in two places spaced $2$ apart such that the distance between the two $1$s is divisible by $3$.\n\nCase 1: The two $1$s are both in a place where the power of two is a multiple of $9$ and it is away from $2^{40}$. We need to be careful here because if they are a power of $2$ away, we can potentially go over the $D$ bound we have set. Thus, we need to account for this. For the first $1$, it could go from $2^0, 2^3, ....2^{36}, 2^{39}$, but since we can't go over $40$ digits for the maximum, it can only go up to $2^{39}$. However, the second $1$ can only go at most $2^n$ such that $0 < n < 39$.\nThis means that there are $\\dbinom{39}{1} \\dbinom{38}{1}$ ways to place the $1$s in this form. Now, we calculate the probability.\n\nFor $1$, it has $39$ available slots to place, there are $D-1 = 39$ available slots left, $2$ choices for the $1$ and $38$ slots left for the next one, so the probability is $\\frac{39 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 38}{2^{40}} = \\frac{39 \\cdot 19}{2^{38}}$.\n\nCase 2: They are a distance of $2$ apart and the distance is divisible by $3$. This time, the first $1$ could go from $2^0, 2^1, .... 2^{37}, 2^{38}$ and the second $1$ could potentially go $2^{2}, 2^{5}, .... 2^{38}$.
