    "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.",
