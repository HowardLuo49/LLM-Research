Fermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\n\nSince 7 is a prime number, we have $9^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTherefore, $9^{1995} \\equiv 9^{6 \\cdot 332 + 3} \\equiv (9^6)^{332} \\cdot 9^3 \\equiv 1^{332} \\cdot 729 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nSo, the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{2}$.",
