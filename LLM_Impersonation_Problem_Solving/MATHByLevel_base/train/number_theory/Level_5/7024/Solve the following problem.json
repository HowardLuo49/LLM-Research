    "solution": "Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\\ge 10$ or $c+g\\ge 10$ or $b+f\\ge 10$. 6. Consider $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. $1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.\nWith $c \\in \\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$, there obviously must be a carry. Consider $c = 9$. $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ have no carry. This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions. Considering $b = 9$, $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\\}$ have no carry. Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\\boxed{156}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine when carrying is required when adding two integers, we need to look at the column where the sum of the digits exceeds 9. \n\nFor this problem, we are looking at consecutive integers, so the units digit will be consecutive, and the tens digit will be consecutive since we are adding consecutive integers. \n\nWhen the units digits are consecutive, such as in the pairs (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), ..., (8,9) no carrying is required. \n\nWhen the units digit is 9, carrying is required for all cases except when the tens digit is 1. In this case, the sum will be in the form 19, 29, ..., 99, which requires carrying. \n\nThus, the only pair of consecutive integers in the given set that does not require carrying is (1999,2000).
