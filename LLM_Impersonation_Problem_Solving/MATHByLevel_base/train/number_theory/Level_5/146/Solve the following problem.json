    "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.",

To find the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence, we can continue following this pattern.\n\nSince the 50th term will have a 1 in the tens place, we know it must be in the form $1a3$ where $a$ is a digit from 0 to 9. The 50th term will be the 40th term in this form (since there are 10 terms for each tens unit).\n\nSo, the 40th term in the form $1a3$ is $193$, making the 50th term $\\boxed{193}$.",
