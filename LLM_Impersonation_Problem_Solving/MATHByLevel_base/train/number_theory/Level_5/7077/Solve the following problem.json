In other words,\n$2008 = 2 \\cdot 3^{6} + 2 \\cdot 3^{5} + 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 1 \\cdot 3^0$\nIn order to rewrite as a sum of perfect powers of $3$, we can use the fact that $2 \\cdot 3^k = 3^{k+1} - 3^k$:\n$2008 = (3^7 - 3^6) + (3^6-3^5) + (3^4 - 3^3) + 3^2 + 3^0 = 3^7 - 3^5 + 3^4 - 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^0$\nThe answer is $7+5+4+3+2+0 = \\boxed{21}$.\nNote: Solution by bounding is also possible, namely using the fact that $1+3+3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{n} = \\displaystyle\\frac{3^{n+1}-1}{2}.$",

Now, notice that in base $3$, we can represent positive integers $1$ and $2$ as $1$ and $-1$ respectively.\n\nThus, we can rewrite $2008$ in base $3$ as $-3^6 + 3^5 + 3^4 + 3^3 - 3^2 + 3^0$. So, $n_1 = 6$, $n_2 = 5$, $n_3 = 4$, $n_4 = 3$, and $n_5 = 1$. \n\nTherefore, $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 1 = \\boxed{19}$.",
