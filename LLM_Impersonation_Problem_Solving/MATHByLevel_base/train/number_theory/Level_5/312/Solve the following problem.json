    "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.",
    "gpt_response": "The smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square is $20^2 = 400$.\n\nThe smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube is $20^3 = 8000$.\n\nNow, we need to find all the multiples of 20 between 400 and 8000.\n\nDividing 400 by 20, we have 400 \u00f7 20 = 20. So, 400 is the 20th multiple of 20.\n\nDividing 8000 by 20, we have 8000 \u00f7 20 = 400. So, 8000 is the 400th multiple of 20.\n\nSo, the list includes all the integers from the 20th multiple of 20 to the 400th multiple of 20.\n\nTo find how many integers are in this list, we subtract the multiples before the starting point and add 1, so 400 - 20 + 1 = 381.\n\nTherefore, there are 381 integers in Cameron's list.",
