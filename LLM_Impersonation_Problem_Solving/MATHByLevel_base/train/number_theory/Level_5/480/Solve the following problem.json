    "solution": "If $n$ is prime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. The primes less than or equal to $50$ are $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.$$There are $15$ of these primes. Also, if $n$ is the square of a prime, then $g(n) = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n$ cannot divide $g(n)$. By looking at the list of primes we already generated, we see that there are four perfect squares of primes less than $50$. If $n$ is any other composite integer, then it can be decomposed into the product of integers $a$ and $b$ with both integers greater than $1$. We have that $ab$ divides $g(n)$ (since $g(n)$ is the product of a collection of integers including $a$ and $b$). Since $ab=n$, this implies that $n$ divides $g(n)$. As a result, there are $15 + 4 = \\boxed{19}$ values of $n$ for which $n$ does not divide $g(n)$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $g(n)$ is equal to the product of all the proper divisors of $n$. If $n$ does not divide $g(n)$, it means that $n$ is not a divisor of $g(n)$. This can only happen if $n$ is not a factor of $g(n)$. \n\nLet's consider the prime factorization of $n$. If $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct primes and $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_k$ are positive integers, then the prime factorization of $g(n)$ will contain all the prime factors of $n$ and possibly some of their powers.\n\nFor example, if $n = 24 = 2^3 \\cdot 3$, then the proper divisors of $24$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8$.
