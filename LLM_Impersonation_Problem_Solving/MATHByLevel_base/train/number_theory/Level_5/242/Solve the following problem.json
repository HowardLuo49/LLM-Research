    "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can start by simplifying the congruence:\n\\[3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\]\n\\[18x+3\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\]\n\\[18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p\\]\nThis means that $18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ has no solution when $p$ is a prime number. \n\nWe know that $\\gcd(18,p)=1$ for all prime numbers $p$. Since $18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ has no solution, it means that $18$ does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo $p$.\n\nThis implies that $18$ is not relatively prime to $p$ for the prime numbers $p$ we are considering. Thus, we need to find all prime numbers $p$ such that $\\gcd(18,p)\\neq 1$.\n\nSince $18=2\\cdot 3^2$, the only prime factor of $18$ is $3$. Therefore, the prime numbers $p$ such that $\\gcd(18,p)\\neq 1$ are those that are divisible by $3$. The sum of all prime numbers that are divisible by $3$ is $3$ (since $3$ is the only such prime number).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
