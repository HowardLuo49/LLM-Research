    "solution": "Let the desired number be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 4\\pmod 5,\\\\\na\\equiv 6\\pmod 7.\n\\end{align*} The first congruence means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=4+5n$. Substituting this into the second congruence yields \\[4+5n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $6$. Then $n\\ge 6\\implies a=4+5n\\ge 34$. $\\boxed{34}$ is the smallest solution since it is a lower bound of $a$ and satisfies both original congruences.",
