    "solution": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the product $1734 \\times 5389 \\times 80,607$ is divided by 10, we can multiply the last digit of each number together:\n\n$4 \\times 9 \\times 7 = 252$\n\nSince we only care about the last digit, we can ignore the rest of the product. The remainder when 252 is divided by 10 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $1734 \\times 5389 \\times 80,607$ is divided by 10 is $\\boxed{2}$.",
