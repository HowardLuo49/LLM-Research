    "solution": "Let $N$ be the number of marbles. We know that for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ $$N = 6a+1,\\\\N = 7b+1, \\\\N = 8c +1.$$In other words, $N-1$ is divisible by $6,$ $7,$ and $8.$ We have $$\\text{lcm}[6,7,8] = \\text{lcm}[3,7,8]= 3\\cdot 7\\cdot 8 = 168,$$and so $168$ divides $N-1.$ The smallest possible value of $N$ greater than $1$ is $N = 168+1 = \\boxed{169}.$",
