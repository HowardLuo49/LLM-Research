With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.  Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.  How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the total number of lollipops Winnie has:\n45 cherry lollipops + 116 wintergreen lollipops + 4 grape lollipops + 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops = 394 lollipops\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of lollipops Winnie has by the number of friends she has:\n394 lollipops / 11 friends = 35.8181818...\n\nSince Winnie can only give out whole lollipops and not a fraction of a lollipop, each friend will receive 35 lollipops. \n\nTherefore, Winnie gave away a total of 385 lollipops (35 lollipops * 11 friends). \n\nTo find out how many lollipops she kept for herself, we subtract the lollipops she gave away from the total number she had:\n394 lollipops - 385 lollipops = 9 lollipops\n\nWinnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself.",
