    "solution": "The only numbers that leave no remainder when divided by $5$ are those that are divisible by $5$. Starting from $1,$ every five integers is divisible by $5: 5,10,15,\\ldots$ This continues even until the last group of five numbers $96$ through $100$ where $100$ is divisible by $5$. Therefore, since we have a whole number of groups of five and every group has exactly one element that is divisible by $5$, $1/5 = \\boxed{20}$ percent of the integers less than $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
    "gpt_response": "The positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that have no remainders when divided by $5$ are exactly the multiples of $5$. To find the number of multiples of $5$ less than or equal to $100$, we divide $100$ by $5$ and round down to the nearest whole number: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 20$. \n\nTherefore, there are $20$ multiples of $5$ less than or equal to $100$. Since there are a total of $100$ positive integers less than or equal to $100$, the percentage of positive integers that have no remainders when divided by $5$ is $\\frac{20}{100} \\times 100 = \\boxed{20\\%}$.",
