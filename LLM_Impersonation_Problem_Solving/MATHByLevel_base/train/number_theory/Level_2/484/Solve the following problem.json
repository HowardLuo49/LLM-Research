    "solution": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes, we can simply multiply the three smallest primes together. The three smallest primes are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n2 * 3 * 5 = 30\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes is 30.",
