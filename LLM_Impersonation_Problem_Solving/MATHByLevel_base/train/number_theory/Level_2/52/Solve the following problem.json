    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the first integer be x.\n\nSince 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers, we have:\n\nx(x+1) = 210\nx^2 + x = 210\nx^2 + x - 210 = 0\n(x+15)(x-14) = 0\n\nTherefore, x = 14 or x = -15.
