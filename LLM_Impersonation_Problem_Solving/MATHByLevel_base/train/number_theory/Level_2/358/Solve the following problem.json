The beads are strung in the following order: one red, one orange, two yellow, one green, and one blue. Then the pattern repeats starting again with one red bead. If the first bead of the necklace is red, what is the color of the last bead used to make the necklace?",
    "solution": "The pattern repeats every $1+1+2+1+1=6$ beads. Since $72=6\\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern). The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\\boxed{\\text{orange}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the color of the last bead used to make the necklace, we need to determine the pattern of colors and how many beads of each color are included in a full cycle of the pattern.\n\nThe pattern of colors is:\n1 red, 1 orange, 2 yellow, 1 green, 1 blue.\n\nThis adds up to a total of 6 beads. To find the total number of cycles needed to reach 74 beads, divide 74 by 6:\n74 \u00f7 6 = 12 with a remainder of 2.\n\nThis means that 12 full cycles of the pattern are used, with 2 additional beads added at the end of the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the last bead used to make the necklace will be the 2nd bead of the pattern, which is orange. \n\nSo, the color of the last bead used to make the necklace is orange.",
