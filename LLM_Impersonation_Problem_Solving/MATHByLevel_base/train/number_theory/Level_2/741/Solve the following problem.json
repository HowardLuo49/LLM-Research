    "solution": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18, we have to consider that a multiple of 9 must have a digits' sum that is divisible by 9.\n\nSince the sum of digits is 18, the possible combinations of digits are 9, 9, and 0. However, a three-digit number cannot have a leading zero.\n\nThe largest three-digit number we can form with the digits 9, 9, and 0 is 990. This number is a multiple of 9 because its digits sum to 18.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18 is 990.",
