    "solution": "For every divisor $d$ of $12$, then $12/d$ is also a divisor of $12$. Their product is $d \\cdot (12/d) = 12$. It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $12$ such that their product is $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. There are $(2+1)(1+1) = 6$ divisors of $12$: $1,2,3,4,6,12$. Thus, the product of the divisors is given by $12^{6/2} = 12^3 = \\boxed{1728}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The positive integer divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nThe product of all these divisors is:\n1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 6 * 12 = 1728\n\nTherefore, the product of all the positive integer divisors of 12 is 1728.",
