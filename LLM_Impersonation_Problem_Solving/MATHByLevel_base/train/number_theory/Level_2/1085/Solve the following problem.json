    "solution": "If $n$ has $3$ divisors, since it is divisible by both $1$ and $n$, the only possibility for a third unique divisor is $\\sqrt{n}$, which must be prime. Therefore, $n$ is the square of a prime number. As a result, $n^2$ is the fourth power of a prime. Let $n^2 = p^4$ for the prime $p$. There are $\\boxed{5}$ divisors of $p^4$, namely $p^0$, $p^1$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$.",
    "gpt_response": "If a number $n$ has $3$ divisors, then $n$ must be a square of a prime number. This is because the only way for a number to have an odd number of divisors is if it is a perfect square (since for a factor $d$ of $n$, there is another factor $n/d$ that also divides $n$). Therefore, $n$ must be equal to $p^2$ where $p$ is a prime number.\n\nSince $n = p^2$, then $n^2 = p^4$. The number $p^4$ has $5$ divisors: $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4$. Therefore, $n^2$ has $5$ divisors. \n\nSo, if a number $n$ has $3$ divisors, then $n^2$ has $5$ divisors.",
