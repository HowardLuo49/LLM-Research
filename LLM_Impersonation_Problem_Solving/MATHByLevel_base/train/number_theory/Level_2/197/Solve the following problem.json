    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers. We can use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{216}$.",

We know that the least common multiple of x and y is 36, and their greatest common divisor is 6.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\nLCM(x,y) * GCD(x,y) = x * y\n\nPlugging in the given values, we have:\n\n36 * 6 = x * y\n216 = x * y\n\nSo, the product of the two numbers is 216.",
