If each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, what is the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out?",
    "solution": "If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number.  On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student.  So $\\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first determine the total number of grapes in the bag and then find the greatest common factor that can be evenly distributed to each student.\n\nLet's say there are x grapes in the bag.\n\nTo find the greatest common factor that can be evenly distributed to each student, we need to find the largest number that can evenly divide x and 5.\n\nThe factors of 5 are 1 and 5.\nThe factors of x are 1, x, and any other factors.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor is 5, and each student will receive x/5 grapes.\n\nThe number of grapes left over is x mod 5.\n\nFor the greatest possible number of grapes thrown out, let's maximize the number of grapes left over by finding the largest possible x such that x mod 5 is not equal to 0.\n\nLet's try different values of x:\n- If x = 14, then each student would receive 14/5 = 2 grapes, and there would be 14 mod 5 = 4 grapes left over.\n- If x = 15, then each student would receive 15/5 = 3 grapes, and there would be 15 mod 5 = 0 grapes left over.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out is 4.",
