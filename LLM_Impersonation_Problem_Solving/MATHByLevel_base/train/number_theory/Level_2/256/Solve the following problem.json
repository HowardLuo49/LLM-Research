    "solution": "The smallest four-digit palindromes have $1$ on each end.  $1001$ is not divisible by $3$, nor is $1111$, but $\\boxed{1221}$ is, so it is the smallest possible.",
    "gpt_response": "The least possible positive four-digit palindrome is 1001. However, 1001 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2 which is not divisible by 3.\n\nThe next least possible positive four-digit palindrome is 1111. The sum of its digits is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, which is not divisible by 3.\n\nThe next least possible positive four-digit palindrome is 1221. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3 is 1221.",
