    "solution": "The units digit of $31^3$ is the same as the units digit of $1^3$, which is 1.  The units digit of $13^3$ is the same as the units digit of $3^3$, which is 7.  Therefore, the units digit of $31^3+13^3$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $31^3+13^3$, we need to first calculate the two values separately and then add them together. \n\n$31^3$ can be simplified as $31^3 = 31 \\times 31 \\times 31$. Since we are looking for the units digit, we only need to consider the units digits of the numbers being multiplied. In this case, $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$, so the units digit of $31^3$ is $1$.\n\nSimilarly, $13^3$ can be simplified as $13^3 = 13 \\times 13 \\times 13$. Again, only the units digits of the numbers being multiplied matter, so $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 7$. Therefore, the units digit of $13^3$ is $7$.\n\nAdding the units digits of $31^3$ and $13^3$, we get $1 + 7 = 8$. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $31^3 + 13^3$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
