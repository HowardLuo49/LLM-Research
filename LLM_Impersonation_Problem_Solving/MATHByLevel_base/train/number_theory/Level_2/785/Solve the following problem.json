    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Jason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard. His parents have agreed to let him work off his debt by babysitting under the following conditions: his first hour of babysitting is worth $\\$1$, the second hour worth $\\$2$, the third hour $\\$3$, the fourth hour $\\$4$, the fifth hour $\\$5$, the sixth hour $\\$6$, the seventh hour $\\$1$, the eighth hour $\\$2$, etc. If he repays his debt by babysitting for 39 hours, how many dollars did he borrow?",
    "solution": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can see that Jason's babysitting payment cycle repeats every 7 hours. Therefore, we can find out how many dollars he earns per 7-hour cycle:\n\n$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 1 = \\$22$\n\nSince 39 is not divisible by 7, we can see that Jason will complete 5 full cycles of 7 hours, earning $22 per cycle. He will then have 4 more hours of babysitting to complete. This is 1+2+3+4 = $10.\n\nTherefore, Jason will earn a total of $22 x 5 + $10 = $110 + $10 = $120.\n\nTherefore, Jason borrowed $\\boxed{\\$120}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response \\$132?: We can see that Jason's babysitting payment cycle repeats every 7 hours.
