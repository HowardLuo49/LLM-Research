    "solution": "We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot13\\cdot(14+98)=\\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we first need to determine the range of two-digit multiples of 7.\n\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14 (7 x 2), and the largest two-digit multiple of 7 is 98 (7 x 14).\n\nNow, we need to find the average of all two-digit multiples of 7. \n\nWe can calculate the sum of the first and last terms in the range:\n\n14 + 98 = 112\n\nNow, we need to find the number of terms in this range by dividing the sum by 7 (since the common difference is 7):\n\n112 / 7 = 16\n\nTherefore, there are 16 two-digit multiples of 7 between 14 and 98.\n\nTo find the mean, we need to divide the total sum by the number of terms:\n\n(14 + 98) / 2 = 112 / 2 = 56\n\nSo, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56.",
