    "solution": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into cases. \n\nCase 1: The number has exactly 3 as the hundreds digit and 4 as the units digit. In this case, there are 9 choices for the tens digit (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 1 choice for the tens digit (3). So there are $1 \\times 9 \\times 1 = 9$ numbers in this case.\n\nCase 2: The number has exactly 4 as the hundreds digit and 3 as the units digit. In this case, there are 9 choices for the tens digit (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 1 choice for the tens digit (4). So there are $1 \\times 9 \\times 1 = 9$ numbers in this case.\n\nTherefore, the total number of integers between 500 and 1000 that contain both the digits 3 and 4 is $9 + 9 = \\boxed{18}$.",
