    "solution": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit whole number whose product of digits is 6, we need to find the smallest possible combination of digits that multiply to 6.\n\nThe factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. To form a three-digit number, we need to combine these factors in such a way that the number is as small as possible.\n\nThe smallest combination of factors that will produce a three-digit number is 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the least three-digit whole number whose product of digits is 6 is 123.",
