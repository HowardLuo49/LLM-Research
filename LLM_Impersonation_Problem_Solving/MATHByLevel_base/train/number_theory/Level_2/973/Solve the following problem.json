    "solution": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out what time it will be 2004 hours from now, we need to first determine how many full 12-hour cycles there are in 2004 hours. \n\n2004 \u00f7 12 = 167 with a remainder of 0 \n\nThis means that after 167 full 12-hour cycles, there are no more full hours left. \n\nSince we are starting at 9 o'clock now, after 167 full cycles, we will end up back at 9 o'clock. \n\nTherefore, it will be 9 o'clock 2004 hours from now.",
