    "solution": "There are $13$ cards in the pattern from $A$ to $K$. When you divide $42$ by $13$, you get $3$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, the $42^\\text{nd}$ card is a $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since the cards are ordered in a repeating pattern with $13$ cards in each suit, we can find the remainder when $42$ is divided by $13$ to determine which card in the pattern the $42$nd card corresponds to.\n\n$$42 \\div 13 = 3 \\text{ remainder } 3$$\n\nSince there are $13$ cards in each suit, the $3$rd card in this order corresponds to the $42$nd card overall. Looking at the order of the cards in each suit, we can see that the $3$rd card corresponds to the number $3$. \n\nTherefore, the $42$nd card is the $3$ of Spades.",
