    "solution": "If two numbers give the same remainder when divided by 5, they are said to be equivalent, modulo 5.  From $n^2$ to $n^3$, we have multiplied by $n$.  Since $n^2$ is equivalent to 4 (modulo 5), and $n^3$ is equivalent to 2 (modulo 5), we are looking for an integer $n$ for which $4\\cdot n$ is equivalent to 2, modulo 5.  Notice that if $n$ is greater than 4, then we can replace it with its remainder when divided by 5 without changing whether it satisfies the condition. Therefore, we may assume that $0\\leq n <5$.  Trying 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we find that only $\\boxed{3}$ times 4 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by representing the remainders of $n^2$ and $n^3$ when divided by 5 as follows:\n\n$n^2 \\equiv 4 \\mod 5$\n$n^3 \\equiv 2 \\mod 5$\n\nFrom the first congruence, we have $n^2 = 5k + 4$ for some integer $k$.

Multiplying both sides by $n$, we get $n^4 = n\\cdot n^3 = (5m + 2)n = 5mn + 2n$. \n\nEquating the expressions for $n^4$ from both congruences, we have\n\\[25k^2 + 40k + 16 = 5mn + 2n.\\]\n\nSince both sides are integers, $5\\mid (25k^2 + 40k + 16)$, and this implies $5\\mid 16$.
