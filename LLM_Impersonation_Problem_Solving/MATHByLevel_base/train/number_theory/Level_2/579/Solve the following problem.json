    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Winnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.  With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.  Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.  How many balloons does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many balloons Winnie keeps for herself, we first need to find the total number of balloons she has:\n\n17 red + 33 white + 65 green + 83 chartreuse = 198 balloons\n\nWe then divide the total number of balloons by the number of friends:\n\n198 balloons / 8 friends = 24.75 balloons\n\nSince Winnie cannot give a fraction of a balloon to each friend, she gives each friend 24 balloons, leaving her with:\n\n198 total balloons - (24 balloons * 8 friends) = 198 total balloons - 192 balloons = 6 balloons\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 6 balloons for herself.",
