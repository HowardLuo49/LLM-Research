    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to determine which numbers between 1 and 50 are both prime and multiples of 7. The only prime number that is a multiple of 7 in this range is 7 itself.\n\nThere is only 1 card with the number 7 out of 50 cards. Therefore, the probability of selecting a prime number that is a multiple of 7 is 1/50. \n\nSo, the probability is 1/50.",

Therefore, the probability of selecting a prime number that is a multiple of 7 is 1/50. \n\nSo, the probability is 1/50.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No, the final solution is incorrect. The probability of selecting a prime number that is a multiple of 7 should be 1/(number of prime numbers between 1 and 50 that are multiples of 7).",
