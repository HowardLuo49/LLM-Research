    "solution": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the original two-digit integer be $10a + b$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit.\n\nIf you switch the digits, you get $10b + a$. Adding 3 to this, we get $10b + a + 3$.\n\nAccording to the problem, this result is equal to $2(10a + b)$, which is $20a + 2b$.\n\nSetting the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n$$10b + a + 3 = 20a + 2b$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$9b - 19a = -3$$\n\nTo find the smallest two-digit integer that satisfies this equation, we can start by substituting values of $b = 1, 2, 3, ...$ and finding the corresponding $a$ value.
