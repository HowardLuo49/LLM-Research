This can be represented as:\nx \u2261 2 (mod 7)\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7. This can be represented as:\n3x - 7 \u2261 y (mod 7)\n\nWe can substitute x = 7k + 2 into the equation:\n3(7k + 2) - 7 = 21k + 6 - 7 = 21k - 1\n\nTo find y (the remainder), we just need to divide 21k - 1 by 7:\n(21k - 1) \u00f7 7 = 3k\n\nTherefore, the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7 is 0.",
