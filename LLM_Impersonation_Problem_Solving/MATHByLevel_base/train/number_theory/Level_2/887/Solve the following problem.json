    "solution": "When you divide 52 by 8, you get 6 with a remainder of 4.  Therefore, 4 of the people will get an extra card, bringing their total to 7, while the remaining $\\boxed{4}$ people have only 6 cards.",
    "gpt_response": "Each person will receive 6 cards each, totaling 48 cards in total (6 cards/person * 8 people = 48 cards). This leaves 4 cards remaining.\n\nTherefore, 4 people will receive only 6 cards each, and the remaining 4 people will receive an additional card, giving them a total of 7 cards each.\n\nTherefore, 4 people will end up with fewer than 7 cards.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 4?: Each person will receive 6 cards each, totaling 48 cards in total (6 cards/person * 8 people = 48 cards).
