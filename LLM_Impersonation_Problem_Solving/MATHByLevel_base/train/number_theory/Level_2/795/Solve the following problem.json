    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $12$ are $2,3,5,7,11$. Since $2$ is the only even prime out of the five primes less than $12$, the answer is $\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{20}{100}=\\boxed{20\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime numbers less than 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.\n\nOut of these numbers, only 2 is divisible by 2.\n\nSo, the percentage of prime numbers less than 12 that are divisible by 2 is 1/5 * 100% = 20%.",
