    "solution": "Consider the differences between consecutive prime numbers and look for the first difference of 6 or greater.  The first several prime numbers are \\[\n2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, 37,\\ldots,\n\\] and the differences between consecutive terms of this sequence are  \\[\n1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,\\ldots.\n\\] The first appearance of a difference of 6 or greater occurs between 23 and $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The smallest prime number that occurs after a sequence of five consecutive positive integers that are nonprime is 11.\n\nThe sequence of five consecutive positive integers that are nonprime are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The next prime number after 5 is 7, but since there are only four consecutive nonprime integers before 7, it does not meet the conditions of the problem.\n\nThe next prime number after 7 is 11, which occurs after the sequence of five consecutive nonprime integers.
