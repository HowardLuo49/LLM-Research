    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. You have a number of gold coins that you were going to distribute equally among your 11 best friends. However, after dividing your gold coins into 11 equal piles, you realize that if you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin. You have less than 100 gold coins. What is the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen?",
    "solution": "If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11. However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$. We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \\frac{98}{11}$. Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of gold coins you have.\n\nSince you have 11 best friends, you divide the gold coins into 11 equal piles, so each pile will have x/11 gold coins.\n\nIf you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin. This means that the total number of gold coins you have must be divisible by 11, and when you subtract 2, it should be divisible by 11 as well. In other words, (x - 2) must be divisible by 11.\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of gold coins, we can start testing values starting from the largest possible value under 100 that satisfies the divisibility conditions.\n\nLet's test x = 97:\n97 is divisible by 11, and 97 - 2 = 95 is also divisible by 11.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen is 97.",
