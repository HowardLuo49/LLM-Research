    "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110, we need to consider that the units digit of the product will be affected by the units digits of the odd numbers being multiplied.\n\nThe odd positive integers between 10 and 110 are: 11, 13, 15, ..., 109.\n\nIf we look at the units digits of these numbers, we can see that the product will be affected by the units digits 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nSince the units digit of the product of any number multiplied by any number ending in 1 will result in the same units digit as the other number multiplied by a number ending in 1, we can disregard the units digit of 1.\n\nThe units digit of the product will be determined by the units digits of 3 x 5 x 7 x 9, which equals 945.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110 is 5.",
