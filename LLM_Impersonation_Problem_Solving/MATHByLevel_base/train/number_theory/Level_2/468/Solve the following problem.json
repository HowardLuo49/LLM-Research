    "solution": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The four smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTo find the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of these prime numbers, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these four numbers.\n\nThe LCM of 2, 3, 5, and 7 is 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 = 210.\n\nThe smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 210 is the smallest multiple of 210 that is greater than or equal to 1000.\n\nDividing 1000 by 210, we get 4 with a remainder of 160. So the smallest four-digit number divisible by 210 is 210 x 5 = 1050.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers is 1050.",
