    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of rows that seat 8 people.\n\nIf there are x rows that seat 8 people, then there are 46 - 8x people left to seat in rows of 7 people.\n\nSince each row seats either 7 or 8 people, the total number of people can be written as:\n\n7(46 - 8x) + 8x = 46\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n322 -56x + 8x = 46\n322 - 48x = 46\n-48x = -276\nx = 5.75\n\nSince x must be a whole number (you cannot have a fraction of a row), there can only be 5 rows that seat exactly 8 people.",
