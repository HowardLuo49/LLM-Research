    "solution": "We divide 1000 by 47 and get a remainder of 13. Therefore, if we subtract 13 from 1000, we should get an integer divisible by 47. Since $1000-13 = 987$ and 987 is divisible by 47, we can then add 47 to 987 to get the smallest four-digit integer that is divisible by 47, namely $987+47 = \\boxed{1034}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47, we need to find the smallest multiple of 47 that is greater than 999.\n\nFirst, we find the smallest multiple of 47 that is greater than or equal to 1000:\n\n47 * 22 = 1034\n\nTherefore, the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47 is 1034.",
