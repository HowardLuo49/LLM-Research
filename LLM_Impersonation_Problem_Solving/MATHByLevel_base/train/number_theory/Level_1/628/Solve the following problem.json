    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 7\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 9\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 10\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 7+9+10 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $12$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

We know that:\n\n$a \\equiv 7 \\pmod{12}$\n$b \\equiv 9 \\pmod{12}$\n$c \\equiv 10 \\pmod{12}$\n\nThis means that $a=12k+7$, $b=12m+9$, and $c=12n+10$ for some integers $k$, $m$, and $n$.\n\nThe sum of the three integers is:\n$a+b+c = (12k+7) + (12m+9) + (12n+10) = 12(k+m+n) + 26$\n\nSo when we divide the sum of the three integers by $12$, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
