    "solution": "Notice that we can pair many of these terms: \\[1+7=2+6=3+5=8,\\]so the remainder we want is the same as the remainder when $4+9+10$ is divided by 8.  We also see that this is the remainder when  \\[4+1+2=7\\]is divided by 8, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8, we can first find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10.\n\nThe sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 can be found using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum of the series, $n$ is the number of terms in the series, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, $n = 10$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_n = 10$, so the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is $S = \\frac{10}{2}(1 + 10) = 55$.\n\nNow, we can find the remainder when 55 is divided by 8. \n\n$55 \\div 8 = 6$ with a remainder of 7.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
