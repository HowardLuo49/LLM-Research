    "solution": "According to the problem statement, we have the system of linear congruences \\begin{align*}\nm &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*} It follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{40}$. The only number that satisfies this criterion for $30 \\le m \\le 80$ is $m = \\boxed{42}$, which is indeed divisible by $6$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $m = 6n$ where $n$ is an integer. We know that $30 \\leq m \\leq 80$, so $5 \\leq n \\leq 13$.\n\nSince $m$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $8$, we have $6n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$.
