    "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $3\\cdot4=12$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 30 and 40 is 120.  Since $\\boxed{120}$ is not divisible by 16, it is the smallest common multiple of 30 and 40 which is not divisible by 16.\n\nNote: Every common multiple of two integers is a multiple of their least common multiple.  Therefore, it is not possible that the least common multiple is divisible by 16 but some other common multiple is not.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 40, and then find the smallest multiple that is not a multiple of 16.\n\nFirst, find the LCM of 30 and 40:\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n40 = 2^3 * 5\nLCM(30, 40) = 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 120\n\nNow, find the smallest multiple of 120 that is not a multiple of 16:\nThe factors of 16 are 2^4\nTherefore, to find a multiple of 120 that is not a multiple of 16, we need to divide 120 by 2^4\n120 \u00f7 16 = 7.5\n\nSince 7.5 is not a positive integer, we need to find the next multiple of 120 that is not a multiple of 16.
