    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit multiple of 19, we need to find the largest number less than 1000 that is divisible by 19. \n\nDividing 1000 by 19, we get a quotient of 52 with a remainder of 18. \n\nSo, the largest three-digit multiple of 19 is 52 * 19 = 988. \n\nTherefore, the greatest three-digit multiple of 19 is 988.",
