    "solution": "The number must be even and divisible by 3. Counting down from 999, the first number that satisfies both these properties is $\\boxed{996}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6, we need to find the highest common multiple of these two numbers. The highest common multiple of 3 and 6 is their least common multiple, which is 6.\n\nTo find the greatest three-digit number that is divisible by 6, we need to find the highest three-digit multiple of 6. We start by dividing 999 by 6 to find the highest multiple of 6 that is less than 999:\n\n999 / 6 = 166 with a remainder of 3\n\nSo, the highest three-digit multiple of 6 is 996.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6 is 996.",
