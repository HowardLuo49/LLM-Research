The first five are gray, followed by four white, followed by three black, followed by five gray, followed by four white, followed by three black,....

    "solution": "We notice that the marbles appear in strings of 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black.  These strings have 12 marbles each.  Since  \\[158=13\\cdot12+2,\\]there are 13 full strings of marbles and 2 extras.  Since the first 5 marbles in any group are gray, the two extra marbles must be $\\boxed{\\text{gray}}$.",
