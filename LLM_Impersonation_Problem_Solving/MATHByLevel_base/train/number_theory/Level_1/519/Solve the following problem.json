    "solution": "We can use the Division Theorem ($a=bq+r$).  $74 \\div 7 = 10 R 4$, so $74 = 10 \\times 7 + 4$.  We subtract 1 to get a remainder of 3, so 74 - 1 = $\\boxed{73}$ is the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, we can start by finding the largest multiple of 7 that is less than 74. This multiple is 70.\n\nNext, we add 3 to this multiple to get the largest number less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7:\n\n70 + 3 = 73\n\nTherefore, the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 is 73.",
