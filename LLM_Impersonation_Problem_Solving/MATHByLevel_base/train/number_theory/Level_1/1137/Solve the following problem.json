    "solution": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The only two-digit number that is even and is a multiple of 11 is 44. The product of its digits is 4 * 4 = 16, which is not a perfect cube. Therefore, there is no such two-digit number that satisfies all the given conditions.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 88?: The only two-digit number that is even and is a multiple of 11 is 44. The product of its digits is 4 * 4 = 16, which is not a perfect cube. Therefore, there is no such two-digit number that satisfies all the given conditions.",
