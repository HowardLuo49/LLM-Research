Grady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags such that every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, but some candy was left over. What is the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over?",
    "solution": "Grady distributes his candy in groups of 9 until he no longer has any groups left.  The largest number of possible pieces left is $\\boxed{8},$ since if he has more than 8 he can distribute another group of 9.",
    "gpt_response": "If Grady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine bags, this means that each bag received $\\frac{x}{9}$ pieces of candy. Since we are looking for the greatest possible number of pieces left over, we want to find the largest remainder when $x$ is divided by 9.\n\nThis means that $x$ can be expressed as $9k + r$, where $k$ is an integer representing the number of whole bags of candy and $r$ is the remainder. We want to maximize $r$.\n\nSince each bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, the remainder must be at its maximum value of 8 (one less than the divisor 9). Therefore, the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over is $\\boxed{8}$.",
