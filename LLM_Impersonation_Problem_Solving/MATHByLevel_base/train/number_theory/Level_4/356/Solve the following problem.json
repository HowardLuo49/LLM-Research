(The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's find all the proper factors of each number less than 25 and calculate their sum. \n\nFor 12: The proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12.\n\nFor 18: The proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 21, which is greater than 18.\n\nFor 20: The proper factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22, which is greater than 20.\n\nFor 24: The proper factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36, which is greater than 24.\n\nTherefore, the numbers less than 25 that are abundant numbers are 12, 18, 20, and 24. There are $\\boxed{4}$ of them.",
