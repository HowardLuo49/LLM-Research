    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. A day can be evenly divided into 86,400 periods of 1 second; 43,200 periods of each 2 seconds; or in many other ways. In total, how many ways are there to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers?",
    "solution": "A day has $86,\\!400$ seconds. $86,\\!400=2^7\\cdot3^3\\cdot5^2$, so 86,400 has $(7+1)(3+1)(2+1)=96$ positive factors. Thus there are $96/2=48$ (unordered) pairs of factors each of whose product is $86,\\!400.$ Since ``$n$ periods of $m$ seconds'' is different from ``$m$ periods of $n$ seconds,'' we need to multiply $48$ by $2$ to get our final answer of $\\boxed{96}$ ways.",
    "gpt_response": "To divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, we can think of this problem as finding the number of ways to place $n-1$ dividers in a row of $m$ units.\n\nThere are $m-1$ spaces between the units where we can place the dividers. Therefore, the number of ways to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds is equal to the number of ways to choose $n-1$ dividers out of $m-1$ possible spaces, which can be calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\n$$\\binom{m-1}{n-1} = \\frac{(m-1)!}{(n-1)!(m-n)!}$$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\binom{m-1}{n-1}$ ways to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds.",
