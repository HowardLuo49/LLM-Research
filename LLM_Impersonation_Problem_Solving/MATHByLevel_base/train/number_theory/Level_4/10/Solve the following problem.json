    "solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",
