    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$.  Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$.  Since $1000 = 8\\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples.  Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit.  Altogether, $9 \\cdot 125 = \\boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$.",
    "gpt_response": "A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8. \n\nThe smallest three-digit number divisible by 8 is 104, and the largest is 992. To find the number of multiples of 8 between these two numbers, we can divide 992 by 8 to find the number of possibilities, which is 124.\n\nTherefore, there are 124 positive four-digit integers that are divisible by 8.",
