    "solution": "Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place. Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place. The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\\times7$ to $15\\times 66$. So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15. Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15. There are $\\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To be divisible by $15$, a number must be have both $3$ and $5$ as factors. Since all $3$ digit numbers with a $5$ in the units place known to be divisible by $15$ are multiples of $15$, we find the smallest such number: $105$. The largest such number is $975$. \n\nWe then count the multiples of $15$ between $105$ and $975$ with a $5$ in the units place. This is equivalent to counting the multiples of $15$ between $1$ and $87$. There are $5$ multiples of $15$ in this range: $15, 30, 45, 60, 75$. \n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{5}$ positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$.",
