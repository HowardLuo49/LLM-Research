    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \\gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 4).\n\\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$.\n\nSince $d$ divides both $3n+4$ and $n$, it also divides their difference, which is $4$. This means that $d$ must divide $4$. \n\nSince $3n+4$ is always larger than $n$, $d$ cannot be greater than $n$. Thus, $d \\leq n$, but since $d$ divides $n$, $d$ must divide $n$  as well.\n\nTherefore, the only possible values for $d$ are $1, 2,$ and $4$. As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, the sum of all these possible values is $\\boxed{7}$.",
