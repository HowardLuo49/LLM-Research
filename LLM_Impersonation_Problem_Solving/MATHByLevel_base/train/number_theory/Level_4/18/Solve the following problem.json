    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 5) \\cdot x(x + 5)}{50} = \\frac{x(x + 5)^2}{50}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nWe are told that the greatest common divisor is $x + 5$, so $x + 5$ divides 50.  The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5.  When $x = 5$, the other number is $5 \\cdot 10^2/50 = 10$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 10 and 50 is 10, and $x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10$.  The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the other positive integer be $y$. We know that the greatest common divisor of 50 and $y$ is $x+5$, and the least common multiple of 50 and $y$ is $x(x+5)$. \n\nSince the greatest common divisor of 50 and $y$ is $x+5$, and 50 = 2*5^2, $y$ must not contain any factor of 2 or 5 in common with 50. This means that $y$ must be of the form $5^a$, where $a$ is a positive integer.\n\nSince the least common multiple of 50 and $y$ is $x(x+5)$, and 50 = 2*5^2, $y$ = 5^a, it follows that $x$ should be of the form $2^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. \n\nNow, $x+5 = 2^b + 5$. Since $x+5$ is the greatest common divisor of 50 and $y$, and $y$ = 5^a, it follows that $x+5$ must divide 50. Thus, $2^b + 5$ must divide 50. The only possible values for $b$ are 1 and 3.\n\nIf $b = 1$, then $x+5 = 2+5 = 7$, which does not divide 50 evenly.\nIf $b = 3$, then $x+5 = 2^3 + 5 = 13$, which divides 50 evenly.\n\nThus, $b = 3$. So, $x = 2^3 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other positive integer $y$ is $5^1 = 5$.",
