    "solution": "When we are subtracting, we want to subtract a smaller number from a bigger number. We can pull out a negative sign in order to accomplish this:  \\[ 35_8-74_8 = -(74_8 - 35_8). \\]Now, we can line in the numbers and subtract just as we do in base 10.  For example, when we borrow from the $8^1$s place, the digit 1 in the units place becomes $4+8=12$, while the digit in the $8^1$s place decreases by 1. Continuing in this way, we find $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & \\cancelto{6}{7} & \\cancelto{12}{4}_8 \\\\\n& - & 3 & 5_8 \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& & 3 & 7_8 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$Therefore, $35_8-74_8 = -(74_8 - 35_8) = \\boxed{-37_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To subtract $74_8$ from $35_8$, we need to perform regrouping.\n\nFirst, we need to borrow from the leftmost digit:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & 1 & 3 & &\\\\\n&3 & 5 & & &  \\\\\n-& 7 & 4 & & &  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNow, in base 8, $15-4 = 13$, which can be written as $13_8 = 1*(8^1) + 3*(8^0) = 13_{10}$.\n\nSo, the result of $35_8 - 74_8$ is $13_8$.",
