    "solution": "Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.  Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4.  By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100.  Calculating, $X = \\boxed{925}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In order for X to be an integer, T must be divisible by 12. The number 12 is divisible by 4 and 3, so in order for T to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 4 and 3.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by its last two digits must also be divisible by 4. The only possible values for the last two digits of T are 00, 01, 10, and 11. Hence, T can end in 00 or 12.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The only possible options for the sum of the digits of T are 0, 1, and 2.\n\nPutting these conditions together, the possible values for T are 0, 12, and 120.\n\nTesting these values, we find that $0 \\div 12 = 0$, $12 \\div 12 = 1$, and $120 \\div 12 = 10$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of X is $\\boxed{0}$.",
