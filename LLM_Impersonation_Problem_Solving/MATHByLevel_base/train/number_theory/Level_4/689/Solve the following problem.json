    "solution": "An integer that is equivalent to 6 mod 7 can be written in the form $7k+6$.\n\n$1000$ is the smallest four-digit integer, so we want to solve the inequality $7k+6 \\ge 1000$. This inequality has solution $k \\ge 142$, so since $k$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $k$ is $142$. As a result, the smallest four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is $7(142) + 6 = \\boxed{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7, we need to find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 7.\n\nLet's find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 7:\n\n6 mod 7 = 6\n\nSo the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is 1006.",
