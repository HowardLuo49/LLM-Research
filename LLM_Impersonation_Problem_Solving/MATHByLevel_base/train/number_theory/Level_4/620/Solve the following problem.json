    "solution": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits, we can set up the equation:\n\n$62 = b^2 + 2b + 0$\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest base $b$ that satisfies this equation, we can start by testing small values of $b$. \n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that $b=7$ is the smallest base that satisfies the equation, since $7^2 + 2(7) + 0 = 62$. \n\nTherefore, $b=\\boxed{7}$.",
