    "solution": "From the Euclidean Algorithm,\n\\[\n\\gcd(a_{n}, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1} - 10a_n).\n\\]We compute $a_{n+1} - 10a_n = \\frac{10^{n+1}-1}{9} - \\frac{10^{n+1}-10}{9} = 1$. Therefore, $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$ share no common factors and $d_n$ is always $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, note that we can write \n\\[a_n = \\frac{10^n-1}{9} = \\underbrace{111\\ldots1}_{n \\text{ ones}}.\\]\nThis implies that $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ are both strings of $n$ ones. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ will also be a number that consists only of ones. \n\nLet us consider the prime factorization of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$. We have:\n\\[a_n = \\underbrace{111\\ldots1}_{n \\text{ ones}} = 11\\ldots1 \\cdot \\frac{10^n-1}{9} = 11\\ldots1 \\cdot (\\underbrace{111\\ldots1}_{n \\text{ ones}}).\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[a_{n+1} = \\underbrace{111\\ldots1}_{n \\text{ ones}} = 11\\ldots1 \\cdot (\\underbrace{111\\ldots1}_{n \\text{ ones}}).\\]\nTherefore, their greatest common divisor will be $\\boxed{111\\ldots1}$ with $n$ ones, which is the maximum possible value $d_n$ can attain.",
