    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$, we need to find the three smallest positive integers whose product is 2004.\n\nFactoring 2004 into its prime factors, we have: $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$\n\nThe three smallest factors whose product equals 2004 are $2, 3,$ and $167$.
