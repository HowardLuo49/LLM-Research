    "solution": "If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite.  Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\\boxed{4}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the prime numbers between 30 and 65 that have a prime remainder when divided by 10, we first need to list out the prime numbers in that range:\n\n31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61\n\nNow we need to find which of these prime numbers have a prime remainder when divided by 10. The possible remainders when a prime number is divided by 10 are 1, 3, 7, or 9. \n\nFrom the list of prime numbers, only 31, 41, and 61 have a prime remainder when divided by 10.\n\nSo, there are 3 prime numbers between 30 and 65 that have a prime remainder when divided by 10.",
