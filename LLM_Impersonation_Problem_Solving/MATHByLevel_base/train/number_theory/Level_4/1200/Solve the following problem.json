    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of 2160 that are perfect squares, we need to consider the exponents of each prime factor in its prime factorization.\n\nIn order for a factor to be a perfect square, each of its prime factors must have an even exponent. This is because a factor that is a perfect square will have each of its prime factors raised to an even power.\n\nThe prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$.\n\nThe possible combinations of even exponents for the prime factors are:\n- 0 or 2 or 4 for 2\n- 0 or 2 for 3\n- 0 for 5\n\nTherefore, there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ possible combinations of even exponents for the prime factors.\n\nEach of these combinations will result in a unique factor of 2160 that is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares.",
