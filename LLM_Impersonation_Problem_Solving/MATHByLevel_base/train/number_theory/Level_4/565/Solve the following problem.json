    "solution": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7$, we first need to determine the range of valid digits in base-5 and base-7.\n\nIn base-5, the valid digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the integer $AA_5$ can be represented as $10A+ A = 11A$ in base-10.\n\nIn base-7, the valid digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the integer $BB_7$ can be represented as $10B + B = 11B$ in base-10.\n\nSince we want the smallest possible integer that can be represented as both $11A$ and $11B$, we need to find the smallest common multiple of 11 in both sequences. The smallest common multiple of 11 is 11 itself. Therefore, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ is $\\boxed{11}$.",
