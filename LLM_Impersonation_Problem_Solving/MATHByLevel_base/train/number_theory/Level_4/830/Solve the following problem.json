    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $n$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  An integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we have 3 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and $2$ choices for $c$, for a total of $(3)(3)(2)=\\boxed{18}$ ways to form an even positive factor of $n$.",
