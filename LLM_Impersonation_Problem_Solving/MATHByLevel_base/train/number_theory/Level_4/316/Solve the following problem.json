    "solution": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To create a palindrome, we would need to add a number such that the resulting number reads the same forward as backward. \n\nStarting with the number 40,305, let's break it down:\n- The number is 5 digits long, so the palindrome that we are looking to create will also be 5 digits long.\n- The first digit of the number is 4, so the last digit of the palindrome will also be 4.\n\nTo create a palindrome, we can mirror the first two digits of the starting number:\n- The first two digits of the starting number are 40.\n- If we mirror them, we get 44.\n\nTherefore, the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is $\\boxed{44}$. The resulting palindrome would be 40,305 + 44 = 40,349.",
