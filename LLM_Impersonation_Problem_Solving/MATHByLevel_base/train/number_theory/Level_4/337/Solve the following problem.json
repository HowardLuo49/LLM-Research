    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. George is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
    "solution": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's look at the two scenarios separately.\n\nScenario 1: George gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies.\nLet the total amount of change be x cents. If he gets the most quarters possible, the remaining amount must be a multiple of 25 cents (since quarters are 25 cents each) plus 3 pennies. Therefore, x = 25n + 3 for some integer n.\n\nScenario 2: George gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies.\nLet the total amount of change be y cents. If he gets the most dimes possible, the remaining amount must be a multiple of 10 cents (since dimes are 10 cents each) plus 8 pennies. Therefore, y = 10m + 8 for some integer m.\n\nWe know that both x and y are less than 100 cents. Let's find the possible values for x and y.\n\nFor x: \nIf he can receive the most quarters possible (25 cents) plus 3 pennies, the maximum value for x would be 25*3 = 75 + 3 = 78 cents.\n\nFor y:\nIf he can receive the most dimes possible (10 cents) plus 8 pennies, the maximum value for y would be 10*8 = 80 + 8 = 88 cents.\n\nNow, let's find the common values for x and y that are less than 78 cents and 88 cents respectively.\nThe possible values are 28, 53, 78 for x and 18, 43, 68, 93 for y.\n\nThe sum of the possible amounts of change George is trying to get is:\n28 + 53 + 78 + 18 + 43 + 68 = 288 cents. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible amounts of change that George is trying to get is 288 cents.",
