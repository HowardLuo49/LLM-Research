    "solution": "We can use the distributive property of multiplication to multiply a three-digit palindrome $aba$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) with 101: $$ 101 \\cdot aba = (100 + 1) \\cdot aba = aba00 + aba = ab(2a)ba. $$Here, the digits of the product are $a$, $b$, $2a$, $b$, and $a$, unless carrying occurs.  In fact, this product is a palindrome unless carrying occurs, and that could only happen when $2a \\ge 10$.  Since we want the smallest such palindrome in which carrying occurs, we want the smallest possible value of $a$ such that $2a \\ge 10$ and the smallest possible value of $b$.  This gives us $\\boxed{505}$ as our answer and we see that $101 \\cdot 505 = 51005$ is not a palindrome.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we can start by listing the three-digit palindromes from smallest to largest:\n\n101, 111, 121, 131, 141, ..., 191, 202, 212, 222, ...\n\nWe can see that the smallest three-digit palindrome is 101. Let's calculate the product of 101 and 101:\n\n101 * 101 = 10201\n\nSince the product of 101 and 101 is a five-digit palindrome, we move on to the next smallest three-digit palindrome, which is 111. Let's calculate the product of 111 and 101:\n\n111 * 101 = 11211\n\nThis product is also a five-digit palindrome, so we move on to the next smallest three-digit palindrome, which is 121. Let's calculate the product of 121 and 101:\n\n121 * 101 = 12221\n\nThis product is again a five-digit palindrome, so we continue this process until we find the first three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome. \n\nThe next three-digit palindrome is 131.
