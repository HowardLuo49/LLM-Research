    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number meeting the given conditions, we want to use as many digits as possible, starting with the largest digit and working our way down. Since our largest digit must be a $3$, we will use as many $3$s as possible before adding any $2$s.\n\nSince the digits must add up to $11$, we can start by using three $3$s which gives us $9$, leaving us with $2$ more to add up to $11$. Since there are only two $2$s left, we can add them to the number to get $3322$.\n\nTherefore, the largest number, meeting the given conditions, is $\\boxed{3322}$.",
