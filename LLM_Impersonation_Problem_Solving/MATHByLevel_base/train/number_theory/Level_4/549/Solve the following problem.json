    "solution": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "For a number to be divisible by 45, it must be divisible by both 5 and 9.\n\nFirst, let's consider divisibility by 5. Since the number ends in 45, it is already divisible by 5. \n\nNext, let's consider divisibility by 9. The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9 in order for the entire number to be divisible by 9. \n\nFor a number of the form $\\_\\_45$, the sum of the digits is $10 + a + 4 + 5 = 19 + a$, where $a$ is a digit between 0 and 9. For the sum to be divisible by 9, we need to find an integer $a$ such that $19 + a$ is divisible by 9. From observation, $a = 1$ makes the sum equal to 20, which is not divisible by 9. However, $a = 8$ makes the sum equal to 27, which is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, there is only one positive four-digit integer of the form $\\_\\_45$ that is divisible by 45, which is $\\boxed{8945}$.",
