    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the number of marbles in each box. Since each box contains more than one marble, $x>1$. Because there are 600 marbles in total, we have $mx=600$. Since $x>1$, we know that $m<600$.\n\nThus, we are looking for the number of positive divisors of 600 that are greater than 1. Since $600=2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$, the number of positive divisors of 600 is $(3+1)(1+1)(2+1)=24$. However, we need to exclude 1 and 600 since they do not satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the total number of values for $m$ is $24-2=\\boxed{22}$.",
