    "solution": "Any factor of $8000=2^6\\cdot5^3$ is in the form $2^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le3$. To count the number of perfect square factors, we must count the factors of $2^6\\cdot5^3$ that have $a=0$, $2$, $4$ or $6$ and $b=0$ or $2$. This gives $4\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ perfect square factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of 8000 that are perfect squares, we first need to find the prime factorization of 8000.\n\n8000 = 2^7 * 5^3\n\nTo find the number of factors that are perfect squares, we need to consider the exponents of the prime factors. For a factor to be a perfect square, the exponents of all prime factors in its prime factorization must be even.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, there are 4 choices for the exponent (0, 2, 4, 6).\nFor the prime factor 5, there are 2 choices for the exponent (0, 2).\n\nTherefore, the total number of factors that are perfect squares is 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nSo, there are 8 factors of 8000 that are perfect squares.",
