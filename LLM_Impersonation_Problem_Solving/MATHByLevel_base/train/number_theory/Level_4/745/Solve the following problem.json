    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first convert the base 7 number $AB_7$ to decimal. \n\n$AB_7 = 7A + B$\n\nNext, let's convert the base 5 number $BA_5$ to decimal.\n\n$BA_5 = 5B + A$\n\nNow, we have the following two equations:\n\n$7A + B = 5B + A$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$6A = 4B$\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n$3A = 2B$\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are digits, we know that $A$ must be 2 and $B$ must be 3 in order to satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, the decimal equivalent of $23_7$ is:\n\n$2*7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17$\n\nSo, the positive integer in decimal is $\\boxed{17}$.",
