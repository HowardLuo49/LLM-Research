    "solution": "Since $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, both $m$ and $n$ are divisible by 12.  Then $10m$ is divisible by $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$, and $15n$ is divisible by $12 \\cdot 15 = 180$.  Since 60 divides both 120 and 180, $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ must be at least 60.\n\nIf we set $m = n = 12$, then $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(12,12) = 12$, and $\\gcd(10m,15n) = \\gcd(120,180) = 60$, which shows that the value of 60 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, which means that both $m$ and $n$ are multiples of 12. Let $m = 12x$ and $n = 12y$ for some positive integers $x$ and $y$.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$. Substituting the expressions for $m$ and $n$, we get:\n\n$\\gcd(10(12x),15(12y)) = \\gcd(120x,180y)$\n\nWe can simplify this by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor:\n\n$\\gcd(120x,180y) = 30\\gcd(4x,6y)$\n\nSince the least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12, the greatest common divisor of 4x and 6y must be a multiple of 12.
