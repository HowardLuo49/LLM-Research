    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$. Therefore, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.\nThe largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $8^3=512$. Therefore, there are $8$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\nHowever, we cannot simply add those two numbers together because there are numbers that are both a perfect cube and a perfect square. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it needs to be a $2 \\cdot 3 =6$th power. The largest 6th power less than $555$ is $2^6=64$, so there are $2$ 6th powers less than $555$.\nTherefore, there are $23+8-2=\\boxed{29}$ integers that are either a perfect cube or perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first find how many perfect cubes are less than 555. The largest cube less than or equal to 555 is $8^3 = 512$. So, there are perfect cubes less than 555 for each of the cubes $1^3, 2^3, 3^3, \\ldots, 8^3$, therefore, there are 8 perfect cubes less than 555.\n\nNext, let's find how many perfect squares are less than 555. The largest square less than or equal to 555 is $23^2 = 529$. So, there are perfect squares less than 555 for each of the squares $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 23^2$, therefore, there are 23 perfect squares less than 555.\n\nHowever, there are some numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. These numbers are $1^6=1, 2^6=64,$ and $3^6 = 729$. Since $729$ is greater than $555$, we only have to subtract $1$ and $64$ from our count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integers less than 555 that are either a perfect cube or a perfect square is $8 + 23 - 2 = \\boxed{29}$.",
