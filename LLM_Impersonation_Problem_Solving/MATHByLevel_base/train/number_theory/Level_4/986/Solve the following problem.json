    "solution": "Note that it is possible that $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, since $3\\cdot 2 = 8 - 2 \\cdot 1$. Then $2b + 12 = 16$. Since $3,$ $5,$ and $6,$ are not factors of $16$, it is not true that these numbers must be divisors of $2b + 12.$\n\nIt only remains to check whether $1$, $2$, and $4$ must be divisors of $2b + 12$. The distributive property gives us   $$8 - 2a = 2 \\cdot 4 - 2a = 2(4 -a),$$so $2$ is a factor of $3b$. Note that   $$b = 3b - 2b,$$so since $2$ is a factor of $3b$ and $2$ is a factor of $2b,$ $2$ must be a factor of $b.$ So we can say $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$. Substituting gives us    \\begin{align*}\n2b + 12 &= 2(2n) + 12\\\\\n&= 4n + 4 \\cdot 3\\\\\n&= 4(n + 3),\n\\end{align*}so $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$. Since $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $4$ and $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$, it must be true that $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $2b + 12$. So our final answer is $\\boxed{3}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Substitute the given equation for $3b$ into $2b + 12$ to get \\[2(8-2a) + 12 =16 - 4a + 12 = 28 - 4a = 4(7 - a).\\]The divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. Since $4a$ is even, $4(7-a)$ is even when $a$ is odd, so 4 is a divisor in these cases. And since $4(7-a)$ is divisible by 7 when $a = 1, 2, 4, 11, 14,$ or 28, 7 is a divisor in these cases. So, three of the first six positive integers must be divisors of $2b + 12.$\n\nAlternatively, since $3b = 8 - 2a$ and $8 = 2^3,$ we know that $3b$ is even, so $b$ is even. So $b$ is a multiple of $2$ for all integers $a.$ From here, one may manually check all integers $a$ to find that $a = 2^1, 2^2, 2^3,$ and $2^4$ give $2b + 12$ as a multiple of an integer in $\\{1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\\},$ so the answer is $\\boxed{3}.$",
