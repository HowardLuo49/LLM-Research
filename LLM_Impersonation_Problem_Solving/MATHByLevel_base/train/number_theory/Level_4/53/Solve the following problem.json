    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Jenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Under Jenny's new system, each book contains a total of 42 pages filled with 10 stamps per page, giving a total of 420 stamps per book. Since Jenny has already filled up 4 complete books, she has a total of 4 * 420 = 1680 stamps from those books.\n\nHer fifth book contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page for a total of 33 * 10 = 330 stamps. This means that there are 1680 + 330 = 2010 stamps in total so far.\n\nSince each of Jenny's initial books contain 6 stamps per page, there are 6 * 42 * 8 = 2016 stamps in total. This means that there is a difference of 2016 - 2010 = 6 stamps from the last page that need to be accounted for.\n\nThus, the last page of the fifth book contains 6 stamps.",
