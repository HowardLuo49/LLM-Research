    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$, we first need to calculate the units digit of $7^{2005}$. We know that the units digit of powers of $7$ repeat in a cycle: $7, 9, 3, 1$. Since $2005$ is one less than a multiple of $4$ (i.e. $2004 = 4 \\times 501$), the units digit of $7^{2005}$ is $9$.\n\nNow, to find the tens digit of $7^{2005}$, we can write $7^{2005}$ as $10a + b$, where $b$ is the units digit and $a$ is some integer. Since the units digit of $7^{2005}$ is $9$, we know that $b = 9$, and we are looking for $a$.\n\nWe also know that $7^{2005} = 10a + 9$ is congruent to $9 \\mod 100$. This means that $10a$ is congruent to $0 \\mod 100$, so $a$ is a multiple of $10$. Thus, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",
