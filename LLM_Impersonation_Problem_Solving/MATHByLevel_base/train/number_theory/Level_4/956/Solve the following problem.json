    "solution": "The value of 121 base $n$ is $1\\cdot n^2+2\\cdot n^1+1\\cdot n^0=n^2+2n+1$.  Since $n^2+2n+1=(n+1)^2$, the digit string 121 is a perfect square in any base except binary (where the digit 2 is not allowed).  There are $10-3+1=\\boxed{8}$ integers between 3 and 10 inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we can write the number $121_n$ as $n^2 + 2n + 1$ using the definition of base $n$ notation. We want to find integers $n$ such that $n^2 + 2n + 1 = m^2$ for some integer $m$. \n\nRearranging the equation gives $(n + 1)^2 = m^2$. We can then simplify this to $n(n + 2) = m^2$. Since $n$ and $n + 2$ are consecutive integers, their greatest common divisor is $1$. Therefore, both $n$ and $n + 2$ must be perfect squares for $n(n + 2)$ to be a perfect square. \n\nNow, we can test the values of $n$ from $3$ to $10$ to see which ones satisfy this condition:\n- For $n = 3$, $n$ is not a perfect square, but $n + 2 = 5$ is not a perfect square either, so $121_3$ is not a perfect square.\n- For $n = 4$, $n = 2^2$, and $n + 2 = 6$ is not a perfect square, so $121_4$ is not a perfect square.\n- For $n = 5$, $n + 2 = 7$ is not a perfect square, so $121_5$ is not a perfect square.\n- For $n = 6$, both $n = 2^2$ and $n + 2 = 8 = 2^3$ are perfect squares, so $121_6$ is a perfect square.\n- For $n = 7$, $n + 2 = 9 = 3^2$ is a perfect square, but $n = 7$ is not, so $121_7$ is not a perfect square.\n- For $n = 8$, $n = 2^3$ and $n + 2 = 10$ are not perfect squares, so $121_8$ is not a perfect square.\n- For $n = 9$, $n = 3^2$, and $n + 2 = 11$ are not perfect squares, so $121_9$ is not a perfect square.\n- For $n = 10$, $121_10 = 121$ is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ integers $n$ such that $3 \\leq n \\leq 10$ and $121_n$ is a perfect square: $n = 6$ and $n = 10$.",
