    "solution": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue of $-811$ modulo $24$, we can first find the residue of $811$ modulo $24$ and then take the negative of that residue.\n\nFirst, divide $811$ by $24$ to get $811 = 24 \\cdot 33 + 19$. Therefore, the residue of $811$ modulo $24$ is $19$.\n\nSince we want the residue of $-811$, we take the negative of $19$ modulo $24$, which is $24-19 = 5$.\n\nSo, the residue of $-811$ modulo $24$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
