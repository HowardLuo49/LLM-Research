    "solution": "We write $2dd5_6$ in base 10 to get $2dd5_6=2\\cdot 6^3+d\\cdot 6^2 +d\\cdot 6 + 5= 437 + 42d$. We can subtract $39\\cdot 11$ from this quantity without changing whether it is divisible by 11. This subtraction yields $437 + 42d-429 = 8 + 42d$. We can subtract $33d$ from this quantity, again not changing whether it is divisible by 11, leaving $8+9d$. Now we try the possible values $d=0,1,2,3,4,5$ for a base-6 digit, and we find that only $d=\\boxed{4}$ results in a number which is divisible by 11.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that a number is divisible by 11 in base 10 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. \n\nTherefore, we need $2-d-d+5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, or $7-2d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. \n\nChecking the possible values of $d$ in base 6, we find that only $d=4$ works. \n\nThus, the base-6 digit $d$ that makes $2dd5_6$ divisible by 11 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
