The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19) = 928,752$.\n\nTo find the other four-letter list with a product equal to this, we need to factorize $928,752$. By observing that $928,752 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 17 \\times 19^2$, we see that the possible letters corresponding to the factors could be $ABBQ$.\n\nChecking the product of $ABBQ$, we find that $(1)(2)(2)(17) = 68$, which is indeed equal to the product of $PQRS$.\n\nTherefore, the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{ABBQ}$.",
