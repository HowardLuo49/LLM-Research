    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "We only need to consider the units digit of each factorial term in the sum, as discussed in a previous problem. Since the units digit of $5!$ onwards is always 0, we only need to consider the units digit of $1! + 2! + 3! + 4!$.\n\n$1! = 1$\n$2! = 2$\n$3! = 6$\n$4! = 24$\n\nAdding these up, we get a units digit of $1 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 3$. Therefore, the units digit of the entire sum is $\\boxed{3}$.",
