    "solution": "We find the prime factorization of $4125$. $4125= 11 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3$. Thus, we want $n!$ to have a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and $3$ factors of $5$. The largest prime in the factorization is $11$, so $n \\ge 11$. The exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 11! is only 2, since only the factors 5 and 10 are divisible by 5. Similarly, 12!, 13!, and 14! only have 2 fives in their prime factorizations. Since $15!$ contains a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and three factors of $5$, the least positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$, we need to find the highest power of 5 and 3 in $n!$.\n\nSince 4125 = $5^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. We need at least two factors of 5 and one factor of 3 in $n!$.\n\nThe highest power of 5 in $n!$ is given by the formula: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThe highest power of 3 in $n!$ is given by the formula: $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1$.\n\nCombining these two requirements, we have $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor \\geq 2$ and $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\geq 1$.\n\nTesting $n = 6$, we have $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{6}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1 + 0 = 1$ which is not enough.
