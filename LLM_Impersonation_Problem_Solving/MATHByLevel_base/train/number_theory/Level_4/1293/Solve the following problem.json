    "solution": "Each member in the set is of the form $(x-1)+x+(x+1)=3x$. Since $x$ can be any positive integer, the greatest common divisor of all these members is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. The sum of three consecutive positive integers starting from $n$ can be calculated as $n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3$. This can be factored as $3(n+1)$.\n\nTherefore, any number in $A$ is of the form $3k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nIt is clear that the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$ is 3, since all numbers in $A$ are multiples of 3. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ is the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$.",
