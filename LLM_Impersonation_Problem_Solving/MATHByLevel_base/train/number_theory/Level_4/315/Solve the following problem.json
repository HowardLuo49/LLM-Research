    "solution": "First, we find the prime factorization of $180$ to be $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Note that the odd divisors of 180 are precisely the integers of the form $3^a5^b$ where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(1+3+9)(1+5)$ yields 6 terms, with each integer of the form $3^a5^b$ appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the odd divisors of 180 is $(1+3+9)(1+5)=13 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{78}$.",
