    "solution": "Factoring out the highest power of 2 that divides 180, we get $180=2^2\\cdot45$. Thus, the odd factors of 180 are all the factors of $45=3^2\\cdot5^1$, which has $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find how many odd whole numbers are factors of 180, we first need to find the prime factorization of 180.\n\n180 = 2 * 90\n180 = 2 * 2 * 45\n180 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 15\n180 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5\n\nNow, we can see that the odd factors of 180 would be any combination of the odd prime factors (3 and 5) multiplied together. This gives us the following odd factors:\n\n1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45\n\nThere are 6 odd factors of 180.",
