    "problem_prompt": "Solve the following problem. Jenna collects stamps.  She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.  One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.  The other has 1008.  What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 840 and 1008.\n\nThe prime factorization of 840 is 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7 and the prime factorization of 1008 is 2^4 * 3^2 * 7.\n\nTo find the greatest common divisor, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in both factorizations. Therefore, the greatest common divisor is 2^3 * 3 * 7 = 168.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page is 168.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 168?: To find the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 840 and 1008.\n\nThe prime factorization of 840 is 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7 and the prime factorization of 1008 is 2^4 * 3^2 * 7.\n\nTo find the greatest common divisor, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in both factorizations.
