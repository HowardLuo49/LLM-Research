    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\\cdot189=2^3\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$. The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$. Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\\cdot3^2=(2\\cdot3)^2=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of 1512 is 2^3 * 3^3 * 7. \nTo find the largest perfect square factor, we want to find the largest square number that can be formed using the prime factors of 1512. \nThe largest perfect square factor of 1512 is therefore 3^2 * 2^2 = 36.",
