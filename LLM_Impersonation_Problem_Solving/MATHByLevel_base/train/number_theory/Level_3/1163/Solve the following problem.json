    "solution": "First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$. Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$, we need to focus on the last digit of each number involved. \n\nFirst, let's find the last digit of $11^{11}$. We know that the last digit of powers of 1 repeats every 4 powers: $1^1 = 1, 1^2 = 1, 1^3 = 1, 1^4 = 1$. Therefore, the last digit of $11^{11}$ is the same as the last digit of $11^{3}$, which is 1.\n\nNext, let's find the last digit of $22^{1}$, $22^{2}$, $22^{3}$ etc.:\n\n$$\n22^1 = 2, \\\\\n22^2 = 4, \\\\\n22^3 = 8, \\\\\n22^4 = 6, \\\\\n22^5 = 2, \\\\\n22^6 = 4, \\\\\n22^7 = 8, \\\\\n22^8 = 6, \\\\\n\\text{and so on...}\n$$\n\nSo the pattern of the last digit of $22^n$ repeats every 4 powers as well: $22^1 = 2, 22^2 = 4, 22^3 = 8, 22^4 = 6$.\n\nNow, we need to find $22^{22(11^{11})}$, but we know that the last digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is the same as the last digit of $22^{22k}$, where $k$ is any integer.
