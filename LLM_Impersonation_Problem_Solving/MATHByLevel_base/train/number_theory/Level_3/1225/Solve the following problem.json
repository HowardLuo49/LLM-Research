    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25, we need to consider the factors of 25. The factors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25.\n\nLet's start with the number 25 itself. The product of its digits is 2*5 = 10, which is not a multiple of 25.\n\nNext, let's consider the number 50. The product of its digits is 5*0 = 0, which is a multiple of 25.\n\nTherefore, the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25 is 50.",
