    "solution": "Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime. The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors. The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4. It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $a$ has $3$ factors, $a$ must be a prime number. The only prime number with $3$ factors is $a = 2.$ Therefore, $a=2$ and has $3$ factors: $1, 2,$ and itself.\n\nNow, since $b$ has $a=2$ factors, $b$ must be a prime number. Let $b = p$ for some prime number $p.$ Since $b$ is divisible by $a,$ we must have $p \\geq a = 2.$\n\nThe smallest prime number greater than $2$ is $3,$ so the least possible value of $b$ is $b=p=3.$ Therefore, the least possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{3}.$",
