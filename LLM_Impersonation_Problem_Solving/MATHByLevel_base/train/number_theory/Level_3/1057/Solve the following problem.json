    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $2n = x^2$ and $3n = y^3$ for some positive integers $x$ and $y$. \n\nSince $2n = x^2$, we have $n = \\frac{x^2}{2}$. \n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we get $\\frac{3x^2}{2} = y^3$. \n\nMultiplying by 2 on both sides, we get $3x^2 = 2y^3$. \n\nTherefore, $y$ must be divisible by 3. Let $y = 3z$ for some positive integer $z$. \n\nSubstitute $y = 3z$ into the equation $3x^2 = 2y^3$, we get $x^2 = 6z^3$. \n\nSince $x^2$ is a perfect square, $x$ must be divisible by 6. Let $x = 6w$ for some positive integer $w$. \n\nSubstitute $x = 6w$ into the equation $2n = x^2$, we get $2n = 36w^2$. \n\nTherefore, $n = 18w^2$. \n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $w$ must be at least 1. \n\nThe smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions is when $w = 1$, which gives $n = 18$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $\\boxed{18}$.",
