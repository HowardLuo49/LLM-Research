    "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's rewrite the expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ as $1 + \\frac{6}{n}$. For this expression to be an integer, $\\frac{6}{n}$ must also be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the only possible integral values for $n$ are factors of 6, namely $1, 2, 3, 6$.\n \nChecking these values in the expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ we find that $n=2$ gives us an integer value but $n=1, 3, 6$ do not. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer is $2$.",
