    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that add up to 87, we need to find two composite numbers that are as close to each other as possible. \n\nThe prime factorization of 87 is $3 \\times 29$. Since both 3 and 29 are prime numbers, 87 cannot be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers with prime factors other than 3 and 29.\n\nTo get composite numbers with prime factors of 3 and 29, we can write 87 as $3 \\times 29 = 43 + 44$. Both 43 and 44 have 4 divisors (1, 43; 1, 2, 22, 44) and are thus composite numbers. The difference between 43 and 44 is 1, so the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that add up to 87 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
