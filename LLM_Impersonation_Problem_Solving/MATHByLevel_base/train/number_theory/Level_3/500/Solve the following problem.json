    "solution": "We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}. $$",
