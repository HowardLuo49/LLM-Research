    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the numbers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, we first need to find the number of perfect squares and perfect cubes within that range.\n\nThere are 12 perfect squares between 1 and 150 (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144).\nThere are 5 perfect cubes between 1 and 150 (1, 8, 27, 64, 125).\n\nHowever, some numbers are both perfect squares and perfect cubes (1, 64). We need to subtract these numbers from the total count. \n\nSo, there are $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$ numbers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers from 1 to 150 that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes are $150 - 15 = \\boxed{135}$.",
