    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
    "gpt_response": "From the second equation, we have $Z = K^3$. In order for $Z$ to be a perfect square, $K^3$ must be a perfect square. Since $K$ is an integer, this means that $K$ must be a perfect cube. \n\nThe cube root of $500$ is approximately $8.66$, and the cube root of $1000$ is approximately $9.97$. Since $K$ must be an integer greater than $1$, the only possible value for $K$ is $9$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{9}$.",
