    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$. Using this fact, we find that the greatest multiple of $9$ that is less than $-1111$ is $-1116$.\n\nWe have $-1111 = -1116+5$. That is, $-1111$ is equal to a multiple of $9$ plus $5$. Therefore, $$-1111\\equiv \\boxed{5}\\pmod 9.$$To verify this answer, we can check that $9$ divides $(-1111)-5 = -1116$; it does, so our answer is correct.",
    "gpt_response": "We want to find the integer $n$ such that $-1111$ is congruent to $n \\pmod 9$. To do this, we can find the remainder when $-1111$ is divided by 9.\n\nSince $-1111$ divided by 9 has a remainder of $-4$ (since $-1111 = -124 \\times 9 - 7$), we can rewrite this as $-1111 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\n\nHowever, we want the value of $n$ to be between $0$ and $8$ inclusive. To find the corresponding positive integer value of $n$, we need to add 9 to $-4$ until we get a value between 0 and 8. \n\nAdding 9 to $-4$, we get $-4 + 9 = 5$.
