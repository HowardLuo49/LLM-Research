    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $115_{10}$ to base $11$, we need to find the largest power of $11$ that is less than $115$. \n\n$11^2 = 121$ which is greater than $115$. \n\nTherefore, we can express $115_{10}$ as $100_{11} + 10_{11} + 5_{11}$. \n\nIn base $11$,  \n$10 = A$ and \n$5 = 5$. \n\nSo, $115_{10} = \\boxed{A5_{11}}$.",
