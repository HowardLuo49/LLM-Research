    "solution": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^3$. Since the three integers are pairwise relatively prime, each integer must consist of a different combination of factors of $2$, $3$, and $5$. \n\nOne possible combination is $2^3$, $3^3$, and $5^3$. Therefore, the three integers are $8$, $27$, and $125$.\n\nTheir sum is $8 + 27 + 125 = \\boxed{160}$.",
