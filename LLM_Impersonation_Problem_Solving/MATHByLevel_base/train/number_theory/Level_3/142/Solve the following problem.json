    "solution": "The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \\cdot 64 = 448$. Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $473_{10}$ to base $8$, we need to repeatedly divide by $8$ and record the remainders.\n\n$473 \\div 8 = 59$ with a remainder of $1$\n$59 \\div 8 = 7$ with a remainder of $3$\n$7 \\div 8 = 0$ with a remainder of $7$\n\nThus, the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $731_8$. So, the first digit (from left to right) of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
