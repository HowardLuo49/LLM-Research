(Note: the underlining is meant to indicate that the number should be interpreted as a five-digit number whose ten thousands digit is 7, whose thousands digit is $n$, and so on).",
    "solution": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A number is divisible by 33 if it is divisible by both 3 and 11.\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 3, we add up the digits. In this case, we have $7+n+9+3+3=22+n$. For this sum to be divisible by 3, $n$ must be 1 (since $22+1=23$ is divisible by 3).\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 11, we take the alternating sum of the digits. In this case, we have $7-n+9-3+3=16-n$. For this difference to be divisible by 11, $n$ must be 5 (since $16-5=11$ is divisible by 11).\n\nTherefore, the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ is divisible by 33 when $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
