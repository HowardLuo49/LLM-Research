    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert the number of people to base $10$, divide by $2$, and then convert the result back to base $6$.\n\nConverting $204_6$ to base $10$:\n\n$204_6 = 2 \\cdot 6^2 + 0 \\cdot 6^1 + 4 \\cdot 6^0 = 2 \\cdot 36 + 0 \\cdot 6 + 4 = 72 + 0 + 4 = 76_{10}$\n\nDividing by $2$: \n\n$76 \\div 2 = 38$\n\nConverting $38$ back to base $6$:\n\n$38 = 6 \\cdot 6 + 2 = 62_6$\n\nTherefore, the bagel shop has $62_6$ benches.",
