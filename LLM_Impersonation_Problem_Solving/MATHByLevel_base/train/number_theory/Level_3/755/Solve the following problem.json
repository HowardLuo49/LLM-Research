    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The only set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6 is:\n\n5, 11, 17, 23, 29\n\nSumming these five prime numbers:\n\n5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85\n\nTherefore, the sum of the five prime numbers in this arithmetic sequence is 85.",
