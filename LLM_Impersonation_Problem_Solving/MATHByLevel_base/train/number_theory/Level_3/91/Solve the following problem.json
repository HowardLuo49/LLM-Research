    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $k$ be the positive integer such that when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. \n\nThis means that $60 = qk^2 + 6$ for some integer $q$. \n\nRearranging the equation, we get $qk^2 = 54$, so $k^2$ divides 54. The factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. \n\nWe are looking for the smallest value of $k$ such that $k^2$ divides 54. Testing the factors, we find that $k=3$ works, because $3^2 = 9$ divides 54.\n\nNow that we know $k=3$, we want to find the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$. \n\nThe remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $100 \\div 3 = 33$ with a remainder of 1. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
