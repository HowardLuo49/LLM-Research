    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A number has a total of 5 factors if and only if it is of the form $p^{4}$ where $p$ is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors is $2^{4} = 16$.",
