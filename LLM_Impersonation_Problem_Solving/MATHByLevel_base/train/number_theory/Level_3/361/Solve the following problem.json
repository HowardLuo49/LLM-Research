    "gpt_response": "The least common multiple of 135 and 468 can be found by first finding the prime factorization of each number.\n\nThe prime factorization of 135 is 3 x 3 x 3 x 5 = 3^3 x 5\n\nThe prime factorization of 468 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 13 = 2^2 x 3^3 x 13\n\nTo find the least common multiple, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either prime factorization. So the least common multiple would be:\n\nLCM = 2^2 x 3^3 x 5 x 13 = 4 x 27 x 5 x 13 = 7020\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is 7020.",
