    "solution": "Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$ where $0 \\le a \\le 3$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$ and $0 \\le c \\le 1$. In other words, there are 4 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and 2 choices for $c$. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{24}$ natural-number factors of $N$.",
