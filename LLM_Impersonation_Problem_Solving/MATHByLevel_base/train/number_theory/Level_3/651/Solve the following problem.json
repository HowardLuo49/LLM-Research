    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$, we can use modular arithmetic.\n\nWe know that $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, so $2^{18} = (2^3)^6 \\equiv 1^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTherefore, $2^{19} = 2^{18} \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nThus, the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
