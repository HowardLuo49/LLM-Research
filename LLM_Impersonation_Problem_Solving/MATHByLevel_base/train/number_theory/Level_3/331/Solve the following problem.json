    "solution": "First, we need to add up the digits in his phone number to see what the digits in his address add up to.  $2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25$.\n\nFor his address, we want to find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to $25$.  Because we want a large number, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible, so the first digit should be $9$.  The next three digits, therefore, must add up to $25-9=16$.  Since the digits must be unique, the next digit cannot be $9$, so we will go for the next largest number, $8$.  The final two digits must add up to $16-8=8$, and since neither can be $8$, the next largest possibility for those numbers is $7$ and $1$.  Therefore, Sam's address is $\\boxed{9871}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of Sam's house number, we need to consider the sum of the digits being as large as possible while still being distinct.\n\nThe sum of the digits in Sam's phone number is 2+7+1+3+1+4+7 = 25.\n\nWe need to find a set of distinct four digits that add up to 25. The largest such set is 9+8+7+1 = 25.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value for Sam's house number is 9871.",
