    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, so we can write $3^{12000} = (3^{400})^{30}$. Since $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we have $(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30} \\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are $\\boxed{001}$.",
