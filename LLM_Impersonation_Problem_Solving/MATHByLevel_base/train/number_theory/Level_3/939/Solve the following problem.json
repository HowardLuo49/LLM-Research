    "solution": "A prime number is a number whose only divisors are $1$ and itself. If a prime were divisible by $39$, it would have to be divisible by $3$ and $13$ as well since $3$ and $13$ are factors of $39$. Thus the \"prime\" would have too many factors and wouldn't be a prime! Thus there are $\\boxed{0}$ primes which are divisible by $39$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find prime numbers that are divisible by $39$, we need to find prime numbers that are also divisible by $3$ and $13$, since $39 = 3\\times 13$.\n\nPrime numbers are only divisible by $1$ and themselves. Since $3$ and $13$ are not prime numbers, there are no prime numbers that are divisible by $39$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.",
