    "solution": "If $k$ is a positive even integer, then $$9^{k} = 81^{k/2}=\\overbrace{(81)(81)\\cdots (81)}^{k/2\\text{ times}},$$so $9^k$ has a units digit of 1. Since 8 is even, $8^7$ is even.  Therefore, $9^{8^7}$ has a units digit of $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the units digit of a number is the digit in the ones place of that number. To find the units digit of $9^{8^7}$, we can first find the units digit of $8^7$.\n\nSince the units digit of 8 raised to any positive integer power follows a pattern of 8, 4, 2, 6, we can find that the units digit of $8^7$ is 6 (since 7 is congruent to 3 mod 4).\n\nNow that we have found the units digit of $8^7$, we can use this information to find the units digit of $9^{8^7}$. Since $9^{8^7} = 9^6 \\cdot 9^6 \\cdot 9^6 \\cdot 9^6 \\cdot 9^6 \\cdot 9$, we need to find the units digit of $9^6$.\n\nSimilarly, we know that the units digit of 9 raised to any positive integer power follows a pattern of 9, 1, 9, 1, so the units digit of $9^6$ is 1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $9^{8^7}$ is the units digit of 1, which is $\\boxed{1}$.",
