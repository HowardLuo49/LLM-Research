    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we need to determine the pattern of units digits that $13^n$ follows as $n$ increases.\n\nStarting with $13^1 = 13$, $13^2 = 169$, $13^3 = 2197$, $13^4 = 28561$, we can see that the units digits cycle with 3, 9, 7, 1.\n\nSince the cycle length is 4, we can divide 2003 by 4 to find the remainder:\n\n$2003 \\div 4 = 500$ with a remainder of 3.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is the same as the units digit of $13^3$, which is 7. \n\nHence, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
