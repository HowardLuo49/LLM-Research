    "solution": "$99!$, the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, includes the product $2\\times5=10$, and since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of 99! is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, we need to consider the units digit in each number.\n\nIf we look at the units digit in each number from 1 to 9, we can see that the units digits repeat every 4 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nTherefore, in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, the units digit will be:\n\n1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9 = 362880\n\nSince 362880 is divisible by 10 (the product of any number with 0 in its units place will result in the product ending in 0), the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99 inclusive is 0.",
