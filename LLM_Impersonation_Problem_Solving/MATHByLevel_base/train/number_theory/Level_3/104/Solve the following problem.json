    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by writing $x\\equiv 9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$. Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$.\n\nModulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\\cdot (9\\cdot 9^{-1}) \\equiv (11\\cdot 9)\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1}$. Thus \\begin{align*}\n11 + 9^{-1} &\\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\pmod{25},\n\\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNotice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$, we know that $9x=25k+1$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{25k+1}{9}=2k+\\frac{7}{9}$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, we must have $k\\geq 1$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of $x$ are $2(1)+1=3, 2(2)+1=5, 2(3)+1=7, \\ldots$. \n\nWhen $x=3$, we have $11+x=14$, which leaves a remainder of $14$ when divided by $25$. \n\nWhen $x=5$, we have $11+x=16$, which leaves a remainder of $16$ when divided by $25$. \n\nWhen $x=7$, we have $11+x=18$, which leaves a remainder of $18$ when divided by $25$. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that the remainder cycles through the numbers $14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11$, so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{14}$.",
