    "solution": "The prime factorization of $91$ is $7 \\cdot 13$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $91$ is equal to $(1 + 7)(1 + 13)$, as each factor of $91$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the answer is equal to $(1 + 7)(1 + 13) = (8)(14)$, or $\\boxed{112}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The prime factorization of 91 is 7 x 13. Therefore, the positive divisors of 91 are 1, 7, 13, and 91.\n\nThe sum of all these divisors is 1 + 7 + 13 + 91 = 112.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the positive divisors of 91 is 112.",
