    "solution": "We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors. $10=5\\cdot2=10\\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:\n\n$\\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3=48.$\n\n$\\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$\n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\\boxed{48}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer with exactly 10 positive factors, we can use the fact that the number of factors of a number is determined by the exponents in its prime factorization.\n\nIf a number has 10 factors, it must be in the form $p^4q^1$ where p and q are distinct prime numbers. The reason is as follows:\n\nIf the prime factorization of a number is $p^a \\cdot q^b \\cdot r^c$ where p, q, and r are distinct prime numbers, the number of factors is $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)$. In our case, to get exactly 10 factors, we must have two of the exponents equal to 1, and the third exponent equal to 4. We also want to minimize the number, so we choose the smallest possible prime numbers, which are 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer with exactly 10 positive factors is $2^4 \\cdot 3^1 = 48$.",
