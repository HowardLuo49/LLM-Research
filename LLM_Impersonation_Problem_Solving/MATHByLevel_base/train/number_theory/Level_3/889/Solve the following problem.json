    "solution": "Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.\n\nEach group of $5$ numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+0=10$. Since $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, we can ignore every group of $5$.\n\nThis leaves the numbers $121,122,$ and $123$. The sum of the residues is $1+2+3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modulo $5$ remainder of the sum $1+2+3+4+5+ \\ldots + 120+121+122+123$, we first find the sum of the integers from $1$ to $123$:\n\nThe sum of the integers from $1$ to $n$ is equal to $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Applying this formula to $n = 123$ gives:\n$$\\frac{123(123+1)}{2} = \\frac{123 \\cdot 124}{2} = \\frac{15252}{2} = 7626.$$\n\nNow we need to find the modulo $5$ remainder of $7626$.
