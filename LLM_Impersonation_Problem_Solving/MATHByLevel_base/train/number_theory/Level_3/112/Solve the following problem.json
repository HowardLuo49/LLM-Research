    "solution": "We know that both $72$ and $108$ are multiples of $n$, so $108-72=36$ is also a multiple of $n$. That is, $n$ is a divisor of $36$.\n\nNote that $24$ is not divisible by $3^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ is divisible by $3^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $3^2$.\n\nSimilarly, $27$ is not divisible by $2^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$ is divisible by $2^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $2^2$.\n\nThe only divisor of $36$ that is a multiple of $3^2$ and $2^2$ is $36$ itself. Thus, $n=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $n$, we first need to understand the definition of the least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers is the smallest multiple that is divisible by both numbers. \n\nGiven that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$, we can write the prime factorization of 72 as $2^3 \\times 3^2$. This means that 24 and $n$ must share the factors of 2 and 3, at least 3 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 3. Thus, $n$ must have at least 1 more factor of 2 and 1 more factor of 3 in its prime factorization. \n\nSimilarly, given that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$, we can write the prime factorization of 108 as $2^2 \\times 3^3$. This means that $n$ and 27 must share the factors of 2 and 3, at least 2 factors of 2 and 3 factors of 3. Thus, $n$ must have at least 2 more factors of 2 and 2 more factors of 3 in its prime factorization. \n\nCombining these conditions, we find that $n$ must have at least 3 factors of 2 and 3 factors of 3 in its prime factorization.
