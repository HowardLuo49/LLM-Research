    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "If one of the factors of $x$ is 3, then $x$ can be written as $3 \\cdot y$, where $y$ is a positive integer.\n\nThe sum of all the positive factors of $x$ can be expressed as $(1 + 3) \\cdot (1 + y) = 24$, since the sum of the factors can be calculated by multiplying all possible combinations of the factors.\n\nExpanding the expression, we have $4(1 + y) = 24 \\Rightarrow 4 + 4y = 24 \\Rightarrow 4y = 20 \\Rightarrow y = 5$.\n\nTherefore, $x = 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{15}$.",
