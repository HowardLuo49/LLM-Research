    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $23^{23}$, we can look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 23. \nThe units digit of $23^1$ is 3. \nThe units digit of $23^2$ is 9. \nThe units digit of $23^3$ is 7. \nThe units digit of $23^4$ is 1. \n\nFrom here, we can see that the units digits of the powers of 23 repeat in a cycle of 4: 3, 9, 7, 1. \nSince $23^{23}$ is congruent to $23^{3}$ (modulo 4), we have that the units digit of $23^{23}$ is the same as the units digit of $23^{3}$, which is 7. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
