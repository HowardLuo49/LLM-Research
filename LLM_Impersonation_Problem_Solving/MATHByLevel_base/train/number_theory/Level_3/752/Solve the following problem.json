    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{384615}$, which repeats every 6 digits. Since 534 is a multiple of 6, the 534th digit is the same as the last digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the digit that appears in the 534th place after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$, we first need to find the decimal representation of this fraction.\n\nWhen we divide 5 by 13, we get: \n\n$$\\frac{5}{13} = 0.3846153846153846...$$\n\nSo we can see that the digits 384615 are repeating infinitely.\n\nSince the repeating pattern has a length of 6 digits, we can divide 534 by 6 to find out how many times the pattern will repeat in the 534th place. \n\nWhen we divide 534 by 6, we get a quotient of 89 with a remainder of 0. \n\nThis means that the digit in the 534th place after the decimal point is the 6th digit in the repeating pattern, which is 5. \n\nTherefore, the digit that appears in the 534th place after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{13}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
