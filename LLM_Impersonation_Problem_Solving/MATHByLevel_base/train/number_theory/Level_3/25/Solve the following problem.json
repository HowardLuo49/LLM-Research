    "solution": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The number of factors of a whole number $n$ is related to its prime factorization. If a prime factorization of $n$ has the form $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ are positive integers, then the number of factors of $n$ is equal to $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\ldots (a_k + 1)$.\n\nTo have an odd number of factors, each of the terms $(a_1+1)$, $(a_2+1)$, $\\ldots$, $(a_k+1)$ must be odd. This means that each $a_i$ must be even for $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, making each $p_i$ raised to an even power in the prime factorization of $n$. Thus, the number of factors of $n$ is of the form $(2m_1)(2m_2)\\ldots(2m_k)$, where $m_i$ are positive integers.\n\nSince the number of factors of $n$ is a product of even numbers, it is also even. Hence, no whole number less than $100$ can have an odd number of positive factors.",
