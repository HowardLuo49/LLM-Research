    "solution": "In order to solve this problem, we must first find the number of digits when $987_{10}$ is converted to each base. Beginning with base-3, we have that $2187>987>729$ or $3^7>987>3^6$. So, we know that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has 7 digits. Similarly with base-8, we have that $4096>987>512$ or $8^4>987>8^3$. So, the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has only 4 digits. Therefore, the base-3 equivalent has $7-4=\\boxed{3}$ more digits than the base-8 equivalent.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of digits in the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$, we need to find the largest power of 3 that is less than or equal to 987. \n\nSince $3^6 = 729$ and $3^7 = 2187$, we see that $3^6 < 987 < 3^7$. This means that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ will have 7 digits.\n\nTo find the number of digits in the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$, we need to find the largest power of 8 that is less than or equal to 987. \n\nSince $8^3 = 512$ and $8^4 = 4096$, we see that $8^3 < 987 < 8^4$.
