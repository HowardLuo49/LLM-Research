    "solution": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $x$ has 12 factors. If the numbers 12 and 15 are factors of $x$, then we can express $x$ in terms of their prime factorization.\n\n$12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$\n\n$15 = 3 \\cdot 5$\n\nSince $x$ has 12 factors, it must be in the form of $p^{11}$, where $p$ is a prime number.\n\nFrom the prime factorization of 12 and 15, we can see that $x$ must have the prime factors $2^2$, $3$, and $5$. Therefore, $x = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60$. \n\nTherefore, $x = 60$.",
