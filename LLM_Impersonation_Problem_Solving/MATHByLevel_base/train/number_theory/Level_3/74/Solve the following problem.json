    "solution": "The divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. They can be paired off into four pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 42:  \\begin{align*}\n\\{1&,42\\}, \\\\\n\\{2&, 21\\},\\\\\n\\{3&, 14\\}, \\text{and}\\\\\n\\{6&, 7\\}.\n\\end{align*}Thus $A=42^4=(2\\cdot3\\cdot7)^4=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4$ has $\\boxed{3}$ prime divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "We first find the prime factorization of $42$. $42 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. \n\nTo find the product of the divisors of $42$, we note that each divisor of $42$ can be paired with another divisor to multiply to $42$. For example, the pair $(1,42)$ multiplies to $42$, as does the pair $(2,21)$, and so on. Since each divisor is paired with another divisor, the product of all the divisors will be the square root of $42$ multiplied by itself for each pair, and this product will have $\\boxed{3}$ distinct prime factors (2, 3, and 7).",
