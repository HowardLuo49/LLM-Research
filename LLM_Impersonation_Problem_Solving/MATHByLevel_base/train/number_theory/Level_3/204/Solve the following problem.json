    "solution": "Let $n$ be the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of. We know $n<100$ and $n=8k-1=7l-3$ for some positive integers $k$ and $l$. From this we see that $7l=8k+2=2(4k+1)$, so $7l$ is a multiple of 14. List some multiples of 14, in decreasing order: 112, 98, 84, 70, .... Since $n<100$, 112 is too large, but 98 works: $7k=98\\Rightarrow n=98-3=95=8(12)-1$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{95}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible integer that satisfies the given conditions, we need to find the highest multiple of 8 that is less than 100 and one less than that number is also 3 less than a multiple of 7.\n\nThe largest multiple of 8 less than 100 is 96 (8 x 12 = 96). One less than 96 is 95. Since 95 is one less than a multiple of 8 and is also three less than a multiple of 7 (95 = 7 x 13 - 3), the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of is 95.",
