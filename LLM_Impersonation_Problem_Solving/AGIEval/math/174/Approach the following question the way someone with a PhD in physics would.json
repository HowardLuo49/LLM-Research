    "solution": "17",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must recognize that a parallelogram has two pairs of opposite sides that are parallel and equal in length. Given the coordinates of three vertices of the parallelogram, we can determine the fourth vertex and subsequently calculate the value of $x + y$.\n\nLet the fourth vertex of the parallelogram be denoted by $(x, y)$, with $x > 7$. Because the opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel, the vector connecting the first vertex to the second vertex must be equal to the vector connecting the fourth vertex to the third vertex. \n\nThus, we have the following equations:\n\n$$(6-5, 8-3) = (x-7, y-4)$$\n\nSolving these equations, we find:\n\n$$(1, 5) = (x-7, y-4)$$\n\nTherefore, $x = 1 + 7 = 8$ and $y = 5 + 4 = 9$. Thus, $x + y = 8 + 9 = 17$.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of $x + y$ for the given parallelogram coordinates is 17.",
