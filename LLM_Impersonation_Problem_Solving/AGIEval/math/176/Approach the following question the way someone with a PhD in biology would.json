    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
    "solution": "56",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can represent the number of correct answers as $x$, the number of incorrect answers as $y$, and the number of questions not answered as $z$. Given that he answered $80$ questions in total, we have the equation:\n\n$x + y + z = 80$\n\nThe total score can also be represented as:\n\n$5x - 2y = 232$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express $z$ in terms of $x$ and $y$: $z = 80 - x - y$\n\nSubstitute $z$ into the second equation:\n\n$5x - 2y = 232$\n\n$5x - 2(80 - x - y) = 232$\n\n$5x - 160 + 2x + 2y = 232$\n\n$7x + 2y = 392$\n\nFrom the given information, we know that $x + y = 80 - z$. Substitute into $7x + 2y = 392$:\n\n$7x + 2(80 - x - z) = 392$\n\n$7x + 160 - 2x - 2z = 392$\n\n$5x - 2z = 232$\n\nThis equation is the same as the second given equation, giving us a system of equations with only one solution.\n\nSolving these equations, we find $x = 48$ and $y = 32$. Therefore, Frank answered $48$ questions correctly.",
