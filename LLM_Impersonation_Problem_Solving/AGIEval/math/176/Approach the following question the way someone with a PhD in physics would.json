Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
    "solution": "56",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.\n\nLet x be the number of questions Frank answered correctly and y be the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly. Since Frank answered 80 questions in total, we have the equation:\n\nx + y = 80      (1)\n\nGiven that each correct answer scores 5 points and each incorrect answer scores -2 points, the total score can be expressed as:\n\n5x - 2y = 232     (2)\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. \n\nFirst, we can rewrite Equation (1) as:\n\ny = 80 - x\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into Equation (2) and solve for x:\n\n5x - 2(80-x) = 232\n5x - 160 + 2x = 232\n7x = 392\nx = 56\n\nTherefore, Frank answered 56 questions correctly.",
