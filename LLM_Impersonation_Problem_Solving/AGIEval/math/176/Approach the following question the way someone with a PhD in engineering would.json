Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
    "solution": "56",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly. Since each correct answer scores $5$ points, the total points Frank scored from answering correctly is $5x$.\n\nThe number of questions Frank answered incorrectly can be calculated by subtracting the number of correct answers from the total number of questions answered. Thus, the number of questions answered incorrectly is $(100 - x) - (100 - 80) = 80 - x$. Since each incorrect answer scores $-2$ points, the total points Frank scored from answering incorrectly is $-2(80-x)$.\n\nGiven that the total points Frank scored is $232$, we can set up the equation:\n\\[5x - 2(80-x) = 232\\]\n\nExpanding and solving the equation gives:\n\\[5x - 160 + 2x = 232\\]\n\\[7x - 160 = 232\\]\n\\[7x = 392\\]\n\\[x = 56\\]\n\nTherefore, Frank answered $56$ questions correctly.",
