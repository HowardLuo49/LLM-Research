Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
    "solution": "56",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly out of the total $100$ questions. \n\nSince Frank answered $80$ questions in total, we know that the number of questions he answered incorrectly is $80 - x$. Therefore, his score for answering questions correctly is $5x$, and his score for answering questions incorrectly is $-2(80-x) = -160 + 2x$. \n\nGiven that Frank's total score is $232$ points, we can write the equation:\n\n$5x - 160 + 2x = 232$\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n$7x - 160 = 232$\n\nAdding $160$ to both sides:\n\n$7x = 392$\n\nDividing by $7$:\n\n$x = 56$\n\nTherefore, Frank answered $56$ questions correctly out of the $80$ questions he answered.",
