By joining alternate vertices of a regular hexagon with edges $4$ inches long, two equilateral triangles are formed, as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the region that is common to the two triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.

Each sector of the hexagon outside the common region consists of two of these equilateral triangles. Therefore, the total area of the sectors outside the common region is 4 times the area of an equilateral triangle, which is 24 square inches.\n\nTherefore, the area of the region that is common to the two triangles is the area of one equilateral triangle minus the area of all the sectors outside the common region, which is:\n\n$4\\sqrt{3} - 24 = \\boxed{-20+4 \\sqrt{3}}$ square inches.",
