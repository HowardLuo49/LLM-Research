By joining alternate vertices of a regular hexagon with edges $4$ inches long, two equilateral triangles are formed, as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the region that is common to the two triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.

We need to determine the area formed by the dashed and dotted lines within the triangle.\n\nSince these lines are dividing the larger equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles, we can consider each smaller triangle separately. Each small triangle has side length $2$ inches and hence area:\n\\[ A_{small} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 2^2 = \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThere are $6$ of these smaller triangles in each large equilateral triangle.
