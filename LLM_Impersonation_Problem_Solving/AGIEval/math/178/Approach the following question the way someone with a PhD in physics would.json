    "solution": "40",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the perimeter of a rhombus with given diagonals, we must first determine the side lengths of the rhombus. \n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, forming four right triangles with the sides of the rhombus. The lengths of the diagonals are 12 and 16 units, which means that the diagonals are the hypotenuses of these right triangles. \n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the lengths of the sides of the rhombus:\n\na^2 + b^2 = 12^2\na^2 + b^2 = 144\n\nc^2 + d^2 = 16^2\nc^2 + d^2 = 256\n\nSince the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, the sides of the rhombus are equal in length. Therefore, a = c and b = d. \n\nAdding the equations for a^2 + b^2 and c^2 + d^2, we get:\n\n2(a^2 + b^2) = 144 + 256\n2(a^2 + b^2) = 400\na^2 + b^2 = 200\n\nSince a = c and b = d, we can substitute a = c and b = d into a^2 + b^2:\n\n2a^2 = 200\na^2 = 100\na = 10\n\nNow that we have found the side lengths of the rhombus to be 10 units, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of all four sides:\n\nPerimeter = 4a\nPerimeter = 4(10)\nPerimeter = 40 units\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units is 40 units.",
