    "gpt_response": "To calculate the perimeter of a rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units, we must first determine the length of the sides of the rhombus. \n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, dividing the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we can determine the length of each side of the rhombus.\n\nLet the half-length of the diagonal be a and b. Given that the diagonals are 12 and 16 units, we have a = 6 and b = 8. \n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of the sides:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = s\u00b2\n6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 = s\u00b2\n36 + 64 = s\u00b2\n100 = s\u00b2\ns = 10\n\nTherefore, the length of each side of the rhombus is 10 units. \n\nTo find the perimeter of the rhombus, we simply multiply the length of one side by 4:\n\nPerimeter = 10 * 4 = 40 units.\n\nThus, the perimeter of the rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units is 40 units.",
