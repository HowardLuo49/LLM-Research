    "gpt_response": "To find the perimeter of a rhombus, we need to know the length of one of its sides. However, we can use the diagonals of the rhombus to calculate the side length using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, forming four right-angled triangles. Let's denote the length of one half of each diagonal as a and b. We can calculate the side length of the rhombus using the formula:\n\ns = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)\n\nGiven that the diagonals of the rhombus have lengths of 12 and 16 units, we can calculate the side length as follows:\n\ns = sqrt((12/2)^2 + (16/2)^2)\ns = sqrt(36 + 64)\ns = sqrt(100)\ns = 10 units\n\nNow that we have the side length of the rhombus, we can calculate its perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4:\n\nPerimeter = 4 x 10 = 40 units\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of a rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units is 40 units.",
