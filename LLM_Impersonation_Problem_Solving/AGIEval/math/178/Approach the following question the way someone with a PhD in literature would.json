    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the perimeter of a rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units, we must first recognize that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all four sides of equal length. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and bisect each other at the midpoint. Additionally, the length of the diagonals can be used to determine the side length of the rhombus.\n\nBy using the formula for the diagonals of a rhombus, we can calculate the side lengths as follows:\n\nLet d1 = 12 units and d2 = 16 units be the lengths of the diagonals.\nThe formula for finding the side length in terms of the diagonals is given by:\ns = sqrt((d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2)\ns = sqrt((12/2)^2 + (16/2)^2)\ns = sqrt(36 + 64)\ns = sqrt(100)\ns = 10 units\n\nSince all sides of the rhombus are equal, each side length is 10 units. Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is calculated as follows:\nPerimeter = 4s\nPerimeter = 4(10)\nPerimeter = 40 units\n\nHence, the perimeter of the rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units is 40 units.",
