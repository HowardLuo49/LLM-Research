    "gpt_response": "To find the perimeter of a rhombus, we need to know either the length of one of its sides or the measure of one of its angles. In this case, we are given the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus.\n\nFor a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles and their lengths are related to the side lengths through the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote the lengths of the diagonals as d1 = 16 units and d2 = 12 units. The side length of the rhombus can be calculated using the formula:\n\ns = sqrt((d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2)\ns = sqrt((8)^2 + (6)^2)\ns = sqrt(64 + 36)\ns = sqrt(100)\ns = 10 units\n\nThe perimeter of a rhombus can be calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units is:\n\nPerimeter = 4 * s\nPerimeter = 4 * 10\nPerimeter = 40 units\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is 40 units.",
