    "gpt_response": "To find the perimeter of a rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units, we can first use the formula for the length of the diagonals of a rhombus in terms of its side length. The length of each diagonal of a rhombus can be found using the formula d = 2s, where d is the length of the diagonal and s is the side length of the rhombus.\n\nGiven that the diagonals of the rhombus are 12 and 16 units, we can set up the following equations:\n\n12 = 2s1\n16 = 2s2\n\nSolving these equations, we find that the side lengths of the rhombus are s1 = 6 units and s2 = 8 units.\n\nThe perimeter of a rhombus is equal to the sum of the four side lengths. Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus with side lengths 6 and 8 units is:\n\nPerimeter = s1 + s2 + s1 + s2\nPerimeter = 6 + 8 + 6 + 8\nPerimeter = 28 units\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the rhombus with diagonals of lengths 12 and 16 units is 28 units.",
