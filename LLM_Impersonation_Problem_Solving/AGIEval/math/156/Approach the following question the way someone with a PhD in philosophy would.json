    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of blue marbles that must be added to the bag in order to achieve a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ for selecting a blue marble at random, we must first establish the total number of marbles in the bag after the addition of the unknown quantity of blue marbles. Let us denote this quantity as $x$.\n\nGiven that the original bag contains 20 marbles, with 5 of them being blue, the probability of selecting a blue marble at random from this initial configuration is $\\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nAfter adding $x$ blue marbles to the bag, the total number of blue marbles in the bag becomes $5+x$.
