    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, let's define the probability of selecting a blue marble from the original bag of 20 marbles as P_blue. Since there are 5 blue marbles out of 20 total marbles, P_blue can be expressed as:\n\nP_blue = number of blue marbles / total number of marbles = 5 / 20 = 1/4\n\nLet x be the number of blue marbles that need to be added to the bag. The total number of marbles in the bag after adding x blue marbles will be 20 + x. The probability of selecting a blue marble from this new bag will be:\n\nP_new_blue = total number of blue marbles / total number of marbles after adding x blue marbles = (5 + x) / (20 + x)\n\nWe want P_new_blue to be 1/2. Setting this equal to 1/2, we get:\n\n(5 + x) / (20 + x) = 1/2\n\nCross multiplying, we get:\n\n2(5 + x) = 20 + x\n10 + 2x = 20 + x\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, 10 blue marbles must be added to the bag so that the probability of selecting a blue marble at random is 1/2.",
