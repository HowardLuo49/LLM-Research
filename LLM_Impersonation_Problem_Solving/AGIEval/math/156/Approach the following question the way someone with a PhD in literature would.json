    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of blue marbles that must be added to the bag in order to achieve a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of selecting a blue marble at random, we must first define the total number of marbles in the bag after adding more blue marbles. Let us denote this total number as $n$.\n\nCurrently, there are 5 blue marbles out of a total 20 marbles in the bag. This means that the probability of randomly selecting a blue marble from the bag is $\\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nAfter adding an additional $x$ blue marbles to the bag, the total number of blue marbles will be $5 + x$, and the total number of marbles in the bag will be $20 + x$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a blue marble at random from the new bag with $20 + x$ marbles is $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}$.\n\nTo find the value of $x$ such that the probability of selecting a blue marble is $\\frac{1}{2}$, we set $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and solve for $x$:\n\n$\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$2(5 + x) = 20 + x$\n\n$10 + 2x = 20 + x$\n\n$x = 10$\n\nTherefore, 10 blue marbles must be added to the bag so that the probability of selecting a blue marble at random is $\\frac{1}{2}$.",
