    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "Let \\(n\\) denote the number of blue marbles added to the bag. The total number of marbles will then be \\(20+n\\). The probability of selecting a blue marble at random from this new distribution is given by the ratio of the number of blue marbles to the total number of marbles, so this probability is given by \\(\\frac{5+n}{20+n}\\).\n\nWe want this probability to be \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so we set up the equation \\(\\frac{5+n}{20+n}=\\frac{1}{2}\\). Cross multiplying, we have \\(2(5+n)=20+n\\), which simplifies to \\(10+2n=20+n\\). From this equation, we find that \\(n=10\\).\n\nTherefore, 10 blue marbles must be added to the bag so that the probability of selecting a blue marble at random is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).",
