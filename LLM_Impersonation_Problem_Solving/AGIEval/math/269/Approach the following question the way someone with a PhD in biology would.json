In this case, the common factor is 4x, so we can factor the polynomial as:\n\n$4x(8x^2 - x + 5)$.\n\nNext, we look for factors of the quadratic trinomial $8x^2 - x + 5$. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this trinomial:\n\n$x = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(8)(5)}}{2(8)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 160}}{16}$\n\n$x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-159}}{16}$.\n\nSince the square root of -159 is not a real number, the quadratic trinomial $8x^2 - x + 5$ cannot be factored further in the real number system. Therefore, the factored form of the original polynomial is:\n\n$4x(8x^2 - x + 5)$.",
