First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",

After visiting the lottery stall, she has $2d$ dollars. She then spends $1024$ dollars in the first shop, leaving her with $2d - 1024$ dollars. \n\nFor each subsequent shop, the amount of money Stacy has follows the pattern:\n\n$2d - 1024 + 2n(1024) = 0$\n\nWhere $n$ is the number of times she has alternated between playing the lottery and getting her money doubled.\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n$2d - 1024 + 2048n = 0$\n\n$2d = 1024 - 2048n$\n\nTo minimize the initial amount $d$, we need to maximize the value of $n$, as $d$ is then reduced by a larger amount. The maximum value of $n$ occurs when she has visited all $10$ shops, so $n = 10$. Plugging this into our equation gives:\n\n$2d = 1024 - 2048(10)$\n\n$2d = 1024 - 20480$\n\n$2d = -19456$\n\n$d = -9728$\n\nHowever, since the initial amount of money must be positive, we take the absolute value of $-9728$ to get the minimum possible value of $d$, which is $\\boxed{9728}$.",
