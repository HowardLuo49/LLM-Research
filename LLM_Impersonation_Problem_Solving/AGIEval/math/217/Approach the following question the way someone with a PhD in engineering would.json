First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",

Let's denote the initial amount of money Stacy has as $d$. \n\nAfter Stacy visits the lottery stall, her money is doubled to $2d$. She then spends $1024$ dollars, leaving her with $2d - 1024$ dollars.\n\nAfter entering the first shop, Stacy alternates between doubling her money and spending $1024$ dollars. We can represent this scenario using the following series:\n\n$2d - 1024, 2(2d - 1024) - 1024, 2(2(2d - 1024) - 1024) - 1024, ...$\n\nWe can see that after visiting $n$ shops, Stacy's money will be given by:\n\n$2^{n-1}(2d - 1024) - 1024$\n\nWe know that she exits the last shop with no money left, so we can set the above equation to $0$ when $n=10$:\n\n$2^{10-1}(2d - 1024) - 1024 = 0$\n\n$2^9(2d - 1024) - 1024 = 0$\n\n$512(2d - 1024) - 1024 = 0$\n\n$1024d - 524288 - 1024 = 0$\n\n$1024d = 525312$\n\n$d = 513$\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of $d$ is $\\boxed{513}$.",
