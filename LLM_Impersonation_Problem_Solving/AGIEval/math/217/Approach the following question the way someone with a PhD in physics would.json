    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. Stacy has $d$ dollars. She enters a mall with $10$ shops and a lottery stall. First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",
    "solution": "1023",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem as a physicist, we can set up a mathematical model to describe Stacy's actions and track the amount of money she has at each step.\n\nLet the initial amount of money Stacy has be $d$ dollars. After visiting the lottery stall, she has $2d$ dollars. After visiting the first shop, she spends $1024$ dollars and has $2d-1024$ dollars left.\n\nLet $n$ be the number of times Stacy plays the lottery and enters a new shop (after the first shop). Since she started with $10$ shops, she will have $10-n$ shops left to visit.\n\nAt each step, Stacy doubles her current amount of money and then spends $1024$ dollars in a shop. Thus, the amount of money she has after each step can be described by the formula:\n\n$2^{n}(2d-1024) = 1024(10-n)$\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation yields:\n\n$2^{n+1}d - 2^{n+1}1024 = 10240 -1024n$\n\nRearranging the terms gives:\n\n$2^{n+1}d = 1024(10+n)$\n\nSince Stacy has no money left after visiting the last shop, we can set $n=9$ in the equation above. This gives:\n\n$2^{10}d = 1024(19)$\n\nSolving for $d$ gives:\n\n$d = \\frac{1024 \\times 19}{2^{10}} = 9.875$\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of $d$ for Stacy to end up with no money after visiting the last shop is $9.875, or $9\\frac{7}{8}$ dollars.",
