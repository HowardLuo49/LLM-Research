    "gpt_response": "To find the base-8 expression of the decimal number 8888, we need to convert it from base-10 to base-8. To do this, we divide the decimal number by the base of our desired conversion (8 in this case) repeatedly until the quotient is zero, keeping track of the remainders at each step. \n\nDividing 8888 by 8, we get a quotient of 1111 with a remainder of 0. Dividing 1111 by 8, we get a quotient of 139 with a remainder of 3. Dividing 139 by 8, we get a quotient of 17 with a remainder of 3. Dividing 17 by 8, we get a quotient of 2 with a remainder of 1. Dividing 2 by 8, we get a quotient of 0 with a remainder of 2. \n\nReading the remainders in reverse order gives us the base-8 expression for 8888, which is 21310. \n\nThe sum of the digits in the base-8 expression for 8888 is 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 7. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of the base-8 expression for $8888_{10}$ is 7.",
