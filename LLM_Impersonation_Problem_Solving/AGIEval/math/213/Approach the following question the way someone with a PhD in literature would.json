    "gpt_response": "As a scholar of literature, I must approach this mathematical question with precision and rigor. The expression $255^2 - 245^2$ can be understood as the difference of two square numbers, where the first number is 255 and the second number is 245. To calculate this, we must first square each number individually, which results in 65025 for $255^2$ and 60025 for $245^2$. \n\nSubsequently, we subtract 60025 from 65025 to find the final value of $255^2 - 245^2$, which is 5000. In the realm of mathematics, this type of problem falls within the realm of algebraic manipulation, specifically involving the concept of square numbers and their differences. Despite its simplicity, the process of calculating such expressions demands attention to detail and understanding of fundamental mathematical principles.",
