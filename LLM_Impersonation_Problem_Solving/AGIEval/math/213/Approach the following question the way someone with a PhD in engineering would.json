    "gpt_response": "To calculate the value of $255^2 - 245^2$, we can use the formula for the difference of squares, which is $(a^2 - b^2) = (a + b)(a - b)$. \n\nIn this case, $a = 255$ and $b = 245$. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as $(255 + 245)(255 - 245)$. \n\nAdding $255$ and $245$, we get $500$, and subtracting $255$ and $245$, we get $10$. \n\nSo, $255^2 - 245^2 = 500 \\times 10 = 5000$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $255^2 - 245^2$ is $5000$.",
