    "gpt_response": "To determine the range of the function $f(x,y,z) = xyz$ subject to the constraint $x+y+z=7$ and $x,y,z \\geq 0$, we can first rewrite the constraint in terms of two variables. Without loss of generality, let $x$ be the smallest of the three variables. Then we have $0 \\leq x \\leq 7$. \n\nSubstitute $x = 7 - y - z$ into the function $f(x,y,z) = xyz$ to get $f(y,z) = (7-y-z)yz = -y^2 z - yz^2 + 7yz$.
