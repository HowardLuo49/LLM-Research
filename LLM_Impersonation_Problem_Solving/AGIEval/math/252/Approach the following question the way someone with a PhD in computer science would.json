    "solution": "69",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers, we first need to find the smallest three-digit integer that is a multiple of 13. This can be done by dividing 100 (the smallest three-digit integer) by 13, which gives us 7 with a remainder of 9.\n\nThis means that the smallest three-digit multiple of 13 is 13 * 8 = 104. The largest three-digit multiple of 13 is 13 * 76 = 988.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers is given by the formula (last term - first term) / common difference + 1. In this case, the last term is 988, the first term is 104, and the common difference is 13.\n\nThus, the number of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers is (988 - 104) / 13 + 1 = 76 - 8 + 1 = 69.",
