    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers, we need to find the first and last three-digit multiples of 13. The first three-digit multiple of 13 can be found by dividing 100 by 13, which equals 7 with a remainder of 9. Therefore, the first three-digit multiple of 13 is 91. The last three-digit multiple of 13 can be found by dividing 999 by 13, which equals 76 with a remainder of 11. Therefore, the last three-digit multiple of 13 is 988. \n\nTo calculate the total number of three-digit multiples of 13, we subtract the first three-digit multiple of 13 from the last three-digit multiple of 13 and divide the result by 13, then add 1 to account for the first multiple:\n\n(988 - 91) / 13 + 1 = 70\n\nTherefore, there are 70 positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers.",
