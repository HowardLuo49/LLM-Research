    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers, we first need to determine the range of three-digit integers that are multiples of 13. \n\nThe smallest three-digit integer that is a multiple of 13 is 104 (13 x 8 = 104) and the largest three-digit integer that is a multiple of 13 is 988 (13 x 76 = 988). \n\nTo find the number of multiples of 13 in this range, we can use the formula for finding the number of integers in an arithmetic sequence. The formula is:\n\nn = (L - F) / d + 1\n\nwhere:\nn is the number of terms\nL is the last term in the sequence\nF is the first term in the sequence\nd is the common difference between terms\n\nIn this case, F = 104, L = 988, and d = 13. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nn = (988 - 104) / 13 + 1\nn = 76 - 8 + 1\nn = 69\n\nTherefore, there are 69 positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers.",
