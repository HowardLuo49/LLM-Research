    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers, we need to find the smallest three-digit integer that is a multiple of 13 and the largest three-digit integer that is a multiple of 13.\n\nThe smallest three-digit integer that is a multiple of 13 is 104, as 13 * 8 = 104.\n\nThe largest three-digit integer that is a multiple of 13 is 988, as 13 * 76 = 988.\n\nTo calculate the number of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers, we need to find the number of integers in the range from 104 to 988 (inclusive) that are multiples of 13. This can be done by dividing the difference between 988 and 104 by 13 and adding 1 to account for the inclusive endpoints.\n\nNumber of positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers = (988 - 104) / 13 + 1 = 76 - 8 + 1 = 69\n\nTherefore, there are 69 positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers.",
