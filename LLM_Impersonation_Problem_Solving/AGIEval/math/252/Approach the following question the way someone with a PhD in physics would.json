    "solution": "69",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many positive multiples of 13 are three-digit integers, we first need to establish the range of three-digit integers. A three-digit integer ranges from 100 to 999 inclusive.\n\nNext, we need to find the first multiple of 13 within this range, which is 13 * 8 = 104. This is the smallest three-digit multiple of 13.\n\nTo find the largest multiple of 13 within the three-digit range, we divide 999 by 13, which equals approximately 76.84. Therefore, the largest multiple of 13 within the range is 13 * 76 = 988.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of three-digit multiples of 13 by finding the difference between the number of multiples we found (76) and the first multiple (8), then adding 1 to account for the inclusive range. This gives us 76 - 8 + 1 = 69 three-digit multiples of 13.\n\nTherefore, there are 69 positive multiples of 13 that are three-digit integers.",
