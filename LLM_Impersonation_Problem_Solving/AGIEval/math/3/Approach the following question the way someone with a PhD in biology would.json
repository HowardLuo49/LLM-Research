    "solution": "110",
    "gpt_response": "To find the area of triangle $ABC$, we must first determine the length of side $AC$. Using the tangent ratio, we know that $\\tan \\angle CAB = \\frac{22}{7}$. We can set up a right triangle with angle $A$ and opposite side length of $22$ units, and adjacent side length of $7$ units. Therefore, the hypotenuse, which is side $AC$, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$AC^2 = 22^2 + 7^2$\n$AC^2 = 484 + 49$\n$AC^2 = 533$\n$AC = \\sqrt{533}$\n\nTherefore, the length of side $AC$ is $\\sqrt{533}$.\n\nNext, we can use the altitudes of the triangle to set up an equation involving the area of the triangle. Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from $A$ to side $BC$, then we can use the fact that the area of a triangle can be found using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AC \\times h$. \n\nSince the altitude divides $BC$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$, we can set up the equation $3h + 17h = h(3 + 17) = h(20) = \\sqrt{533}$. \n\nSolving for $h$, we get $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{533}}{20}$. \n\nFinally, substitute the values of $AC$ and $h$ into the formula to find the area of triangle $ABC$:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{533} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{533}}{20}$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{533}{20}$\n$A = \\frac{533}{40}$\n$A = \\frac{533}{40}$ square units\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{533}{40}$ square units.",
