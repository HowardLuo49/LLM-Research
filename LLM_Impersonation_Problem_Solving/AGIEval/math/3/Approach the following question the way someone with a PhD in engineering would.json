In triangle $ABC$, let $a$ be the length of segment $AC$, $b$ be the length of segment $BC$, and $h$ be the length of the altitude from $A$.\n\nWe have $\\tan(\\angle CAB) = \\frac{h}{b} = \\frac{22}{7}$, which implies $h = \\frac{22}{7}b$.\n\nSince the altitude from $A$ divides $BC$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$, we have $b = 3 + 17 = 20$.
