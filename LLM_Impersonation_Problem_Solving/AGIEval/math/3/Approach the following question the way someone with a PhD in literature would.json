    "solution": "110",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first recognize that the tangent of an angle in a triangle is equal to the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, $\\tan \\angle CAB = \\frac{22}{7}$. This means that the length of the side opposite to angle $CAB$ is $22$ and the length of the side adjacent to angle $CAB$ is $7$. \n\nNext, we need to determine the length of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. Since the altitude divides $BC$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$, we can infer that the altitude is $3+17 = 20$. \n\nNow, we have the base $BC = 20$ and height $h = 20$. The area of triangle $ABC$ can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Substituting the values we have, we get:\n\n$Area_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times 20 = 200$\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $200$ cubic units.",
