    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first use the information given to find the lengths of the other sides of the triangle. We know that the tangent of angle CAB is equal to the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\tan \\angle CAB = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{22}{7}$$\n\nWe can also express the area of the triangle in terms of the base $BC$ and the altitude $AD$ and use the information given to relate it to the lengths of the segments $BD$ and $DC$. Let $h$ be the length of the altitude $AD$. Then, the area of triangle $ABC$ is given by:\n\n$$\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BC \\cdot h$$\n\nSince the altitude divides $BC$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$, we have $BD = 3$ and $DC = 17$.
