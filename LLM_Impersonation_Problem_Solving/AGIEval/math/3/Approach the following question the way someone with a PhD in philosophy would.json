    "solution": "110",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first recognize that the tangent of an angle in a right triangle is equal to the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. In this case, $\\tan \\angle CAB = \\frac{22}{7}$ implies that the side opposite angle $A$ has length 22 and the side adjacent to angle $A$ has length 7.\n\nNext, we observe that the altitude from vertex $A$ divides side $BC$ into segments of length 3 and 17. This information can lead us to the realization that we are dealing with similar triangles. Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from vertex $A$. Using the properties of similar triangles, we have the following ratios:\n\\[\\frac{h}{3} = \\frac{h}{17} = \\frac{22}{7}\\]\nSolving for $h$, we find $h = \\frac{66}{7}$. \n\nNow that we have the altitude length, we can find the area of triangle $ABC$ using either of the sides as the base. Calculating the area using base $BC = 20$, we have:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times \\frac{66}{7} = 60\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is 60 square units.",
