    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first identify all possible pairs of numbers that can be chosen without replacement from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. These pairs are: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n\nWe must then determine for each pair whether their sum is greater than their product. For example, for the pair (1,2), the sum is 3 which is greater than the product 2. We can generalize this and determine that the only pairs for which the sum is greater than the product are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (2,3).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 10 possible pairs that can be chosen, and only 5 of them satisfy the condition that their sum is greater than their product. Thus, the probability that the sum is greater than the product is $\\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$.",
