Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",

    "gpt_response": "In this problem, we are given that the math textbook has a double-digit number of pages and that each section is $12$ pages long except for the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. We are also told that a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of each $5$th page, starting from the fifth page.\n\nLet's denote the number of sections in the textbook as $n$. Since each section except for the epilogue has $12$ pages, the total number of pages in all sections excluding the epilogue is $12n$. The epilogue has $11$ pages.\n\nIn total, the textbook has $12n + 11$ pages. Since this is a double-digit number, $12n$ must be in the form of $10, 20, 30, ...$. \n\nIf we assume that $12n = 10$, then $n = \\frac{10}{12}$ which is not an integer. Similarly, if $12n = 20$, then $n = \\frac{20}{12}$ is also not an integer. \n\nIf we consider $12n = 30$, then $n = \\frac{30}{12} = 2.5$ which is also not an integer. \n\nHowever, if $12n = 40$, then $n = \\frac{40}{12} = 3\\frac{1}{3}$. Since the question specifies that the number of sections is a positive integer, we must have $n = 3$, which means the textbook has $12 \\times 3 + 11 = 47$ pages.\n\nTherefore, the textbook has $47$ pages.",
