Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",
    "solution": "71",
    "gpt_response": "Let us consider the structure of the textbook as described. We have a total number of pages denoted by $N$, with each section being $12$ pages long except for the epilogue which is $11$ pages long. Let us denote the number of full sections as $k$ and the number of pages in the epilogue as $e$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$N = 12k + e$\n\nGiven that a trivia fact appears on the bottom of each $5$th page, we can express this relationship as:\n\n$5n = N - 1$\n\nwhere $n$ represents the number of trivia facts presented on each $5$th page.\n\nNow, we are given that a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, which means that there are at least $2$ trivia facts. Therefore, we have:\n\n$5n \\leq N - 2$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $N$ and $5n$ into this inequality, we get:\n\n$12k + e - 2 \\leq 12k + e - 1$\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n$e \\leq 1$\n\nSince the epilogue section must have at least $1$ page, we conclude that the epilogue consists of $1$ page. Therefore, the total number of pages in the textbook is:\n\n$N = 12k + 1$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the trivia fact on the second-to-last page, we get:\n\n$5n \\leq 12k + 1 - 2$\n\n$5n \\leq 12k - 1$\n\nThis indicates that the number of trivia facts is at most equal to $12k - 1$.\n\nHowever, we know that there must be at least $2$ trivia facts present in the textbook. Therefore, we have:\n\n$5n \\geq 2$\n\nSubstituting this inequality back into our previous equation, we find:\n\n$12k - 1 \\geq 2$\n\n$12k \\geq 3$\n\n$k \\geq \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSince $k$ must be a whole number, we deduce that $k$ must be equal to $1$. Therefore, the total number of pages in the textbook is:\n\n$N = 12(1) + 1 = 13$\n\nHence, the textbook contains $13$ pages in total.",
