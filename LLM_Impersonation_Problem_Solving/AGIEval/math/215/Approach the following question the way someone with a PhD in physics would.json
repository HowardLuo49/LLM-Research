Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",

    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the number of pages in the textbook. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:\n1. The textbook is split into sections, each $12$ pages long, except for the epilogue which is $11$ pages long. This gives us the equation $12m + 11 = n$ for some integer $m$ representing the number of complete sections.\n2. Trivia facts are presented on the bottom of every 5th page, starting from the fifth page. This means the 5th, 10th, 15th, ... pages are the ones with trivia facts. So, the second-to-last page must have a trivia fact, meaning there are $2$ pages remaining in the textbook after the second-to-last page. Since trivia facts appear on every 5th page, this implies $n-4$ is a multiple of $5$. Therefore, $n-4$ is of the form $5k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nCombining the two equations, we have:\n$12m + 11 = n$ and $n-4 = 5k$\n\nSubstitute $n = 12m + 11$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n$12m + 11 - 4 = 5k$\n$12m + 7 = 5k$\n$12m = 5k - 7$\n\nSince $12$ is not divisible by $5$, this equation has no integer solutions for $m$ and $k$. Therefore, there is no valid solution and the question as stated cannot be answered based on the information provided.",
