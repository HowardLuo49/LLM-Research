Each section is exactly $12$ pages long, with the exception of the epilogue, which is $11$ pages long. Every page belongs to a section. Furthermore, on the bottom of each $5$th page, a trivia fact is presented on the bottom of the page, starting from the fifth page. If a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then how many pages does the textbook have?",
    "solution": "71",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the total number of pages in the textbook as $N$. Since each section is $12$ pages long (except for the epilogue which is $11$ pages long), we can write the total number of pages as:\n\n$12x + 11 = N$\n\nwhere $x$ is the number of full sections in the textbook. \n\nNow, we know that a trivia fact appears on the bottom of each $5$th page starting from the fifth page. This means that the first trivia fact appears on page $5$, the second on page $10$, the third on page $15$, and so on. \n\nIf a trivia fact appears on the bottom of the second-to-last page, then it must have appeared on the bottom of page $N-1$. Since the trivia facts appear on the bottom of every $5$th page, we can write:\n\n$N - 1 = 5k$\n\nfor some integer $k$. \n\nSubstitute this into our first equation:\n\n$12x + 11 = 5k + 1$\n\nSince the total number of pages must be a double-digit number, the smallest possible value for $x$ is $1$ (since each section is $12$ pages long). Let's check if this satisfies the equation:\n\n$12(1) + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$12 + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$23 = 5k + 1$\n$22 = 5k$\n$k = 4.4$\n\nThis is not an integer, so $x = 1$ is not the correct number of sections. Let's try $x = 2$:\n\n$12(2) + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$24 + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$35 = 5k + 1$\n$34 = 5k$\n$k = 6.8$\n\nAgain, this is not an integer. Let's try $x = 3$:\n\n$12(3) + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$36 + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$47 = 5k + 1$\n$46 = 5k$\n$k = 9.2$\n\nThis is also not an integer. Let's try $x = 4$:\n\n$12(4) + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$48 + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$59 = 5k + 1$\n$58 = 5k$\n$k = 11.6$\n\nOnce again, this is not an integer. Let's try $x = 5$:\n\n$12(5) + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$60 + 11 = 5k + 1$\n$71 = 5k + 1$\n$70 = 5k$\n$k = 14$\n\nThis gives us a valid value for $k$. Therefore, the textbook must have $N = 5(14) + 1 = 71$ pages.",
