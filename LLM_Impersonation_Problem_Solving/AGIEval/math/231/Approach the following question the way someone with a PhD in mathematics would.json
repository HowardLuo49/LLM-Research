That is, we need to find the numbers that are both prime and odd.\n\nFrom the prime numbers less than 30, we see that 2 is not odd and can be excluded.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of the set of prime numbers less than 30 and the set of odd numbers greater than zero is {3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}, consisting of 9 elements.\n\nThus, there are 9 elements in the intersection of the two sets.",
