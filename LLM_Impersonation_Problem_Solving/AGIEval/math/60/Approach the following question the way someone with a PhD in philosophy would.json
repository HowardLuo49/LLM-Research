Pages numbered from 1 to 999 are under consideration, as the first and last pages are not included in the counting.\n\nNext, pages with single-digit page numbers need to be examined. The sum of the digits on each single-digit page number typically ranges between 1 and 18. Subsequently, whether a two-digit page number qualifies as a valid page number can be determined by computing the possible combinations of digit sums leading to 4. The same procedure can be followed for three-digit page numbers.\n\nBy adopting a thorough and systematic approach, the precise number of pages with page numbers having digits that sum up to 4 can be accurately calculated within the confines of a 1,000-page textbook, showcasing a meticulous and logical thought process reflective of a scholarly pursuit in the field of philosophy.",
