Since the textbook has 1,000 pages, the page numbers range from 1 to 1,000.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4. This can be achieved by breaking down the problem into cases based on the possible digit combinations that sum to 4. \n\nFor instance, the digit combinations that sum to 4 are {4, 0}, {3, 1}, and {2, 2}. To count the number of page numbers corresponding to each case, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the digits and arrange them within the page numbers. \n\nAfter determining the number of page numbers corresponding to each case, we can sum them up to find the total number of pages in the textbook where the digits add up to exactly 4.",
