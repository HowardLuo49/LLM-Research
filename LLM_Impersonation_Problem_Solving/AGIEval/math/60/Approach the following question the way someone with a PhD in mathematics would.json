    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by listing all possible ways that the digits of a page number can sum up to 4. These combinations are 4, 13, 22, 31, 112, 121, and 211. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of pages that correspond to each of these combinations. \n\nFor a 1-digit number (e.g., pages 4), there is only 1 possibility. \nFor a 2-digit number (e.g., pages 13), there are 2 possibilities (13 and 31).\nFor a 3-digit number (e.g., pages 112), there are 3 possibilities (112, 121, 211).\n\nTherefore, in total, there are:\n1 possibility for the sum of digits 4\n2 possibilities for the sum of digits 13\n3 possibilities for the sum of digits 22\n3 possibilities for the sum of digits 31\n6 possibilities for the sum of digits 112, 121, and 211.\n\nAdding these up, we have a total of 15 possibilities. \n\nSince each page number corresponds to 2 pages (front and back), the total number of pages with the sum of digits equal to 4 is 15 * 2 = 30 pages.\n\nTherefore, out of the 1,000 pages in the textbook, there are 30 pages whose page numbers have digits that add up to exactly 4.",
