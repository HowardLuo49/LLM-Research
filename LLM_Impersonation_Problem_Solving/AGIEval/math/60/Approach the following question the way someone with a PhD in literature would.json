    "gpt_response": "To determine how many pages in a 1,000 page textbook have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4, we must first establish the possible combinations of digits that sum to 4. These combinations include:\n-4, 0\n-3, 1\n-2, 2\n-1, 3\n-0, 4\n\nConsidering the first combination, wherein the digits are 4 and 0, there is only one possible page number in the range of the textbook that will have this sum of digits, which is page number 40. Therefore, there is only one page with this combination.\n\nFor the second combination, wherein the digits are 3 and 1, there are two possible page numbers that fit this criterion: 13 and 31.\n\nUpon considering the combination with the sum of digits is 2 and 2, there are multiple combinations of page numbers that result in this sum, including 22, 31, and 40. \n\nFurthermore, for the combination with the sum of digits is 1 and 3, there are two possible page numbers: 31 and 13.\n\nLastly, for the combination with the sum of digits is 0 and 4, there is again only one possible page number in the range of the textbook that meets this criterion, which is page number 04. \n\nIn total, there are a total of 1+2+3=6 pages in the 1,000 page textbook that have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4.",
