    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of subsets of the set of divisors of 72 containing only composite numbers, we first need to identify the divisors of 72. The divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\nAmong these divisors, the composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72. \n\nNow, we need to find the number of subsets that contain only these composite numbers. \n\nThere are a total of 9 composite numbers in the set of divisors of 72. Therefore, the total number of subsets containing only composite numbers can be calculated using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of composite numbers.\n\nIn this case, n = 9, so the total number of subsets containing only composite numbers is 2^9 = 512.\n\nTherefore, there are 512 subsets of the divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers, including the empty set.",
