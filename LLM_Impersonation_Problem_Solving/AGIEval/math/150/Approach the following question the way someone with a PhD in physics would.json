    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first find the divisors of 72. \n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is $2^3 \\times 3^2$. \n\nSo, the divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.\n\nNext, we need to find the composite numbers among these divisors. Composite numbers are numbers that have factors other than 1 and themselves. So, the composite numbers in the divisors of 72 are 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36.\n\nNow we need to find the subsets of the set of these composite divisors. There are a total of 8 composite divisors, including the empty set. \n\nTo find the number of subsets of a set with n elements, we use the formula $2^n$.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsets of the set of divisors of 72 that contain only composite numbers is $2^8 = 256$.",
