Two intersecting circles have a common chord of length 16 ft, and their centers lie on opposite sides of the chord. The radii of the circles are 10 ft and 17 ft respectively. Express the distance between the centers of the circles in feet.",
    "solution": "21",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the distance between the centers of the circles, we must first identify the point where the common chord intersects the line connecting the centers of the circles. This point can be found using basic geometry principles, as the common chord is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the circles.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the center of the circle with radius 10 ft and the point of intersection as x, and the distance between the center of the circle with radius 17 ft and the point of intersection as y.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can establish two equations:\n\nx^2 + 10^2 = (16-x)^2\ny^2 + 17^2 = (16-y)^2\n\nBy solving the above equations simultaneously, we can determine the values of x and y. Once we have x and y, we can find the distance between the centers of the circles by adding the distances x and y together.\n\nThis methodology requires a deep understanding of geometry and mathematical equations, and a literature PhD would likely approach this problem using logical reasoning and problem-solving skills similar to those used in literary analysis.",
