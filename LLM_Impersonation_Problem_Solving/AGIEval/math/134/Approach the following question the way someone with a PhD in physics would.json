Two intersecting circles have a common chord of length 16 ft, and their centers lie on opposite sides of the chord. The radii of the circles are 10 ft and 17 ft respectively.

Let's suppose the centers of the circles are A and B, the intersection point between the circles is C, and the common chord is AB.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of AC and BC. We can do this by considering triangles ABC and AOB as right triangles. The length of AB is already given as 16 ft, the length of AO is 10 ft, and the length of BO is 17 ft.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the lengths of AC and BC as follows:\n\nAC = sqrt(AB^2 - AO^2) = sqrt(16^2 - 10^2) = sqrt(256-100) = sqrt(156) = 2\u221a39 ft\nBC = sqrt(AB^2 - BO^2) = sqrt(16^2 - 17^2) = sqrt(256-289) = sqrt(-33) = i\u221a33 ft\n\nNow, we can use the law of cosines to find the distance between the centers of the circles, which is the length of segment AB:\n\nAB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2(AC)(BC)cos(\u2220C)\nAB^2 = (2\u221a39)^2 + (i\u221a33)^2 - 2(2\u221a39)(i\u221a33)cos(\u2220C)\nAB^2 = 4(39) - 33 - 4(39)(33)cos(\u2220C)\n16 = 156 - 33 - 156cos(\u2220C)\nCos(\u2220C) = 1/3\n\nFinally, the distance between the centers of the circles is given by:\n\nCD = sqrt(AC^2 + BC^2 - 2(AC)(BC)cos(\u2220C))\nCD = sqrt((2\u221a39)^2 + (i\u221a33)^2 - 2(2\u221a39)(i\u221a33)(1/3))\nCD = sqrt(4(39) - 33 - 4(39/3))\nCD = sqrt(156 - 33 - 52)\nCD = sqrt(88) = 2\u221a22 ft\n\nTherefore, the distance between the centers of the circles is 2\u221a22 ft.",
