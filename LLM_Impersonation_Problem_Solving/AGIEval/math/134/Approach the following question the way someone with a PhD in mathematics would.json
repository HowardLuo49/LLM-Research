Two intersecting circles have a common chord of length 16 ft, and their centers lie on opposite sides of the chord. The radii of the circles are 10 ft and 17 ft respectively. Express the distance between the centers of the circles in feet.",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can apply the property that the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle. Let's denote the distance between the center of the circle with radius 10 ft and the common chord as d1, and the distance between the center of the circle with radius 17 ft and the common chord as d2. \n\nSince the centers are on opposite sides of the chord, we can form a right triangle with d1, d2, and the distance between the centers of the circles (let's call this distance x) as the legs, and the common chord as the hypotenuse. Therefore, we can set up the following equations based on the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nd1^2 + x^2 = 17^2\nd2^2 + x^2 = 10^2\nd1 + d2 = 16\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations to find the value of x, which represents the distance between the centers of the circles. This mathematical approach allows us to determine the distance between the centers of the circles in feet.",
