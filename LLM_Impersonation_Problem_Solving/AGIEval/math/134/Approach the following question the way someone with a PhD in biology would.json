Two intersecting circles have a common chord of length 16 ft, and their centers lie on opposite sides of the chord. The radii of the circles are 10 ft and 17 ft respectively. Express the distance between the centers of the circles in feet.",
    "solution": "21",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometry involved. The distance between the centers of the circles can be expressed as the sum of the distance from the center of each circle to the common chord. \n\nLet's denote the distance between the centers of the circles as d, the radius of the smaller circle as r1=10 ft, and the radius of the larger circle as r2=17 ft. We can also denote the distance from the center of the smaller circle to the common chord as x, and the distance from the center of the larger circle to the common chord as y. \n\nSince the common chord is a perpendicular bisector of the line joining the centers of the circles, we can form right triangles with sides x, y, r1, and r2. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up two equations:\n\nx^2 + 8^2 = r1^2\ny^2 + 8^2 = r2^2\n\nFrom these equations, we can solve for x and y:\n\nx^2 = 100 - 64\nx = \u221a36\nx = 6 ft\n\ny^2 = 289 - 64\ny = \u221a225\ny = 15 ft\n\nNow, we can express the distance between the centers of the circles as:\n\nd = x + y + 16\nd = 6 + 15 + 16\nd = 37 ft\n\nTherefore, the distance between the centers of the circles is 37 ft.",
