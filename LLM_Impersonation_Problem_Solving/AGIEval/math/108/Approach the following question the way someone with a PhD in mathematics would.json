    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the three-digit number that has the same hundreds, tens, and units digit.\n\nLet the three-digit number be represented as XYZ, where X, Y, and Z are the same digit.\n\nSince the number has the same hundreds, tens, and units digit, we can express it as 111X, where X is a digit from 1 to 9.\n\nNext, we need to find the prime factors of the number 111X. The prime factorization of 111X is 3 * 37 * X.\n\nGiven that the sum of the prime factors of the number is 47, we have:\n\n3 + 37 + X = 47\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nX = 47 - 40\n\nX = 7\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number is 777.",
