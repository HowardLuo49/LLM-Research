    "solution": "777",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the concept of prime factors. Prime factors are the prime numbers that can be multiplied together to obtain a given number. In this case, the sum of the prime factors of the three-digit number is 47.\n\nWe are also given that the hundreds, tens, and units digit of the number are the same. Let's denote this digit by x. Therefore, the three-digit number can be represented as 100x + 10x + x, or 111x.\n\nNow, we need to find the prime factors of 111x and calculate their sum. Since 111 = 3 x 37, we can write the number as 3 x 37 x x. The sum of the prime factors is then calculated as 3 + 37 + x. According to the problem, this sum is equal to 47.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation as:\n\n3 + 37 + x = 47\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 47 - 3 - 37\nx = 7\n\nNow that we have found the value of x, we can substitute it back into the original expression for the three-digit number:\n\n111x = 111 x 7 = 777\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number that satisfies the given conditions is 777.",
