    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first identify all the three-digit numbers where the hundreds, tens, and units digits are the same. These numbers are 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, and 999.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the prime factors of each number and find the sum of these factors. After calculating the prime factors for each number, we find that the only number whose prime factors sum up to 47 is 444.\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number that meets the given conditions is 444.",
