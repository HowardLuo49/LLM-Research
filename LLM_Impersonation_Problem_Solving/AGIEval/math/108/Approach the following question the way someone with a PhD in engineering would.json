The only such number is 111. \n\nNext, we need to find the prime factors of 111. The prime factors of 111 are 3 and 37. \n\nThe sum of these prime factors is 3 + 37 = 40, not 47. \n\nTherefore, there is no three-digit number where all three digits are the same and the sum of the prime factors is 47.",
