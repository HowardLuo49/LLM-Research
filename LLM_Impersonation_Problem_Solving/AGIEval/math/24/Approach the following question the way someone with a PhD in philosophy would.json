Since $a\\equiv 16\\pmod{37}$ and $b\\equiv 21\\pmod{37}$, we can express $a$ and $b$ as follows: $a=37m+16$ and $b=37k+21$, where $m$ and $k$ are integers.\n\nNow, we can compute the difference $a-b$ as follows: \n\\begin{align*}\na-b &= (37m+16)-(37k+21) \\\\\n&= 37m+16-37k-21 \\\\\n&= 37(m-k)-5.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we have $a-b\\equiv -5\\pmod{37}$.
