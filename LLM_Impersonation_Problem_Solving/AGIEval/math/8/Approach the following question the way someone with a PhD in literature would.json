    "gpt_response": "To determine the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$, we must first consider the properties of polynomial addition. \n\nWhen adding two polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ of degrees $m$ and $n$ respectively, the resulting polynomial $f(x) + g(x)$ will have a degree that is equal to the maximum of $m$ and $n$. This is because when adding polynomials, like terms of the same degree are combined, and the degree of the resulting polynomial is determined by the highest degree term present in the sum.\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials of degree 7, the minimum possible degree of their sum $f(x) + g(x)$ would be 7, when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ have the same highest degree term. The maximum possible degree of their sum would also be 7, as this is the highest possible degree that can be achieved when adding two polynomials of degree 7.\n\nTherefore, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $7 \\times 7 = 49$.",
