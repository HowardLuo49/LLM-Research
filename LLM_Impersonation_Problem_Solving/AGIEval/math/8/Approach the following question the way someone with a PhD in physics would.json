    "gpt_response": "To find the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$, we first need to consider the degree of the sum of two polynomials. \n\nWhen adding two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is simply the larger of the two degrees. Given that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 7, the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ will also be 7.\n\nTherefore, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7*7=49.",
