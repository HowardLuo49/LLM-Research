    "solution": "0",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$, we first need to consider the possible scenarios for the degree of the sum of two polynomials. \n\nThe degree of a sum of polynomials is always less than or equal to the maximum degree of the polynomials being summed. Therefore, the maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ would be 7, which is the maximum degree of $f(x)$ or $g(x) in this case.\n\nNext, we consider the minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$. In order for the sum of two polynomials to have a degree less than 7, one of the polynomials must have a lower degree than the other. We can let one of the polynomials, say $f(x)$, have a degree of 0, and the other polynomial, $g(x)$, have a degree of 7. In this scenario, $f(x) + g(x)$ would have a degree of 7.\n\nTherefore, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 7.",
