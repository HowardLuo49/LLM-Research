    "solution": "0",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the degree of the sum of two polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we need to consider the highest degree terms in each polynomial. Since both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 7, the highest degree term in each would be $ax^7 + bx^7$, where $a$ and $b$ are the leading coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ respectively. \n\nAdding these highest degree terms together gives us $(a+b)x^7$, which implies that the sum $f(x) + g(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 7. Thus, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $7 \\times 7 = 49$.",
