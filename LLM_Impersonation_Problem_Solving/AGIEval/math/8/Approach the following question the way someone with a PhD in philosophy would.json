    "solution": "0",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the properties of polynomials and their degrees. \n\nA polynomial of degree $n$ can be represented in the form $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0$, where $a_n$ is the leading coefficient and $n$ is the highest power of $x$. \n\nGiven that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials of degree 7, we can represent them as $f(x) = a_7x^7 + a_6x^6 + ... + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_7x^7 + b_6x^6 + ... + b_0$, where $a_7$ and $b_7$ are the leading coefficients. \n\nThen, the sum $f(x) + g(x)$ will be a polynomial of degree at most 7, with the highest power term coming from adding the leading terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Therefore, the maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is equal to the maximum of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which is 7.\n\nOn the other hand, the minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ will occur when the leading terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ cancel each other out, resulting in a lower degree polynomial. This can happen when the leading coefficients have opposite signs. Therefore, the minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is equal to the minimum of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which is also 7.\n\nThus, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $7 \\times 7 = 49$.",
