An equiangular hexagon is a six-sided figure in which all interior angles are equal. This implies that each of the six sides is congruent to its adjacent sides.\n\nGiven the lengths of four consecutive sides as 1, 7, 2, and 4 units, we can deduce the lengths of the remaining two sides by considering the overall structure of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equiangular, we can determine the lengths of the remaining sides by continuing the pattern established by the known lengths.\n\nThe pattern of side lengths in the equiangular hexagon appears to alternately increase and decrease. By following this pattern, we can deduce that the lengths of the remaining sides are 7 and 1 units, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides is 7 + 1 = 8 units.",
