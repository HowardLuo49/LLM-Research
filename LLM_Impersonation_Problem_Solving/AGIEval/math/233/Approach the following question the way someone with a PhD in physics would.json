    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of an equiangular hexagon. An equiangular hexagon is a six-sided polygon where all interior angles are equal.\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the sides of the hexagon as a, b, c, d, e, and f. Since the hexagon is equiangular, each side is equal in length to its neighboring sides.\n\nGiven that the lengths of the four consecutive sides are 1, 7, 2, and 4 units, we can deduce the remaining lengths. Since the hexagon is equiangular, the lengths of the sides alternate between smaller and larger values. Therefore, the lengths of the sides are: 1, 7, 2, 4, 7, 1 units.\n\nThe sum of the remaining two sides is 7 + 1 = 8 units.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides of the equiangular hexagon is 8 units.",
