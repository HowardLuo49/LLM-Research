    "gpt_response": "In considering this geometric conundrum, we must first recognize the inherent properties of an equiangular hexagon. An equiangular hexagon is a six-sided polygon in which all angles are equal in measure. Additionally, the sides of an equiangular hexagon alternate between being of two different lengths. \n\nGiven the lengths of the four sides provided, we can infer a pattern in which the lengths increase and decrease in a specific order. The shortest and longest sides are clearly 1 unit and 7 units, respectively, with the remaining sides being 2 units and 4 units. This alternating pattern suggests that the lengths of the two remaining sides would be 1 unit and 7 units, respectively.\n\nThus, the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides of the equiangular hexagon would be 1 unit + 7 units = 8 units. This is the rigorous and logical conclusion derived from the understanding of the geometric properties of an equiangular hexagon.",
