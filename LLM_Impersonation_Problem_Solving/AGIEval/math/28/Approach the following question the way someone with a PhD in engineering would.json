    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability of forming a subcommittee with 1 member from each party, we first need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 members from the Senate committee.\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 3 members from 13 committee members = 13C3 = 286\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent for the subcommittee.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 Republican from 5 Republicans = 5C1 = 5\nNumber of ways to choose 1 Democrat from 6 Democrats = 6C1 = 6\nNumber of ways to choose 1 Independent from 2 Independents = 2C1 = 2\n\nTotal number of ways to choose 1 member from each party = 5 * 6 * 2 = 60\n\nTherefore, the probability of forming a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is given by:\n\nProbability = Number of ways to choose 1 member from each party / Total number of ways to choose 3 members from 13 committee members\nProbability = 60 / 286\nProbability \u2248 0.2098\n\nTherefore, the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is approximately 0.2098 or 20.98%.",
