A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{30}{143}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of the subcommittee consisting of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent, we first need to determine the total number of ways we can choose 3 members from the original Senate committee.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 members from a group of 13 (5 Republicans + 6 Democrats + 2 Independents) is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13-3)!) = 286.\n\nNext, we determine the number of ways to choose 1 member from each party to form the desired subcommittee. We have 5 choices for the Republican member, 6 choices for the Democrat member, and 2 choices for the Independent member.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 1 member from each party is:\n\n5 * 6 * 2 = 60.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\nP(subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent) = 60 / 286 \u2248 0.2097.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the subcommittee consisting of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is approximately 0.2097 or 20.97%.",
