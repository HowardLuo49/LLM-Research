A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of having 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent in the subcommittee, we need to first determine the total number of ways a subcommittee of 3 members can be chosen from the Senate committee.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 members from a group of 13 (5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents) can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n\nIn this case, the total number of ways to choose 3 members out of 13 is: C(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * 10!) = 286\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent for the subcommittee.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 Republican from 5 Republicans is: C(5, 1) = 5\nThe number of ways to choose 1 Democrat from 6 Democrats is: C(6, 1) = 6\nThe number of ways to choose 1 Independent from 2 Independents is: C(2, 1) = 2\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent for the subcommittee is: 5 * 6 * 2 = 60\n\nFinally, the probability of selecting a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: 60/286 = 0.2098 or approximately 20.98%.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of selecting a subcommittee consisting of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent from the Senate committee with 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents is approximately 20.98%.",
