A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability of selecting a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent, we first calculate the total number of possible subcommittees that can be formed from the pool of 13 members.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from 13 total members is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13-3)!) = 286\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent for the subcommittee. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 1 Republican from 5 Republicans is C(5, 1) = 5\nThe number of ways to choose 1 Democrat from 6 Democrats is C(6, 1) = 6\nThe number of ways to choose 1 Independent from 2 Independents is C(2, 1) = 2\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is: 5 * 6 * 2 = 60\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (60) by the total number of possible outcomes (286):\n\nP(1R, 1D, 1I) = 60 / 286 \u2248 0.209\n\nThus, the probability of selecting a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is approximately 0.209, or 20.9%.",
