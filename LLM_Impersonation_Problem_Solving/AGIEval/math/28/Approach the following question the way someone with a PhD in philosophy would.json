A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",

    "gpt_response": "To explore this question, we must first understand the concept of probability within the context of random selection. In this case, there are a total of 13 members in the Senate committee, with 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents. \n\nThe total number of ways to select a subcommittee of 3 members from the Senate committee can be determined using the combination formula, which is denoted as C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of choices and k is the number of choices being made.\n\nIn this scenario, we are interested in determining the probability of selecting 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent in the subcommittee. To calculate this probability, we must first determine the number of ways in which this specific combination can occur.\n\nThere are 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents in the Senate committee. Thus, in order to select 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent, we can choose 1 Republican from 5 options, 1 Democrat from 6 options, and 1 Independent from 2 options.\n\nThe total number of ways to select this combination is calculated as follows:\n\n(5C1) * (6C1) * (2C1) = 5 * 6 * 2 = 60\n\nNext, we must calculate the total number of ways to select a subcommittee of 3 members from the Senate committee, which is given by:\n\n13C3 = 13! / (3!(13-3)!) = 286\n\nFinally, to determine the probability of selecting 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent in the subcommittee, we divide the number of ways in which this combination can occur by the total number of ways to select a subcommittee of 3 members:\n\nProbability = 60 / 286 \u2248 0.209\n\nTherefore, the probability of randomly selecting 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent in the subcommittee is approximately 0.209.",
