    "gpt_response": "To evaluate $2911_{11}-1392_{11}$, we first need to align the numbers vertically, lining up the corresponding place values:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n& & 2 & 9 & 1 1 \\\\\n- & & 1 & 3 & 9 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n& & & & \n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the subtraction starting from the rightmost column (ones place). Since 2 - 2 equals 0, we write 0 in the ones place. Moving to the next column (elevens place), we have 1 - 9, which would require borrowing from the next column. However, since there's no more to borrow from, we must regroup with borrowing a 11 from the hundreds place. We then have 11 + 1 - 9 = 3 (A in base 11, representing 10). Therefore, we write A in the elevens place and regroup 1 to the hundreds column. In the next column (hundreds place), we then have 9 - 3 (considering the regrouped 1) = 6. Finally, in the thousands place, we have 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nThus, the result of $2911_{11}-1392_{11}$ is $16A1_{11}$.",
