    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, I must first approach this mathematical question with a careful and analytical eye. The equation presented involves an expression with cube roots, which requires a deeper understanding of algebraic manipulation.\n\nTo begin, we are given the equation $\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2$. To simplify this expression, I will cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube roots. This results in $(\\sqrt[3]{2x-4})^3 = 2^3(\\sqrt[3]{x+4})^3$, which simplifies to $2x-4 = 8(x+4)$.\n\nNext, I will expand and solve for $x$. This yields $2x-4 = 8x+32$, which simplifies to $-6x = 36$. Finally, dividing by -6 gives us $x = -6$. Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x = -6. \n\nIn conclusion, by applying algebraic manipulation and careful reasoning, I have successfully found the value of $x$ in the given equation. This demonstrates the importance of mathematical problem-solving skills in diverse academic disciplines, such as literature.",
