Attaching to adjacent sides:\nThere are 5 positions where the triangles can be attached to adjacent sides. In this case, the triangles could be attached to any two consecutive sides of the pentagon.

Attaching to opposite sides:\nThere are also 5 positions where the triangles can be attached to opposite sides. In this case, the triangles could be attached to any two sides of the pentagon that are not adjacent. This gives us 5 different possibilities for attaching the triangles in this manner.\n\n3. Attaching in a mix of adjacent and opposite sides:\nThere are 5 positions where the triangles can be attached in a mix of adjacent and opposite sides. In this case, one triangle could be attached to a pair of adjacent sides while the other triangle could be attached to a pair of opposite sides. This gives us 5 different possibilities for attaching the triangles in this manner.\n\nTherefore, in total, there are $5+5+5 = 15$ different non-congruent figures that can be constructed by attaching two equilateral triangles to the regular pentagon $ABCDE$ in the provided positions.",
