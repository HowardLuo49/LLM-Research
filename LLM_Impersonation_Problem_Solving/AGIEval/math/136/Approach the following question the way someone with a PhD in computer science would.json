The points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ are two non-consecutive vertices of a rhombus with an area of $80$ square units. One of the other vertices is $(0, K)$ where $K > 0$. What is the value of $K$?",

Since the area of the rhombus is 80 square units, we can use the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2$, where $A$ is the area of the rhombus, $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nGiven that the points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ are two non-consecutive vertices of the rhombus, the length of one side can be calculated as the distance between these two points, which is $8$ units.\n\nLet's call the length of the diagonal that connects the points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ as $d$. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we have two right-angled triangles with hypotenuse $d$ and sides of length $4$.
