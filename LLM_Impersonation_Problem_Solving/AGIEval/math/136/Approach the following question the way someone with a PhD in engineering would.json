    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by using the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2}d_1d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus.\n\nIn this case, we know that the two given points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ are the endpoints of one of the diagonals of the rhombus, which has a length of $8$ units. We are given that the area of the rhombus is $80$ square units. We can use this information to find the length of the other diagonal.\n\nSubstitute $A = 80$ and $d_1 = 8$ into the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}d_1d_2$ to get:\n\n$80 = \\frac{1}{2}(8)(d_2)$\n\n$80 = 4d_2$\n\n$d_2 = 20$\n\nNow that we have the lengths of both diagonals, we can find the height of the rhombus by finding the distance between the point $(0, K)$ and the line passing through the points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$.\n\nSince the height of the rhombus forms a right-angled triangle with the two given points, we can use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint of the diagonal line segment between $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$. The midpoint is $(0, 0)$.\n\nNext, we can calculate the equation of the line passing through $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$, which is the line $y = 0$. Thus, the height of the rhombus is the absolute value of the $y$-coordinate of the third vertex, which is $K$.\n\nSince the height is the perpendicular distance from the point $(0, K)$ to the line $y = 0$, the height is $K$. Therefore, $K = 20$.",
