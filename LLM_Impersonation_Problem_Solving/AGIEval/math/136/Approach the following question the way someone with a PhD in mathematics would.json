    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $K$, we first need to determine the length of one of the diagonals of the rhombus. \n\nSince the points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ are two non-consecutive vertices of the rhombus, the length of the diagonal connecting these two points is equal to the length of one side of the rhombus. Let's denote this length as $s$.\n\nThe area of a rhombus can be expressed as $A = \\frac{1}{2}d_1 \\cdot d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of the two diagonals. In this case, $A = 80$ and $d_1 = 2s$, since it connects the points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$.\n\nThus, we have $80 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2s \\cdot d_2$.\n\nSubstitute $s$ for $d_2$ as the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Thus, $\\frac{s}{2} = 4 \\implies s = 8$.\n\nSince the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can see that the third vertex $(0, K)$ must form a right triangle with the points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$. Thus, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for $K$.\n\nThe distance between $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ is $8$, and since $(0, K)$ is the midpoint, we have a right triangle with sides $4$, $K$, and $8$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, $4^2 + K^2 = 8^2$,\n\n$16 + K^2 = 64$\n\n$K^2 = 48$\n\n$K = \\sqrt{48}$\n\n$K = 4\\sqrt{3}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $K$ is $4\\sqrt{3}$.",
