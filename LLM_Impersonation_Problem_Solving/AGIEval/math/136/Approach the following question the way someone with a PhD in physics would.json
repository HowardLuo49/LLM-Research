    "gpt_response": "To begin, we need to recall the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is given by the product of its diagonals divided by 2. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, the length of each diagonal can be calculated as the distance between the two given points.\n\nThe distance between $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ is $8$ units, which represents the length of one of the diagonals of the rhombus. Let's denote this diagonal as $d_1$. Since the area of the rhombus is $80$ square units, we have:\n\n$80 = \\frac{d_1 \\cdot d_2}{2}$\n\nSubstituting $d_1 = 8$ into the equation gives:\n\n$80 = \\frac{8 \\cdot d_2}{2}$\n\nSolving for $d_2$ gives us the length of the other diagonal of the rhombus.\n\nNext, we need to find the distance between $(0, K)$ and the midpoint of the diagonal $d_1 = 8$, which is $(0, 0)$. This distance is equal to $K$, the $y$-coordinate of the unknown vertex of the rhombus.\n\nBy using the distance formula, the length of $d_2$, and the midpoint formula for the diagonal, the value of $K$ can be calculated by combining these concepts. After solving the algebraic equations, we will determine the precise value of $K$ that satisfies the conditions given.",
