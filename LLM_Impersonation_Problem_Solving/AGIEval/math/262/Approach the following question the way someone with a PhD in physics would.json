    "gpt_response": "Let the three consecutive positive even numbers be represented as $2n$, $2n+2$, and $2n+4$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the squares of these three numbers is $12296$, so we can write:\n\n$$(2n)^2 + (2n+2)^2 + (2n+4)^2 = 12296$$\n\nExpanding this equation:\n\n$$4n^2 + 4n^2 + 8n + 4 + 4n^2 + 16n + 16 = 12296$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$12n^2 + 24n + 20 = 12296$$\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n$$12n^2 + 24n - 12276 = 0$$\n\nNow we can solve this quadratic equation for $n$.
