    "gpt_response": "Firstly, let's represent the three consecutive positive even numbers as $2x$, $2(x+1)$, and $2(x+2)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. \n\nAccording to the given information, the equation we have is:\n$$(2x)^2 + (2(x+1))^2 + (2(x+2))^2 = 12296$$\nSimplifying this, we get:\n$$4x^2 + 4(x+1)^2 + 4(x+2)^2 = 12296$$\n$$4x^2 + 4(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 4(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 12296$$\n$$4x^2 + 4x^2 + 8x + 4 + 4x^2 + 16x + 16 = 12296$$\n$$12x^2 + 24x + 20 = 12296$$\n$$3x^2 + 6x + 5 = 3074$$\n\nNow, to find the values of $x$ for which this equation holds, we can either factorize the equation or use the quadratic formula. Solving this quadratic equation, we get:\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5}}{6}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{36-60}}{6}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{-24}}{6}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-6 \\pm 2i\\sqrt{6}}{6}$$\n$$x = \\frac{-3 \\pm i\\sqrt{6}}{3}$$\n\nSince we are looking for a positive integer value for $x$, we see that $x = 1$ is the only valid solution. \n\nThus, the three consecutive positive even numbers are $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$, $2 \\cdot (1+1) = 4$, and $2 \\cdot (1+2) = 6$.\n\nThe product of these numbers is $2 \\times 4 \\times 6 = 48$.
