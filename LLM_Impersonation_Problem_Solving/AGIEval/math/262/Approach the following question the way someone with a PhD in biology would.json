According to the given information, the sum of the squares of these numbers can be expressed as:\n\n(2n)^2 + (2n+2)^2 + (2n+4)^2 = 12296\n\nExpanding and simplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n4n^2 + 4(n+1)^2 + 4(n+2)^2 = 12296\n4n^2 + 4n^2 + 8n + 4 + 4n^2 + 16n^2 + 32n + 16 = 12296\n24n^2 + 40n + 20 = 12296\n24n^2 + 40n - 12276 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for n, we get:\n\nn = (-40 \u00b1 sqrt(40^2 - 4*24*(-12276))) / 2*24\nn = (-40 \u00b1 sqrt(1600 + 1176192)) / 48\nn = (-40 \u00b1 sqrt(1177792)) / 48\nn = (-40 \u00b1 1085.98) / 48\n\nSince we are looking for positive values of n, we can choose:\n\nn = (-40 + 1085.98) / 48\nn \u2248 21.2\n\nThis value of n is not an integer, so we need to re-evaluate our initial assumption that the numbers are consecutive positive even numbers.
