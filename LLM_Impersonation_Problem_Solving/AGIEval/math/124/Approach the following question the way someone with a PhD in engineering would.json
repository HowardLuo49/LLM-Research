    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. One ticket to a show costs $\\$20$ at full price. Susan buys $4$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $25\\%$ discount. Pam buys $5$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $30\\%$ discount. How many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?",
    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total amount Susan paid for the tickets, we start by determining the discount she received. The $25\\%$ discount means she effectively paid $75\\%$ of the original price. This gives us that each ticket costs $0.75 \\times 20 = \\$15$. Therefore, the total amount Susan paid for $4$ tickets is $4 \\times 15 = \\$60$.\n\nSimilar to Susan, we compute the total amount Pam paid for the tickets. The $30\\%$ discount implies she paid $70\\%$ of the original price per ticket. Therefore, Pam paid $0.7 \\times 20 = \\$14$ per ticket, and thus the total amount she paid for $5$ tickets is $5 \\times 14 = \\$70$.\n\nTo determine how many more dollars Pam paid than Susan, we calculate the difference between the total amount Pam paid and the total amount Susan paid. This difference is $70 - 60 = \\$10$.\n\nTherefore, Pam paid $\\$10$ more than Susan for their tickets.",
