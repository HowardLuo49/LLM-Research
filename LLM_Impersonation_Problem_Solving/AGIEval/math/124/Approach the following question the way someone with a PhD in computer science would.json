    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first calculate the discounted price for each ticket purchased by Susan and Pam.\n\nFor Susan:\nDiscounted price per ticket = $20 - 0.25 \\times 20 = 15$\nTotal cost for Susan = $4 \\times 15 = 60$\n\nFor Pam:\nDiscounted price per ticket = $20 - 0.30 \\times 20 = 14$\nTotal cost for Pam = $5 \\times 14 = 70$\n\nTo find the difference in amount paid by Pam and Susan, we subtract the total cost paid by Susan from the total cost paid by Pam:\n$70 - 60 = 10$\n\nTherefore, Pam pays \\$10 more than Susan.",
