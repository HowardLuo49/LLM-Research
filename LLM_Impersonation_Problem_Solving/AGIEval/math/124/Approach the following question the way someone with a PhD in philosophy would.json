    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. One ticket to a show costs $\\$20$ at full price. Susan buys $4$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $25\\%$ discount. Pam buys $5$ tickets using a coupon that gives her a $30\\%$ discount. How many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?",
    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "Let us start by analyzing the price that Susan pays for her tickets. Since she has a coupon that gives her a $25\\%$ discount, she will pay $75\\%$ of the original price for each ticket. This means that each ticket for Susan costs $0.75 \\times \\$20 = \\$15$. Therefore, the total amount that Susan pays for $4$ tickets is $4 \\times \\$15 = \\$60$.\n\nSimilarly, Pam will pay $70\\%$ of the original price for each ticket, since she has a $30\\%$ discount. This means that each ticket for Pam costs $0.70 \\times \\$20 = \\$14$. Therefore, the total amount that Pam pays for $5$ tickets is $5 \\times \\$14 = \\$70$.\n\nTo find the difference in the amount that Pam pays compared to Susan, we calculate $ \\$70 - \\$60 = \\$10$. Therefore, Pam pays $\\$10$ more than Susan for the tickets.",
