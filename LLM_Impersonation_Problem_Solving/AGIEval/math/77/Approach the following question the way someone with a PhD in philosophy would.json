    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. An ice cream cone consists of a sphere of vanilla ice cream and a right circular cone that  has the same diameter as the sphere. If the ice cream  melts, it will exactly fill the cone.  Assume that the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream. What is the ratio of the cone's height to its radius? (Note: A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\pi r^2 h/3$, and a sphere with radius $r$ has volume $4\\pi r^3/3$.)",

The transformation of solid frozen ice cream into its melted liquid form offers a profound meditation on the dynamic and impermanent nature of material existence. The transition from a coherent sphere, representing stability and order, to a fluid mass conforming to the shape of the cone bears resemblance to the broader philosophical concept of change and mutability.\n\nTurning our attention to the mathematical aspect of the question, we are presented with the task of determining the ratio of the height to the radius of the cone. To begin our analysis, let us denote the radius of the sphere (frozen ice cream) as $r$ and the height and radius of the cone as $h$ and $r$ respectively.\n\nThe volume of the sphere is given by $V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$.\n\nSince the melted ice cream fills the cone completely, the volume of the melted ice cream is equal to the volume of the cone, which is given by $V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$.\n\nGiven that the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream, we have the equation:\n\n$0.75 \\cdot V_{\\text{sphere}} = V_{\\text{cone}}$\n$0.75 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$\n$3r = h$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the cone's height to its radius is $h : r = 3 : 1$. \n\nIn conclusion, the mathematical solution to the given problem yields a ratio that is consistent with the intuitive geometric properties of a right circular cone.
