    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. An ice cream cone consists of a sphere of vanilla ice cream and a right circular cone that  has the same diameter as the sphere. If the ice cream  melts, it will exactly fill the cone.  Assume that the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream. What is the ratio of the cone's height to its radius? (Note: A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\pi r^2 h/3$, and a sphere with radius $r$ has volume $4\\pi r^3/3$.)",

    "gpt_response": "To address this problem, we first need to determine the volume of the frozen ice cream cone. Since the cone and sphere have the same diameter, the radius of the cone, \\( r_c \\), is equal to the radius of the sphere, \\( r_s \\). The volume of the cone can be expressed as \\( \\frac{\\pi r_c^2 h}{3} \\), where \\( h \\) is the height of the cone. The volume of the sphere is \\( \\frac{4 \\pi r_s^3}{3} = \\frac{4 \\pi r_c^3}{3} \\).\n\nGiven that the melted ice cream fills the cone once melted, we can express the volume of the melted ice cream as \\( 0.75 \\) times the volume of the frozen ice cream cone. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\( 0.75 \\cdot \\frac{4 \\pi r_c^3}{3} = \\frac{\\pi r_c^2 h}{3} \\)\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\n\\( 3r_c = h \\)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the cone's height to its radius. Substituting \\( h = 3r_c \\) into the formula for the volume of the cone gives:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\pi r_c^2 (3r_c)}{3} = \\pi r_c (r_c) = \\pi r_c^2 \\)\n\nThus, the ratio of the cone's height to its radius is \\( 3r_c : r_c = \\boxed{3 : 1} \\).",
