    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 and exactly two dice showing a 2, we first need to determine the total number of outcomes. Since each die has 6 sides, there are 6^6 possible outcomes when rolling six dice.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways we can have exactly two 1's and two 2's. This can be calculated using combinational mathematics. There are 6 ways to choose the two dice that show a 1, and then there are 4 ways to choose the two dice that show a 2 (since we've already used two of the dice for the 1's). Finally, the remaining two dice can show any of the remaining 4 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to get exactly two 1's and two 2's is given by :\n\n6C2 * 4C2 * 4^2 = (6!/(2!4!)) * (4!/(2!2!)) * 16 = 15 * 6 * 16 = 1440\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes\nProbability = 1440 / 6^6\nProbability = 1440 / 46656\nProbability = 5 / 162\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show a 1 and exactly two of the dice show a 2 is 5/162.",
