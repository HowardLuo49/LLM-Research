    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we must first calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice. Since each die has 6 sides, there are 6^6 total outcomes.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways in which exactly two of the dice show a 1 and exactly two of the dice show a 2. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 6 dice and k = 2 dice showing 1 and 2, respectively. So the number of ways to choose 2 out of 6 dice to show a 1 is C(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 dice to show a 2 is C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to get exactly two 1s and exactly two 2s by the number of ways to arrange the remaining two dice, which can take on any of the four remaining values (3, 4, 5, 6). There are 4^2 = 16 ways to arrange the two remaining dice.\n\nTherefore, the total number of desired outcomes is 15 * 6 * 16 = 1440.\n\nFinally, we divide the number of desired outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes to get the probability:\n\nProbability = 1440 / 6^6 = 1440 / 46656 = 20 / 729\n\nThus, the probability that exactly two of the dice show a 1 and exactly two of the dice show a 2 is 20/729.",
