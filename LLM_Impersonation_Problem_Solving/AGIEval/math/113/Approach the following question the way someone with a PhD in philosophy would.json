    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 and exactly two dice showing a 2 when rolling six 6-sided dice, we must first determine the total number of ways this outcome can occur.\n\nThere are 6 choices for which two dice will show a 1 and ${6 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose the 2 positions for the dice showing the two 1s. Similarly, there are 6 choices for which two dice will show a 2 and ${4 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose the 2 positions for the dice showing the two 2s. The remaining two dice can show any of the 4 remaining numbers, and each has 4 choices. Therefore, the total number of ways to obtain the desired outcome is:\n\n6 * ${6 \\choose 2}$ * 6 * ${4 \\choose 2}$ * $4^2$ = 15,360\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice is $6^6 = 46656$. Therefore, the probability of rolling exactly two 1s and two 2s is:\n\n15,360 / 46,656 = 320 / 972 = 40 / 121\n\nTherefore, the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 and exactly two dice showing a 2 when rolling six 6-sided dice is 40/121.",
