    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the probability of exactly two dice showing a 1 and two dice showing a 2, we must first calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six 6-sided dice. Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, the total number of outcomes is 6^6=46656.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways we can have exactly two dice show a 1 and two dice show a 2. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations, which is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!. In this case, we need to choose 2 out of 6 dice to show a 1, which can be done in 6C2 ways. Similarly, we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 dice to show a 2, which can be done in 4C2 ways. Therefore, the number of ways to have exactly two dice show a 1 and two dice show a 2 is 6C2 * 4C2 = 15 * 6 = 90.\n\nFinally, to calculate the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 90/46656 = 15/7776. Therefore, the probability that exactly two dice show a 1 and two dice show a 2 is 15/7776.",
