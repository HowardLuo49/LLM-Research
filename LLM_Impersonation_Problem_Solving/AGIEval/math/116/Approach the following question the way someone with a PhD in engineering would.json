    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all the rational terms in the expansion of $(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt[3]{3})^{12}$, we need to consider the Binomial Theorem. \n\nThe general form of the Binomial Theorem states that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$ and any positive integer $n$, \n\\[(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k}b^k,\\]\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the binomial coefficient.\n\nIn our case, we have $a = \\sqrt{2}$ and $b = \\sqrt[3]{3}$, with $n = 12$. Therefore, the expansion of $(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt[3]{3})^{12}$ will include terms of the form \n\\[\\binom{12}{k} (\\sqrt{2})^{12-k} (\\sqrt[3]{3})^k.\\]\n\nIn order for a term to be rational, the powers of $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{3}$ must combine to give integers. We know that $\\sqrt{2}^2 = 2$ and $\\sqrt[3]{3}^3 = 3$, so let's find which powers of $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{3}$ will yield integers when multiplied.\n\nThe powers of $\\sqrt{2}$ in our expansion will be $12 - k$, so we need $12-k$ to be even for $\\sqrt{2}^{12-k}$ to yield an integer. This means $k$ must be even.\n\nThe powers of $\\sqrt[3]{3}$ in our expansion will be $k$, so we need $k$ to be a multiple of $3$ for $\\sqrt[3]{3}^{k}$ to yield an integer.\n\nTherefore, the only terms in the expansion that will be rational are those where $k$ is both even and a multiple of $3$. \n\nFrom $k$ being a multiple of $3$ and even, we find that $k$ must be a multiple of $6$.\n\nSo, the sum of all the rational terms in the expansion of $(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt[3]{3})^{12}$ will be the sum of terms of the form \n\\[\\binom{12}{6i} (\\sqrt{2})^{12-6i} (\\sqrt[3]{3})^{6i},\\]\nwhere $i$ ranges from $0$ to $2$. \n\nNow, we can compute these terms using the binomial coefficient and the properties of radicals to find the desired sum.",
