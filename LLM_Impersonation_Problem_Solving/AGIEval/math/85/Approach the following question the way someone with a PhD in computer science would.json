If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win, we need to consider all possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities.\n\nBeth is rolling a fair six-sided die, so the probability of rolling each number is 1/6.\n\nBeth can roll a 2, 3, 5 and win 1 dollar each time. The probability of rolling a 2, 3 or 5 is 1/6 each, so the total probability of winning 1 dollar is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nBeth can roll a 4 or 6 and lose 1 dollar each time. The probability of rolling a 4 or 6 is 1/6 each, so the total probability of losing 1 dollar is 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nBeth rolls a 1 and nothing happens, so the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6.\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is:\n\n(1/2 * $1) + (1/3 * (-$1)) + (1/6 * $0) = $1/2 - $1/3 = $3/6 - $2/6 = $1/6\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is $1/6.",
