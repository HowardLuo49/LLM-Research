If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{1}{6}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected value, we first need to determine the probability of each outcome and the amount of money won or lost for each outcome.\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair 6-sided die: rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Out of these outcomes, only 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers, while 4 and 6 are composite numbers.\n\nThe probability of rolling a prime number is 3/6 = 1/2, and the probability of rolling a composite number is 2/6 = 1/3. The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6.\n\nIf Beth rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, so the amount of money won in this case is 1. If she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar, so the amount of money won or lost in this case is -1. If she rolls a 1, nothing happens, so the amount of money won or lost in this case is 0.\n\nNow we can calculate the expected value:\n\nExpected value = (Probability of winning * Amount won) + (Probability of losing * Amount lost) + (Probability of nothing happening * Amount won/lost)\nExpected value = (1/2 * 1) + (1/3 * (-1)) + (1/6 * 0)\nExpected value = 1/2 - 1/3\nExpected value = 3/6 - 2/6\nExpected value = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 1/6.",
