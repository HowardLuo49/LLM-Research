If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{1}{6}",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win, we must first calculate the probabilities of rolling each possible outcome.\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Of these, 1 is neither prime nor composite, so Beth will neither win nor lose money if she rolls a 1.\n\nFor the remaining numbers, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:\n- The probability of rolling a prime number (2, 3, or 5) is 3/6 = 1/2.\n- The probability of rolling a composite number (4 or 6) is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value:\n- If Beth rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar with a probability of 1/2.\n- If Beth rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar with a probability of 1/3.\n\nThe expected value can be calculated as:\nExpected value = (1/2)*(1) + (1/3)*(-1)\nExpected value = 1/2 - 1/3\nExpected value = 3/6 - 2/6\nExpected value = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 1/6.",
