If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win when rolling the die once, we must first identify the probabilities associated with each outcome.\n\nWhen rolling a fair six-sided die, there are 6 equally likely outcomes: rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Of these outcomes, the prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5, which means that there is a probability of 3/6 or 1/2 of winning 1 dollar. The composite numbers are 4 and 6, with a probability of 2/6 or 1/3 of losing 1 dollar. Finally, rolling a 1 does not result in any change to Beth's balance.\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected value using the formula:\n\nExpected value = (Probability of winning * Amount won) + (Probability of losing * Amount lost)\n\nSubstitute the probabilities and amounts into the formula:\n\nExpected value = (1/2 * 1) + (1/3 * (-1))\nExpected value = 1/2 - 1/3\nExpected value = 3/6 - 2/6\nExpected value = 1/6\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is 1/6.",
