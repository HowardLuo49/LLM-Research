We recognize that the given expression is a quadratic polynomial that can be factored into two linear factors. This process of factoring involves understanding how to break down the polynomial into its constituent parts, which in this case are represented by the integers $A$ and $B$.\n\nIn order to find the values of $A$ and $B$, we need to first expand the expression $(Ax-8)(Bx+3)$ and equate it to the original polynomial $10x^2-x-24$. By doing so, we can compare the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation and derive a system of equations that will allow us to solve for $A$ and $B.\n\nUpon expanding the expression and simplifying, we find that $ABx^2 + (3A-8B)x - 24 = 10x^2 - x - 24$. By equating the coefficients of the corresponding terms on both sides of the equation, we obtain the following system of equations:\n\n$AB = 10$\n$3A - 8B = -1$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find that $A = 2$ and $B = 5$. Therefore, $AB + B = 2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15$.\n\nIn conclusion, as a philosopher with a PhD, we recognize the importance of understanding the mathematical processes involved in solving problems such as this one.
