A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",
    "solution": "48",
    "gpt_response": "In this situation, we can consider the planes as distinguishable objects and the runways as distinguishable slots. Since each plane can take off from either runway, we have 2 choices for each of the 3 planes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the three takeoffs can be scheduled is 2*2*2 = 8 ways.\n\nHence, there are 8 ways in which the blue, red, and white planes can be scheduled to take off from the airport.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 48?: In this situation, we can consider the planes as distinguishable objects and the runways as distinguishable slots.
