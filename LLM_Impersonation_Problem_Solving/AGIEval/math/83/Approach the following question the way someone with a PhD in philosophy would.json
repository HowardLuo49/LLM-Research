A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",
    "solution": "48",
    "gpt_response": "In considering the scheduling of the three planes for takeoff, we must take into account the order in which they are allowed to depart, as well as the runway from which they can depart. Let us denote the blue plane as B, the red plane as R, and the white plane as W. The planes can depart in the following sequences:\n\n1. B, R, W\n2. B, W, R\n3. R, B, W\n4. R, W, B\n5. W, B, R\n6. W, R, B\n\nEach of these sequences can be executed on either of the two runways. Therefore, for each sequence, there are 2 ways in which it can be scheduled in terms of the choice of runway. Thus, there are a total of 6 * 2 = 12 ways in which the three planes can be scheduled to take off from the airport.",
