A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",
    "solution": "48",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways in which the three planes can be scheduled for takeoff, we need to consider the total number of possible permutations. Since there are two runways available for takeoff and each plane can take off from either runway, there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for the three planes.\n\nHowever, not all of these combinations are distinct. For example, the combination where all three planes take off from runway A is equivalent to the combination where all three planes take off from runway B. Therefore, we need to eliminate duplicates from our count.\n\nTo do this, we can consider the number of ways in which the three planes can be divided among the two runways. There are three possibilities for this division: 1-1-1, 2-1-0, and 3-0-0. \n\nFor the 1-1-1 division, there are a total of 3! = 6 ways in which the planes can be scheduled. \n\nFor the 2-1-0 division, there are 3 ways to choose the runway for the two planes and 2 ways to choose the runway for the remaining plane, giving a total of 3*2 = 6 ways.\n\nFor the 3-0-0 division, there is only 1 way in which the planes can be scheduled.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct ways in which the three planes can be scheduled for takeoff is 6 (1-1-1) + 6 (2-1-0) + 1 (3-0-0) = 13 ways.",
