A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",
    "solution": "48",
    "gpt_response": "This question can be approached by analyzing the permutations of the three planes taking off from the two runways. \n\nWe can consider the different ways in which the planes can take off from the runways. Since each plane must take off one at a time, we can consider the order of takeoffs. \n\nWe can first calculate the number of ways in which the blue plane can take off. It has two choices of runways, so the blue plane can take off in 2 ways. \n\nOnce the blue plane has taken off, there are two planes left to take off - the red and white planes. Both of these planes also have two choices of runways to take off from, so they can each take off in 2 ways. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways in which the three takeoffs can be scheduled is 2 (ways for the blue plane) * 2 (ways for the red plane) * 2 (ways for the white plane) = 8 ways. \n\nTherefore, there are 8 different ways in which the three planes can be scheduled to take off from the airport.",
