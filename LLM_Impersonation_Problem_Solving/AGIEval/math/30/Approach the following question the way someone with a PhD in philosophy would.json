    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. Theo has one sphere with radius 5; Akshaj has two spheres with radius 2.  What is the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres?",
    "solution": "\\frac{25}{8}",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first calculate the surface areas of the spheres in question. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nFor Theo's sphere with a radius of 5, the surface area would be:\n4\u03c0(5^2) = 4\u03c0(25) = 100\u03c0\n\nFor Akshaj's spheres with a radius of 2, each sphere would have a surface area of:\n4\u03c0(2^2) = 4\u03c0(4) = 16\u03c0\n\nSince Akshaj has two spheres, their total surface area would be:\n2 * 16\u03c0 = 32\u03c0\n\nThus, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres can be calculated as:\n100\u03c0 / 32\u03c0 = 100 / 32 = 25 / 8\n\nThis ratio simplifies to 25:8.\n\nIn conclusion, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 25:8. This mathematical comparison reveals the relationship between the surface areas of the given spheres, providing a quantitative understanding of their geometric properties.",
