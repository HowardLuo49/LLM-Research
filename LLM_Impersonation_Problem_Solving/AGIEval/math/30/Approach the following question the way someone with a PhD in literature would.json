    "gpt_response": "In analyzing this problem, we must first understand the formula for finding the surface area of a sphere, which is given by A=4\u03c0r^2, where A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere. \n\nTherefore, the surface area of Theo's sphere can be calculated as A_theo = 4\u03c0(5)^2 = 100\u03c0.\n\nSimilarly, the surface area of one of Akshaj's spheres can be calculated as A_akshaj = 4\u03c0(2)^2 = 16\u03c0. Since Akshaj has two spheres, the total surface area of his spheres is 2A_akshaj = 32\u03c0.\n\nTo find the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres, we divide A_theo by the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres:\n\nRatio = A_theo / (2A_akshaj) = 100\u03c0 / (32\u03c0) = 25 / 8.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 25:8.",
