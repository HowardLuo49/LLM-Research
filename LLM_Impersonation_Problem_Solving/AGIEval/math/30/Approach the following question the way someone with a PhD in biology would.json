    "gpt_response": "To calculate the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula 4\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the sphere. \n\nThe surface area of Theo's sphere can be calculated as 4\u03c0(5)^2 = 4\u03c0(25) = 100\u03c0.\n\nThe surface area of one of Akshaj's spheres can be calculated as 4\u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0(4) = 16\u03c0. Since Akshaj has two spheres, the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 2 * 16\u03c0 = 32\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 100\u03c0 : 32\u03c0, which simplifies to 25:8.",
