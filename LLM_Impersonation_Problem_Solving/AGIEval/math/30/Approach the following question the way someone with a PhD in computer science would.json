    "solution": "\\frac{25}{8}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula 4*pi*r^2, where r is the radius of the sphere. \n\nFor Theo's sphere with radius 5, the surface area would be 4*pi*5^2 = 4*pi*25 = 100*pi. \n\nFor Akshaj's spheres with radius 2, each sphere has a surface area of 4*pi*2^2 = 4*pi*4 = 16*pi. Since Akshaj has two spheres, the total surface area of both spheres would be 2*16*pi = 32*pi.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of Theo's sphere surface area to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 100*pi / 32*pi, which simplifies to 100/32, or 25/8.",
