    "gpt_response": "To find the surface area of a sphere, we use the formula A = 4\u03c0r^2, where A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nTheo's sphere has a radius of 5, so its surface area is A_theo = 4\u03c0(5)^2 = 100\u03c0.\n\nAkshaj has two spheres with a radius of 2 each, so the surface area of one sphere is A_akshaj = 4\u03c0(2)^2 = 16\u03c0. Since Akshaj has two spheres, the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 2 * 16\u03c0 = 32\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is:\n\nA_theo / A_akshaj = 100\u03c0 / 32\u03c0 = 25 / 8.\n\nSo, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 25:8.",
