    "solution": "\\frac{25}{8}",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the surface area of a sphere, one can use the formula A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, where A is the surface area and r is the radius of the sphere. \n\nFor Theo's sphere, with a radius of 5, the surface area can be calculated as A_theo = 4\u03c0(5)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0. \n\nFor Akshaj's spheres, each with a radius of 2, the total surface area can be calculated as A_akshaj = 2 * 4\u03c0(2)\u00b2 = 32\u03c0. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is A_theo / A_akshaj = (100\u03c0) / (32\u03c0) = 100 / 32 = 25 / 8. \n\nHence, the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 25:8.",
