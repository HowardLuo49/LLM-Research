The slope $m$ can be calculated as $(3-0)/(0+4) = 3/4$. Thus, the equation of the line $F_2P$ is $y = \\frac{3}{4}x + 3$.\n\nNext, we need to find the equation of the line passing through the focus $F_1(4,0)$ and point $Q(x,y)$. Since the focus $F_1$ is on the $x$-axis, the line will be vertical. Hence, the equation of the line $F_1Q$ is simply $x = 4$.\n\nTo find the point $Q$ on the ellipse, we substitute $y = \\frac{3}{4}x + 3$ into $\\frac{x^2}{49} + \\frac{y^2}{33} = 1$ and solve for $x$.
