This implies that each term is obtained by adding one more digit to the previous term. \n\nNow, we can consider the arithmetic properties involved in the sum:\n$$1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8$$\n\nWe can observe that the sum of the digits in each term follows a pattern where it goes from 1 to 9, then repeats. In other words, the sum of the digits from 1 to 9 is congruent to 0 modulo 9. \n\nTherefore, since the sum we are given is essentially the sum of the digits from 1 to 9, the value of the sum modulo 9 is 0. Hence, $n=0$. \n\nAs a biologist with a PhD, we have utilized our analytical skills, pattern recognition, and knowledge of properties of numbers to determine the value of $n$ in this mathematical problem.",
