To find the modulus of such a large sum can be a daunting task, so using some simplification techniques may prove to be beneficial.\n\nOne approach is to look for patterns in the numbers that would allow us to simplify the problem. By examining the first few terms, we see that each term can be expressed as a multiple of 1234567 with some additional digits added in front. For example, $1 = 1*1234567$, $12 = 10*1234567 + 2$, $123 = 100*1234567 + 23$, and so on. \n\nTherefore, the given sum can be simplified as follows:\n$$1+12+123+1234+12345+123456+1234567+12345678 \\\\= 1(1234567) + 12(1234567) + 123(1234567) + 1234(1234567) + 12345(1234567) + 123456(1234567) + 1234567(1234567) + 12345678 \\\\= 1234567(1 + 12 + 123 + 1234 + 12345 + 123456 + 1234567) + 12345678 \\\\= 1234567(1111111) + 12345678$$\n\nNow, we can easily find the remainder when $1234567(1111111)$ is divided by 9 by looking at the individual remainders of 1234567 and 1111111 which are 4 and 6 respectively. Multiplying these together, we get 24. \n\nTherefore, the remainder of $1234567(1111111)$ when divided by 9 is the same as the remainder of 24 when divided by 9. Since 24 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 6, the value of n in the given expression is 6.",
