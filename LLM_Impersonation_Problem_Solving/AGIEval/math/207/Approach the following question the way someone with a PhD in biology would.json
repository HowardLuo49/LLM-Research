We know that n gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, so we can express this as:\nn \u2261 3 (mod 7)\n\nNext, we want to find the remainder of 2n+1 when divided by 7. We can substitute our expression for n into the equation for 2n+1:\n2n+1 \u2261 2(3)+1 \u2261 7 (mod 7)\n\nTherefore, when 2n+1 is divided by 7, the remainder is 1. \n\nThis demonstrates the application of modular arithmetic in finding the remainder when dividing by 7.",
