    "solution": "0",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first consider the given information: that $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. This implies that $n$ can be expressed in the form $n = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNext, we must determine the remainder when $2n + 1$ is divided by 7. Substituting the expression for $n$ into $2n + 1$, we have:\n\n$2n + 1 = 2(7k + 3) + 1 = 14k + 6 + 1 = 14k + 7 = 7(2k + 1)$\n\nSince $2k + 1$ is an integer, it follows that $2n + 1$ is divisible by 7 with no remainder. Therefore, the remainder of $2n + 1$ when divided by 7 is $0$.",
