The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",
    "solution": "1250",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the equivalent exchange rate between the Italian lire and the US dollar in 1992, we can use the price of gelato as a reference point. \n\nBased on the information provided, 1200 lire is equivalent to $\\$1.50$. To find the exchange rate in terms of dollars per lire, we can set up the following proportion: \n\n$\\frac{1200 \\text{ lire}}{\\$1.50} = \\frac{1000000 \\text{ lire}}{x}$\n\nSolving for $x$, we find that $x = \\frac{1000000}{1200} \\times 1.50 = \\$1250$.\n\nTherefore, at the equivalent exchange rate in 1992, 1,000,000 lire would be equivalent to $\\$1250.",
