The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",
    "solution": "1250",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the exchange rate between the lire and the dollar in 1992. We can do this by setting up a proportion based on the prices of gelato in Italy and the U.S.:\n\n$\\frac{1200 \\text{lire}}{1} = \\frac{\\$1.50}{1}$\n\nSolving for 1 lire in dollars, we find:\n\n$1 \\text{lire} = \\frac{1}{1200} \\times \\$1.50 = \\$0.00125$\n\nTherefore, the exchange rate between the lire and the dollar in 1992 was \\$0.00125 per lire.\n\nTo find out how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire, we simply multiply the amount of lire by the exchange rate:\n\n$1,000,000 \\text{lire} \\times \\$0.00125/\\text{lire} = \\$1250$\n\nTherefore, 1,000,000 lire would be equivalent to $\\$1250$ in 1992.",
