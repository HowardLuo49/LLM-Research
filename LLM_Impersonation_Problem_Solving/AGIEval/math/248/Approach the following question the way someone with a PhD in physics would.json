The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",
    "solution": "1250",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the exchange rate between the Italian lire and the US dollar in 1992. By dividing the cost of the gelato in lire by the cost in dollars, we find that 1 lire was equivalent to $\\frac{1200}{1.50} = 800$ of a dollar.\n\nTherefore, to find out how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire, we can simply divide 1,000,000 by 800:\n\n$\\frac{1,000,000}{800} = 1250$\n\nTherefore, 1,000,000 Italian lire would be equivalent to $1250 USD$ at the exchange rate in 1992.",
