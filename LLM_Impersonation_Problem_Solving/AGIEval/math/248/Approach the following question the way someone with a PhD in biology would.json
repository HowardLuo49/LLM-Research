The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",
    "solution": "1250",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar in 1992, we can use the information provided about the cost of gelato in Italy and the U.S. The cost of gelato in Italy was 1200 lire, while the cost in the U.S. was $1.50. \n\nBy setting up a proportion, we can find the exchange rate:\n\n$\\frac{1200 \\text{ lire}}{1.50~\\text{USD}} = 800~\\text{ lire/USD}$\n\nTherefore, in 1992, 800 lire was equivalent to 1 USD.\n\nTo find out how many dollars are equivalent to 1,000,000 lire, we can set up another proportion:\n\n$\\frac{1,000,000 \\text{ lire}}{x~\\text{USD}} = \\frac{800 \\text{ lire}}{1 \\text{ USD}}$\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{1,000,000 \\text{ lire} \\cdot 1 \\text{ USD}}{800 \\text{ lire}} = 1250~\\text{USD}$\n\nTherefore, 1,000,000 lire would be equivalent to 1250 USD in 1992.",
