    "gpt_response": "To find the range of the function \\(f(x)\\), we first need to find the domain of the function. \n\nThe square root function \\(\\sqrt{y}\\) is defined for \\(y \\geq 0\\). Therefore, in order for the expressions \\(\\sqrt{x^{2} - 10x + 34}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{x^{2} + 4}\\) to be real-valued, the quantities under the square roots must be non-negative. This gives us the inequalities \\(x^{2} - 10x + 34 \\geq 0\\) and \\(x^{2} + 4 \\geq 0\\).\n\nSolving \\(x^{2} - 10x + 34 \\geq 0\\), we find that the roots of the quadratic are \\(x = 5 \\pm 3i\\). Since the leading coefficient is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning that the quantity is non-negative for all \\(x\\). Therefore, this inequality is satisfied for all real \\(x\\).\n\nSolving \\(x^{2} + 4 \\geq 0\\), we see that the minimum value is 4, which is achieved at \\(x = 0\\). Therefore, this inequality is also satisfied for all real \\(x\\).\n\nSince both inequalities are satisfied for all real \\(x\\), the expressions \\(\\sqrt{x^{2} - 10x + 34}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{x^{2} + 4}\\) are always real-valued.\n\nNow, to find the range of the function \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x^{2} - 10x + 34} - \\sqrt{x^{2} + 4}\\), we note that as \\(x \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty\\), \\(f(x) \\rightarrow -\\infty\\). This is because the first term grows without bound while the second term remains constant. \n\nAlso, it's clear from the form of the function that the maximum possible output value would be when both terms are at their minimum. Since the minimum value of the first term is 0 and the minimum value of the second term is 2, the max value of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(0 - 2 = -2\\).\n\nTherefore, the range of the function \\(f(x)\\) is \\([-2, \\infty)\\).",
