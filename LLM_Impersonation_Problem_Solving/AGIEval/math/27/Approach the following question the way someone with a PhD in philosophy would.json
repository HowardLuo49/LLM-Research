    "gpt_response": "To find $\\csc 330^\\circ$, we first need to understand the concept of cosecant. The cosecant of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the reciprocal of the sine of that angle. However, in the context of the unit circle and trigonometry in general, the cosecant of an angle is defined as the reciprocal of the sine of that angle in the unit circle.\n\nIn the unit circle, we can represent angles in degrees by using the point on the circle corresponding to that angle. In this case, we are interested in finding the cosecant of the angle 330 degrees. To do this, we first need to find the sine of 330 degrees.\n\nIn the unit circle, the angle 330 degrees is in the fourth quadrant. To find the sine of 330 degrees, we need to evaluate the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle corresponding to 330 degrees. This point is $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. Therefore, the sine of 330 degrees is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince the cosecant of an angle is the reciprocal of the sine of that angle, we can calculate $\\csc 330^\\circ$ by taking the reciprocal of $-\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $\\csc 330^\\circ = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = -2$.\n\nThus, the cosecant of 330 degrees is equal to -2.",
