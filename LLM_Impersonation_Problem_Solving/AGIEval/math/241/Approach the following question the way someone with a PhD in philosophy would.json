    "gpt_response": "To find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers for which $x^2+ax+b$ has a non-real root whose cube is $343$, we first need to express the equation $x^2+ax+b$ in terms of $x$ by using the roots of the polynomial.\n\nLet the roots of the polynomial $x^2+ax+b$ be $r$ and $s$. Since the product of the roots is $b$ and the sum of the roots is $-a$, we have $rs=b$ and $r+s=-a$. \n\nGiven that one of the roots of the polynomial has a cube of $343$, we can express the roots as $r = 7e^{i\\theta}$ and $s = 7e^{-i\\theta}$, where $\\theta \\in (0,2\\pi)$.\n\nNow we have $rs = (7e^{i\\theta})(7e^{-i\\theta}) = 49$. Thus, $b = 49$.\n\nAdditionally, we have $r+s = 7e^{i\\theta} + 7e^{-i\\theta} = -a$. By using Euler's formula ($e^{i\\theta} = \\cos{\\theta} + i\\sin{\\theta}$), we get:\n\n$2\\cos{\\theta} = -a/7$\n\nTherefore, $-a = 14\\cos{\\theta}$.\n\nSince we know that $\\cos{3\\theta} = \\cos{(\\pi - \\theta)} = \\cos{\\pi}\\cos{\\theta} - \\sin{\\pi}\\sin{\\theta} = -\\cos{\\theta}$, we have:\n\n$a^3 = 64\\cos^3{\\theta} = -64\\cos{\\theta}$\n\nHence, $a = -4$. \n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a,b) = (-4,49)$.",
