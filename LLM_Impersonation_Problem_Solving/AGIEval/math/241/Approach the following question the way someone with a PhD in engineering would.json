    "gpt_response": "To find the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers for which $x^2+ax+b$ has a non-real root whose cube is $343$, we can start by setting the quadratic equation equal to zero:\n\n$x^2+ax+b = 0$\n\nLet the roots of this equation be $r$ and $s$. Since the quadratic has a non-real root whose cube is $343 = 7^3$, we know that one of the roots must be a complex number of the form $re^{i\\theta}$, where $r>0$ and $0<\\theta<\\pi$. Let's say $r = |r|e^{i\\theta}$.\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of the quadratic is $-a$ and the product is $b$, so:\n\n$r+re^{-i\\theta} = -a$\n\n$r \\cdot re^{-i\\theta} = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we find that $r = \\frac{-a}{2}$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{-a}{2} \\cdot \\frac{-a}{2} \\cdot e^{-i\\theta} = b$\n\nSolving this, we get $b = \\frac{a^2}{4}$. \n\nSince one of the roots is $re^{7i/3}$, we have:\n\n$(re^{i\\theta})^3 = r^3 e^{3i\\theta} = 343$\n\nThis means that $r^3 = 343$. Since $r = \\frac{-a}{2}$, we have:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{-a}{2}\\right)^3 = 343$\n\nSolving this equation gives $a = -14$.\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is $(-14, 49)$.",
