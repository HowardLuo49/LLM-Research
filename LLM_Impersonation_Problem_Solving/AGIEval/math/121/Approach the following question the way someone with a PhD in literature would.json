    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. Six witches and ten sorcerers are at an arcane mixer. The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",
    "solution": "60",
    "gpt_response": "The scenario presented in the question is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using principles of combinatorial mathematics.\n\nTo determine the number of handshakes that took place at the mixer, we can first calculate the total number of possible handshakes between the witches and the sorcerers. Since each of the six witches shook hands with each of the ten sorcerers, we have a total of 6 witches * 10 sorcerers = 60 handshakes.\n\nNext, we need to account for the fact that the witches did not shake hands with each other and the sorcerers did not shake hands with each other. Since there are 6 witches and 10 sorcerers, we subtract the handshakes within these groups. The witches shook hands (6 witches choose 2) = 6C2 = 15 handshakes. Similarly, the sorcerers shook hands (10 sorcerers choose 2) = 10C2 = 45 handshakes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes that took place at the mixer can be calculated as:\n\nTotal handshakes = Total handshakes - (Handshakes between witches) - (Handshakes between sorcerers) = 60 - 15 - 45 = 0.\n\nBased on the conditions given in the question, it can be concluded that no handshakes took place at the mixer.",
