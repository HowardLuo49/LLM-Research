The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",
    "solution": "60",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the number of handshakes that take place in a group of n individuals. The formula is given by n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, there are 6 witches and 10 sorcerers. The witches will shake hands with the sorcerers, so we need to calculate the number of handshakes between the witches and the sorcerers.\n\nNumber of handshakes between witches and sorcerers = 6 x 10 = 60\n\nSo, the total number of handshakes that took place at the mixer is 60.",
