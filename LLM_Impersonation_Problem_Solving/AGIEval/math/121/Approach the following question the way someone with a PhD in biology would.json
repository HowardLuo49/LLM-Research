The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",
    "solution": "60",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we first need to understand the total number of potential handshakes that could take place between the witches and sorcerers. The witches will each shake hands with the ten sorcerers, resulting in 6 witches x 10 sorcerers = 60 handshakes.\n\nSince the witches do not shake hands with each other and the sorcerers do not shake hands with each other, there are no additional handshakes beyond those between the witches and sorcerers. Therefore, a total of 60 handshakes took place at the mixer.",
