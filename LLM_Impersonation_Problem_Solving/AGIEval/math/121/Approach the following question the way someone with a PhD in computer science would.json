    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. Six witches and ten sorcerers are at an arcane mixer. The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",
    "solution": "60",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. \n\nFirst, we calculate the number of handshakes between the witches and the sorcerers. Since each witch shakes hands with each sorcerer, there will be 6 witches * 10 sorcerers = 60 handshakes between witches and sorcerers.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of handshakes between the sorcerers themselves. Since none of the sorcerers shake hands with each other, there will be no handshakes between sorcerers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes at the mixer is 60 handshakes between witches and sorcerers.",
