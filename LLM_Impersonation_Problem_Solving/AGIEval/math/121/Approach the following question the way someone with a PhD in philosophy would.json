    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. Six witches and ten sorcerers are at an arcane mixer. The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",
    "solution": "60",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the principles of combinatorics. Each witch shakes hands with all ten sorcerers, resulting in a total of 6 witches x 10 sorcerers = 60 handshakes. The sorcerers, on the other hand, do not shake hands with each other. Therefore, the total number of handshakes that took place at the arcane mixer is 60 handshakes.",
