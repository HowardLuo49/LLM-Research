The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",
    "solution": "60",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of handshakes that took place between the witches and sorcerers. \n\nSince each of the six witches shook hands with each of the ten sorcerers, there are a total of 6 witches * 10 sorcerers = 60 handshakes between them.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of handshakes between the sorcerers themselves. Since none of the sorcerers shook hands with each other, there are no handshakes between them.\n\nTherefore, the total number of handshakes that took place at the mixer is 60 handshakes between the witches and sorcerers.",
