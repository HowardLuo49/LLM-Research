For the numerator $x + c$, we have $x + c < 0$ for $x < -c$ and $x + c > 0$ for $x > -c.$ This means that $c > 0$ for the numerator to be negative on the interval $(-\\infty,-1)$ and $c < 0$ for the numerator to be positive on the interval $(1,2).$\n\nFor the denominator $x^2 + ax + b$, we can consider the discriminant $\\Delta = a^2 - 4b$ to determine its sign.
