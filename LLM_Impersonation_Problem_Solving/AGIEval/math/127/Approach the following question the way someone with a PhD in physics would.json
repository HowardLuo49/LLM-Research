Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",

Let's calculate each of these probabilities separately.\n\nFor selecting exactly 3 oranges:\nn = 8 (total number of pieces of fruit)\nx = 3 (number of oranges)\np(orange) = 1/3 (probability of selecting an orange)\n\nP(3 oranges) = (8 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^5\n\nFor selecting exactly 6 apples:\nn = 8 (total number of pieces of fruit)\nx = 6 (number of apples)\np(apple) = 1/3 (probability of selecting an apple)\n\nP(6 apples) = (8 choose 6) * (1/3)^6 * (2/3)^2\n\nNow, to calculate the probability of either of these events happening, we add the individual probabilities together:\n\nP(either event) = P(3 oranges) + P(6 apples)\n\nThis calculation will give us the final probability of either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit being oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit being apples.",
