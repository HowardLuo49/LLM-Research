Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{1904}{6561}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit being oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit being apples, we must consider the total number of ways in which Pat can select 8 pieces of fruit, as well as the number of ways in which he can select exactly 3 oranges and exactly 6 apples.\n\nThe total number of ways in which Pat can select 8 pieces of fruit, each being either an orange, an apple, or a banana, is 3^8.\n\nTo calculate the number of ways in which Pat can select exactly 3 oranges and exactly 6 apples, we must consider the number of ways in which he can choose 3 positions out of 8 for the oranges, and then the remaining 6 positions for the apples. This can be calculated using combinations, where C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), resulting in C(8, 3) * C(5, 6) = 56 * 5 = 280.\n\nTherefore, the probability of either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit being oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit being apples is 280 / 3^8 \u2248 0.0716 or approximately 7.16%.",
