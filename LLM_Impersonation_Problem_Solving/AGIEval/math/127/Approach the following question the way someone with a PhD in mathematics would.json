Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{1904}{6561}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples, we first need to determine the total number of ways Pat can select 8 pieces of fruit, considering that each piece can be an orange, an apple, or a banana.\n\nSince there are 3 choices for each of the 8 pieces of fruit, the total number of ways Pat can select 8 pieces of fruit is 3^8.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of ways Pat can select exactly 3 oranges and 5 non-oranges. The number of ways to select 3 oranges from 8 pieces is given by the binomial coefficient (8 choose 3), denoted as C(8, 3), which is equal to 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!). Similarly, the number of ways to select 5 non-oranges from the remaining 5 pieces is (5 choose 5), which is equivalent to 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways Pat can select exactly 3 oranges is C(8, 3) * 1 = 56.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways Pat can select exactly 6 apples and 2 non-apples. The number of ways to select 6 apples from 8 pieces is given by the binomial coefficient (8 choose 6), denoted as C(8, 6), which is equal to 8! / (6! * (8 - 6)!). Similarly, the number of ways to select 2 non-apples from the remaining 2 pieces is (2 choose 2), which is equivalent to 1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways Pat can select exactly 6 apples is C(8, 6) * 1 = 28.\n\nSince these two events are mutually exclusive, the total number of favorable outcomes is 56 (for exactly 3 oranges) + 28 (for exactly 6 apples) = 84.\n\nFinally, the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 84 / 3^8.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 84 / 6561, which simplifies to 4 / 307.",
