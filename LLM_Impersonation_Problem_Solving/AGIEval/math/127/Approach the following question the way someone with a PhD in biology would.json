Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{1904}{6561}",
    "gpt_response": "In order to answer this question, we must first determine the total number of ways 8 pieces of fruit can be selected from oranges, apples, and bananas. Since each piece of fruit can be one of 3 types (orange, apple, or banana), there are 3^8 = 6561 possible ways to choose 8 pieces of fruit.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of combinations where exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges. This can be done using the binomial coefficient formula, which is expressed as C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). In this case, we are calculating C(8,3), which equals 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 56 ways to choose exactly 3 oranges.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of combinations where exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples as C(8,6) = 8! / (6!(8-6)!) = 28 ways to choose exactly 6 apples.\n\nSince these two events are mutually exclusive, we can add the number of ways to choose exactly 3 oranges and 6 apples, which equals 56 + 28 = 84.\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability as the number of favorable outcomes (choosing exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 84 / 6561 = 0.0128, or approximately 1.28%.",
