Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{1904}{6561}",
    "gpt_response": "The question presented delves into the realm of combinatorial mathematics, specifically involving the probability of certain outcomes occurring within a set sample space. In this case, Pat is selecting 8 pieces of fruit, each of which can be classified as an orange, an apple, or a banana. The task at hand is to determine the likelihood of either exactly 3 of the pieces being oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces being apples.\n\nTo address this question, it is first necessary to define the total number of ways in which Pat can select 8 pieces of fruit, considering that each piece can belong to one of three categories. This can be calculated using the concept of combinations, as the order in which the fruits are selected is not relevant.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 8 fruits from 3 categories (orange, apple, banana) is given by the binomial coefficient (nCr), where there are 3 choices for each fruit and a total of 8 fruits to be selected. Hence, the total sample space can be represented as (3+8-1)C(8) = 10C8.\n\nTo determine the probability of selecting exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples, it is imperative to ascertain the number of successful outcomes for each scenario. For the case of selecting 3 oranges, this involves choosing 3 oranges out of a total of 8 fruits. This can be computed by calculating the product of the number of ways to choose 3 oranges from 3 available options (3C3) and the number of ways to choose the remaining 5 fruits from the 2 remaining options (2C5).\n\nSimilarly, for the scenario of choosing exactly 6 apples, the number of successful outcomes is given by the product of the number of ways to choose 6 apples from 3 available options (3C6) and the number of ways to choose the remaining 2 fruits from the 2 remaining options (2C2).\n\nSubsequently, the probability of either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit being oranges or exactly 6 being apples can be obtained by summing the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events. This sum represents the desired probability and can be expressed as the ratio of the total number of successful outcomes to the total sample space.\n\nIn conclusion, the question at hand calls for the application of combinatorial principles and probability theory to determine the likelihood of specific outcomes within a set sample space. Through a systematic calculation of successful outcomes and total possibilities, the probability of the desired events can be accurately established.",
