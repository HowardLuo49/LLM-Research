Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{1904}{6561}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinatorics and probability.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of possible ways Pat can choose 8 pieces of fruit, each being an orange, an apple, or a banana. Since there are 3 choices for each fruit and a total of 8 fruits, there are 3^8 = 6561 possible outcomes.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of ways Pat can choose exactly 3 oranges out of 8 fruits. This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of fruits (8 in this case) and k is the number of oranges chosen (3 in this case). So, the number of ways to choose exactly 3 oranges out of 8 is C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 56 ways.\n\nSimilarly, let's calculate the number of ways Pat can choose exactly 6 apples out of 8 fruits. This can be done using the binomial coefficient formula as well. So, the number of ways to choose exactly 6 apples out of 8 is C(8, 6) = 8! / (6!(8-6)!) = 28 ways.\n\nNow, to find the probability that either exactly 3 of the fruits are oranges or exactly 6 of the fruits are apples, we need to sum the probabilities of both events happening. The probability of choosing exactly 3 oranges is the number of ways to choose 3 oranges divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 56 / 6561. And the probability of choosing exactly 6 apples is the number of ways to choose 6 apples divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 28 / 6561. Therefore, the required probability is (56 + 28) / 6561 = 84 / 6561.\n\nSo, the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples is 84 / 6561 = 0.0128 (approximately 1.28%).",
