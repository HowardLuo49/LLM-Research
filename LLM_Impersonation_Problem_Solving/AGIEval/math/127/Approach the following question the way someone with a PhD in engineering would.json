Pat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
    "solution": "\\dfrac{1904}{6561}",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability of either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit being oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit being apples, we first need to calculate the total number of ways in which Pat can select 8 pieces of fruit with each piece being an orange, an apple, or a banana. Since there are 3 choices for each piece of fruit, this can be represented by 3^8.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways in which exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges. This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient formula, which states that the number of ways to choose k items from n items is given by nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n! denotes the factorial of n.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose 3 oranges out of 8 is 8C3 = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 56.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose exactly 6 apples out of 8 is 8C6 = 8! / (6!(8-6)!) = 28.\n\nFinally, the probability of either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit being oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit being apples is given by the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events divided by the total number of ways to select 8 pieces of fruit:\n\nP = (56 + 28) / 3^8\n\nP = 84 / 6561\n\nP \u2248 0.0128\n\nTherefore, the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples is approximately 0.0128 or 1.28%.",
