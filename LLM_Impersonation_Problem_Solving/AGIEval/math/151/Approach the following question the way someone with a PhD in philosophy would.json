A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$, where $t$ is the time after launch. At what time is the height of the ball at its maximum?",

The vertex of a parabola in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by the formula $(-b/2a,-(b^2-4ac)/4a)$.\n\nIn this case, our parabolic function is $h(t)=-25t^2+75t+24$, where $a=-25$, $b=75$, and $c=24$.
