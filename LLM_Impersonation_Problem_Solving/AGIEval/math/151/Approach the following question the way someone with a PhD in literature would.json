A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$, where $t$ is the time after launch. At what time is the height of the ball at its maximum?",

Applying this to our function $-25t^2 + 75t + 24$, we get the x-coordinate of the vertex as $-75 / (2*(-25)) = 1.5$. \n\nTherefore, at $t=1.5$, the height of the ball is at its maximum.
