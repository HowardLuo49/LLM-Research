    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we need to follow the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). Given the expression $\\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot (7-1)$, we must first simplify the parentheses.\n\nInside the parentheses, we have $7-1=6$. Therefore, our expression simplifies to $\\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6$.\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication and division operations. We will start from left to right. First, we have $\\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 = -1$. So, the expression becomes $-1 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6$.\n\nNext, we have $-1 \\cdot 7 = -7$. So, the expression simplifies to $-7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6$.\n\nFollowing the order of operations, we now have to perform multiplication and division from left to right. First, we do $8 \\cdot 2 = 16$. Then, we have to do the division: $16 \\div 8 = 2$. Our expression now becomes $-7 + 2 \\cdot 6$.\n\nFinally, we do the remaining multiplication: $2 \\cdot 6 = 12$. Therefore, our final answer is $-7 + 12 = 5$.",
