    "solution": "36",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the area of a square with sides equal to the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units, we first need to find the radius of the circle.\n\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is $C=2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. Given that the circumference is $12\\pi$ units, we can substitute this value into the formula:\n\n$12\\pi = 2\\pi r$\n\nSolving for $r$:\n\n$12\\pi = 2\\pi r$\n\n$r = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi}$\n\n$r = 6$\n\nSo, the radius of the circle is 6 units. Since the sides of the square are equal to the radius, the side length of the square is also 6 units.\n\nThe formula for the area of a square is $A=s^2$, where $A$ is the area and $s$ is the side length. Substituting the side length of the square:\n\n$A = 6^2$\n\n$A = 36$\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 36 square units.",
