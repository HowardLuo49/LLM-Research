    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. What is the area, in square units, of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units?",
    "solution": "36",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the relationships between the given values. The circumference of a circle is related to its radius by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. In this case, we are given that the circumference is $12\\pi$ units, so we can set up the equation $12\\pi = 2\\pi r$ and solve for the radius $r$. \n\nDividing both sides by $2\\pi$, we get $r = 6$ units. This means that the sides of the square are also 6 units long, as they are the same length as the radius of the circle. \n\nTo find the area of the square, we use the formula $A = s^2$, where $A$ is the area and $s$ is the side length. Substituting $s = 6$ into the formula, we get $A = 6^2 = 36$ square units. Therefore, the area of the square is 36 square units.",
