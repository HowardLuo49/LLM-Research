    "gpt_response": "To calculate the area of the square, we first need to determine the radius of the circle. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. Given that $C = 12\\pi$, we can solve for $r$:\n\n$12\\pi = 2\\pi r$\n$r = 6$ units\n\nSince the sides of the square are equal in length to the radius of the circle, each side of the square is also 6 units long. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. Therefore, the area of the square in this case would be:\n\n$Area = (6)^2 = 36$ square units\n\nTherefore, the area of the square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units is 36 square units.",
