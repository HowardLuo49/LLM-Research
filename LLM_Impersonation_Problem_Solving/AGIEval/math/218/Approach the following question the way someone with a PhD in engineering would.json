A pyramid with a square base is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and is 2 units from the base.  The surface area of the smaller pyramid that is cut from the top is half the surface area of the original pyramid.  What is the altitude of the original pyramid?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometry of the situation. The original pyramid has a square base and an unknown altitude.

Let's denote the edge length of the base of the original pyramid as \\( x \\) and the altitude of the original pyramid as \\( h \\).\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a pyramid is given by\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2}P \\times s + B \\]\nwhere \n\\( A \\) is the surface area,\n\\( P \\) is the perimeter of the base,\n\\( s \\) is the slant height,\nand \\( B \\) is the area of the base.\n\nSince the smaller pyramid has half the surface area of the original pyramid, we have\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}A = \\frac{1}{2}P \\times s' + B' \\]\nwhere\n\\( s' \\) is the slant height of the smaller pyramid,\nand \\( B' \\) is the area of the base of the smaller pyramid.\n\nThe perimeter of the base of the original pyramid is \\( P = 4x \\), and the area of the base is \\( B = x^2 \\). The slant height of the smaller pyramid can be calculated as \\( s' = \\sqrt{(x/2)^2 + h^2} \\), where \\( (x/2) \\) is half the base length.\n\nSince the altitude of the original pyramid is perpendicular to the base and the plane cutting the pyramid is parallel to the base, we can form a right triangle with half the base and the altitude of the original pyramid as the legs, and the unknown length from the apex to the cut plane as the hypotenuse.
