A pyramid with a square base is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and is 2 units from the base.  The surface area of the smaller pyramid that is cut from the top is half the surface area of the original pyramid.  What is the altitude of the original pyramid?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to define some variables. Let's denote the side length of the square base of the original pyramid as x, and the altitude of the original pyramid as h. \n\nThe surface area of a pyramid is given by the formula S = B + (1/2)Pl, where B is the base area, P is the perimeter of the base, and l is the slant height.\n\nFor the original pyramid, the surface area is S_original = x^2 + (1/2)(4x)l_original.\n\nFor the smaller pyramid, the surface area is half of the original pyramid's surface area: S_smaller = 0.5 * S_original.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the smaller pyramid is cut 2 units from the base, so the height of the smaller pyramid is h - 2.\n\nSince the smaller pyramid is cut parallel to the base, the ratio of the height of the smaller pyramid to the height of the original pyramid must be the same as the ratio of the side length of the smaller base to the side length of the original base. \n\nTherefore, (h-2)/h = x/(x-2).\n\nBy substituting x = 4 (side length of original base) in the above equation, we can find h = 8 units.",
