A pyramid with a square base is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and is 2 units from the base.  The surface area of the smaller pyramid that is cut from the top is half the surface area of the original pyramid.  What is the altitude of the original pyramid?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to establish a relationship between the surface areas of the original pyramid and the smaller pyramid that is cut from the top.\n\nIn general, the surface area of a pyramid is given by the formula:\nSurface Area = base area + (1/2)*perimeter*slant height\n\nLet the original pyramid have a base side length of x units and an altitude of h units.\n\nThe surface area of the original pyramid is then:\nOriginal Surface Area = x^2 + (1/2)*4x*sqrt(x^2 + h^2)\n                              = x^2 + 2x*sqrt(x^2 + h^2)\n\nNow, when the smaller pyramid is cut from the top, its surface area is half that of the original pyramid:\n(1/2)*Original Surface Area = x^2 + 2x*sqrt(x^2 + h^2)\n\nGiven that the plane cutting the pyramid is 2 units from the base, the altitude of the smaller pyramid is given by h - 2. Thus, the surface area of the smaller pyramid can be expressed as:\nSmaller Surface Area = x^2 + 2x*sqrt(x^2 + (h-2)^2)\n\nSince we are given that the surface area of the smaller pyramid is half that of the original pyramid, we can write the following equation:\nx^2 + 2x*sqrt(x^2 + (h-2)^2) = 1/2 * (x^2 + 2x*sqrt(x^2 + h^2))\n\nFrom here, we would carry out algebraic manipulations to solve for the unknown altitude h in terms of the base side length x. The solution to this equation would give us the altitude of the original pyramid.",
