A pyramid with a square base is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and is 2 units from the base.  The surface area of the smaller pyramid that is cut from the top is half the surface area of the original pyramid.  What is the altitude of the original pyramid?",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, a PhD in literature would likely apply their knowledge of geometry and spatial reasoning to solve the problem. They may begin by visualizing the scenario described in the question and breaking down the information provided.\n\nThe original pyramid is described as having a square base with an unknown altitude. It is then cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and 2 units away from it, creating a smaller pyramid with half the surface area of the original pyramid.\n\nTo solve for the altitude of the original pyramid, the PhD in literature may consider the relationship between the surface areas of similar pyramids. Since the smaller pyramid is a portion of the original pyramid with the same base, the ratio of the surface areas of the two pyramids would be proportional to the square of the ratio of their altitudes.\n\nBy setting up and solving this proportion, the PhD in literature could then calculate the altitude of the original pyramid. This would require a thorough understanding of geometric principles and the ability to apply mathematical reasoning to solve the problem at hand.",
