    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a biologist with a PhD, we can think of the numbers $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ as representing different biological entities. In this case, let's consider them as chromosomes in a hypothetical organism.\n\nGiven that the sum of these two chromosomes is $123422$, we can set up the equation $AMC10 + AMC12 = 123422$. Since we are looking for the sum of the digits $A$, $M$, and $C$, we want to focus on how these digits contribute to the overall value of the chromosomes.\n\nWe can break down the sum $123422$ to better understand the contribution of each digit. The sum of the digits in this number is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 14$. \n\nThis means that the sum of the digits $A + M + C$ must also equal $14$. As a biologist with a PhD, we can appreciate the importance of maintaining balance and harmony in biological systems. In this case, the sum of the digits in the chromosome numbers also reflects this balance, with $A + M + C = 14$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits $A$, $M$, and $C$ in the chromosomes $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ is $\\boxed{14}$.",
