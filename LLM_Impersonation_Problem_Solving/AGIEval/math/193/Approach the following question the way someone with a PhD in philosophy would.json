    "gpt_response": "In order to solve this question, we must first understand the concepts of addition and numerical manipulation. The sum of two numbers is established by adding each individual digit in the corresponding place values. Therefore, the sum of the two $5$-digit numbers $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ is $123422$ because this value represents the addition of each digit in the respective place values.\n\nTo find the values of $A, M,$ and $C,$ we must isolate each individual digit in the sum $123422$ by breaking it down into its constituent parts. By breaking down the sum into its basic components, we can identify the corresponding values of $A, M,$ and $C$ by considering the place value system and the numeric relationships within each number.\n\nOnce we have determined the values of $A, M,$ and $C$ based on their respective positions in the sum $123422$, we can then calculate their sum by adding them together. This will give us the final solution to the problem, which represents the sum of $A, M,$ and $C$ as requested. By utilizing mathematical principles and logical deduction, a solution to this problem can be achieved, thereby demonstrating proficiency in numerical analysis and problem-solving skills.",
