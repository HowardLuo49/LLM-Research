    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the two 5-digit numbers $AMC10$ as $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10$ and $AMC12$ as $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12$. \n\nSumming these two numbers yields $20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422$. Simplifying gives $20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400$. \n\nDividing by $200$ on both sides results in $100A + 10M + C = 617$. \n\nBy analyzing the equation $100A + 10M + C = 617$, we can see that $A = 6, M = 1,$ and $C = 7$. \n\nTherefore, $A + M + C = 6 + 1 + 7 = \\boxed{14}$.",
