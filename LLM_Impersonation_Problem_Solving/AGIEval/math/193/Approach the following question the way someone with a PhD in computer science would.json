    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to apply basic principles of number theory and algebra to find the values of the unknown digits $A, M, $ and $ C$. Given that $AMC10$ and $AMC12$ are $5$-digit numbers, we can express them as $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10$ and $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12$, respectively.\n\nSince the sum of these two numbers is $123422$, we can set up the equation $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 + 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 = 123422$. Simplifying this equation gives $20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422$, or equivalently $20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400$.\n\nDividing through by $200$ gives $100A + 10M + C = 617$. Since $A, M, $ and $C$ are single-digit integers, we can quickly deduce that $A = 6$ and $M = 1$, leaving $C$ as $7$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of $A + M + C$ is $6 + 1 + 7 = 14$. And that is the answer to the question.",
