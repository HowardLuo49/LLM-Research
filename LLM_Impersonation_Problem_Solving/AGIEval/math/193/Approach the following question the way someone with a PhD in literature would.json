    "gpt_response": "In this problem, we are presented with two 5-digit numbers, denoted as AMC10 and AMC12. We are given that the sum of these two numbers is 123422.\n\nLet us denote the numbers as:\n\nAMC10 = $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10$,\nAMC12 = $10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two numbers can be written as:\n\n$20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we can express the values of A, M, and C in terms of the sum:\n\n$20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400$,\n$100A + 10M + C = 617$.\n\nGiven that A, M, and C are digits, we know that:\n- $1 \\leq A \\leq 9$,\n- $0 \\leq M \\leq 9$,\n- $0 \\leq C \\leq 9$.\n\nConsidering the equation $100A + 10M + C = 617$, it is evident that A must be 6, M must be 1, and C must be 7 in order to satisfy the equation. Thus, the sum $A + M + C$ becomes:\n\n$6 + 1 + 7 = 14$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits A, M, and C is $14$.",
