The product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors $n$ has, $c$ is a positive integer, and the greatest common factor of the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$. What is $a+b+c$?",

    "gpt_response": "To properly approach this question, we need to start by understanding the properties of the given equation and how it relates to the factors of a positive integer $n$.\n\nLet's denote the set of proper positive integer factors of $n$ as $D(n)$. The product of the elements in $D(n)$ can be expressed as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$. \n\nWe know that the product of the factors of $n$ is equal to $n^{x}$ where $x$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:\n\n$n^{x} = n^{(ax+b)/c}$\n\nBy equating the exponents on both sides, we have:\n\n$x = \\frac{ax+b}{c}$\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$cx = ax + b$\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n$(c-a)x = b$\n\nSince $c$, $a$, and $b$ are integers, we know that $x$ must be divisible by $c-a$. This indicates that $x$ is a multiple of $c-a$.\n\nGiven that the greatest common factor of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$, we can see that $x$ must also be a multiple of $c$ to satisfy the equation.\n\nThis implies that $x$ is a common multiple of $c$ and $c-a$. The least common multiple of $c$ and $c-a$ is $c(c-a)$.\n\nTherefore, $x = c(c-a)$.\n\nSince $x$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$, we know that $x$ must be a positive integer. This gives us the condition that $c>a$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $x = c(c-a)$ into our equation $cx = ax + b$:\n\n$c^2(c-a) = ac + b$\n\n$c^3 - ac^2 = ac + b$\n\n$b = c(c^2 - a)$\n\nTherefore, $a+b+c = a + c(c^2 - a) + c = c^3$. \n\nThus, the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is equal to the cube of $c$ (given that $c > a$).",
