The product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors $n$ has, $c$ is a positive integer, and the greatest common factor of the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$. What is $a+b+c$?",

    "gpt_response": "We know from the problem that the product of the proper positive integer factors of a number, denoted as $n$, can be expressed as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors that $n$ has, $c$ is a positive integer, and the greatest common factor of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$.\n\nLet's consider an example to get a better understanding of this concept. Let $n=12$, the positive divisors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$ and the product of these factors is $1*2*3*4*6=144$. \nSo, in this case, $x=6$ and the product of proper positive integer factors of $12$ can be written as $12^{(ax+b)/c}$.\n\nNow, let's find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in this example:\nFrom the example, we have $n^{(ax+b)/c} = 12^{(ax+b)/c} = 144$.\n\nSince $12=2^2*3$, we know that $12$ has $(2+1)(1+1)=6$ factors. So, in this case, $x=6$.\n\nThe equation now becomes $12^{(6a+b)/c}=144$, which simplifies to $12^{(6a+b)/c}=12^2$.\n\nFrom this, we can see that $(6a+b)/c=2$ and this can be rewritten as $6a+b=2c$. \n\nSince $a+b+c$ is asked in the problem, we now have to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a+b+c$ is minimized.\n\nTo find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can substitute $a=1, b=1, c=4$.  \nThis gives us $(6*1+1)/4=2$, as required.\n\nTherefore, $a=1, b=1, c=4$, and $a+b+c=1+1+4=\\boxed{6}$.",
