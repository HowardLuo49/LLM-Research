The product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors $n$ has, $c$ is a positive integer, and the greatest common factor of the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$. What is $a+b+c$?",

    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a positive integer with prime factorization $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$. The number of positive divisors of $n$ is given by $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots(e_k+1)$.\n\nThe product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ is equal to $\\sqrt{n^{\\tau(n)}}$, where $\\tau(n)$ is the total number of positive divisors of $n$. Therefore, the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{\\tau(n)/2} = p_1^{E_1}p_2^{E_2}\\cdots p_k^{E_k}$, where $E_i = e_i(e_i+1)/2$.\n\nThe values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in the given expression can be determined by comparing the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and the above expression for the product of proper divisors. We have $ax+b = E_i$ for each $i=1,2,\\ldots,k$.\n\nSolving for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $e_i$ gives $a = (e_i-1)/2$ and $b = e_i(e_i+1)/2$. The quantity $c$ is equal to $\\gcd(a,b)$ for all $i$, which is equal to $1$.\n\nTherefore, $a = (e_i-1)/2$ and $b = e_i(e_i+1)/2$ for all $i$, and the sum $a+b+c = (e_i-1)/2 + e_i(e_i+1)/2 + 1$ for all $i=1,2,\\ldots,k$. \n\nIn summary, the sum $a+b+c$ for the given problem is equal to the sum of $(e_i-1)/2 + e_i(e_i+1)/2 + 1$ for all prime factors.",
