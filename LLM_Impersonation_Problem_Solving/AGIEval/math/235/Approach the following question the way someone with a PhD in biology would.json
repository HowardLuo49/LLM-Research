The product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors $n$ has, $c$ is a positive integer, and the greatest common factor of the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$. What is $a+b+c$?",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question as a PhD in biology, I would first break down the problem logically. \n\nFrom the information given, we can deduce that the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$. This means that the product of the positive divisors of $n$ is equal to $n^{(ax+b)/c}$.\n\nNext, we know that $x$ represents the number of positive divisors that $n$ has. We are also given that $c$ is a positive integer, and that the greatest common factor of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$.\n\nOur goal is to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in order to determine the sum $a+b+c$.\n\nTo determine these values, we need to consider the prime factorization of $n$. The product of the positive divisors of $n$ can be expressed in terms of the prime factors raised to certain powers. This can be related to the equation $n^{(ax+b)/c}$.\n\nBy analyzing the relationship between the prime factorization of $n$ and the given equation, we can determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c. Once these values are found, we can calculate the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to provide the answer.\n\nTherefore, as a PhD in biology, I would approach this question by applying mathematical principles and reasoning to derive a solution based on the information provided.",
