    "solution": "72",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this algebraic equation, we first simplify both sides. \n\nOn the left side of the equation, $500 - 90 + 7$ simplifies to $500 - 90 = 410$ and then adding 7 gives $410 + 7 = 417$. \n\nOn the right side of the equation, $400 - 60 + 5$ simplifies to $400 - 60 = 340$ and then adding 5 gives $340 + 5 = 345$. \n\nSo, the given equation simplifies to $417 = 345 + N$. \n\nTo solve for $N$, we subtract 345 from both sides: \n$417 - 345 = 72 = N$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $N$ is 72.",
