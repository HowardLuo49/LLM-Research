    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many minutes Casey will need to paint $300$ dimples on the golf ball, we first calculate the total number of seconds it will take him. Since it takes him $2$ seconds to paint one dimple, it will take him $2 \\cdot 300 = 600$ seconds to paint all $300$ dimples.\n\nNext, we convert the total number of seconds into minutes by dividing by $60$ since there are $60$ seconds in a minute. Thus, he will need $\\frac{600}{60} = 10$ minutes to paint all $300$ dimples on the golf ball.\n\nTherefore, Casey will need $10$ minutes to complete his job of painting $300$ dimples on the golf ball.",
