    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we first need to calculate the total time it will take Casey to paint all 300 dimples on the golf ball. \n\nGiven that Casey takes 2 seconds to paint one dimple, to find the total time it will take him to paint one dimple, we would need to multiply the number of dimples to be painted by the time it takes to paint one dimple. \n\nSo, the total time it will take Casey to paint all 300 dimples would be 300 dimples * 2 seconds/dimple = 600 seconds.\n\nTo convert this time from seconds to minutes, we would divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).\n\nTherefore, Casey will need 600 seconds / 60 = 10 minutes to paint all 300 dimples on the golf ball.",
