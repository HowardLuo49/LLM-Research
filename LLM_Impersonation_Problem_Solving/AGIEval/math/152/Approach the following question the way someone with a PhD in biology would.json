    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the total time required for Casey to paint 300 dimples on the golf ball, we first need to calculate the total number of seconds needed and then convert that into minutes. \n\nSince Casey takes 2 seconds to paint one dimple, the total number of seconds needed to paint 300 dimples can be calculated by multiplying the number of dimples by the time taken to paint each dimple:\n$$300 \\text{ dimples} \\times 2 \\text{ seconds/dimple} = 600 \\text{ seconds}$$\n\nNext, we need to convert the total seconds into minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so to convert from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:\n$$600 \\text{ seconds} \u00f7 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 10 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nTherefore, Casey will need 10 minutes to paint 300 dimples on the golf ball.",
