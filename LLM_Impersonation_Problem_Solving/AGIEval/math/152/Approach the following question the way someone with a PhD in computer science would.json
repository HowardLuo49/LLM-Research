    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. Casey's shop class is making a golf trophy.  He has to paint $300$ dimples on a golf ball.  If it takes him $2$ seconds to paint one dimple, how many minutes will he need to do his job?",
    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we first need to calculate the total time Casey will spend painting all $300$ dimples on the golf ball. Given that it takes him $2$ seconds to paint one dimple, the total time in seconds is $300$ dimples $\\times 2$ seconds/dimple = $600$ seconds.\n\nHowever, since we are asked to give the answer in minutes, we need to convert $600$ seconds to minutes. There are $60$ seconds in a minute, so Casey will need $600$ seconds / $60$ seconds/minute = $10$ minutes to complete painting all $300$ dimples on the golf ball. Therefore, Casey will need $10$ minutes to do his job.",
