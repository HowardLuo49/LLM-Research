    "solution": "10",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the total time Casey needs to paint all 300 dimples on the golf ball. \n\nGiven that Casey takes 2 seconds to paint one dimple, he will take $300 \\times 2 = 600$ seconds to paint all 300 dimples. \n\nNext, we will convert the total time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60, since there are 60 seconds in one minute. \n\nTherefore, Casey will need $\\frac{600}{60} = 10$ minutes to paint all 300 dimples on the golf ball.",
