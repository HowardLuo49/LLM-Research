Thirteen of the boxes contain pencils, nine of the boxes contain pens, and three of the boxes contain neither pens nor pencils. How many boxes contain both pens and pencils?",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must utilize principles of set theory and basic mathematical reasoning. The total number of boxes that Rosyln has (20) can be represented as the union of three sets: those that contain pencils, those that contain pens, and those that contain neither.\n\nLet A be the set of boxes containing pencils, B be the set of boxes containing pens, and C be the set of boxes containing neither. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B| + |C|\n\nGiven that there are 13 boxes containing pencils, 9 boxes containing pens, and 3 boxes containing neither, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 13 + 9 - |A \u2229 B| + 3\n|A \u222a B| = 22 - |A \u2229 B| + 3\n|A \u222a B| = 25 - |A \u2229 B|\n\nAs the total number of boxes is 20, we have:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 20\n25 - |A \u2229 B| = 20\n|A \u2229 B| = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 boxes that contain both pens and pencils.",
