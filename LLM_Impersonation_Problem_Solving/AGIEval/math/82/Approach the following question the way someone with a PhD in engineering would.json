Let's denote the number of boxes containing only pencils as P, the number of boxes containing only pens as Q, and the number of boxes containing both pens and pencils as R. \n\nAccording to the given information, P = 13, Q = 9, and P \u222a Q = 20 - 3 = 17 (since there are 3 boxes containing neither pens nor pencils). \n\nWe can now use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of boxes containing both pens and pencils:\n\nP \u222a Q = P + Q - R\n17 = 13 + 9 - R\n17 = 22 - R\nR = 22 - 17\nR = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 boxes that contain both pens and pencils.",
