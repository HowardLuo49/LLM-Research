Thirteen of the boxes contain pencils, nine of the boxes contain pens, and three of the boxes contain neither pens nor pencils. How many boxes contain both pens and pencils?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use set theory and the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the number of boxes containing only pencils as P, the number of boxes containing only pens as Q, and the number of boxes containing both pencils and pens as R. We also know that the number of empty boxes is 3.\n\nAccording to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of boxes can be expressed as:\nTotal boxes = P + Q + R + Empty boxes\n\nGiven that Roslyn has twenty boxes:\n20 = 13 + 9 + R + 3\n\nSolving for R:\nR = 20 - 13 - 9 - 3\nR = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 boxes that contain both pens and pencils.",
