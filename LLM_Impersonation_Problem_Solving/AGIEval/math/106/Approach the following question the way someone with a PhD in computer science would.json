    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first determine the current positions of the hour and minute hands on the clock at 2:48. \n\nThe hour hand is between the 2 and 3, but not exactly at 2. It is approximately $80\\degree$ from the 3 (since there are $60$ minutes in 1 hour and $80\\degree$ corresponds to $\\frac{60}{12} \\times 2 = 40$ minutes). \n\nThe minute hand is on the $8$ and $\\frac{48}{60} \\times 30\\degree = 24\\degree$ from the $8$ towards the $9$.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the hour and minute hands at 2:48 can be calculated by taking the difference between their positions: $80 - 24 = 56\\degree$. \n\nThus, the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of the clock at 2:48 is $\\boxed{56\\degree}$.",
