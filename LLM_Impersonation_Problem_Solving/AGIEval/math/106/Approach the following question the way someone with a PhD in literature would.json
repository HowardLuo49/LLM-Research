    "gpt_response": "From a literary perspective, the concept of time and the passing of hours is a common motif found in many literary works. In this question, we are asked to determine the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at $2\\!:\\!48$.\n\nTo approach this question, we first must understand the movement of the hour and minute hands of a clock. The hour hand moves $360^\\circ$ in $12$ hours, which means it moves $30^\\circ$ per hour. The minute hand moves $360^\\circ$ in $60$ minutes, which means it moves $6^\\circ$ per minute. \n\nAt $2\\!:\\!48$, the hour hand is pointing between the $2$ and $3$ and the minute hand is pointing at the $8$. The angle between the hour hand and the $12$ on the clock is $2 \\times 30^\\circ + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ$. The angle between the minute hand and the $12$ on the clock is $8 \\times 6^\\circ = 48^\\circ$.\n\nThe smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands at $2\\!:\\!48$ is the difference between these two angles, which is $60^\\circ - 48^\\circ = 12^\\circ$. Therefore, the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a $12$-hour clock at $2\\!:\\!48$ is $12^\\circ$.",
