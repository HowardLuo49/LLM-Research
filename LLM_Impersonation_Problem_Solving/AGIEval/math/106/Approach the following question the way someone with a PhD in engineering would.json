    "solution": "156^\\circ",
    "gpt_response": "To begin solving this problem, we must first determine the positions of the hour and minute hands at $2\\!:\\!48$. \n\nAt $2\\!:\\!00$, the minute hand is at the 12 o'clock position, which is $0$ degrees from the $12$ on the clock face. The hour hand is halfway between the 2 and 3 on the clock face, positioning it at $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the total distance between the 2 and 3. Since the total angle traversed by the hour hand in an hour is $30$ degrees (since there are $12$ hours on a clock face and $360$ degrees in a circle), the angle measure the hour hand makes with the 12 o'clock position at $2\\!:\\!00$ is $30 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 5$ degrees.\n\nFrom $2\\!:\\!00$ to $2\\!:\\!48$, the minute hand covers $\\frac{48}{60} = \\frac{4}{5}$ of the total distance of $360$ degrees, which corresponds to $360 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 288$ degrees. Since the minute hand covers $360$ degrees in $60$ minutes, the minute hand covers $288$ degrees in $\\frac{60}{360} \\times 288 = 48$ minutes. Therefore, at $2\\!:\\!48$, the minute hand points to $48$ degrees on the clock face.\n\nTo find the angle between the hour and minute hands at $2\\!:\\!48$, we must subtract the position of the hour hand at $2\\!:\\!48$ from the position of the minute hand at $2\\!:\\!48$. The position of the hour hand at $2\\!:\\!48$ is $5 + \\frac{48}{60} \\times 30 = 5 + 24 = 29$ degrees. Therefore, the angle between the hour and minute hands at $2\\!:\\!48$ is $48 - 29 = 19$ degrees.\n\nThus, the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a $12$-hour clock at $2\\!:\\!48$ is $19$ degrees.",
