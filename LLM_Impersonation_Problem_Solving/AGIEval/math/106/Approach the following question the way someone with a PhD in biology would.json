    "gpt_response": "To determine the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at $2\\!:\\!48$, we must first calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands.\n\nThe hour hand is between the $2$ and $3$ and is $\\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the way between these two numbers. In one hour, the hour hand covers $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12} = 30^\\circ$, so at $2\\!:\\!48$, the hour hand has moved $2 \\cdot 30^\\circ + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ + 5^\\circ = 65^\\circ$ from the $12$ o'clock position.\n\nThe minute hand at $48$ minutes is at the $8$ position. In one minute, the minute hand covers $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60} = 6^\\circ$, so at $2\\!:\\!48$, the minute hand has moved $8 \\cdot 6^\\circ = 48^\\circ$ from the $12$ o'clock position.\n\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands can be calculated as $|65^\\circ - 48^\\circ| = |17^\\circ - 48^\\circ| = 31^\\circ$.
