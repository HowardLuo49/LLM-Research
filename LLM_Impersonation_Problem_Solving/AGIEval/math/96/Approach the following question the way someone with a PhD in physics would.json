The area of triangle $ABE$ is $8 = \\frac{1}{2}a\\cdot h$, where $h$ is the length of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. This gives us $h = \\frac{16}{a}$.  Similarly, the area of triangle $ADF$ is $5 = \\frac{1}{2}b\\cdot h'$.  We know that $h = \\frac{b}{a}h'$, so $h' = \\frac{80}{ab}$.  The area of triangle $CEF$ is 9, so $9 = \\frac{1}{2}(a + b)(h + h') = \\frac{1}{2}(a + b)\\left(\\frac{16}{a} + \\frac{80}{ab}\\right)$.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $9 = 8 + 40/b + 80/a$, which gives us $40/b + 80/a = 1$.
