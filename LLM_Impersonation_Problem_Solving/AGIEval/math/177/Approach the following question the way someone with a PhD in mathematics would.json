    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20, we begin by considering the constraints on the individual digits. \n\nSince the number is a five-digit number, the leftmost digit must be non-zero to preserve its five-digit status. This leaves us with four remaining digits to distribute 20 units of value. \n\nIn order to minimize the number, we want to prioritize placing lower digits in the more significant places. To achieve this, we can start by assigning the digit 1 to as many places as possible, moving from left to right. \n\nAfter placing as many 1s as possible, we distribute the remaining difference of 16 (20 - 4) among the remaining places while ensuring all digits are non-zero. \n\nThis leads us to the smallest five-digit number meeting the criteria, which is 11149.",
