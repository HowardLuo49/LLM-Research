    "solution": "11189",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that adds up to 20, we need to consider the constraints on the possible combinations of digits that can add up to 20.\n\nLet's start by trying to determine the possible combinations of five non-zero digits that add up to 20. Since the smallest non-zero digit is 1, the maximum value for any digit we can use is 9. We can represent this as an equation:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = 20\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n1 \u2264 xi \u2264 9 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nTo find the smallest combination, we need to minimize the value of the number formed from these digits. This can be achieved by placing the smallest non-zero digits in the most significant positions. Therefore, we aim to minimize the value of x1.\n\nBy inspection, we can see that the smallest possible combination of digits that adds up to 20 is {1, 1, 1, 8, 9}. So, the smallest five-digit number that meets the criteria is 11189.",
