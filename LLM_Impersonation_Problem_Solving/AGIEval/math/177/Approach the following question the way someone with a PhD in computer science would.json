    "solution": "11189",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20, we need to start with the digits from left to right. \n\nSince the number must have five digits and the digits must add up to 20, we want the left-most digit to be as small as possible. Therefore, we start with the digit '1' in the ten-thousands place.\n\nNext, we need to distribute the remaining sum of 19 to the remaining four digits. To minimize the number, we want the next digits to be as small as possible. To achieve this, we assign the digit '2' to the thousands place, followed by the digit '3' in the hundreds place. \n\nThis leaves us with a remaining sum of 15 to distribute to the last two digits. Following the same logic of minimizing the number, we assign the digit '6' to the tens place and the digit '8' to the ones place.\n\nTherefore, the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits that add up to 20 is 12368.",
