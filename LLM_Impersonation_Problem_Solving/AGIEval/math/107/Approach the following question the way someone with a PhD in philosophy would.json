    "solution": "17\\text{ meters}",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first consider the Cartesian coordinate system in relation to Stacey's movements. Stacey's starting position can be arbitrarily defined as the origin (0,0) of the coordinate system. As she walks 11 meters west, her position changes to (-11,0). Subsequently, her movement 30 meters north shifts her position to (-11,30). Moving 4 meters west changes her position to (-15,30), and finally, walking 22 meters south places her at the point (-15,8).\n\nTo calculate the distance from Stacey's final position to her starting point (the origin), we utilize the Pythagorean theorem. The distance between two points on a Cartesian plane, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is given by the equation:\n\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nBy applying this formula to Stacey's final position (-15,8) and the origin (0,0), we find:\nDistance = \u221a((-15 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2)\nDistance = \u221a(225 + 64)\nDistance = \u221a289\nDistance = 17 meters\n\nTherefore, Stacey is 17 meters away from her starting point after completing her movements in the field.",
