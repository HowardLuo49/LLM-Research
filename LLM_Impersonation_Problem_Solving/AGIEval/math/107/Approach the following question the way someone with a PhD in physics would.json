    "gpt_response": "To find the total distance Stacey is from her starting point, we must calculate the net displacement vector. This can be done by summing the individual displacement vectors along each cardinal direction.\n\nLet's denote the displacement vectors as follows:\n- 11 meters west: -11 meters in the x-direction\n- 30 meters north: 30 meters in the y-direction\n- 4 meters west: -4 meters in the x-direction\n- 22 meters south: -22 meters in the y-direction\n\nAdding these together, we get:\nNet displacement vector = (-11, 30) + (-4, -22)\nNet displacement vector = (-15, 8)\n\nFinally, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the net displacement vector, which will give us the distance from Stacey's starting point:\nDistance = sqrt((-15)^2 + 8^2)\nDistance = sqrt(225 + 64)\nDistance = sqrt(289)\nDistance = 17 meters\n\nTherefore, Stacey is 17 meters from her starting point.",
