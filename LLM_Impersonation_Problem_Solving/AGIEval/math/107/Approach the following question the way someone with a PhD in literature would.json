    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. Stacey is standing in a field. She walks 11 meters west, 30 meters north, 4 meters west and finally 22 meters south. How many meters is she from her starting point?",
    "solution": "17\\text{ meters}",
    "gpt_response": "In exploring this question from a literary perspective, we may consider the character of Stacey as a protagonist navigating the landscape, both physical and metaphorical. As she moves through the field, her journey can be viewed as a metaphor for the complexities and ambiguities of human experience, mirroring the ups and downs, twists and turns that mark the path of life.\n\nTo determine the distance between Stacey's starting point and her final location, we must first break down her movements into their individual components. Stacey walks 11 meters west, followed by 30 meters north, then 4 meters west, and finally 22 meters south. By tracing her steps on a graph or diagram, we can visualize her journey through the field and calculate the overall displacement.\n\nWhen we analyze Stacey's movement in this way, we see that she has effectively formed a right-angled triangle with sides of 15 meters (11 meters west + 4 meters west) and 8 meters (30 meters north - 22 meters south). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the hypotenuse of this triangle, which represents the direct distance between Stacey's starting point and final location.\n\nThrough this analytical approach, we can determine that Stacey is approximately 17 meters away from her starting point. This mathematical solution, when viewed through a literary lens, serves as a representation of the journey of self-discovery and growth that Stacey undergoes as she navigates the field of her own consciousness. Just as her physical movements lead her from one point to another, her inner journey leads her to new insights and revelations about herself and the world around her.",
