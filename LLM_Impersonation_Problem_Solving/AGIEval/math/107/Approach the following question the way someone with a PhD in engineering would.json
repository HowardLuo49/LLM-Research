    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the distance from Stacey's starting point, we must first represent her movements as displacements in a two-dimensional coordinate system. Let us assign the origin as Stacey's starting point.\n\nFrom the given information, we can denote Stacey's movements as follows:\n\n1. 11 meters west is a displacement of -11 meters in the x-direction.\n2. 30 meters north is a displacement of 30 meters in the y-direction.\n3. 4 meters west is a displacement of -4 meters in the x-direction.\n4. 22 meters south is a displacement of -22 meters in the y-direction.\n\nAdding up all these displacements, we get:\n\n\u0394x = -11 meters - 4 meters = -15 meters\n\u0394y = 30 meters - 22 meters = 8 meters\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the total displacement (d) from Stacey's starting point:\n\nd = \u221a((-15)^2 + 8^2)\nd = \u221a(225 + 64)\nd = \u221a289\nd = 17 meters\n\nTherefore, Stacey is 17 meters away from her starting point.",
