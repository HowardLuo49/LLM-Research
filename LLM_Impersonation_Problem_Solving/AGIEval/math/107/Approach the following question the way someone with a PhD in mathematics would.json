    "solution": "17\\text{ meters}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can represent Stacey's movements as vectors in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Let the west direction be the negative x-axis, the north direction be the positive y-axis, and the south direction be the negative y-axis.\n\nStacey's movements can be represented as the following vectors:\n- 11 meters west: (-11, 0)\n- 30 meters north: (0, 30)\n- 4 meters west: (-4, 0)\n- 22 meters south: (0, -22)\n\nTo find Stacey's position after these movements, we can add these vectors together:\n(-11, 0) + (0, 30) + (-4, 0) + (0, -22) = (-15, 8)\n\nStacey's final position, relative to her starting point, is (-15, 8) meters. To find the distance from her final position to her starting point, we can use the distance formula in two dimensions:\n\u221a((-15)^2 + 8^2) = \u221a(225 + 64) = \u221a289 = 17 meters\n\nTherefore, Stacey is 17 meters away from her starting point after her movements in the field.",
