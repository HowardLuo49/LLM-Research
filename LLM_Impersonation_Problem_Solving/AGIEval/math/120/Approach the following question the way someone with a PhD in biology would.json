    "solution": "\\$6",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an algebraic equation based on the information given. \n\nLet x be the total amount of Carla's savings in dollars. Since Carla spent two-fifths of her savings on the bracelet and had $9 left over, we can set up the equation:\n\n2/5x + 9 = x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n2/5x = x - 9\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2x = 5x - 45\n\nSubtracting 2x from both sides:\n\n3x = 45\n\nDividing by 3:\n\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, Carla's savings before buying the bracelet was $15. Since she had $9 left after buying the bracelet, the cost of the bracelet was:\n\n$15 - $9 = $6\n\nTherefore, Carla's bracelet cost $6.",
