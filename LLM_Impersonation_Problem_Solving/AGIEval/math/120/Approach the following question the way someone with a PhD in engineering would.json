    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation to represent the given information. Let x represent the cost of the bracelet. Since Carla spent two-fifths of her savings on the bracelet and had $9 left over, we can write the equation:\n\n2/5 * S + 9 = S\n\nwhere S is Carla's total savings. \n\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\n2/5 * S + 9 = S\n2/5 * S = S - 9\n2S = 5(S - 9)\n2S = 5S - 45\n3S = 45\nS = 15\n\nSo Carla's total savings is $15. Plugging this back into the original equation to find the cost of the bracelet:\n\n2/5 * 15 + 9 = 15\n6 + 9 = 15\n15 = 15\n\nTherefore, the bracelet cost $\\$ 6$.",
