We know that Carla spent two-fifths of her savings on the bracelet, so we can write the equation:\n\n$\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\text{total savings} = x$\n\nWe also know that Carla had $9 left over after buying the bracelet, so we can write another equation:\n\n$\\text{total savings} - x = 9$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (total savings and cost of the bracelet). We can solve this system of equations to find the cost of the bracelet.",
