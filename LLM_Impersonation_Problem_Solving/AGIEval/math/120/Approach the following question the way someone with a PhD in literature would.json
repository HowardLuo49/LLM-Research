    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the total amount of money Carla had saved as $x$. According to the information given in the question, Carla spent two-fifths of her savings on a bracelet, which implies that she spent $\\frac{2}{5}x$ on the bracelet.\n\nAfter purchasing the bracelet, Carla had $9$ dollars left over. This means that the amount of money she had left was $x - \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{3}{5}x$.\n\nGiven that Carla had $9$ dollars left, we can set up the equation $\\frac{3}{5}x = 9$ and solve for $x$:\n\n$\\frac{3}{5}x = 9$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{3}$:\n\n$x = 9 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = 15$\n\nTherefore, Carla initially saved $\\$ 15$.\n\nTo find out how much the bracelet cost, we can calculate $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 15$:\n\n$\\frac{2}{5} \\times 15 = 6$\n\nHence, Carla's bracelet cost $\\$ 6.00.",
