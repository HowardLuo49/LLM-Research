    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first identify the total amount of money Carla had saved before purchasing the bracelet. Let us denote this total amount of money as $x$ dollars.\n\nWe are given that Carla spent two-fifths of her savings on a bracelet. This means she spent $\\frac{2}{5}x$ dollars on the bracelet. After purchasing the bracelet, she had $9$ dollars left over. Therefore, we can express this information as an equation:\n\n$\\frac{2}{5}x + 9 = x$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2}{5}x = 9$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction, we have:\n\n$2x = 45$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we find that Carla's total savings amounted to $x = 22.5$ dollars. Therefore, Carla spent $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 22.5 = 9$ dollars on the bracelet. \n\nHence, Carla's bracelet cost $9$ dollars.",
