    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a philosophical perspective, we must engage with the underlying concepts of inequality, addition, subtraction, and division. \n\nGiven $a<c$ and $b<0$, we need to consider the implications of these inequalities on the given options.\n\n1. $ab < ac$: This statement must be true because when multiplying by a negative number (in this case $b<0$), the inequality sign is reversed. Therefore, $ab < ac$.\n\n2. $a+b<c+b$: This statement is not necessarily true. Since $b$ is negative, adding $b$ to both sides of the inequality $a<c$ will not change the sign of the inequality relationship between $a$ and $c$. Therefore, $a+b<c+b$ is not always true.\n\n3. $a-b < c-b$: This statement is also true. Similar to the rationale of the first statement, subtracting a negative number will reverse the inequality sign. Hence, $a-b < c-b$.\n\n4. $c/a > 1$: This statement may or may not be true. Depending on the values of $a$ and $c$, $c/a$ can either be greater than 1 or not. \n\nTherefore, the options that must be true are:\n- $ab < ac$ (Option A)\n- $a-b < c-b$ (Option C)",
