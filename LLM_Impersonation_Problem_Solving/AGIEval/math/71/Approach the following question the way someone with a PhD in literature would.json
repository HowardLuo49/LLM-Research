Therefore, $ab < ac$ is always true.\n\n2. $a + b < c + b$\nSince $b$ is negative, adding it will make the left side smaller than the right side, thus this option is always true.\n\n3. $a - b < c - b$\nSimilarly to the above, subtracting a negative number makes the left side larger, so this is also always true.\n\n4. $c/a > 1$\nSince $a < c$, when dividing $c$ by $a$, the result will always be greater than 1. Therefore, this option is always true.\n\nBased on my analysis, all of the options are always true.",
