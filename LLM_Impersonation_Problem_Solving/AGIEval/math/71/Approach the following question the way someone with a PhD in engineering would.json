    "gpt_response": "In order to analyze which among the given options must be true, we can consider the inequalities provided: $a<c$ and $b<0$.\n\n1. $ab < ac$: Multiplying both sides of $a<c$ by $b$, we get $ab < bc$. Since $b < 0$, this means that $ab > ac$. Therefore, this option is not always true.\n\n2. $a+b < c+b$: Adding $b$ to both sides of $a<c$, we get $a+b < c+b$. Therefore, this option is always true.\n\n3. $a-b < c-b$: Subtracting $b$ from both sides of $a<c$, we get $a-b < c-b$. Therefore, this option is always true.\n\n4. $c/a > 1$: Dividing both sides of $a<c$ by $a$, we get $c/a > 1$. Therefore, this option is always true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'B, C, D'.",
