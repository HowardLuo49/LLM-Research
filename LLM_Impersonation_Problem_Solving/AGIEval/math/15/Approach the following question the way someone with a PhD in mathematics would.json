    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}$, we can look for patterns in the units digits of the powers of 6, 7, and 8.\n\nStarting with 16, we can observe that the units digits of the powers of 6 follow a pattern: 6, 6, 6, 6, ..., repeating every 4 powers. Knowing this, we can simplify $16^{17}$ to $6^{17}$, which has a units digit of 6.\n\nSimilarly, the units digits of the powers of 7 repeat in a pattern: 7, 9, 3, 1, ..., cycling every 4 powers. Therefore, we can simplify $17^{18}$ to $7^{18}$, which has a units digit of 1.\n\nFinally, the units digits of the powers of 8 follow a pattern: 8, 4, 2, 6, ..., repeating every 4 powers. We can simplify $18^{19}$ to $8^{19}$, which has a units digit of 8.\n\nMultiplying the units digits of the simplified powers, we get $6 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 48$. Therefore, the units digit of $16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}$ is 8.",
