    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the given expression, we need to consider the pattern of the units digits of the powers of 6, 7, and 8.\n\nFor $16^{17}$, we can observe that the units digit of $6^n$ cycles every 4 powers: $6^{1}$ is 6, $6^{2}$ is 6, $6^{3}$ is 6, and $6^{4}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $16^{17}$ is the same as the units digit of $6^{1}$, which is 6.\n\nSimilarly, for $17^{18}$, the units digit of $7^n$ cycles every 4 powers: $7^{1}$ is 7, $7^{2}$ is 9, $7^{3}$ is 3, $7^{4}$ is 1. Therefore, the units digit of $17^{18}$ is the same as the units digit of $7^{2}$, which is 9.\n\nFinally, for $18^{19}$, the units digit of $8^n$ cycles every 4 powers: $8^{1}$ is 8, $8^{2}$ is 4, $8^{3}$ is 2, $8^{4}$ is 6. Therefore, the units digit of $18^{19}$ is the same as the units digit of $8^{3}$, which is 2.\n\nNow, we can multiply the units digits together to find the units digit of the overall expression: $6 \\times 9 \\times 2 = 108$. The units digit of 108 is 8.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}$ is 8.",
