    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the given expression, we can focus on the units digits of each term $16^{17}$, $17^{18}$, and $18^{19}$ separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider $16^{17}$. The units digit of $6^1$ is 6, and since the units digit of any power of 6 cycles in the pattern of 6, 6, 6, ..., the units digit of $6^{17}$ is also 6.\n\nNext, we look at $17^{18}$. The units digit of $7^1$ is 7, and the units digit of any power of 7 cycles in the pattern of 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1, ..., so the units digit of $7^{18}$ is 1.\n\nFinally, let's examine $18^{19}$. The units digit of $8^1$ is 8, and the units digit of any power of 8 cycles in the pattern of 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6, ..., so the units digit of $8^{19}$ is 8.\n\nMultiplying the units digits of $16^{17}$, $17^{18}$, and $18^{19}$ together, we get $6 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 48$.
