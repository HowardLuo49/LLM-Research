We know that this number is divisible by 12. \n\nThe sum of the known digits in the number is $5+9+1+3+8 = 26$. In order for this number to be divisible by 3, the possible values for $d$ should be such that the sum of all the digits (including $d$) should be divisible by 3.\n\nNext, let's find the congruence of the sum of the digits with $d$ modulo 3:\n\n$(5+9+1+3+d+8) \\equiv 26+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nThis means that $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nThe possible values for $d$ that satisfy the condition are 1, 4, 7.\n\nTo find the sum of all the possible digits that could replace $d$, we simply add these numbers together:\n\n$1+4+7 = 12$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all the digits that could replace $d$ in the given number is 12.",
