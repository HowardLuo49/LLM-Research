    "solution": "4",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the possible values for $d$, we know that a number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits in $591{,}3d8$ is $5+9+1+3+d+8=26+d$. Since 26 is already divisible by 3, we just need to determine the possible values for $d$ that would also make 26+d divisible by 3.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this case, the last two digits are just 8 and d. To find the possible values for $d$ that would make 8d divisible by 4, we can simply list the values of d that would form a number less than 100 and check which of these values would result in a multiple of 4.\n\nConsidering these constraints, we find that the possible values for $d$ are 0, 4, and 8. Therefore, the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $0+4+8=12$.",
