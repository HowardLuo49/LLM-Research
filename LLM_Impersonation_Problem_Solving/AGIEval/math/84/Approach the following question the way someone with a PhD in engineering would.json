    "solution": "4",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the possible digits that could replace $d$, we must first understand the divisibility conditions for 12. A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. \n\nTo check divisibility by 3, we sum the digits of $591{,}3d8$:\n$5 + 9 + 1 + 3 + d + 8 = 26 + d$\nSince 26 is not divisible by 3, in order for the entire number to be divisible by 3, $d$ must be chosen such that $26 + d$ is a multiple of 3. Therefore, $d$ can be 1, 4, 7, or 10 (which is equivalent to 0).\n\nTo check divisibility by 4, we look at the last two digits of $591{,}3d8$. Since $d$ is in the tens place, we must consider the number $38 + d$ to be a multiple of 4. Possible values for $d$ are 2, 6, 10 (which is equivalent to 0).\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $d$ are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7. The sum of these values is $0 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 7 = \\boxed{20}$.",
