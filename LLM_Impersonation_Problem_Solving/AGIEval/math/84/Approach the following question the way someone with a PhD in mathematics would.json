    "gpt_response": "In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4. \n\nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. \nHence, for $591{,}3d8$ to be divisible by 3, \n$5 + 9 + 1 + 3 + d + 8 = 26 + d$ must be divisible by 3. \n\n$26 + d$ is divisible by 3 if $d = 1$ or $d = 4$. \n\nNow, a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. \nTherefore, for $591{,}3d8$ to be divisible by 4, \nthe number formed by the last two digits, 18, must be divisible by 4. \n\nAs we can see, $d$ cannot be 1 (resulting in the number 1818) because it is not divisible by 4. \nThus, $d$ must be 4 in order for the number to be divisible by 12. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all the digits that could replace $d$ is $5 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 30$.",
