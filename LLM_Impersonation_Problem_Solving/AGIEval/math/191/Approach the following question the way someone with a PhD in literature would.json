    "solution": "3600",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the change in area of the square when its length is decreased by $60$ and its width is increased by $60$, it is necessary to first understand the formula for the area of a square. The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square.\n\nIn this particular case, the original square has side length $3491$, so its original area is $A_{\\text{original}} = 3491^2$.\n\nWhen the length of the square is decreased by $60$ and its width is increased by $60$, the new dimensions of the square are $3491 - 60 = 3431$ and $3491 + 60 = 3551$. The new area of the square after these changes is therefore $A_{\\text{new}} = 3431 \\times 3551$.\n\nTo find the change in area of the square, we can subtract the original area from the new area: $\\Delta A = A_{\\text{new}} - A_{\\text{original}} = 3431 \\times 3551 - 3491^2$.\n\nSolving this expression will give us the change in area of the square.",
