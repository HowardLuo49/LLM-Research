    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to understand the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is given by $A = l \\times w$, where $A$ is the area, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.\n\nGiven that the original square has side lengths of $3491$, the area of the original square can be calculated as $A_{\\text{original}} = 3491 \\times 3491$.\n\nWhen the length is decreased by $60$ and the width is increased by $60$, the new lengths of the square become $3431$ and $3551$ respectively. The area of the new square can be calculated as $A_{\\text{new}} = 3431 \\times 3551$.\n\nThe change in area can be calculated as $\\Delta A = A_{\\text{new}} - A_{\\text{original}}$. Substituting the values we calculated earlier, we get $\\Delta A = 3431 \\times 3551 - 3491 \\times 3491$.\n\nBy simplifying this expression, we can find the exact amount by which the area changes in the new square compared to the original square.",
