    "solution": "3600",
    "gpt_response": "To find the change in area when the length of a square is decreased by 60 and the width is increased by 60, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is $A = s^2$ where $s$ is the side length of the square.\n\nLet $s$ be the original side length of the square. The area of the original square is $A_1 = s^2$. After the changes, the new length of the square is $s-60$ and the new width is $s+60$. The area of the new square is $A_2 = (s-60)(s+60)$. \n\nThe change in area is given by:\n$$\\Delta A = A_2 - A_1 = (s-60)(s+60) - s^2$$\n\nExpanding the terms gives:\n$$\\Delta A = s^2 - 60s + 60s - 3600 - s^2 = -3600$$\n\nTherefore, the area of the square decreases by $3600$ square units when the length is decreased by $60$ and the width is increased by $60$.",
