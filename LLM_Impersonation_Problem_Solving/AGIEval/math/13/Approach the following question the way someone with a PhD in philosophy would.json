    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. Carlos has chosen twelve different compact discs (CDs) he would like to buy. Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{295}{396}",
    "gpt_response": "In this scenario, we can approach the problem by first identifying the total number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs out of the 12 available. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is denoted as \"n choose r\" and calculated as n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n represents the total number of items and r represents the number of items being chosen.\n\nIn this case, Carlos is choosing 5 CDs out of 12, so the total number of ways he can do this is 12 choose 5, or 12! / (5!(12-5)!).\n\nTo determine the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each category, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes that meet this condition. This can be found by calculating the number of ways he can choose at least one CD from each category and then dividing that by the total number of ways he can choose 5 CDs.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the number of ways he can choose exactly one CD from each category and then choose the remaining 2 CDs from the remaining 4 CDs. To do this, we can calculate (4 choose 1) * (5 choose 1) * (3 choose 1) * (4 choose 2), which gives us the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs that include at least one CD from each category.\n\nThe probability of this occurring is then the number of ways he can choose at least one CD from each category divided by the total number of ways he can choose 5 CDs, which will give us the desired probability as a common fraction.",
