    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. Carlos has chosen twelve different compact discs (CDs) he would like to buy. Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs out of the 12 available. This can be done using the combination formula, which is nCr = (n!)/(r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 and r = 5, so the total number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs out of the 12 is 12C5 = (12!)/(5!(12-5)!) = 792.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways that Carlos can choose at least one CD from each of the three categories (rap, country, heavy metal). We can do this by finding the number of ways to choose 1 CD from each category and then 2 additional CDs from the remaining CDs.\n\nFor rap music, there are 4C1 = 4 ways to choose 1 CD.\nFor country music, there are 5C1 = 5 ways to choose 1 CD.\nFor heavy metal music, there are 3C1 = 3 ways to choose 1 CD.\n\nAfter choosing 1 CD from each category, there are 4 remaining CDs to choose from (12 total CDs - 3 CDs already chosen). Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 additional CDs is 4C2 = (4!)/(2!(4-2)!) = 6.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose at least one CD from each category, we multiply the number of ways to choose CDs from each category: 4 x 5 x 3 x 6 = 360.\n\nFinally, we divide the number of ways to choose at least one CD from each category by the total number of ways to choose 5 CDs: 360/792 = 45/99 = 5/11.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories is 5/11.",
