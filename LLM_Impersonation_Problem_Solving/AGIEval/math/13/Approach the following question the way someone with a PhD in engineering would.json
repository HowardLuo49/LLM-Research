Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories, we need to calculate the total number of ways he can select 5 CDs out of the 12 available CDs and the number of ways he can choose at least one CD from each category.\n\nThe total number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs out of the 12 available CDs is given by the combination formula:\nTotal ways = 12 choose 5 = 12! / (5! * (12-5)!) = 792\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways Carlos can choose at least one CD from each category. This can be done by finding the number of ways he can choose exactly 1 CD from each category, and the number of ways he can choose 2 CDs from one category and 1 CD from each of the other two categories.\n\nNumber of ways to choose exactly 1 CD from each category:\n4 choose 1 * 5 choose 1 * 3 choose 1 = 4 * 5 * 3 = 60\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 CDs from one category and 1 CD from each of the other two categories:\n(4 choose 2 * 5 choose 1 * 3 choose 1) + (4 choose 1 * 5 choose 2 * 3 choose 1) + (4 choose 1 * 5 choose 1 * 3 choose 2) = (6 * 5 * 3) + (4 * 10 * 3) + (4 * 5 * 3) = 90 + 120 + 60 = 270\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose at least one CD from each category is 60 + 270 = 330.\n\nFinally, the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories is given by the ratio of the number of ways he can choose at least one CD from each category to the total number of ways he can choose 5 CDs:\nProbability = 330 / 792 = 55 / 132 = 5 / 12\n\nSo, the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories is 5/12.",
