Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{295}{396}",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability of Carlos' purchase including at least one CD from each category, we first calculate the total number of ways he can choose 5 CDs from the 12 available CDs. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of CDs (12) and r is the number of CDs he chooses (5).\n\n12C5 = 12! / 5!(12-5)! = 792\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways he can choose CDs that include at least one from each category. This can be done by calculating the number of ways he can choose 1 CD from each category and then choosing the remaining 2 CDs from the remaining 9 CDs that are not in the three categories he has already chosen. This can be done by calculating the product of the combinations for each step:\n\n4C1 * 5C1 * 3C1 * 9C2 = 4 * 5 * 3 * 36 = 2160\n\nTherefore, the probability of Carlos' purchase including at least one CD from each of the three categories is:\n\n2160 / 792 = 45 / 44\n\nTherefore, the probability is 45/44.",
