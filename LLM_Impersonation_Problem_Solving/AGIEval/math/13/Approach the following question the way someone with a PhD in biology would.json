Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{295}{396}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Carlos' purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories, we can use the principle of complementary probability. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways Carlos can select 5 CDs from the 12 available. This can be done using the combination formula, which is nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 12 and r = 5, so there are 12C5 = 792 ways for Carlos to select 5 CDs.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways Carlos can select 5 CDs without including at least one CD from each category. This can be done by considering the three cases separately: selecting only rap CDs, only country CDs, or only heavy metal CDs.\n\n1. Selecting only rap CDs: There are 4C5 = 0 ways to choose 5 CDs from 4 rap CDs.\n2. Selecting only country CDs: There are 5C5 = 1 way to choose 5 CDs from 5 country CDs.\n3. Selecting only heavy metal CDs: There are 3C5 = 0 ways to choose 5 CDs from 3 heavy metal CDs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select 5 CDs without including at least one CD from each category is 0 (since all individual cases result in 0 ways).\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each category by subtracting the probability of not selecting at least one CD from each category from 1:\n\nProbability = 1 - 0 / 792 = 1\n\nTherefore, the probability that Carlos' purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories is 1, or 1/1 as a common fraction.",
