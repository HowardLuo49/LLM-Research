Four are rap music, five are country music, and three are heavy metal music. Carlos then randomly selects five of the 12 CDs to purchase. What is the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{295}{396}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each category, we will use the principle of complementary probability. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs out of the 12 CDs. This can be done using the combination formula:\n\nTotal number of ways = (12 choose 5) = 12! / (5! * (12-5)!) = 792\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs without including at least one CD from each category. This can be done by subtracting the number of ways he can choose CDs that only belong to one or two categories from the total number of ways.\n\nNumber of ways without including at least one CD from each category:\n- Choosing all 5 CDs from rap or country or heavy metal CDs:  (4 choose 5) + (5 choose 5) + (3 choose 5) = 0\n\n- Choosing 4 CDs from one category and 1 CD from another category: (4 choose 4) * (5 choose 1) + (5 choose 4) * (3 choose 1) + (3 choose 4) * (4 choose 1) = 40 + 15 + 12 = 67\n\nTherefore, the number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs without including at least one CD from each category is 67.\n\nNow, the number of ways Carlos can choose 5 CDs that include at least one CD from each category is the complement of the above, which is:\n\nNumber of ways including at least one CD from each category = (Total number of ways) - (Number of ways without including at least one CD from each category) = 792 - 67 = 725\n\nTherefore, the probability that his purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories is:\n\n725 / 792 = 25 / 27\n\nSo, the probability that Carlos's purchase includes at least one CD from each of the three categories is 25/27.",
