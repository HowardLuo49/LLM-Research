    "gpt_response": "To find the area of triangle $ABC$, we can use the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$, where $a$ and $b$ are the side lengths of the triangle and $C$ is the angle between these sides.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of side $AC$. We can use the law of sines to find this length. The law of sines states that $\\frac{\\sin A}{a} = \\frac{\\sin B}{b} = \\frac{\\sin C}{c}$. Since we know $\\sin B$ and $\\sin C$, we can write the following equations:\n\n$\\frac{\\sin A}{AC} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{13}}}{32} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{5}}$\n\n$\\frac{\\sin A}{AC} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}}{AC} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{5}}$\n\nCombining these equations, we get $\\frac{3}{32} = \\frac{1}{AC}$, so $AC = \\frac{32}{3}$.\n\nNow we can find the area of the triangle using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$.
