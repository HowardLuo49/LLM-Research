    "gpt_response": "First, let's analyze the prime factorization of $80 = 2^4 \\cdot 5$. We know that any positive divisor of $80$ can be expressed in the form $2^m \\cdot 5^n$ where $0 \\le m \\le 4$ and $0 \\le n \\le 1$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are distinct positive divisors of $80$, we can express $a = 2^m_1 \\cdot 5^{n_1}$ and $b = 2^m_2 \\cdot 5^{n_2}$ where $0 \\le m_1, m_2 \\le 4$ and $0 \\le n_1, n_2 \\le 1$. \n\nThe product $ab$ can be represented as $2^{m_1 + m_2} \\cdot 5^{n_1 + n_2}$. \n\nNext, we need to find the smallest value of $ab$ such that it is not a divisor of $80$. This means that $m_1 + m_2 > 4$ or $n_1 + n_2 > 1$. Since we want to minimize $ab$, we should aim to make $m_1 + m_2 = 5$ and $n_1 + n_2 = 2$.\n\nLet's try $a = 2^3 \\cdot 5$ and $b = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$. \n\nThen, $ab = (2^3 \\cdot 5) \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 5^2) = 2^5 \\cdot 5^3 = 32 \\cdot 125 = 4000$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $ab$ which is not a divisor of $80$ is $\\boxed{4000}$.",
