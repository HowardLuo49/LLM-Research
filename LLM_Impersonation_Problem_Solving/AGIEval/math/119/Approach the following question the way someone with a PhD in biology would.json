In the graph of $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$, let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.",

    "gpt_response": "To start, we need to determine the behavior of the graph at different critical points. \nThe given function can be simplified as $\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+1)(x+3)} = \\frac{x}{x+1}$. \nAt $x = -1$, there is a hole in the graph as $(x+1)$ is a factor in both the numerator and denominator. So $a = 1$. \nThe vertical asymptotes occur at the values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero, so $b = 1$. \nThe horizontal asymptote can be found by examining the limit of the function as $x$ approaches infinity, which equals 1. Hence, $c = 1$. \nSince the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, there is no oblique asymptote. Therefore, $d = 0$. \nAdding these values together: $a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 1 + 2(1) + 3(1) + 4(0) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$. \nTherefore, the sum is 6.",
