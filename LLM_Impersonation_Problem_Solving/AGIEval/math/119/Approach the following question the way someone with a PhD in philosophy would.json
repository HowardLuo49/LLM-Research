Finding holes in the graph: We can begin by factoring the numerator and denominator of $f(x)$. We have $f(x) = \\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} = \\frac{x}{x+1}$. From this expression, we can see that $f(x)$ is undefined at $x=-1$. This value of $x$ gives rise to a hole in the graph.\n\n2. Identifying vertical asymptotes: In order for $f(x)$ to have vertical asymptotes, the denominator must equal zero at certain values of $x$. We observe that $x=-3$ is a zero of the denominator but not the numerator. Thus, we have a vertical asymptote at $x=-3$.\n\n3. Determining horizontal asymptotes: The degree of the numerator and denominator of $f(x)$ are the same, so we look at the leading coefficients to determine potential horizontal asymptotes. In this case, the horizontal asymptote is $y=1$.\n\n4. Examining oblique asymptotes: To determine whether $f(x)$ has an oblique asymptote, we can perform polynomial long division. Dividing $x^2+3x$ by $x^2+4x+3$, we get $f(x) = x-1 + \\frac{2}{x+1}$. Since the remainder does not approach zero as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity, there are no oblique asymptotes for $f(x)$.\n\nTherefore, we have $a=1$ (hole in the graph), $b=1$ (vertical asymptote), $c=1$ (horizontal asymptote), and $d=0$ (no oblique asymptote). Thus, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1 + 2(1) + 3(1) + 4(0) = 6$.",
