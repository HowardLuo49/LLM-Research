In the graph of $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$, let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.",

    "gpt_response": "To find the number of holes in the graph, we first factor the expression $\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$. This simplifies to $\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+1)(x+3)}$. It is clear that there is 1 hole in the graph at $x = -3$, as this is a point where the numerator and denominator have a common factor of $(x+3)$. Therefore, $a = 1$.\n\nNext, to find the number of vertical asymptotes, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$. This gives $x = -1$. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator after canceling common factors, there will be a vertical asymptote at $x = -1$. Thus, $b = 1$.\n\nFor horizontal asymptotes, we compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since the degrees are equal, we have a horizontal asymptote at the ratio of the leading coefficients, which simplifies to $y = 1$. Therefore, $c = 1$.\n\nLastly, to determine if there are any oblique asymptotes, we divide the numerator by the denominator. This gives $y = \\frac{x}{x+1}$. There is no non-zero remainder when dividing, so there is no oblique asymptote.\n\nTherefore, $a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 1 + 2(1) + 3(1) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$.",
