Point $D$ lies strictly between $A$ and $B$ on $\\overline{AB}$ and point $E$ lies strictly between $A$ and $C$ on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $AD = DE = EC$.  Find $AD.$",

Using the triangle angle bisector theorem on triangle $ADE$, we can derive the equation $\\frac{AB}{EB} = \\frac{AD}{ED}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{10}{EB} = \\frac{x}{x}$.

Since $EC = x$ and $BC = 12$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to obtain the equation $x^2 + 12^2 = 10^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 = 64$.
