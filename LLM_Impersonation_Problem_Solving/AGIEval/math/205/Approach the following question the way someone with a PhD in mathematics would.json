    "gpt_response": "Since $AD = DE = EC$, we can denote $AD = x$. Therefore, $DE = x$ and $EC = x$. By the Triangle Inequality, $AC + CB > AB \\Rightarrow 12 + 10 > x \\Rightarrow 22 > x$. Furthermore, $AB + BC > AC \\Rightarrow 10 + 12 > x \\Rightarrow 22 > x$. Therefore, $x$ must be less than $22$. Since $AD = x$ and $AD = DE$, we know that $DE = x$. We can use Pythagorean Theorem to find $CE$ in terms of $x$:\n$AC^2 = AE^2 + CE^2 \\Rightarrow 10^2 = x^2 + CE^2 \\Rightarrow 100 = 2x^2 + CE^2$. \nSimilarly, since $AD = x$ and $AD = DE$, we can use Pythagorean Theorem to find $CD$ in terms of $x$:\n$BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 \\Rightarrow 12^2 = x^2 + CD^2 \\Rightarrow 144 = x^2 + CD^2$.\nSince $CE = CD$,\n$100 = 2x^2 + CD^2 = 144$.\nThis simplifies to $2x^2 = 44 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 22$.\nThus, $x = \\sqrt{22} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{22}}$.",
