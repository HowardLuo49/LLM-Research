    "gpt_response": "To find the center of an ellipse given its equation, we must first rewrite the equation in standard form. \n\nThe general equation for an ellipse centered at the origin is:\n$\\dfrac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\dfrac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$\n\nwhere $(h,k)$ is the center of the ellipse, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $b$ is the semi-minor axis.\n\nFor the given ellipse equation $9x^2 + 72x + 4y^2 - 8y - 176 = 0$, we need to rewrite it into the standard form. We complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms:\n\n$9(x^2 + 8x) + 4(y^2 - 2y) = 176$\n\n$9(x^2 + 8x + 16) + 4(y^2 - 2y + 1) = 176 + 9(16) + 4(1)$\n\n$9(x+4)^2 + 4(y-1)^2 = 320$\n\n$(x+4)^2/ (16/9) + (y-1)^2/ (80/4) = 1$\n\nTherefore, the center of the ellipse is at $(-4, 1)$.",
