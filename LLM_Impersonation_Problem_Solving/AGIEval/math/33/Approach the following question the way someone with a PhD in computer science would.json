    "gpt_response": "To find the center of the ellipse defined by the given equation, we first need to rewrite the equation in standard form. The standard form of the equation of an ellipse is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,$$\n\nwhere $(h,k)$ is the center of the ellipse, $a$ is the semi-major axis, and $b$ is the semi-minor axis.\n\nTo convert the given equation to standard form, we need to complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms. \n\nStarting with the $x$ terms:\n$9x^2 + 72x = 9(x^2 + 8x) = 9[(x+4)^2 - 16] = 9(x+4)^2 - 144.$\n\nAnd now the $y$ terms:\n$4y^2 - 8y = 4(y^2 - 2y) = 4[(y-1)^2 - 1] = 4(y-1)^2 - 4.$\n\nSubstitute these expressions back into the original equation:\n$9(x+4)^2 - 144 + 4(y-1)^2 - 4 - 176 = 0.$\n$9(x+4)^2 + 4(y-1)^2 - 324 = 0.$\n$9(x+4)^2 + 4(y-1)^2 = 324.$\n\nDivide by 324:\n$\\frac{(x+4)^2}{36} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{81} = 1.$\n\nComparing this with the standard form, we can see that $h = -4$ and $k = 1$. Therefore, the center of the ellipse is at $(-4,1)$.",
