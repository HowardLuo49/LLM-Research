    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we can use Vieta's formulas, which relate the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients. \n\nLet's denote the polynomial as P(x) = a_n*x^n + a_(n-1)*x^(n-1) + ... + a_1*x + a_0, where a_n, a_(n-1), ..., a_0 are the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nSince all the coefficients are integers and the constant coefficient is 42, we have a_0 = 42. \n\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial is given by -a_(n-1)/a_n. Since all the roots are distinct integers, the sum of the roots must also be an integer. Therefore, a_(n-1) must be a multiple of a_n.\n\nIn this case, since all coefficients are integers, a_(n-1) must also be an integer. This means a_n must divide a_(n-1). \n\nFurthermore, if the polynomial has k integer roots, then by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is also equal to -a_(n-1)/a_n. Since all roots are distinct integers, the sum of the roots must be an integer. \n\nTo maximize the number of integer roots, we want a_n to be as small as possible while still dividing a_(n-1). The smallest possible value for a_n in this case is 1, which means a_(n-1) = 42. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of integer roots in the polynomial is equal to the number of factors of 42. Since 42 = 2 * 3 * 7, it has 8 factors (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42). \n\nThus, the largest possible number of integer roots in the polynomial is 8.",
