    "gpt_response": "To tackle this problem, we must first consider the properties of polynomials with integer coefficients. Given that all the coefficients are integers and the constant coefficient is 42, we can express the polynomial in the form:\n\nP(x) = a(x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3)...(x - rn)\n\nWhere \"a\" is the leading coefficient, and r1, r2, r3, ..., rn are the distinct integer roots of the polynomial.\n\nSince all the roots are integers, this implies that a must divide evenly into 42. Therefore, the possible values for a are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16, \u00b17, \u00b114, \u00b121, and \u00b142.\n\nWe are also given that all the roots are distinct, which means that there cannot be repeated roots. Thus, the largest possible number of integer roots occurs when a is equal to 1 or -1. In this case, the integer roots of the polynomial would be the factors of 42.\n\nThe factors of 42 are -21, -14, -7, -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21. Therefore, the largest possible number of integer roots in this scenario is 14.\n\nIn conclusion, the largest possible number of distinct integer roots of the given polynomial with all integer coefficients and a constant coefficient of 42 is 14.",
