    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.\n\nEach die has 6 sides, so there are a total of 6 possible outcomes for each die. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\nOut of these 36 possible outcomes, there is only 1 outcome where the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5. Therefore, the probability of this specific outcome occurring is 1/36.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5 when rolling two 6-sided dice is 1/36.",
