    "solution": "\\frac{1}{36}",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice. Each die has 6 sides, so the total number of outcomes is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\nNext, we determine the number of favorable outcomes, where the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5. There is only one outcome where the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5, so there is only 1 favorable outcome.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5 is:\n1 (favorable outcome) / 36 (total outcomes) = 1/36.\n\nSo the probability is 1/36.",
