    "solution": "\\frac{1}{36}",
    "gpt_response": "In considering the scenario presented where two 6-sided dice are rolled, we must assess the potential outcomes and their associated probabilities. There are a total of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice (6 x 6 = 36), each representing a unique combination of values that can appear on the red and green die.\n\nTo address the specific inquiry regarding the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5, we must identify the number of outcomes that meet this condition. In this case, there is only one outcome in which the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5. Therefore, the probability of this specific outcome occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nHence, the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5 can be expressed as:\n\n\\(P(\\text{Red die shows 2 and green die shows 5}) = \\frac{1}{36}\\)\n\nTherefore, the probability of such an event transpiring is 1 out of 36 or approximately 0.0278, as calculated.",
