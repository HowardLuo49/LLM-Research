    "gpt_response": "In order to find the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5, we first need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.\n\nEach die has 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. When two dice are rolled, the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes of each die, which is 6 x 6 = 36.\n\nThe specific outcome we are interested in is when the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5. This is a single outcome out of the total of 36 possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the red die showing a 2 and the green die showing a 5 is 1/36.",
