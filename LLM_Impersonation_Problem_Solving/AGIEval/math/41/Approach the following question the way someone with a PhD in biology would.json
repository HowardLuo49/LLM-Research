One of the diagonals divides the rhombus into two congruent right triangles with hypotenuse of $30$ units.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the length of each leg of the right triangle:\n$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the right triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse.\n\nLet $x$ be the length of one of the legs of the right triangle.
