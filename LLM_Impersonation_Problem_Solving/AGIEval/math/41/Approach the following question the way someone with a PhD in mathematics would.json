    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by using the properties of a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length, so in this case, each side of the rhombus has a length of $68/4 = 17$ units. \n\nNext, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles to split the rhombus into four right triangles. Since one of the diagonals has a length of 30 units, each half of the diagonal (from the center to a corner of the rhombus) would have a length of 15 units. \n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other diagonal:\n$17^2 = 15^2 + x^2$\n$289 = 225 + x^2$\n$x^2 = 64$\n$x = 8$\n\nTherefore, the other diagonal of the rhombus has a length of 16 units.\n\nFinally, we can find the area of the rhombus using the formula $A = \\frac{d1 \\times d2}{2}$ where $d1$ and $d2$ are the lengths of the diagonals. \n$A = \\frac{30 \\times 16}{2}$\n$A = 240$\n\nTherefore, the area of the rhombus is $240$ square units.",
