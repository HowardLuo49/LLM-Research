    "gpt_response": "In order to find the area of the rhombus, we must first determine the length of its sides. \n\nLet us denote the length of each side of the rhombus as $a$. Since a rhombus has all sides of equal length, the perimeter can be expressed as $4a = 68$, which implies $a = 17$ units. \n\nNext, we need to find the length of the other diagonal of the rhombus. Let us denote this diagonal as $b$. We can see that this diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles. Therefore, by using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find $b$ as follows:\n\n\\[b^2 = a^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}d)^2\\]\n\\[b^2 = 17^2 + 15^2\\]\n\\[b^2 = 289 + 225\\]\n\\[b^2 = 514\\]\n\\[b \\approx 22.68\\]\n\nNow that we have found the lengths of both diagonals, we can calculate the area of the rhombus using the formula:\n\n\\[Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2\\]\n\\[Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 \\times 22.68\\]\n\\[Area \\approx 340.2\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the rhombus is approximately $340.2$ square units.",
