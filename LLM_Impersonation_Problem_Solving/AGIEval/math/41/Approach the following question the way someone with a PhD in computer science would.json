    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the length of each side of the rhombus. Since the perimeter of the rhombus is $68$ units and a rhombus has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by $4$ to get the length of each side. \n\n$68/4 =17$ units \n\nTherefore, each side of the rhombus is $17$ units long. \n\nNext, we can use the diagonal given ($30$ units) and the formula for the area of a rhombus to find the area. The formula for the area of a rhombus is $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d1 \\times d2$, where $d1$ and $d2$ are the lengths of the diagonals. \n\nGiven that one diagonal is $30$ units, we need to find the length of the second diagonal. Since a rhombus has perpendicular diagonals that bisect each other, we can form a right triangle with the two diagonals as its hypotenuse and one side being half the length of a side of the rhombus. \n\nLet $x$ be half the length of a side of the rhombus. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$x^2 + x^2 = 30^2$\n\n$2x^2 = 900$\n\n$x^2 = 450$\n\n$x = 15 \\sqrt{2}$\n\nTherefore, the second diagonal is $2x = 30 \\sqrt{2}$ units long. \n\nNow, we can plug the length of the diagonals into the area formula:\n\n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 \\times 30 \\sqrt{2}$\n\n$A = 450 \\sqrt{2}$ square units\n\nTherefore, the area of the rhombus is $450 \\sqrt{2}$ square units.",
