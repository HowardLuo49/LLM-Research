    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first establish the properties of a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all four sides of equal length and opposite angles equal. Additionally, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. \n\nGiven that the perimeter of the rhombus is $68$ units, we know that each side of the rhombus has a length of $17$ units (as $17 \\times 4 = 68$). \n\nNext, we are given that one of the diagonals of the rhombus is $30$ units in length. Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, we can divide the rhombus into four congruent right-angled triangles. The diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent right triangles with hypotenuse $30$ units and legs $15$ units each.\n\nNow we can calculate the area of one of these triangles using the formula for the area of a right triangle: $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times$ base $\\times$ height. Substituting in the values we have, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times 15 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 225 = 112.5$ square units.\n\nSince there are four of these triangles in the rhombus, the total area of the rhombus is $4 \\times 112.5 = 450$ square units. Thus, the area of the rhombus is $450$ square units.",
