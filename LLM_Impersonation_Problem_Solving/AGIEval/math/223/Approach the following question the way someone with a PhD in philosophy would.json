A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans?",

    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans, we must first determine the total number of possible subcommittees that can be formed from the Senate committee. \n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 members from a group of 13 members (5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents) can be calculated using the combination formula, given as:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nIn this case, n = 13 and r = 3. Therefore, the total number of possible subcommittees that can be formed is:\n\n13C3 = 13! / 3!(13-3)! = 286\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways a subcommittee can consist of three Republicans. Since there are 5 Republicans in the Senate committee, the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 5 is:\n\n5C3 = 5! / 3!(5-3)! = 10\n\nTherefore, the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans is given by the ratio of the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans to the total number of possible subcommittees, as:\n\nP(3 Republicans) = 10 / 286 \u2248 0.035\n\nTherefore, the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans is approximately 0.035, or 3.5%.",
