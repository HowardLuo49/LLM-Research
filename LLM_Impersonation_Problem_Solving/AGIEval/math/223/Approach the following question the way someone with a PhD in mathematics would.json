A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans?",

    "gpt_response": "To find the probability of selecting a subcommittee consisting of three Republicans, we first need to determine the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the total number of members in the Senate committee.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from a total of 13 members is given by the combination formula: \nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\nwhere n is the total number of members (13 in this case) and k is the number of members in the subcommittee (3 in this case).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from 13 members is:\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3! * (13-3)!) = 13! / (3! * 10!) = 286 ways.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways to choose three Republicans from the 5 Republican members. This is given by the combination formula again:\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5-3)!) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10 ways.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a subcommittee consisting of three Republicans is:\nNumber of ways to choose 3 Republicans / Total number of ways to choose a subcommittee\n= 10 / 286\n= 0.03497 (approximately)\n\nSo, the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans is approximately 0.03497 or 3.497%.",
