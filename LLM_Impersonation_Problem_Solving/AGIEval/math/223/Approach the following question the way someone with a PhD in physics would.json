    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans, we must first calculate the total number of ways a subcommittee of 3 members can be chosen from the Senate committee. This can be done using combinations.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from a group of 13 (5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents) is given by the formula:\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3!(13-3)!) = 286\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of ways a subcommittee of 3 Republicans can be chosen from the 5 Republicans in the Senate committee. This is given by the combination:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 10\n\nTherefore, the probability of choosing a subcommittee consisting of three Republicans is:\n\nP(3 Republicans) = Number of ways to choose 3 Republicans / Total number of ways to choose a subcommittee\nP(3 Republicans) = 10 / 286 \u2248 0.035\n\nTherefore, the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans is approximately 0.035, or 3.5%.",
