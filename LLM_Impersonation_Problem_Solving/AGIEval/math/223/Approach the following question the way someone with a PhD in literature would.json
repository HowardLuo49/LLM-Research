    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans, we first need to determine the total number of possible subcommittees that can be formed from the Senate committee.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from the Senate committee is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) \n\nwhere n is the total number of members in the Senate committee (13 in this case) and k is the number of members in the subcommittee (3 in this case).\n\nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3!(13-3)!) \nC(13, 3) = 13! / (3!10!) \nC(13, 3) = (13 x 12 x 11) / (3 x 2 x 1) \nC(13, 3) = 286\n\nTherefore, there are 286 possible subcommittees that can be formed from the Senate committee.\n\nNow, to find the probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans, we need to determine the number of ways three Republicans can be chosen from the five Republicans in the Senate committee. This is given by the combination formula again:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) \nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!2!) \nC(5, 3) = (5 x 4) / (2 x 1) \nC(5, 3) = 10\n\nTherefore, there are 10 ways to choose three Republicans from the Senate committee.\n\nThe probability of the subcommittee consisting of three Republicans is given by the number of ways to choose three Republicans divided by the total number of possible subcommittees:\n\nProbability = 10 / 286 \nProbability \u2248 0.035\n\nTherefore, the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans is approximately 0.035 or 3.5%.",
