An adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long. If the area of the garden is 184 square feet, what is the length, in feet, of the common side?",
    "solution": "23",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let the length of the common side be x feet. Since the area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width, we have:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n184 = x(8)\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 184 / 8\nx = 23\n\nTherefore, the length of the common side is 23 feet.",
