An adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long. If the area of the garden is 184 square feet, what is the length, in feet, of the common side?",
    "solution": "23",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to set up the equation based on the given information. Let the length of the common side between the garden and the house be x feet. The other adjacent side of the garden is given to be 8 feet. \n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the equation: Area = length * width. Therefore, for the garden, we have:\n\n184 = 8 * x\nx = 184 / 8\nx = 23\n\nTherefore, the length of the common side between the garden and the house is 23 feet.",
