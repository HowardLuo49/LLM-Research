An adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long. If the area of the garden is 184 square feet, what is the length, in feet, of the common side?",
    "solution": "23",
    "gpt_response": "In considering this mathematical problem, it is essential for a scholar with a PhD in literature to approach it with precision and attention to detail.\n\nFirstly, let us denote the length of the common side between the house and the garden as x feet. Since one side of the garden is adjacent to the house and is eight feet long, this implies that the other side of the garden, perpendicular to the house, is also x feet long.\n\nGiven that the area of the garden is 184 square feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the area of a rectangle: \n\nArea = length * width\n\nTherefore, \n184 = 8 * x\n\nSolving for x, we find that x = 23 feet. Thus, the length of the common side between the house and the garden is 23 feet.\n\nIn conclusion, a scholar with a PhD in literature approaches this mathematical problem systematically, utilizing algebraic equations to determine the length of the common side between the house and the garden. By engaging in logical reasoning and mathematical calculations, the scholar arrives at the precise answer of 23 feet.",
