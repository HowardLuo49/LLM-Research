    "gpt_response": "To find the length of the common side of the garden, we will set up an equation based on the given information.\n\nLet the length of the common side of the garden be x feet. The width of the garden, which is adjacent to the common side, is given as 8 feet.\n\nTherefore, the area of the garden can be written as:\nx * 8 = 184\n\nSolving for x:\n8x = 184\nx = 184 / 8\nx = 23\n\nTherefore, the length of the common side of the garden is 23 feet.",
