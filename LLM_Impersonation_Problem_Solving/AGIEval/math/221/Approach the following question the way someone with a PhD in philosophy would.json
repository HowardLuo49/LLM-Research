    "gpt_response": "To determine the $y$-coordinate of point A in this isosceles triangle, we need to first establish the relationship between the base and height of the triangle. Since the area of the triangle is given as 240, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n\nIn this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between points B and C, which is 20 units. Let the height be denoted by $h$. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times h = 240$\n\nSolving for $h$, we find that $h = \\frac{240 \\times 2}{20} = 24$\n\nThis height gives us the $y$-coordinate of point A, because the height of a triangle is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of point A is 24.",
