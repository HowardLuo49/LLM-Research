    "gpt_response": "To find the $y$-coordinate of point A, we must first determine the length of the base of the triangle. Since triangle ABC is isosceles, the base is the line segment between points B and C. Using the distance formula, we find that the length of BC is 20 units.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. We know that the area of triangle ABC is 240, and we have just calculated that the base is 20 units. Substituting these values into the formula, we have:\n\n$240 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times \\text{height}$\n\nSolving for the height, we find that the height of the triangle is 24 units. Since point A has the same y-coordinate as the height of the triangle, the y-coordinate of point A is $\\boxed{24}$.",
