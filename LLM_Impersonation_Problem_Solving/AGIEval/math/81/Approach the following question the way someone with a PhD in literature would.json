    "solution": "8000",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation, we must first analyze the equation itself. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers $a$ and $b$, denoted as $\\text{lcm}(a, b)$, is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$. In this case, we are looking for positive integers $r$ such that the LCM of $r$ and $700$ is equal to $7000$.\n\nWe can express the LCM of $r$ and $700$ as:\n\n$$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,700] = \\frac{r \\cdot 700}{\\text{gcd}(r,700)} = 7000$$\n\nwhere $\\text{gcd}(r,700)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $r$ and $700$. Since $700 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$, we can see that the prime factors of $700$ are $2$, $5$, and $7$.\n\nNow, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\\frac{r \\cdot 700}{\\text{gcd}(r,700)} = 7000$$\n\nSolving for $\\text{gcd}(r,700)$, we get:\n\n$$\\text{gcd}(r,700) = \\frac{r \\cdot 700}{7000} = \\frac{r}{10}$$\n\nSince $\\text{gcd}(r,700)$ must be a divisor of both $r$ and $700$, it follows that $10$ must divide $r$. Therefore, $r$ must be of the form $10k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting $r = 10k$ back into the initial equation, we have:\n\n$$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[10k,700] = 7000$$\n\nSince the LCM of $10k$ and $700$ is $700k$, we can equate this to $7000$:\n\n$$700k = 7000$$\n\nSolving for $k$, we find $k = 10$. Therefore, the valid solutions for $r$ are $r = 10 \\cdot 10 = 100$. \n\nIn conclusion, the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation is $100$.",
