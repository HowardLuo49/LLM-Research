    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation, we must first understand the relationship between the least common multiple (lcm) and the prime factorization of the numbers involved.\n\nThe prime factorization of 700 is $2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$. The lcm of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. In this case, the lcm of $r$ and 700 must be a multiple of both $r$ and 700.\n\nSince the lcm of $r$ and 700 is 7000, and the prime factorization of 7000 is $2^3 \\times 5^3 \\times 7$, we know that $r$ must have at least $2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1$ as its prime factors in order for the lcm with 700 to result in 7000.\n\nTherefore, any positive integer $r$ that satisfies the given equation must have the prime factorization $2^a \\times 5^b \\times 7^c$, where $a \\geq 1$, $b \\geq 1$, and $c \\geq 1$.
