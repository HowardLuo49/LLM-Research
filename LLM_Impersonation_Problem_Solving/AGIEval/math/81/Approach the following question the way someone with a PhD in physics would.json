    "solution": "8000",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation, we need to consider the prime factorization of 700.\n\nFirst, we factorize 700 as $2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$. Then, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of $r$ and 700 as $2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2$, which is equal to 7000.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of each prime factor present in the factorizations of the numbers. In this case, the LCM has a 2 with a power of 2, a 5 with a power of 2, and a 7 with a power of 2.\n\nNow, in order for the LCM of $r$ and 700 to be 7000, the number $r$ must have at least the same prime factors as the LCM. This means $r$ must have a factorization that includes $2^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $r$ are numbers of the form $2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2 \\times k$, where $k$ is any positive integer. The sum of all such $r$ can be calculated by summing over all possible values of $k$.\n\nSince $k$ can be any positive integer, the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation is $2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2 \\times (1+2+3+4+5+...)$.\n\nTo find the sum $1+2+3+4+5+...$ we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ where $n$ is the number of terms in the series. In this case, the number of terms is infinite, so we substitute in $n = \\infty$ to find the sum.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the equation is $(2^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2) \\times \\frac{\\infty(\\infty+1)}{2}$.\n\nThis simplifies to $4 \\times 25 \\times 49 \\times \\infty = 4900\\infty$.\n\nHence, the sum of all positive integers $r$ that satisfy the given equation is $4900\\infty$.",
