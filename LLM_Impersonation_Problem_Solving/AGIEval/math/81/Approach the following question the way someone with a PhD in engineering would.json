    "gpt_response": "Let's start by understanding the problem statement. The least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by both numbers. In this case, we are looking for all positive integers r that satisfy the equation \\(\\text{lcm}[r,700] = 7000\\).\n\nWe know that the lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their greatest common factor (gcd). Mathematically, we can represent the lcm as \\(\\text{lcm}(a,b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\text{gcd}(a,b)}\\). \n\nIn our case, we have \\(\\text{lcm}[r,700] = 7000\\). Writing this in terms of the above formula, we get \\(\\frac{r \\cdot 700}{\\text{gcd}(r,700)} = 7000\\).\n\nSince 7000 = 2^3 * 5^3 * 7, we know that r must have factors that include 2, 5, and 7 to satisfy the given equation. The only factor missing from 700 (2^2 * 5^2 * 7) is 2^1. Therefore, we must have 2 as a factor of r.\n\nAdditionally, we know that r must also be a multiple of 700 (2^2 * 5^2 * 7) to satisfy the equation. This means that r must be a multiple of 2 and 100.\n\nSo, the possible values of r are the numbers that are multiples of 2 and 100, which are 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700. Therefore, the sum of all positive integers r that satisfy the given equation is 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 + 500 + 600 + 700 = 2800.",
