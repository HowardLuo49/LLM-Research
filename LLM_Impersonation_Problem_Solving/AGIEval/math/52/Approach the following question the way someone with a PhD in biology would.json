    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which nonzero value of $N$ makes the number $21420N$ divisible by 6, we must consider the divisibility rules for 6. \n\nA number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. To be divisible by 2, the units digit must be even, which means that $N$ can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. \n\nTo be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of $21420N$ would be $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$. For this sum to be divisible by 3, $N$ must be equal to 3. \n\nTherefore, the nonzero value of $N$ that makes the number $214203$ divisible by 6 is $N = 3$.",
