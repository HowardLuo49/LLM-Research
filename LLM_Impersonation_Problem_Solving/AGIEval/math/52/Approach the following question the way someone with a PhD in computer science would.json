    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $N$ that makes the number $21420N$ divisible by $6$, we first need to consider the requirements for a number to be divisible by 6. In order for a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nWe know that a number is divisible by 2 if its units digit is even, and it is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. \n\nThe sum of the digits of $21420N$ is $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$, which must be divisible by 3 for the entire number to be divisible by 3. \n\nFor $9 + N$ to be divisible by 3, $N$ must be congruent to $0\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 3)$. The possible values for $N$ in this case are 0, 3, 6, and 9. \n\nNow, we need to check which of these possible values of $N$ also make $21420N$ divisible by 2. \n\nSince $N$ is the units digit of the number $21420N$, for the number to be divisible by 2, $N$ must be even. \n\nAmong the possible values of $N$ which are congruent to $0\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 3)$, only $N = 0$ satisfies the condition of being even. Therefore, the value of $N$ that makes the number $21420N$ divisible by 6 is $N = 0$.",
