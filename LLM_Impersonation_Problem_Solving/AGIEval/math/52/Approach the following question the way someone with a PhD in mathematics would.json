    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the integer represented by the number $21420N$. We are looking for the nonzero value of $N$ such that $n$ is divisible by $6$. \n\nTo determine divisibility by 6, we can check if $n$ is divisible by both 2 and 3. Since $n$ ends in the digit $N$, we know that $n$ is even if and only if $N$ is even. Hence, $N$ must be even. Furthermore, a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. \n\nThe sum of the digits of the number $21420N$ is $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$. For this sum to be divisible by 3, $N$ must be 3 or 9. However, $N$ must be even and nonzero. Thus, the only valid solution is $N=6$. \n\nTherefore, the unique nonzero value of $N$ that makes the number $214206$ divisible by 6 is $N=6$.",
