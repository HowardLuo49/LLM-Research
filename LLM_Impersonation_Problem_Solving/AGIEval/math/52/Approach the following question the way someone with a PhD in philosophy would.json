    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. Let $N$ be the units digit of the number $21420N$. Which nonzero value of $N$ makes this number divisible by $6$?",
    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "In addressing this question, it is essential to draw upon basic principles of number theory and modular arithmetic. Divisibility by 6 requires that a number be divisible by both 2 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 2, its units digit must be even. Therefore, N could take on the values 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Furthermore, for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In this context, the sum of the digits of $21420N$ can be expressed as $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$. In order for that sum to be divisible by 3, it follows that $N$ must be equal to 3. Thus, the nonzero value of $N$ that would render the number $214203$ divisible by 6 is 3.",
