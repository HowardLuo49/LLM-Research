    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "In order for a number to be divisible by 6, it must first be divisible by both 2 and 3. \n\nFor a number to be divisible by 2, its units digit must be even. This means that $N$ can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits in the number $21420N$ is given by $2+1+4+2+0+N=9+N$. In order for this sum to be divisible by 3, $N$ must be equal to either 0 or 3.\n\nWe already know that $N$ must be even for the number to be divisible by 2, so the only possible value for $N$ that satisfies both conditions is $N=0$.\n\nTherefore, the only nonzero value of $N$ that makes the number $21420N$ divisible by 6 is $N=0$.",
