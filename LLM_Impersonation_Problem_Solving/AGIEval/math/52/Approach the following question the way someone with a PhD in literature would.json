    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "To determine which nonzero value of $N$ makes the number $21420N$ divisible by $6$, we must consider the divisibility rules for 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. \n\nFirst, we examine divisibility by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if its units digit is even. Therefore, $N$ must be an even number in order for $21420N$ to be divisible by 2.\n\nNext, we consider divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. In this case, the sum is $2+1+4+2+0+N=9+N$. Therefore, for $21420N$ to be divisible by 3, $9+N$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nCombining the requirements for divisibility by 2 and 3, we find that $N$ must be an even number such that $9+N$ is divisible by 3. The only such value of $N$ is $N=6$. Therefore, the number $214206$ is the only number with a nonzero value of $N$ that is divisible by 6.",
