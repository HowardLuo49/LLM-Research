Each of them arrives at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00. What is the probability that the number of minutes Alice is late for the party plus the number of minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "\\frac{9}{32}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this probability problem, we can first define the random variables for Alice and Bob's lateness to the party. Let X represent the number of minutes Alice is late, and Y represent the number of minutes Bob is late. \n\nSince each of them arrives at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00, the possible values for X and Y range from 0 to 60 minutes. \n\nWe want to find the probability that X + Y is less than 45 minutes. This can be visualized as the area under the region where the sum of X and Y is less than 45 on a coordinate plane where X and Y are the axes.\n\nTo find this probability, we can calculate the total number of outcomes in the sample space, which is 60 * 60 = 3600.\n\nNext, we can determine the area under the region where X + Y is less than 45 minutes. This area is a right-angled triangle with sides measuring 45 minutes. The area of this triangle is (1/2) * 45 * 45 = 1012.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of X and Y is less than 45 is 1012.5 / 3600 = 9 / 32. \n\nSo, the probability that the sum of the minutes Alice and Bob are late for the party is less than 45 is 9/32.",
