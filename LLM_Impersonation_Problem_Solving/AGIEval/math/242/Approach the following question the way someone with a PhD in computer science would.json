Each of them arrives at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00. What is the probability that the number of minutes Alice is late for the party plus the number of minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to define the scenario mathematically. Let the random variable X represent the number of minutes Alice is late for the party, and let the random variable Y represent the number of minutes Bob is late for the party. Therefore, X and Y follow a uniform distribution between 0 and 60 minutes.\n\nWe are interested in finding the probability that X + Y < 45. To determine this, we need to calculate the region in the XY-plane where the sum of X and Y is less than 45.\n\nThe total area of the XY-plane is 60*60 = 3600 square minutes. The region where X + Y < 45 forms a triangle with vertices (0, 0), (45, 0), and (0, 45), which has an area of 0.5 * 45 * 45 = 1012.5 square minutes.\n\nTherefore, the probability that X + Y < 45 is given by the ratio of the area of the desired region to the total area of the XY-plane, which is 1012.5/3600 = 9/32.\n\nThus, the probability that the sum of the minutes Alice is late and Bob is late for the party is less than 45 minutes is \\( \\frac{9}{32} \\).",
