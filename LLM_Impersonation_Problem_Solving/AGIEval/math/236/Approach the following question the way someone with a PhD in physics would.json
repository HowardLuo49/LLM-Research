    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. A recipe for crispy rice treats results in a mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. If a crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe is poured into a pan that is 10 inches by 15 inches, to what depth, in inches, will the pan be filled? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "1.17",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first calculate the volume of the original crispy rice treats mixture and then determine the volume of the new mixture. Since volume is directly proportional to depth, we can find the new depth of the mixture by dividing the new volume by the new pan's area.\n\nGiven that the original pan size is 9 inches by 13 inches and filled to a depth of one inch, the volume of the original mixture can be calculated as:\n\nVolume_original = 9 * 13 * 1 = 117 cubic inches\n\nIf 1.5 times the original recipe is used, the new volume of the mixture can be calculated as:\n\nVolume_new = 1.5 * 117 = 175.5 cubic inches\n\nThe new pan size is 10 inches by 15 inches. Therefore, the new depth of the mixture can be calculated as:\n\nDepth_new = Volume_new / (10 * 15) = 175.5 / 150 = 1.17 inches\n\nSo, the pan will be filled to a depth of 1.17 inches.",
