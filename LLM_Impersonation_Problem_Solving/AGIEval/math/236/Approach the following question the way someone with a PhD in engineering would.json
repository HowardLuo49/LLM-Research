    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. A recipe for crispy rice treats results in a mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. If a crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe is poured into a pan that is 10 inches by 15 inches, to what depth, in inches, will the pan be filled? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "1.17",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the final depth of the crispy rice treats mixture in the larger pan, we can use the concept of volume conservation. The volume of the mixture will remain the same before and after the change in pan size. \n\nThe volume of the original mixture can be calculated as follows:\nVolume = length x width x depth\nVolume = 9 inches x 13 inches x 1 inch\nVolume = 117 cubic inches\n\nWhen the recipe is increased by 1.5 times, the volume of the new mixture will be:\nNew Volume = 1.5 x 117 cubic inches\nNew Volume = 175.5 cubic inches\n\nNow, we need to find the depth of the new mixture in the larger pan. Let's assume the depth of the new mixture in the larger pan is \"d\" inches. The new volume can be calculated using the dimensions of the larger pan:\nVolume = 10 inches x 15 inches x d inches\n\nSince the volume remains the same:\n10 inches x 15 inches x d inches = 175.5 cubic inches\n\nSolving for \"d,\" we get:\n150d = 175.5\nd = 175.5 / 150\nd = 1.17 inches\n\nTherefore, the depth of the new crispy rice treats mixture in the larger pan will be approximately 1.17 inches.",
