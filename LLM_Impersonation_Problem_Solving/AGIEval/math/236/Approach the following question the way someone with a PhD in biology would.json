    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. A recipe for crispy rice treats results in a mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. If a crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe is poured into a pan that is 10 inches by 15 inches, to what depth, in inches, will the pan be filled? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "solution": "1.17",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the depth to which the pan will be filled with the mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe, we must first calculate the volume of the mixture for both the original recipe and the increased recipe.\n\nThe volume of the mixture for the original recipe can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pan:\nVolume_original = 9 inches x 13 inches x 1 inch = 117 cubic inches\n\nFor the mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe, the volume can be calculated by multiplying the dimensions of the larger pan and the increased depth:\nVolume_new = 10 inches x 15 inches x D inches\n\nSince the volume of the new mixture is 1.5 times the original mixture, we can express this mathematically as:\n1.5 x Volume_original = Volume_new\n\nSubstitute the values for Volume_original and Volume_new:\n1.5 x 117 cubic inches = 10 inches x 15 inches x D inches\n\n175.5 cubic inches = 150 square inches x D inches\n\nSolve for D:\nD = 175.5 cubic inches / 150 square inches\nD \u2248 1.17 inches\n\nTherefore, the pan will be filled to a depth of approximately 1.17 inches.",
