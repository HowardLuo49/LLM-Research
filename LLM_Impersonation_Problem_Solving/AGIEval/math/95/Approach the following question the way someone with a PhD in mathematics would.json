At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
    "solution": "9c+6",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total amount spent by Jamie and Kevin in terms of $c$, we first note that the cost of a vanilla bar is $c+2$ dollars. \n\nJamie spends $c$ dollars on the chocolate bar and $3(c+2)$ dollars on the three vanilla bars. Thus, Jamie spends a total of $c + 3(c+2)$ dollars.\n\nKevin spends $5c$ dollars on the five chocolate bars.\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent by Jamie and Kevin at the candy store is $c + 3(c+2) + 5c$. Simplifying, we get $c + 3c + 6 + 5c = \\boxed{9c + 6}$ dollars.",
