At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
    "solution": "9c+6",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we first need to establish the relationship between the cost of a chocolate bar and a vanilla bar. Let's denote the cost of a chocolate bar as $c$ dollars. Then, according to the given information, the cost of a vanilla bar would be $c+2$ dollars.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Jamie and Kevin at the candy store. Jamie buys one chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, so Jamie spends $1 \\cdot c + 3 \\cdot (c+2)$ dollars. Simplifying this expression, we get $c + 3c + 6 = 4c + 6$ dollars spent by Jamie.\n\nOn the other hand, Kevin buys five chocolate bars, so Kevin spends $5 \\cdot c$ dollars. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of money spent by Jamie and Kevin at the candy store, in terms of $c$, is $4c + 6 + 5c = 9c + 6$ dollars.",
