    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
    "solution": "9c+6",
    "gpt_response": "Let us first define the cost of a vanilla bar in terms of the cost of a chocolate bar. Since a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar, we can express the cost of a vanilla bar as $c+2$ dollars.\n\nJamie buys a chocolate bar for $c$ dollars and three vanilla bars for a total cost of $3(c+2)$. Therefore, Jamie spends a total of $c + 3(c+2)$ dollars at the candy store.\n\nKevin buys five chocolate bars, each for a cost of $c$ dollars. Therefore, Kevin spends a total of $5c$ dollars at the candy store.\n\nAdding Jamie and Kevin's total spending together, we get:\n\nTotal spending $= c + 3(c+2) + 5c$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nTotal spending $= c + 3c + 6 + 5c$\n\nTotal spending $= 9c + 6$ dollars\n\nTherefore, Jamie and Kevin spend a total of $9c + 6$ dollars at the candy store in terms of $c$.",
