At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
    "solution": "9c+6",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in biology, we would first set up the problem by defining the cost of the chocolate bar as $c$ dollars. Since a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar, the cost of a vanilla bar would be $(c + 2)$ dollars.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total amount of money Jamie spent by buying one chocolate bar and three vanilla bars. The total cost for Jamie would be:\n$$\nc + 3(c + 2) = c + 3c + 6 = 4c + 6\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of money Kevin spent by buying five chocolate bars. The total cost for Kevin would be:\n$$\n5c\n$$\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money Jamie and Kevin spent at the candy store in terms of $c$ would be the sum of the amounts they each spent:\n$$\n4c + 6 + 5c = 9c + 6\n$$\n\nIn conclusion, Jamie and Kevin spent $9c + 6$ dollars in total at the candy store.",
