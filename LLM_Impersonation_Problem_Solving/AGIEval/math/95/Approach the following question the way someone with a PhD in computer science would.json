At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the cost of a vanilla bar in terms of $c$. Given that a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar, we can express the cost of a vanilla bar as $c+2$ dollars.\n\nJamie buys one chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, so he spends $c + 3(c+2) = 4c + 6$ dollars.\n\nKevin buys five chocolate bars, so he spends $5c$ dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money spent by Jamie and Kevin at the candy store in terms of $c$ is $4c + 6 + 5c = 9c + 6$ dollars.",
