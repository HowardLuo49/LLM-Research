A diagonal is a line segment connecting any two non-adjacent vertices of a polygon.\n\nIn a convex hexagon, each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a diagonal, with the exception of its immediate neighbors. This means that there are a total of 9 possible diagonals that can be drawn in a convex hexagon.\n\nTherefore, a convex hexagon can have 9 distinct diagonals that can be drawn.",
