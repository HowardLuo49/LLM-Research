    "gpt_response": "We can approach this problem by utilizing properties of angles in circles and the Power of a Point theorem. Since $AP = CP = 7$ and $AB$ and $CD$ are chords intersecting at $P$, we can deduce that $\\triangle ABP$ and $\\triangle CDP$ are isosceles triangles.\n\nLet $\\angle ABP = \\alpha$ and $\\angle CDP = \\beta$. Since $\\triangle ABP$ and $\\triangle CDP$ are isosceles, we have $\\angle APB = 180^\\circ - 2\\alpha$ and $\\angle CPD = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta$. Therefore, $\\angle APD = 360^\\circ - \\angle APC - \\angle CPD = 360^\\circ - 2\\alpha - 2\\beta$.\n\nSince $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, we have $\\angle APD + \\angle CPB = 180^\\circ$. Substituting the expressions for $\\angle APD$ and $\\angle CPB$, we get $360^\\circ - 2\\alpha - 2\\beta + \\alpha + \\beta = 180^\\circ$. This simplifies to $180^\\circ - \\alpha - \\beta = 0$ or $\\alpha + \\beta = 180^\\circ$.\n\nBy the Power of a Point theorem, $AP \\cdot BP = CP \\cdot DP$, or $7 \\cdot BP = 7 \\cdot DP$. Therefore, $BP = DP$. Since $\\triangle ABP$ and $\\triangle CDP$ are isosceles triangles and $\\angle APB = \\angle CPD = 2\\alpha$, we have $\\angle ABP = \\angle CDP = \\alpha$. Therefore, $\\angle BPD = 180^\\circ - 2\\alpha = \\beta$.\n\nBy triangle similarity, $\\triangle BPD \\sim \\triangle DPC$.
