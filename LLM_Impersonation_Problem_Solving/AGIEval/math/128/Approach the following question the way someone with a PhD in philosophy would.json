    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first consider the given equation $f(x) = x^7 + ax^3 + cx$ and the fact that $f(5) = 3.$ This tells us that when we substitute $x = 5$ into the function $f(x)$, we get a value of $3$. So, we have:\n\n$f(5) = 5^7 + a(5)^3 + c(5) = 3$\n\nSolving for $a$ and $c$ may not be straightforward, as the equation is nonlinear and involves multiple variables. However, we can make use of a key property of polynomials to simplify the problem.\n\nWe know that polynomials are symmetric with respect to their roots.
