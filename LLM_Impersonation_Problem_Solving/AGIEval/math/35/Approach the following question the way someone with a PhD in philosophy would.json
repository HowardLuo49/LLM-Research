This results in 15 times 35 times 21 being equal to 11,025. \n\nNext, we calculate the square root of 11,025. To do this, we consider the prime factorization of 11,025, which is 3 x 5 x 5 x 7 x 7. We then take the square root of each prime factor, resulting in the square root of 11,025 being 3 x 5 x 7 = 105.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 15 times 35 times 21 is 105.",
