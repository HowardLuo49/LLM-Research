    "solution": "26",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine Ben's minimum height, we must first establish that the function representing his height off the ground is a quadratic function. The general form of a quadratic function is $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\n\nFor Ben's height function, $h(t) = 2t^2 - 5t + 29$, we can see that $a = 2$, $b = -5$, and $c = 29$. The vertex of a quadratic function in the form $f(t) = at^2 + bt + c$ can be found using the formula $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nSubstitute $a = 2$ and $b = -5$ into the formula to find the time at which Ben's height is minimized:\n\n$t = -\\frac{-5}{2(2)} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$.\n\nNow, to find Ben's minimum height, substitute $t = 1.25$ into the height function:\n\n$h(1.25) = 2(1.25)^2 - 5(1.25) + 29$.\n\n$h(1.25) = 2(1.5625) - 6.25 + 29$\n\n$h(1.25) = 3.125 - 6.25 + 29$\n\n$h(1.25) = 25.875$.\n\nTherefore, to the nearest foot, Ben's minimum height would be approximately 26 feet as he climbs the tree with a lot of branches.",
