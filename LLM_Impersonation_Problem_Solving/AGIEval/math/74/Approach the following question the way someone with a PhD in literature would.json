In other words, we are seeking the solution to the equation $2^n = 64$. By simplifying, we can rewrite 64 as $2^6$, which implies that $\\log_2 64 = 6$. Therefore, the base 2 logarithm of 64 is equal to 6. This calculation exemplifies the fundamental principle underlying logarithmic functions, which express the inverse relationship between exponentiation and logarithms.",
