    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the division of two numbers. According to the problem statement, when 39,500 is divided by an integer $n$, the quotient is 123 and the remainder is 17. This can be represented as:\n\n39,500 = 123n + 17\n\nNow, let's solve for $n$ using this equation. First, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:\n\n39,500 - 17 = 123n\n39,483 = 123n\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 123 to solve for $n:\n\nn = 39,483 / 123\nn = 321\n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ is 321.",
