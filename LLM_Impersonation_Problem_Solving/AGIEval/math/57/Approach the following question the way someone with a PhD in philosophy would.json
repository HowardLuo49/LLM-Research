    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem as a philosopher with a PhD, we must first understand the nature of division and how remainders are used in mathematics. Division is the process of distributing a quantity into equal parts and determining how many times one number can be divided by another. The remainder is what is left over after the division process has been completed.\n\nIn this particular problem, we are given that when 39,500 is divided by an integer $n$, the quotient is 123 and the remainder is 17. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n39,500 = 123n + 17\n\nNow, to find the integer $n$, we must first isolate it by subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation:\n\n39,500 - 17 = 123n\n39,483 = 123n\n\nTo find the value of $n$, we must divide 39,483 by 123:\n\nn = 39,483 / 123\nn = 321\n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem is 321.",
