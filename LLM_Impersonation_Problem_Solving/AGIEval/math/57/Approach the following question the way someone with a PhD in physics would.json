    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem as a physicist, we can use the concept of division in modular arithmetic. When a number is divided by another number, the remainder can be expressed in terms of modular arithmetic. In this case, we have:\n\n39500 \u2261 123n + 17 (mod n)\n\nThis equation tells us that when 39500 is divided by n, the remainder is 17. In other words, 39500 is congruent to 17 modulo n. We can rearrange this equation to solve for n:\n\n39500 \u2261 123n + 17 (mod n)\n\n39500 - 17 \u2261 123n (mod n)\n\n39483 \u2261 123n (mod n)\n\nSince the remainder of 39483 divided by n is 0, we can write this as:\n\n39483 = 123n\n\nNow we can solve for n:\n\nn = 39483 / 123\nn = 321\n\nTherefore, the integer n that divides 39500 with a quotient of 123 and a remainder of 17 is 321.",
