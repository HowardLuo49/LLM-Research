    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for division of integers. When a number (in this case, 39,500) is divided by another number (n), the quotient (123) can be expressed as:\n\n39,500 = n * 123 + 17\n\nNow, we need to solve for n. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n39,500 = 123n + 17\n\nSubtracting 17 from both sides gives:\n\n39,483 = 123n\n\nDividing both sides by 123 gives:\n\nn = 321\n\nTherefore, the integer n that divides 39,500 to give a quotient of 123 and a remainder of 17 is 321.",
