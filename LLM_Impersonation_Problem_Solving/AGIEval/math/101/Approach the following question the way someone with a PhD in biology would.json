Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?",
    "solution": "100\\%",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we first need to understand the implications of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in the context of quantum mechanics. The principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously measure both the position and momentum of a particle with arbitrary precision. This is due to the inherent quantum nature of particles, where their properties are described by wave functions that exhibit wave-like behavior.\n\nMathematically, the uncertainty principle is expressed as:\n\n\u0394x * \u0394p \u2265 h/4\u03c0\n\nwhere \u0394x is the uncertainty in the measurement of the particle's position, \u0394p is the uncertainty in the measurement of the particle's momentum, and h is the Planck constant.\n\nNow, suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. This means that \u0394p is now \u0394p/2. We want to determine how this change affects the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position.\n\nLet's denote the new minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position as \u0394x'. According to the uncertainty principle, we have:\n\n\u0394x' * (\u0394p/2) \u2265 h/4\u03c0\n\nSolving for \u0394x', we find:\n\n\u0394x' \u2265 (h/4\u03c0) * 2/\u0394p\n\u0394x' \u2265 h/2\u03c0\u0394p\n\nNow, we want to compare \u0394x' to the original minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position, \u0394x. The percentage increase in the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position can be calculated as follows:\n\nPercentage increase = ((\u0394x' - \u0394x)/\u0394x) * 100\nPercentage increase = ((h/2\u03c0\u0394p - h/4\u03c0\u0394p)/(h/4\u03c0\u0394p)) * 100\nPercentage increase = ((2/2 - 1/4)/(1/4)) * 100\nPercentage increase = (1/2) * 100\nPercentage increase = 50%\n\nTherefore, if the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved, the minimum error in the measurement of its position will increase by 50%.",
