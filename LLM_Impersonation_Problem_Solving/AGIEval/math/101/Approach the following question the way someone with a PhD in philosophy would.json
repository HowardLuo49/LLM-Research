Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?",
    "solution": "100\\%",
    "gpt_response": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously measured. It dictates that the product of the uncertainties in the measurements of these properties must be greater than or equal to a certain value, specifically Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$.\n\nGiven this principle, let us consider a scenario where the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum is halved. We are interested in determining the corresponding increase in the minimum error in the measurement of its position.\n\nLet $\\Delta p$ and $\\Delta x$ represent the original errors in the measurement of the particle's momentum and position, respectively, and let $\\frac{\\Delta p}{2}$ represent the halved error in the measurement of the momentum. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we have:\n\n$\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nSubstituting the halved error in the measurement of momentum, we obtain:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{2} \\cdot \\Delta x \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nFrom this inequality, we can solve for $\\Delta x$:\n\n$\\Delta x \\geq \\frac{2h}{\\Delta p \\cdot 4\\pi}$\n\nNext, we can determine the minimum error in the measurement of position resulting from the halved error in momentum measurement by calculating the new minimum value of $\\Delta x$. We first find the original minimum measurement error in position by considering the equality case in the Uncertainty Principle:\n\n$\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x = \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nSubstitute the original error in momentum and solve for the original error in position:\n\n$\\Delta x = \\frac{h}{4\\pi \\cdot \\Delta p}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage increase in the minimum error in the measurement of position as a result of halving the error in momentum measurement. Let $\\Delta x_{\\text{new}}$ denote the new error in position measurement. The percentage increase can be calculated as:\n\n$\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta x_{\\text{new}} - \\Delta x}{\\Delta x} \\right) \\times 100$\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\Delta x_{\\text{new}}$ and $\\Delta x$ into the formula above and simplify to find the percentage increase.\n\nIn conclusion, a detailed analysis of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and its implications on the measurements of a particle's position and momentum reveals the intricacies of quantum mechanics and the limitations imposed by fundamental physical laws. By following the steps outlined above, we can rigorously determine the increase in the minimum error in the measurement of position resulting from a halved error in the measurement of momentum.",
