Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?",

    "gpt_response": "To address the question posed, we must first acknowledge the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics as encapsulated by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. This principle posits a fundamental limitation on the precision with which certain pairs of properties of a particle, such as momentum and position, can be simultaneously determined. Specifically, the product of the uncertainties in the measurement of these properties must be greater than or equal to a certain limit, in this case, Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. \n\nIn the context of this question, we are tasked with examining how a change in the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum impacts the minimum error in the measurement of its position. Let us denote the initial errors in the momentum and position measurements as $\\Delta p$ and $\\Delta x$ respectively, and the corresponding initial uncertainty products as $\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x$. According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, we have:\n\n$\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nwhere $h$ represents Planck's constant.\n\nIf the error in the measurement of the particle's momentum is halved, the new error in the measurement of momentum becomes $\\frac{\\Delta p}{2}$. In order to determine the corresponding increase in the minimum error in the measurement of position, denoted as $\\Delta x_{\\text{new}}$, we must first calculate the new uncertainty product, which is given by:\n\n$\\left(\\frac{\\Delta p}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\Delta x_{\\text{new}} \\geq \\frac{h}{4\\pi}$\n\nRearranging the above inequality, we find:\n\n$\\Delta x_{\\text{new}} \\geq \\frac{2h}{4\\pi \\cdot \\Delta p}$\n\nNow, we can assess the percentage increase in the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position by comparing the initial uncertainty product $\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x$ to the new uncertainty product $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta p}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\Delta x_{\\text{new}}$:\n\n$\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta p}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\Delta x_{\\text{new}} - \\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x}{\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta x} \\times 100\\%$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $\\Delta x_{\\text{new}}$, then simplify the expression to obtain the final answer.",
