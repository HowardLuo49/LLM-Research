    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when a base 4 number is divided by 8, we need to convert the base 4 number to base 10 first. \n\nWe start by multiplying each digit in the base 4 number by its positional value in base 4. Starting from the rightmost digit, we have:\n$2 \\times 4^0 = 2 \\\\\n3 \\times 4^1 = 12 \\\\\n2 \\times 4^2 = 32 \\\\\n0 \\times 4^3 = 0 \\\\\n1 \\times 4^4 = 256 \\\\\n3 \\times 4^5 = 3072 \\\\\n0 \\times 4^6 = 0 \\\\\n1 \\times 4^7 = 16384$\n\nAdding all these up, we get: $2 + 12 + 32 + 0 + 256 + 3072 + 0 + 16384 = 19758$\n\nTo find the remainder when 19758 is divided by 8, we divide 19758 by 8: \n$19758 \\div 8 = 2470 R 6$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the base 4 number $120301232_4$ is divided by 8 in base 10 is 6.",
