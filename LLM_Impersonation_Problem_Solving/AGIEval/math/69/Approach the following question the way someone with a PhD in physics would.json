    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ways to fill in the tens digit and hundreds digit of $1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4$ so that it is divisible by $11$, we need to consider the divisibility rule for $11$. \n\nA number is divisible by $11$ if the difference between the sum of the digits at the odd positions and the sum of the digits at the even positions is a multiple of $11$.\n\nIn this case, the number we are considering is $1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4$. So, if we call the tens digit $a$ and the hundreds digit $b$, the number becomes $1ab4$. \n\nThe sum of the odd-position digits (1 and 4) is $1+4 = 5$.\nThe sum of the even-position digits (a and b) is $a+b$.\n\nFor the number $1ab4$ to be divisible by $11$, we need the difference of the sum of the odd-position digits and the sum of the even-position digits to be a multiple of $11$. This gives us the equation:\n\n$5 - (a+b) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSolving this equation gives us $5 \\equiv a+b \\pmod{11}$.\n\nTherefore, we need to find all pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a+b \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are digits, we have limited possibilities.
