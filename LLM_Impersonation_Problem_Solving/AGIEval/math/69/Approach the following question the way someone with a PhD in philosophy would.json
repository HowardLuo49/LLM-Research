    "gpt_response": "In response to the question at hand, we must consider the criteria for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. In the case of the given number $1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4$, this alternating sum would be $1 - \\underline{\\hphantom{2}} + \\underline{\\hphantom{2}} - 4 = -3 + \\underline{\\hphantom{2}}$. To ensure that this sum is divisible by 11, it is clear that we must choose a digit between 0 and 9 to replace the open digit $\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}$ such that the resulting number is congruent to 3 modulo 11. This constraint provides 10 possible values for the tens digit to satisfy the divisibility criterion. By extension, there are also 10 possible values for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are a total of $10 \\times 10 = 100$ ways to fill in the tens digit and hundreds digit of $1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4$ such that it is divisible by 11.",
