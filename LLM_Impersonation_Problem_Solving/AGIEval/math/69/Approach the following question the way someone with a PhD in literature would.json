In the given number $1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4$, the odd-positioned digit is 1 and the even-positioned digit is 4. Therefore, we have:\n\n$(1+4) - (t + h) = 11k$, where t represents the tens digit and h represents the hundreds digit, and k is an integer. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we obtain:\n\n$5 - (t + h) = 11k$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$t + h = 5 - 11k$\n\nSince t and h are both single-digit numbers, the possible combinations to satisfy the equation are:\n\n(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1). \n\nHence, there are 4 ways to fill in the tens digit and hundreds digit of the number $1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4$ so that it is divisible by 11.",
