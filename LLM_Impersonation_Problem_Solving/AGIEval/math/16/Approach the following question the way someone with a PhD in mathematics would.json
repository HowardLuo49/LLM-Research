By the properties of modular arithmetic, we know that $617n \\equiv 943n \\pmod{18}$ is equivalent to $617n - 943n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{18}$.\n\nSimplifying further, we have $-326n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{18}$. Now, we want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence. \n\nGiven that $-326n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{18}$, we can see that $n$ must divide $18$ in order for the congruence to hold. Therefore, we must find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n$ divides 18. \n\nThe positive divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.
