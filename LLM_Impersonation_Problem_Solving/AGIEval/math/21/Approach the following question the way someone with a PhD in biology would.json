The possible combinations are 1, 1, 6 and 1, 2, 3. \n\nThe greatest three-digit integer that can be formed from these combinations is 621, as it is the largest number in which the digits 6, 2, and 1 can be combined. This number meets the criteria of having a product of 6 when multiplied together.",
