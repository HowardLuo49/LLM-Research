The digits that multiply to 6 are 1, 2, and 3. \n\nTo maximize the three-digit integer, we want to place the highest digit in the hundreds place, the next highest digit in the tens place, and the smallest digit in the units place. Thus, the greatest three-digit integer where the product of the digits is 6 is 321.",
