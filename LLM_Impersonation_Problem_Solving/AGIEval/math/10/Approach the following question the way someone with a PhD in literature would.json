    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem as someone with a PhD in literature would, we can begin by analyzing the system of equations as a narrative or a story that unfolds. The first equation can be interpreted as a relationship between two characters, $x$ and $y$, where their combined actions, represented by $3ax$ and $3y$, lead to a result, represented by $5b$. The second equation can be seen as a separate relationship between the same characters, $x$ and $y$, where their combined actions, represented by $2x$ and $y$, lead to a different result, represented by $5$.\n\nIn order for there to be infinite solutions $(x,y)$ to this system, the two relationships represented by the equations must intersect in such a way that there are multiple possible outcomes for the characters $x$ and $y. This can be achieved when the two equations are actually representing the same relationship, just expressed in different ways. \n\nBy examining the equations closely, we can see that the first equation can be rewritten as $3(2a)x + 3y = 5b$, which can be simplified to $6ax + 3y = 5b$. Comparing this equation to the second equation $2x + y = 5$, we see that they both have the same form of $ax + y = b$. Therefore, for infinite solutions to exist, we must have $a = 2$ and $b = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ for which there are infinite solutions $(x,y)$ to the system is $(2,5)$.",
