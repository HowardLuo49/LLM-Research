    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the minimum value of the expression $a^2+6a-7$, we first need to identify the critical points of the function. This involves finding the value of $a$ that makes the derivative equal to 0. \n\nTaking the derivative of $a^2+6a-7$ with respect to $a$ gives us $2a+6$. Setting this equal to 0 and solving for $a$ yields $a=-3$. \n\nNext, we must determine whether this critical point corresponds to a minimum value or maximum value. We can do this by evaluating the second derivative. The second derivative of $a^2+6a-7$ is 2, which is positive. This means that the function is concave up at $a=-3$, indicating that it is a minimum point.\n\nSubstituting $a=-3$ back into the original expression, we get $(-3)^2+6(-3)-7 = 9-18-7 = -16$. Therefore, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is -16.",
