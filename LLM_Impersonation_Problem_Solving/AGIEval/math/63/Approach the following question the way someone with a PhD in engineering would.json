Let's denote the point in the $yz$-plane as $(0,-2,-5)$ as point $A$, and the point in the $xz$-plane as $(3,0,-1)$ as point $B$. \n\nThe direction vector of the line, $AB$, can be found by subtracting the coordinates of $A$ from the coordinates of $B$. So the direction vector, $\\mathbf{d}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{d} = \\langle 3-0, 0-(-2), -1-(-5) \\rangle = \\langle 3, 2, 4 \\rangle. \n$$\n\nNow, we can parametrize the line with a point $P(x,y,z)$ that is a distance $t$ along the direction vector from point $A$. So, we can express $P$ as:\n$$\nP = \\langle 0, -2, -5 \\rangle + t \\langle 3, 2, 4 \\rangle.\n$$\n\nThe $z$-coordinate of the point $P$ at a distance $t$ is given by:\n$$\nz = -5 + 4t.\n$$\n\nWe want to find the point where the line intersects the $xy$-plane, so we need to find the value of $t$ for which $P$ lies on the $xy$-plane, i.e., $z = 0$. Solving $-5 + 4t = 0$, we find $t = \\frac{5}{4}$. \n\nSubstitute $t = \\frac{5}{4}$ back into the parametric equation for $P$, we get:\n$$\nP\\left(\\frac{15}{4}, -2 + 2\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right), 0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{15}{4}, 1, 0\\right).\n$$\n\nTherefore, the point where the line intersects the $xy$-plane is $\\left(\\frac{15}{4}, 1, 0\\right)$.",
