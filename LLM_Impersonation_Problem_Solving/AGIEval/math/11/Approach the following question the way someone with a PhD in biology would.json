Since trapezoid $BCDE$ is part of a regular octagon, the height will be equal to the length of the altitude of the octagon.\n\nTo find the altitude of the regular octagon $ABCDEFGH$, we can divide it into 8 congruent triangles by drawing lines from the center of the octagon to each vertex. The altitude of each of these triangles is the radius of the circumcircle of the octagon.\n\nThe side of the octagon is given as 12cm, so the radius of the circumcircle is given by $r = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2(1 + \\sqrt{2})}$, where $s$ is the side length of the octagon.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get $r = \\frac{12}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2(1+\\sqrt{2})} = 6 \\cdot \\sqrt{2(1+\\sqrt{2})}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of trapezoid $BCDE$ is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (12 + 12) \\times 6 \\cdot \\sqrt{2(1+\\sqrt{2})} = 72 \\cdot \\sqrt{2(1+\\sqrt{2})}$ square centimeters.",
