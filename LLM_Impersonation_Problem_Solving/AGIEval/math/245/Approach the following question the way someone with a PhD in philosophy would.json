At a competition with $N$ players, the number of players given elite status is equal to $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$. Suppose that $19$ players are given elite status. What is the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$?",
    "solution": "154",
    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question, we must first analyze the given expression for the number of elite players in terms of $N$. The expression $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$ can be simplified by noting that $\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor$ represents the largest power of $2$ that is less than or equal to $N-1$.\n\nTherefore, when $N$ is a power of $2$, the expression simplifies to $2^{1+(\\log_{2} (N-1))}-N = 2N-2-N = N-2$. This means that the number of elite players is $N-2$ when $N$ is a power of $2$.\n\nNext, we consider the case when $N$ is not a power of $2$. In this situation, the expression simplifies to $2^{1+(\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor)}-N$. Since $\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor$ represents the largest power of $2$ less than $N-1$, we have that $2^{1+(\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor)}$ is the smallest power of $2$ greater than $N-1$. This means that $N$ is between two consecutive powers of $2$, and the number of elite players depends on the gap between $N$ and the next power of $2$.\n\nGiven that $19$ players are elite, we want to find the two smallest possible values of $N$ that satisfy the given expression. We know that $19 = N-2$ when $N$ is a power of $2$. The two smallest powers of $2$ that satisfy this condition are $N=21$ and $N=19$, which yield $19$ elite players. \n\nWhen $N$ is not a power of $2$, the number of elite players is different due to the gap between $N$ and the next power of $2$. To find the next smallest value of $N$, we consider the gap between $N$ and the next power of $2$. The next power of $2$ after $19$ is $32$. Since $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (32-1) \\rfloor}-32 = 2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (31) \\rfloor}-32 = 2^{1+4}-32 = 32-32 = 0$, $N=31$ will yield $19$ elite players as well. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$ is $21+19+31 = 71$.",
