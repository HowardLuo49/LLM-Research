At a competition with $N$ players, the number of players given elite status is equal to $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$. Suppose that $19$ players are given elite status. What is the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first analyze the given expression for the number of players given elite status:\n\n$2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N = 19$\n\nNext, we need to solve this equation for possible values of $N$. We start by rearranging the equation:\n\n$2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor} = 19 + N$\n\nSince the left side of the equation is a power of 2, $19 + N$ must also be a power of 2. We can determine the possible values of $N$ by checking the powers of 2 starting from $2^1$:\n\n$N = 2^1 - 19 = -17$\n\nThis value of $N$ is not valid since $N$ must be a positive integer. We continue to check the powers of 2:\n\n$N = 2^2 - 19 = -15$\n\n$N = 2^3 - 19 = -11$\n\n$N = 2^4 - 19 = -3$\n\n$N = 2^5 - 19 = 13$\n\n$N = 2^6 - 19 = 45$\n\n$N = 2^7 - 19 = 109$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $N$ which result in $19$ players being given elite status are $13$ and $45$.
