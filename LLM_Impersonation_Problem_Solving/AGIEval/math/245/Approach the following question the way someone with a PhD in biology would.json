At a competition with $N$ players, the number of players given elite status is equal to $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$. Suppose that $19$ players are given elite status. What is the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$?",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. We know that the number of players given elite status is $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$, and this quantity is equal to 19 in this case. Therefore, we have:\n\n$2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N = 19$\n\nTo find the two smallest possible values of $N$, we can start by simplifying this equation. First, we can rewrite $\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor$ as $k$ where $k$ is an integer such that $k \\leq \\log_{2} (N-1) < k+1$. This implies $2^{k} \\leq N-1 < 2^{k+1}$. \n\nSubstitute this back into the equation, we get:\n\n$2^{1+k}-N = 19$\n\n$2^{k+1}-N = 19$\n\n$N = 2^{k+1}-19$\n\nOur goal is to find the two smallest possible values of $N$, so we want to minimize $N$. The smallest possible value of $k$ is 4, because $2^{4} \\leq N-1 < 2^{5}$ and $N$ must be an integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $2^{4+1}-19 = 32-19 = 13$.\n\nThe second smallest value of $k$ that satisfies $2^{k} \\leq N-1 < 2^{k+1}$ is 5. Therefore, the second smallest possible value of $N$ is $2^{5+1}-19 = 64-19 = 45$.\n\nThe sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$ is $13 + 45 = 58$. \n\nThus, a person with a PhD in biology would approach this question by understanding the mathematics behind the given formula and solving the problem methodically to arrive at the correct answer.",
