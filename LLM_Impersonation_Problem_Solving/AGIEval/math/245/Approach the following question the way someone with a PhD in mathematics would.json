At a competition with $N$ players, the number of players given elite status is equal to $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N$. Suppose that $19$ players are given elite status. What is the sum of the two smallest possible values of $N$?",
    "solution": "154",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we start by setting the given expression for the number of players given elite status equal to $19$:\n\n$2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N = 19$\n\nNext, we can simplify the expression by noting that $\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\log_{2}(N-1)$. This means that $\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor$ is the exponent to which $2$ must be raised to obtain a number just smaller than $(N-1)$. In other words, $2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}$ is the smallest power of $2$ that is greater than $N-1$.\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n$2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor} > N-1$\n\nFrom this inequality, we can deduce that $N-1$ must lie between two consecutive powers of $2$, implying that $N-1$ is of the form $2^{k} < N-1 < 2^{k+1}$. It follows that $N$ lies between $2^{k}+1$ and $2^{k+1}+1$.\n\nSince $19$ players are given elite status, we can substitute that into the original equation to obtain:\n\n$2^{1+\\lfloor \\log_{2} (N-1) \\rfloor}-N = 19$\n\nSubstituting the range of possible values for $N$:\n\n$2^{1+k}-N = 19$\n\nExpressing $N$ in terms of $k$:\n\n$N = 2^{1+k}-19$\n\nGiven that $N$ lies between $2^{k}+1$ and $2^{k+1}+1$, the smallest possible values for $N$ correspond to the smallest value of $k$. Therefore, we must find the smallest value of $k$ such that $2^{1+k}-19$ is greater than $2^{k}$. By trial and error, we find that $k=4$ satisfies this condition. This implies that $N = 21$.\n\nThe next smallest value for $N$ corresponds to the smallest value of $k$ such that $2^{1+k}-19$ is greater than $2^{k+1}$. Again, by trial and error, we find that $k=5$ satisfies this condition. This implies that $N = 45$.\n\nHence, the sum of the two smallest possible values for $N$ is $21+45 = 66$.",
