    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of the other endpoint. \n\nLet the coordinates of the other endpoint be $(x, y)$. Since the midpoint of the line segment is $(1,2)$, we can use the formula for the midpoint to find the coordinates of the other endpoint. The formula for the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:\n\n$$(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$$\n\nIn this case, we have the midpoint at $(1,2)$ and one endpoint at $(3,9)$. This means we can substitute $x_1=3$, $y_1=9$, $x_2=x$, $y_2=y$ into the formula and solve for $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$(\\frac{3+x}{2}, \\frac{9+y}{2}) = (1,2)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$3+x=2 \\implies x=-1$$\n$$9+y=4 \\implies y=-5$$\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the other endpoint are $(-1,-5)$.
