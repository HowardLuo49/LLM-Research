Euclidean space is characterized by its adherence to Euclid's axioms, particularly the parallel postulate.

A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In our case, $CM$ is a median of $\\triangle ABC$ since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$.\n\nIt is well known in Euclidean geometry that the length of a median from a vertex $C$ to the midpoint $M$ of the opposite side $AB$ in a triangle equals half the length of the third side $AB.$ Therefore, in our scenario, $CM = \\frac{AB}{2} = 4.$\n\nIn conclusion, the length of $CM$ in triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with side lengths $AC = 17,$ $BC = 15,$ and $AB = 8$ is $\\boxed{4}.$",
