    "gpt_response": "To find the length of $CM$, we can first find the coordinates of points $A$, $B$, and $C$ in the Cartesian plane. Let the origin be point $C$, so the coordinates of $C$ are $(0,0)$. Since $AC=17$ and $BC=15$, the coordinates of $A$ are $(0,17)$ and $B$ are $(15,0)$.\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the midpoint $M$ of $AB$ using the midpoint formula. Let $M$ have coordinates $(x,y)$. Then, we have\n\\[x = \\frac{0+15}{2} = 7.5,\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{17+0}{2} = 8.5.\\]\nSo, the coordinates of $M$ are $(7.5,8.5)$.\nUsing the distance formula, we can find the length of $CM$:\n\\[CM = \\sqrt{(7.5-0)^2 + (8.5-0)^2} = \\sqrt{7.5^2 + 8.5^2} = \\sqrt{56.25 + 72.25} = \\sqrt{128.5}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the length of $CM$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{128.5}}$.",
