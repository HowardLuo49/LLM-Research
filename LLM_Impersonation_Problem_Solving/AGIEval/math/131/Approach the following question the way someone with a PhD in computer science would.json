Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \\(w\\) and the length as \\(2w\\).\n\nWe know that the diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the length and width of the rectangle. Therefore, we can create the following equation using the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\n\\(w^2 + (2w)^2 = (5\\sqrt{5})^2\\)\n\nSolving for \\(w\\), we get:\n\n\\(w^2 + 4w^2 = 25 \\times 5\\)\n\n\\(5w^2 = 125\\)\n\n\\(w^2 = 25\\)\n\n\\(w = 5\\)\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is 5 units, and the length is \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\) units.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the formula: \\(Area = \\text{width} \\times \\text{length}\\)\n\nSubstitute the values found for the width and length:\n\n\\(Area = 5 \\times 10 = 50\\) unit^2\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 50 square units.",
