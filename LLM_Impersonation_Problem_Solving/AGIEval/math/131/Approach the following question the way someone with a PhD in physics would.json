    "gpt_response": "To find the area of the rectangle, we first need to express the length and width in terms of each other using the given information. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as $w$ and the length as $2w$, since the length is twice the width.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the length, width, and diagonal of the rectangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (diagonal) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nIn this case, the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse, so we have:\n$(2w)^2 + w^2 = (5\\sqrt{5})^2$\n$4w^2 + w^2 = 25*5$\n$5w^2 = 125$\n$w^2 = 25$\n$w = 5$\n\nSo, the width of the rectangle is 5 units and the length is twice the width, which is 10 units.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is:\nArea = length * width\nArea = 10 * 5\nArea = 50 square units\n\nThus, the area of the rectangle is 50 square units.",
