    "solution": "50",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can start by applying the Pythagorean theorem to the rectangle. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as $w$ and the length as $2w$. Since the diagonal of the rectangle forms a right triangle with the sides being the length, width, and diagonal, we can write the following equation:\n\n$(2w)^2 + w^2 = (5\\sqrt{5})^2$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$4w^2 + w^2 = 25 \\times 5$\n\n$5w^2 = 125$\n\n$w^2 = 25$\n\n$w = 5$\n\nNow that we have determined the width of the rectangle, we can find the length by multiplying the width by 2:\n\n$2w = 2 \\times 5 = 10$\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is 5 units and the length is 10 units. The area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width:\n\nArea = Length x Width\nArea = 10 x 5\nArea = 50\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 50 square units.",
