Let the width of the rectangle be \\(w\\) and the length be \\(2w\\).\n\nWe know that the diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the length and width of the rectangle. Therefore, we can write the Pythagorean theorem as:\n\n\\(w^2 + (2w)^2 = (5\\sqrt{5})^2\\)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\(w^2 + 4w^2 = 25*5\\)\n\n\\(5w^2 = 125\\)\n\n\\(w^2 = 25\\)\n\n\\(w = 5\\)\n\nThus, the width of the rectangle is 5 and the length is \\(2*5 = 10\\).\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by \\(A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width}\\) which in this case is \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 50 square units.",
