    "gpt_response": "Let the width of the rectangle be denoted by $w$, and the length be denoted by $2w$ since it is twice the width. \n\nWe can now use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the length, width, and diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of the rectangle forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the length and width as the other two sides. \n\nAccording to the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of the diagonal ($5\\sqrt{5}$) can be related to the length and width of the rectangle as follows:\n\n$(2w)^2 + w^2 = (5\\sqrt{5})^2$\n\nSolving the equation gives:\n\n$4w^2 + w^2 = 125 \\rightarrow 5w^2 = 125 \\rightarrow w^2 = 25 \\rightarrow w = 5$\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is 5 units, and the length is $2w = 2(5) = 10$ units. \n\nThe area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying the width and length:\n\n$Area = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 10 \\times 5 = 50$ square units\n\nHence, the area of the rectangle is 50 square units.",
