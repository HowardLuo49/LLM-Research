    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we first need to identify the odd integers within this range. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. \n\nMultiplying these odd integers together, we get: 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395\n\nTo find the units digit of this product, we can simply focus on the units digits of each number being multiplied. Starting from the rightmost digit of each number, we multiply the units digits: \n1 * 3 = 3\n3 * 5 = 5\n5 * 7 = 5\n7 * 9 = 3\n9 * 1 = 9\nMultiplying these units digits together: 3 * 5 * 5 * 3 * 9 = 2025 \n\nTherefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.",
