The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest 100th.",
    "solution": "0.25\\,\\text{ cm}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the change in water level when the rock is submerged in the aquarium, we first need to calculate the total volume of water in the aquarium before the rock is added. \n\nThe volume of the aquarium is given by the formula Volume = length x width x height. \nSo, the volume of water in the aquarium before the rock is added is 100 cm x 40 cm x 37 cm = 148,000 $cm^3$.\n\nAfter the rock is added, the total volume of water in the aquarium will be the volume of the water plus the volume of the rock. \nThe volume of the rock is given as 1000 $cm^3$. \nTherefore, the total volume of water and the rock in the aquarium is 148,000 $cm^3$ + 1000 $cm^3$ = 149,000 $cm^3$.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the new water level. \nLet the new water level after adding the rock be x cm.\nThe volume of water with the new water level is given by the formula Volume = length x width x depth. \nTherefore, 100 cm x 40 cm x x cm = 149,000 $cm^3$.\n\nSolving for x, we have\n4000x = 149,000\nx = 149,000 / 4000\nx \u2248 37.25 cm\n\nTherefore, the water level rises by approximately 0.25 cm when the rock is submerged in the aquarium.",
