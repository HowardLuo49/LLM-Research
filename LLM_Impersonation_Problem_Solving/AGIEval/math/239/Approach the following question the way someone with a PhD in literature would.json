The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest 100th.",
    "solution": "0.25\\,\\text{ cm}",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine by how many centimeters the water level rises when the rock is submerged in the aquarium, we must first calculate the initial volume of water in the aquarium. The initial volume can be found by multiplying the area of the base (100 cm * 40 cm) by the initial depth of water (37 cm):\n\nInitial volume = 100 cm * 40 cm * 37 cm = 148000 cm^3.\n\nNext, we must calculate the final volume of water in the aquarium after the rock is submerged. This can be found by adding the volume of the rock (1000 cm^3) to the initial volume of water:\n\nFinal volume = 148000 cm^3 + 1000 cm^3 = 149000 cm^3.\n\nWith this information, we can determine the final depth of water in the aquarium, given that the base area remains constant:\n\nFinal depth = Final volume / (100 cm * 40 cm) = 149000 cm^3 / 4000 cm^2 = 37.25 cm.\n\nTherefore, the water level rises by 0.25 cm when the rock is submerged in the aquarium.",
