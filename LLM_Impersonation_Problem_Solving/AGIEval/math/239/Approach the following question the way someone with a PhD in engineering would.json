The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest 100th.",
    "solution": "0.25\\,\\text{ cm}",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the principle of fluid displacement. When the rock is placed in the aquarium, it displaces a volume of water equal to its own volume. Therefore, the amount by which the water level rises will be equal to the volume of the rock divided by the surface area of the base of the aquarium.\n\nThe volume of the rock is given as $1000 \\text{cm}^3$. The surface area of the base of the aquarium is $100 \\text{cm} \\times 40 \\text{cm} = 4000 \\text{cm}^2$.\n\nTherefore, the amount by which the water level rises is calculated as:\n\n$\\text{Rise in water level} = \\dfrac{1000 \\text{cm}^3}{4000 \\text{cm}^2} = 0.25 \\text{ cm}$\n\nSo, the water level rises by 0.25 cm when the rock is placed in the aquarium.",
