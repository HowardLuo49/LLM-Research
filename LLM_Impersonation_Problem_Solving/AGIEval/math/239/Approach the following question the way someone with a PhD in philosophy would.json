The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest 100th.",
    "solution": "0.25\\,\\text{ cm}",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first consider the principle of displacement, as formulated by Archimedes. This principle states that the volume of water displaced by a submerged object is equal to the volume of the object itself.\n\nGiven that the rock has a volume of $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ and is completely submerged in the water, it displaces $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ of water within the aquarium. This displacement causes the water level to rise.\n\nTo determine the amount by which the water level rises, we must calculate the increase in volume resulting from the introduction of the rock. The increase in volume can be found by dividing the volume of the rock by the area of the base of the aquarium:\n\n$\\text{Increase in Volume} = \\frac{1000 \\text{cm}^3}{100 \\text{cm} \\times 40 \\text{cm}} = 0.25 \\text{cm}$\n\nTherefore, the water level in the aquarium rises by 0.25 cm.",
