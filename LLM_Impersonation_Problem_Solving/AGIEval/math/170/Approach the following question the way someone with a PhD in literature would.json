    "solution": "(0,0)",
    "gpt_response": "An odd function is symmetric about the origin, meaning that $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain. Since $(-3,5)$ is on the graph, we have that $f(-3) = 5$. From the definition of an odd function, we know that $f(3) = -f(-3) = -5$. Therefore, the graph of $f(x)$ must also pass through the point $(3,-5)$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{(3,-5)}$.",
