    "gpt_response": "As an odd function, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. Therefore, if $(a,b)$ is a point on the graph of $y = f(x)$, then $(-a,-b)$ must also be on the graph.\n\nGiven that $(-3,5)$ is on the graph, we know that $(3,-5)$ must also be on the graph. Thus, the graph of $y = f(x)$ must pass through the point $(3,-5)$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{(3,-5)}$.",
