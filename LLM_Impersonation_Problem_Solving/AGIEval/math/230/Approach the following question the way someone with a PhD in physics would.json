    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2000+2001+2002+2003+2004+2005+2006$ is divided by $7$, we can simplify the sum by noticing that the terms $2000$, $2001$, $2002$, $2003$, $2004$, $2005$, and $2006$ can be rewritten as $7$ multiplied by a consecutive list of integers, starting from $285$ up to $292$.\n\nTherefore, the sum $2000+2001+2002+2003+2004+2005+2006$ simplifies to $7(285+286+287+288+289+290+291+292)$.\n\nEach term in the parentheses can be written as $\\frac{285+292}{2} = 288.5$. Since there are $8$ terms in total, the simplified sum becomes $8(288.5)(7) = 8(2019.5) = 16156$.\n\nWhen dividing $16156$ by $7$, we have a quotient of $2308$ and a remainder of $0$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2000+2001+2002+2003+2004+2005+2006$ is divided by $7$ is $0$.",
