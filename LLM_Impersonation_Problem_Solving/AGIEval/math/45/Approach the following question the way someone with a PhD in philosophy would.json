    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first examine the relationship between the two triangles presented in the diagram. The two triangles are similar due to the given information that they have parallel bases. This similarity implies that the ratio of corresponding sides is constant and that the ratio of their areas is the square of this constant ratio. \n\nLet us denote the ratio of the two triangles as k. Given that the smaller triangle has a base of 4 cm and the larger triangle has a base of 10 cm, the ratio of their bases is 4/10 = 2/5. Therefore, this ratio k must also be 2/5. \n\nThe ratio of the areas of the two triangles is thus (2/5)^2 = 4/25. Therefore, the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is 4/25. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question, when approached from a philosophical perspective with a focus on meticulous reasoning and logical deduction, is that the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is 4/25.",
