    "gpt_response": "To find the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is directly proportional to the square of its base length. Since the triangles have parallel bases, the ratio of the areas will be equal to the ratio of the squares of the corresponding base lengths.\n\nLet's denote the base of the smaller triangle as b1 and the base of the larger triangle as b2. In this case, b1 = 4 cm and b2 = 10 cm. \n\nThe ratio of the areas is equal to:\n(Area of smaller triangle) / (Area of larger triangle) = (0.5 * b1 * h1) / (0.5 * b2 * h2) = (b1 * h1) / (b2 * h2)\n\nSince the heights of the triangles are equal, we can ignore them in our calculation. Thus, the ratio of the areas is:\n(b1^2) / (b2^2) = (4^2) / (10^2) = 16 / 100 = 4 / 25\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is 4/25.",
