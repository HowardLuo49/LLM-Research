    "gpt_response": "To calculate the ratio of the areas of the two triangles, we first calculate the area of each triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is given by 1/2 * base * height.\n\nLet the smaller triangle have base B and height H, and the larger triangle have base b and height h.\n\nGiven that the bases are parallel, we have B = 4 cm and b = 10 cm.\n\nUsing similar triangles, we know that the ratio of the heights H:h is the same as the ratio of the bases B:b. Therefore, H/h = B/b = 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nSince the area of a triangle is proportional to the product of its base and height, the ratio of the areas of the smaller triangle to the larger triangle is (B*H) / (b*h) = (4*2) / (10*5) = 8 / 50 = 4 / 25.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is 4/25.",
