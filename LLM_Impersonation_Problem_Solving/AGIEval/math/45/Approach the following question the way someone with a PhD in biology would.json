    "gpt_response": "To determine the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle, we need to consider the relationship between the bases and heights of the two triangles. \n\nLet the smaller triangle be Triangle A with base 4 cm and height h (in same units), and let the larger triangle be Triangle B with base 10 cm and height 3h.

Let us reevaluate the original conditions. \n\nGiven the parallel bases, we can determine the ratio of the heights of the two triangles. Let h\u2081 and h\u2082 denote the heights of the smaller and larger triangles, respectively. So, h\u2081/h\u2082 = 4/10 = 2/5.\n\nThe ratio of the areas of the two triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their heights.
