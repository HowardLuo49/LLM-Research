Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers \"wrap around\" upon reaching a certain value called the modulus.\n\nIn this case, our modulus is 6. This means that for any integer n, the remainder of n (mod 6) can be found by dividing n by 6 and taking the remainder.\n\nTo find the remainder of 1529 (mod 6), we first divide 1529 by 6.
