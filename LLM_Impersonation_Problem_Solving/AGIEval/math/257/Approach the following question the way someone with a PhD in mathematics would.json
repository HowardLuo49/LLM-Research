    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. I am going to buy exotic fruits.  Dragonfruit costs $x-4$ dollars.  Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",

    "gpt_response": "Let's define the variables first. Let $D$ be the cost of one dragonfruit, $S$ be the cost of one starfruit, and $R$ be the cost of one rambutan.\n\nFrom the given information:\n1. $D = x - 4$\n2. $S = R - 5$\n3. $R = D + 2x$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the third equation:\n$R = (x - 4) + 2x$\n$R = 3x - 4$\n\nSubstitute $R = 3x - 4$ into the second equation:\n$S = (3x - 4) - 5$\n$S = 3x - 9$\n\nNow we know the cost of each fruit. To find the cost of buying one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit:\n$1R + 2S + 3D = 1(3x - 4) + 2(3x - 9) + 3(x - 4)$\n$= 3x - 4 + 6x - 18 + 3x - 12$\n$= 12x - 34$\n\nTherefore, the expression that depends on $x$ for the total cost of buying one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit is $12x - 34$.",
