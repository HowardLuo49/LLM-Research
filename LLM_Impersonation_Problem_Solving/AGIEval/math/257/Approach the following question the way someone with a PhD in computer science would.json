Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",

We are given the following relationships:\n\n1. $d = x - 4$\n2. $s = r - 5$\n3. $r = 2x$\n\nWe need to find the total cost for one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit. Let's express this in terms of $d$, $s$, and $r$:\n\nTotal cost = $3d + 2s + r$\n\nNow we can substitute the values of $d$, $s$, and $r$ from our equations:\n\nTotal cost = $3(x-4) + 2(r-5) + 2x$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nTotal cost = $3x - 12 + 2(2x - 5) + 2x$\n\nTotal cost = $3x - 12 + 4x - 10 + 2x$\n\nTotal cost = $9x - 22$\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit is $9x - 22$.",
