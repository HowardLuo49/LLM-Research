Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem as someone with a PhD in literature, we must first understand the relationships and constraints given in the question. We can interpret these price relationships as symbols of power dynamics within the exotic fruit market, with each fruit symbolizing a different facet of society or literature.\n\nLet's assign variables to the prices of each fruit: Let the cost of dragonfruit be $d=x-4$ dollars, the cost of starfruit be $s$, and the cost of rambutan be $r=2x$ dollars. Given that starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan, we can express this relationship as $s=r-5$. Additionally, we understand that rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit, which gives us the equation $r=d+2x$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $d$ and $r$ into the equation $s=r-5$ to find the cost of starfruit in terms of $x$. Substituting gives $s=(x-4)+2x-5$. Simplifying this expression, we find $s=3x-9$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to determine the total cost of one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit. By adding up the costs of each fruit and expressing them in terms of $x$, we get the total cost expression as follows:\n\n$R=(2x)+(2*3x-9)+(3*(x-4))=2x+6x-18+3x-12=11x-30$.\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit in terms of $x$ is $11x-30.",
