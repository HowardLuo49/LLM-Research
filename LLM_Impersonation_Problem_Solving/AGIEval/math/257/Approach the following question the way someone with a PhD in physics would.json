Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",

Let's denote the cost of dragonfruit as $d$, starfruit as $s$, and rambutan as $r$.\n\nWe are given that:\n1. The cost of dragonfruit is $x-4$: $d = x - 4$\n2. Starfruit costs five dollars less than rambutan: $s = r - 5$\n3. Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit: $r = d + 2x$\n\nNow we need to express the total cost of buying one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit in terms of $x$. The total cost can be calculated as:\nTotal cost = $1 \\times r + 2 \\times s + 3 \\times d$\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $d$, $s$, and $r$ into the total cost equation:\nTotal cost = $1 \\times (x-4) + 2 \\times (r-5) + 3 \\times d$\nTotal cost = $x - 4 + 2 \\times (d + 2x - 5) + 3 \\times d$\n\nNow simplify the expression:\nTotal cost = $x - 4 + 2d + 4x - 10 + 3d$\nTotal cost = $4x + 3d - 14$\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $d$ back into the equation:\nTotal cost = $4x + 3(x-4) - 14$\nTotal cost = $4x + 3x - 12 - 14$\n\nSimplify further to get the final expression for the total cost of buying one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit:\nTotal cost = $7x - 26$",
