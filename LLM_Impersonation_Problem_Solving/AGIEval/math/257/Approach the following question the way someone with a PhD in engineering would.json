    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. I am going to buy exotic fruits.  Dragonfruit costs $x-4$ dollars.  Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",
    "solution": "-34 + 12x",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to set up a system of equations based on the given information.\n\nLet D represent the cost of one dragonfruit, S represent the cost of one starfruit, and R represent the cost of one rambutan.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can create the following equations:\n\n1. D = x - 4\n2. S = R - 5\n3. R = D + 2x\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of D, S, and R in terms of x.\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 3:\nR = (x - 4) + 2x\nR = 3x - 4\n\nSubstitute equation 1 into equation 2:\nS = (x - 4) + 2x - 5\nS = 3x - 9\n\nNow, we have expressions for the cost of one dragonfruit, one starfruit, and one rambutan in terms of x. To find the total cost of purchasing one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit, we multiply the respective costs by the quantities specified:\n\nTotal cost = 1(R) + 2(S) + 3(D)\nTotal cost = 1(3x - 4) + 2(3x - 9) + 3(x - 4)\nTotal cost = 3x - 4 + 6x - 18 + 3x - 12\nTotal cost = 12x - 34\n\nTherefore, the expression for the total cost of purchasing one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit is $12x - 34.",
