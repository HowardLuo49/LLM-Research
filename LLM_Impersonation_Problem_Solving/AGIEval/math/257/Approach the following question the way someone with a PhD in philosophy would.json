    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. I am going to buy exotic fruits.  Dragonfruit costs $x-4$ dollars.  Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",
