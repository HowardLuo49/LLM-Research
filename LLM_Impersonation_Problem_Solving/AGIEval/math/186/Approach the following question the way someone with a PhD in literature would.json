    "gpt_response": "To compute $(3^{-1}+5^{-1})^{-1} \\pmod{31}$, we first need to find the inverses of $3$ and $5$ in modulo $31$. \n\nThe inverse of $a \\pmod{m}$ is the integer $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. Therefore, to find the inverse of $3$ in modulo $31$, we need to find $b$ such that $3b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$. From inspection, we can see that $21$ is the inverse of $3$ modulo $31$ since $3 \\cdot 21 \\equiv 63 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nSimilarly, to find the inverse of $5$ in modulo $31$, we need to find $c$ such that $5c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$. Again from inspection, we can see that $25$ is the inverse of $5$ modulo $31$ since $5 \\cdot 25 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nTherefore, we have\n$$(3^{-1}+5^{-1})^{-1} = (21 + 25)^{-1} = 46^{-1}.$$\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of $46$ in modulo $31$. From inspection, we find that $23$ is the inverse of $46$ modulo $31$ since $46 \\cdot 23 \\equiv 1058 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nTherefore, $(3^{-1}+5^{-1})^{-1} \\equiv 23 \\pmod{31}$. \n\nAs an integer from $0$ to $30$ inclusive, the answer is $\\boxed{23}$.",
