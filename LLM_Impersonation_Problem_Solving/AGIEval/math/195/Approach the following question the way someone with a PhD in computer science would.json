    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of Fridays in the year 2007, we must first determine the number of days in the year. In a non-leap year like 2007, there are 365 days. \n\nSince January 1, 2007 was a Monday, we can infer that January 5, 2007 (4 days later) was a Friday. Therefore, there is a pattern of every 7 days corresponding to the same day of the week, i.e., Monday to Monday, Tuesday to Tuesday, and so on.\n\nGiven that there are 365 days in 2007, we can divide this by 7 to determine the number of complete weeks, which is 52.1 weeks. This means that there are 52 full cycles of weekdays in 2007, resulting in 52 Fridays.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the remaining days that do not form a complete week. As the year started on a Monday, we can count the days in 2007 and see that December 31, 2007 was a Monday. Therefore, there are a total of 53 Fridays in the year 2007, with the last one occurring on December 28th.",
