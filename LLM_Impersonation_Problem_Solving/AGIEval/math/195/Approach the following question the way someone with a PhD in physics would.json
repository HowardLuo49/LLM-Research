The Gregorian calendar operates on a 400-year cycle, with each year containing 52 weeks and 1 or 2 additional days. \n\nIn a non-leap year like 2007, there are 365 days, which is equivalent to 52 weeks and 1 day. This means that each day of the week will occur 52 times in a non-leap year, with the remaining day occurring an additional time. Since January 1, 2007 was a Monday, the day that occurs 52 times in 2007 will also be a Monday.\n\nTherefore, Friday, being four days away from Monday, will occur 52 times in the year 2007 as well. So, there are a total of 52 Fridays in the year 2007.",
