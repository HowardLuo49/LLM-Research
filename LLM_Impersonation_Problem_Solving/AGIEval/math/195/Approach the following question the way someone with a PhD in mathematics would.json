    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of Fridays in 2007, we can break down the problem into several steps. \n\nFirst, we note that there are 365 days in a non-leap year. Since January 1, 2007 was a Monday, we can count the number of days between each Monday and each Friday in a 7-day cycle. \n\nThe days of the week in a 7-day cycle are as follows:\nMonday -> Tuesday -> Wednesday -> Thursday -> Friday -> Saturday -> Sunday\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the day of the week advances by one day each day. Therefore, the days between a Monday and a Friday can be counted as 3 (Tuesday), 2 (Wednesday), 1 (Thursday), and 0 (Friday). \n\nIf we look at the entire year 2007, we can see that there are 52 complete 7-day cycles in a non-leap year. This means that each day of the week will occur 52 times in total throughout the year. \n\nGiven that January 1, 2007 was a Monday, we can determine that there will be 52 Fridays in 2007. \n\nThus, in 2007, there are a total of 52 Fridays.",
