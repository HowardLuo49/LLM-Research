    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. January 1, 2007 was a Monday. In 2007, how many Fridays are there?",
    "solution": "52",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, one must first consider the nature of time and its relationship to the days of the week. Time is a construct that structures our experience of reality, serving as a tool for organizing events and activities. Specifically focusing on the days of the week, we understand that they follow a cyclical pattern that repeats every seven days.\n\nGiven that January 1, 2007 was a Monday, we can utilize this information to determine the day of the week for each subsequent day in 2007. By recognizing that there are 365 days in a non-leap year, we can calculate that there are 52 full weeks and one additional day. This means that January 1, 2008 would fall on a Tuesday.\n\nThrough a systematic analysis of the days of the week in 2007, we can conclude that there are a total of 52 Fridays in the year. This understanding is derived from the consistent seven-day cycle that governs our calendar system, allowing us to predict the occurrence of specific weekdays based on an initial reference point.\n\nIn essence, the question of how many Fridays are in 2007 serves as an opportunity to explore the interplay between time, repetition, and the structure of our temporal reality. By engaging in a methodical and logical analysis, we can arrive at a definitive answer grounded in the principles of philosophy and mathematics.",
