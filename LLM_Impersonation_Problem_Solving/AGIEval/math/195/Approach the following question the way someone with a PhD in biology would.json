    "gpt_response": "To determine how many Fridays there are in the year 2007, we must first establish that there are 365 days in a non-leap year. Since January 1, 2007, was a Monday, we can say that January 5, 2007, (four days later) was a Friday. \n\nWe can then determine that every 7th day after that will also be a Friday. Using this pattern, we can calculate the total number of Fridays in 2007 by dividing the total number of days (365) by 7:\n\n365 \u00f7 7 = 52 with a remainder of 1\n\nThis means that there are 52 full weeks in the year 2007, and one additional day. Therefore, there are a total of 52 Fridays in 2007.",
