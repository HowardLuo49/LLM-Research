After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 32$), then the number of books sold per month is $128-4p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?",
    "solution": "16",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the price that would maximize revenue for the bookstore, we first need to understand the relationship between price, quantity sold, and revenue. Revenue is calculated by multiplying the price of the book by the number of books sold.\n\nLet $R(p)$ represent the revenue at price $p$, then $R(p) = p(128-4p)$. We can expand this expression to get $R(p) = 128p - 4p^2$. To find the price that maximizes revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to $p$ and set it equal to zero.\n\n$\\frac{dR}{dp} = 128 - 8p = 0$\n$8p = 128$\n$p = 16$\n\nTherefore, the price that the store should charge to maximize its revenue is $16.",
