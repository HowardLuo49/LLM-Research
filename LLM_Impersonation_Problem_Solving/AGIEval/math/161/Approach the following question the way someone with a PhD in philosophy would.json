    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. A bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 32$), then the number of books sold per month is $128-4p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?",
    "solution": "16",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the price at which the store should charge for the book in order to maximize its revenue, we must first understand the relationship between price, quantity sold, and revenue. \n\nThe revenue function is given by the product of the price and the quantity sold. In this case, the revenue ($R$) can be expressed as $R = p(128-4p)$. \n\nTo find the price that maximizes revenue, we need to differentiate the revenue function with respect to price, set the derivative equal to zero, and solve for $p$. \n\nFirst, let's simplify the revenue function:\n$R = p(128-4p) = 128p - 4p^2$\n\nNow, differentiating the revenue function with respect to price $p$:\n$\\frac{dR}{dp} = 128 - 8p$\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n$128 - 8p = 0$\n\nSolving for $p$:\n$p = 16$\n\nTherefore, the store should charge $16 for the book in order to maximize its revenue.",
