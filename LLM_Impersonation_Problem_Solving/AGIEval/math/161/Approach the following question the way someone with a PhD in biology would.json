    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in biology would. A bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 32$), then the number of books sold per month is $128-4p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?",
    "solution": "16",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the price at which the store should charge for the book in order to maximize its revenue, we need to consider the relationship between price, number of books sold, and revenue.\n\nThe revenue generated by selling $x$ books at a price of $p$ dollars per book is given by the product of the price and the number of books sold: $R = p \\cdot x$. In this case, the number of books sold per month is given by $128-4p$.\n\nTherefore, the revenue function for selling books at price $p$ can be expressed as:\n\\[R(p) = p \\cdot (128-4p) = 128p - 4p^2\\]\n\nTo find the price that maximizes revenue, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function. The revenue function $R(p)$ is a quadratic function, and its critical points can be found by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero:\n\\[R'(p) = 128 - 8p\\]\nSetting $R'(p) = 0$:\n\\[128 - 8p = 0\\]\n\\[8p = 128\\]\n\\[p = 16\\]\n\nTherefore, the store should charge a price of $16 per book to maximize its revenue.",
