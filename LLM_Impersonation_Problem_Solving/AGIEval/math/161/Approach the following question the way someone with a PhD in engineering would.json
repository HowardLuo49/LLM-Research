    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. A bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 32$), then the number of books sold per month is $128-4p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?",
    "solution": "16",
    "gpt_response": "To maximize revenue, we need to find the price that will maximize the product of price and quantity sold. \n\nLet's define the revenue function $R(p)$ as the product of the price $p$ and the number of books sold per month, which is $128-4p$. \n\nTherefore, the revenue function can be represented as: \n\n$R(p) = p(128-4p)$\n\nExpanding this expression gives:\n\n$R(p) = 128p - 4p^2$\n\nTo find the price that maximizes revenue, we need to find the critical points of the revenue function. To do this, we take the derivative of $R(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it equal to zero in order to find the critical points:\n\n$R'(p) = 128 - 8p$\n\nSetting $R'(p) = 0$ gives:\n\n$128 - 8p = 0$\n\n$8p = 128$\n\n$p = 16$\n\nNow we need to verify if this critical point is a maximum by using the second derivative test. Taking the second derivative of $R(p)$ gives:\n\n$R''(p) = -8$\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the critical point at $p=16$ corresponds to a maximum.\n\nTherefore, the store should charge $16 for the book to maximize its revenue.",
