    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. A bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 32$), then the number of books sold per month is $128-4p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?",
    "solution": "16",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the price that the store should charge to maximize its revenue, we need to first calculate the revenue function. Revenue is defined as the product of the price of the book and the number of books sold per month. \n\nLet the price of the book be denoted as $p$ dollars, with $p \\le 32$ as per the given conditions. The number of books sold per month can be represented as $128-4p$. Therefore, the revenue generated by selling $p$-priced books is:\n\n$R(p) = p(128-4p) = 128p - 4p^2$\n\nTo maximize revenue, we take the derivative of this function with respect to $p$ and set it equal to zero:\n\n$R'(p) = 128 - 8p = 0$\n\nSolving for $p$, we find:\n\n$8p = 128$\n\n$p = 16$\n\nTherefore, the store should charge a price of $16 to maximize its revenue.",
