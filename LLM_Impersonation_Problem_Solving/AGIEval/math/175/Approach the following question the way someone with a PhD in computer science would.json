    "gpt_response": "To determine the first digit of a number as large as $20!$, we need to employ mathematical properties of factorials and number theory. \n\nFirst, we can decompose $20!$ into its prime factors. The prime factorization of a factorial number can be determined by considering the primes less than or equal to the factorial number itself. In this case, the prime numbers less than or equal to 20 are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}. Next, we determine the powers to which each prime number appears in the factorization of $20!$. \n\nNext, we can consider the property that a number's divisibility by 10 is dependent on the number of factors of 2 and 5 it contains. Since 5 is the only prime factor that contributes a factor of 10 to the number, we are interested in the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $20!$. \n\nThe number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $20!$ can be determined by the formula $\\lfloor \\frac{20}{5} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{20}{25} \\rfloor = 4 + 0 = 4$.
