    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in philosophy would. At a certain amusement park, there is a bulk discount for tickets. If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",
    "solution": "69",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first define the variables and analyze the situation. Let $x$ be the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time above the initial 60 tickets. Therefore, the total number of tickets bought in bulk is $60+x$. \n\nThe cost of each ticket is $\\$70 - x$ for $x$ additional tickets bought above 60 tickets. So, the total cost to the amusement park for selling $60+x$ tickets is $70 \\times 60 + (70 - x)x = 4200 + 70x - x^2$.\n\nTo find the profit, we must subtract the cost from the total revenue received from selling $60+x$ tickets. The revenue from selling $60+x$ tickets is $70(60+x)$ which simplifies to $4200 + 70x$.\n\nTherefore, the profit is $4200 + 70x - x^2 - (4200 + 70x) = -x^2$.\n\nWe want to find the largest $x$ such that the profit is greater than $\\$4200$. Therefore, we want to maximize the quadratic function $-x^2$. Since this is a concave down parabola, the maximum value occurs at the vertex. \n\nThe vertex of the parabola $f(x) = -x^2$ is at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$ where $a=-1$ and $b=0$. So, $x = 0$ is the largest $x$ value that will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$.\n\nTherefore, the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $60$.",
