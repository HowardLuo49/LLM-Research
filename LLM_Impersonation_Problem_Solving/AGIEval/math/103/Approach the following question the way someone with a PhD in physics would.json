If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",

Let $P(t)$ be the profit function, where $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time.\n\nThe cost of each ticket is \\$70 if the number of tickets bought is up to 60. Therefore, the cost function for the park is:\n\\[ C(t) = \n\\begin{cases} \n70t & \\text{for } t\\leq 60 \\\\\n70\\cdot 60 + (t-60)(70-(t-60)) & \\text{for } t>60\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThe revenue function can be represented as:\n\\[ R(t) = 70\\cdot t \\]\n\nThe profit function is given by:\n\\[ P(t) = R(t) - C(t) \\]\n\nSubstitute the values of $R(t)$ and $C(t)$ into the profit function:\n\\[ P(t) = 70t - \n\\begin{cases} \n70t & \\text{for } t\\leq 60 \\\\\n70\\cdot 60 + (t-60)(70-(t-60)) & \\text{for } t>60\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the profit function:\n\\[ P(t) = \n\\begin{cases} \n70t-70t & \\text{for } t\\leq 60 \\\\\n70t - (70\\cdot 60 + (t-60)(70-(t-60))) & \\text{for } t>60\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than \\$4200.
