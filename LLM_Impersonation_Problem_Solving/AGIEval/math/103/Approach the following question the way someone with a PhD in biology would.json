If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",
    "solution": "69",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$, we first need to determine the profit made from selling $t$ tickets.\n\nThe profit made from selling $t$ tickets is equal to the total revenue minus the total cost. Let x be the number of tickets beyond 60 that were purchased, then the total revenue is equal to $70t + 70(x) - x(x+1)/2$. \n\nThe total cost is equal to the cost of the tickets bought, which can be represented as $70t + (x(x+1)/2)$.\n\nTherefore, the profit made from selling $t$ tickets, $P(t)$, can be expressed as:\n\n$P(t) = (70t + 70(x) - x(x+1)/2) - (70t + (x(x+1)/2)) = 70x - x(x+1)/2$\n\nThe amusement park wants to make a profit greater than \\$4200, so we set up the following inequality:\n\n$P(t) = 70x - x(x+1)/2 > 4200$\n\nExpanding and rearranging this inequality, we get:\n\n$x^2 + 2(70)x - 8400 < 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality, and in order to solve for $t$ we need to find the largest integer $t$ that satisfies this inequality. \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the equation $x^2 + 2(70)x - 8400 = 0$ are approximately $x \\approx 74.37$ and $x \\approx -114.37$. \n\nSince $x$ is the number of tickets beyond 60 purchased, we cannot have a negative number of tickets purchased.
