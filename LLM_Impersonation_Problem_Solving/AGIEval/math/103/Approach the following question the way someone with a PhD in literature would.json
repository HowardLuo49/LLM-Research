If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",

    "gpt_response": "In analyzing this problem, we can set up a function to represent the revenue generated by selling tickets in bulk. Let $R(t)$ denote the revenue from selling $t$ tickets in bulk. \n\nWhen $t \\leq 60$, the price per ticket is $70$ dollars, so the revenue generated by selling $t$ tickets in this case is $70t$. \n\nWhen $t > 60$, the price per ticket is reduced by $1$ dollar for each additional ticket bought beyond 60 tickets. Therefore, the price per ticket can be represented as $70 - (t-60)$ dollars. The revenue generated by selling $t$ tickets in this case is then given by $R(t) = (70 - (t-60))t = 70t - t^2 + 60t$. \n\nNow, we want to find the largest value of $t$ such that the revenue generated by selling $t$ tickets is greater than $\\$4200$, i.e., $R(t) > 4200$. \n\nFor $t \\leq 60$, $70t > 4200$ gives $t > 60$, which is satisfied by our assumption when $t \\leq 60$. \n\nFor $t > 60$, $70t - t^2 + 60t > 4200$ gives $-t^2 + 130t > 4200$, which simplifies to $t^2 - 130t + 4200 < 0$. \n\nBy solving the quadratic inequality $t^2 - 130t + 4200 < 0$, we find the roots $t = 30$ and $t = 100$. Since the coefficient of $t^2$ is negative, the parabola opens downwards and the inequality holds true for $30 < t < 100$. \n\nTherefore, the largest value of $t$ that will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t = 99$.",
