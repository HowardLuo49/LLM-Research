Since $u = x + yi$ and $v = z + wi$, where $x, y, z, w$ are integers, we can express $uv = (x + yi)(z + wi) = (xz - yw) + (xw + yz)i$. \n\nFrom the factorizations of 10, we can substitute different values for $x, y, z, w$ in the expression for $uv$ and check if the real and imaginary parts are integers. \n\nFor example, when $10 = 10 \\times 1$, we have $u = 10 + 0i$ and $v = 1 + 0i$.
