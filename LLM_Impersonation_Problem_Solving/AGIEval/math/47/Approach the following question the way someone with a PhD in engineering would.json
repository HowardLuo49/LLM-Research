    "gpt_response": "To compute the number of ordered pairs of complex numbers $(u, v)$ such that $uv = 10$ and such that the real and imaginary parts of $u$ and $v$ are integers, we need to consider the possible factorizations of $10$ into two complex numbers with integer real and imaginary parts.\n\nLet $u = a + bi$ and $v = c + di$, where $a, b, c, d$ are integers. We have $uv = (a + bi)(c + di) = ac - bd + (ad + bc)i = 10$.\n\nSince $uv = 10$, we must have $ac - bd = 10$ and $ad + bc = 0$. From $ad + bc = 0$, we have $ad = -bc$. Plugging this into $ac - bd = 10$, we get $a(-c) + b(-c) = 10$, which simplifies to $-ac - bc = 10$. Hence, $c(-a - b) = 10$.\n\nThe factor pairs of $10$ are $(1, 10)$, $(2, 5)$, $(-1, -10)$, $(-2, -5)$, $(10, 1)$, and $(5, 2)$. For each factor pair, we can find the corresponding values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nFor example, if $c = 1$ and $-a - b = 10$, we can set $a = -11$ and $b = -1$, giving us the pair $(u, v) = (-11 - i, 1 + i)$. Similarly, the other factor pairs will give us different solutions.\n\nThus, the number of ordered pairs of complex numbers $(u, v)$ such that $uv = 10$ and such that the real and imaginary parts of $u$ and $v$ are integers is $6$.",
