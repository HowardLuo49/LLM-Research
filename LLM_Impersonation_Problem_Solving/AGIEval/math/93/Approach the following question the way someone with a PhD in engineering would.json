    "gpt_response": "As an engineer, I would approach this question using my knowledge of number theory and problem-solving skills. \n\nSince the product of the positive integers is given as 84, we need to find the prime factorization of 84. Prime factorization of 84 yields 2^2 * 3 * 7. \n\nTo find the least possible sum of these integers, we should arrange the prime factors in a way that minimizes the sum. This can be done by finding the least divisor of 84 that is distinct and positive. \n\nThe least divisor of 84 that is distinct and positive is 2. Therefore, the set of distinct positive integers that multiply to 84 and have the least possible sum is {2, 2, 3, 7}. \n\nAdding these integers together, we get 2 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 14. \n\nThus, the least possible sum of the distinct positive integers that multiply to 84 is 14.",
