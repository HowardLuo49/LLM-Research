    "gpt_response": "To determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we must consider the prime factorization of 84. \n\nThe prime factorization of 84 is:\n84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7\n\nIn order to minimize the sum of the integers in the set, we should distribute the prime factors as evenly as possible among the numbers. This can be achieved by assigning one factor to each number until all factors have been allocated.\n\nThus, the set of numbers with the least possible sum whose product is 84 would be:\n2, 2, 3, 7\n\nThe sum of these integers is:\n2 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 14\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of the distinct positive integers whose product is 84 is 14.",
