The prime factorization of 84 is 2^2 * 3 * 7. \n\nNext, we need to consider the distinct positive integers that can multiply to give 84. Since the integers are distinct, we cannot have duplicate factors in the set.\n\nTo find the least possible sum of these integers, we want to minimize the number of integers in the set. This means we want to find the smallest possible set of distinct positive integers that multiply to 84.\n\nOne way to do this is to start with the smallest prime factor, which is 2, and see how many 2s we can use while maintaining the product of 84. We can then move on to the next smallest prime factor, 3, and so on.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the set of distinct positive integers that minimizes the sum is {2, 3, 7}. The sum of these integers is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of these distinct positive integers that multiply to 84 is 12.",
