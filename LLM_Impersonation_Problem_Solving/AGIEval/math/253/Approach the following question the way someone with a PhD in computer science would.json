Katie has a list of real numbers such that the sum of the numbers on her list is equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers on her list. Compute the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of her numbers.",
    "solution": "1",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the numbers on Katie's list as x1, x2, ..., xn. Then we can write the equation:\n\nx1 + x2 + ... + xn = x1^2 + x2^2 + ... + xn^2\n\nSince we have the sum of the numbers being equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers, we can rearrange the equation to:\n\n0 = x1^2 - x1 + x2^2 - x2 + ... + xn^2 - xn\n\nThis equation can be simplified to:\n\n0 = (x1 - 1/2)^2 + (x2 - 1/2)^2 + ... + (xn - 1/2)^2 - n/4\n\nSince the left side of the equation is the sum of squares, it is always non-negative. Therefore, the smallest value it can take is 0, which occurs when all terms are 0. This gives us the following solution:\n\nx1 = x2 = ... = xn = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of Katie's numbers is:\n\n(1/2 + 1/2 + ... + 1/2)/n = 1/2.",
