Katie has a list of real numbers such that the sum of the numbers on her list is equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers on her list. Compute the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of her numbers.",
    "solution": "1",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of Katie's numbers, we must first consider the relationship between the sum of the numbers and the sum of the squares of the numbers on her list.\n\nLet us denote the numbers on Katie's list as a1, a2, ..., an. According to the given information, we have the following equation:\n\na1 + a2 + ... + an = a1^2 + a2^2 + ... + an^2\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n(a1 + a2 + ... + an) = (a1^2 + a2^2 + ... + an^2)\na1 + a2 + ... + an = a1^2 + a2^2 + ... + an^2\n\nRearranging the terms, we obtain:\n\n0 = a1^2 - a1 + a2^2 - a2 + ... + an^2 - an\n\nThis expression resembles the form of a complete square. To simplify this expression, we add and subtract (1/2)^2 to each term:\n\n0 = a1^2 - a1 + (1/2)^2 - (1/2)^2 + a2^2 - a2 + (1/2)^2 - (1/2)^2 + ... + an^2 - an + (1/2)^2 - (1/2)^2\n0 = (a1 - 1/2)^2 + (a2 - 1/2)^2 + ... + (an - 1/2)^2 - n(1/2)^2\n\nTherefore, the given condition is equivalent to the sum of the squares of the differences between each number on Katie's list and 1/2 is equal to n/4. This result suggests that the numbers on Katie's list must be symmetrically arranged around 1/2.\n\nIn order to maximize the arithmetic mean of Katie's numbers, we need to maximize each number on her list while satisfying the condition above. Since the numbers must be symmetrically arranged around 1/2, the maximum value of the arithmetic mean occurs when all the numbers on her list are equal to 1/2.\n\nHence, the largest possible value of the arithmetic mean of Katie's numbers is 1/2.",
