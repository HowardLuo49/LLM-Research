    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct three-letter sequences with at least one \"T\" using the letters in \"TARGET,\" we can consider the different cases in which \"T\" appears in the sequence.\n\nCase 1: \"T\" appears in the first position\nIn this case, we have 1 slot filled with \"T\" and 2 slots to fill with the remaining 5 letters (\"A,\" \"G,\" \"E,\" \"R\"). This can be done in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.\n\nCase 2: \"T\" appears in the second position\nSimilar to case 1, we have 1 slot filled with \"T\" and 2 slots to fill with the remaining 5 letters. This can also be done in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.\n\nCase 3: \"T\" appears in the third position\nAgain, we have 1 slot filled with \"T\" and 2 slots to fill with the remaining 5 letters. This can be done in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to count the case where all three letters are \"T\" (such as \"T-T-T\"), as we want at least one \"T\" in the sequence. This case is counted in all three cases above, so we need to subtract it once from the total count.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct three-letter sequences with at least one \"T\" using the letters in \"TARGET\" is $10+10+10-1=29.$\n\nHence, there are 29 distinct three-letter sequences that can be formed with at least one \"T\" using the letters in \"TARGET.\"",
