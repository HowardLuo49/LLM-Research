    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the number of distinct three-letter sequences with at least one \"T\" that can be formed using the letters in \"TARGET,\" we must first consider that there are a total of six letters to choose from. These letters are {T, A, R, G, E, T}.\n\nThe possible scenarios for forming a three-letter sequence with at least one \"T\" are as follows:\n1. One \"T\" and two other distinct letters (3C1 * 5C2)\n2. Two \"T\"s and one other distinct letter (3C2 * 4C1)\n3. Three \"T\"s (3C3)\n\nCalculating the combinations for each scenario, we obtain:\n1. 3C1 * 5C2 = 3 * 10 = 30\n2. 3C2 * 4C1 = 3 * 4 = 12\n3. 3C3 = 1\n\nSumming up the possibilities for each scenario, we find that there are a total of 30 + 12 + 1 = 43 distinct three-letter sequences with at least one \"T\" that can be formed using the letters in \"TARGET\".",
