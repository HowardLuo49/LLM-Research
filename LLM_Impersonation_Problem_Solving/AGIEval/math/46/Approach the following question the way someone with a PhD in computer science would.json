    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we must first analyze the pattern present in the figures provided. Each successive figure seems to have more line segments and endpoints than the previous one, due to the addition of smaller Y shapes at the extremities of each line segment.\n\nIn Figure 1, there are 3 endpoints. In Figure 2, the pattern is continued with the addition of smaller Y shapes at the extremities of each line segment, resulting in a total of 6 endpoints.\n\nNow, to determine the number of endpoints in Figure 3, we must first count the total number of line segments. There are 17 line segments in total. Each line segment has 2 endpoints at its extremities. Additionally, each smaller Y shape added to the extremity of a line segment introduces 2 new endpoints.\n\nTherefore, in Figure 3, we have:\n- 17 line segments, contributing 17 * 2 = 34 endpoints\n- 7 smaller Y shapes, contributing 7 * 2 = 14 endpoints\n\nAdding these together, we have a total of 34 + 14 = 48 endpoints in Figure 3.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can determine that Figure 4 will have a total of 48 + 9 * 2 = 66 endpoints, and Figure 5 will have a total of 66 + 11 * 2 = 88 endpoints.\n\nTherefore, Figure 5 will have a total of 88 endpoints.",
