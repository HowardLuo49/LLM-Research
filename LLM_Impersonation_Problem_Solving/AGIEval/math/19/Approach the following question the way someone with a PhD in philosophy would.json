    "gpt_response": "To analyze this question, we must employ principles of combinatorics and set theory. \n\nFirstly, we must recognize that we have a total of 30 men and 40 women to choose from. The number of ways to choose 3 men from the 30 men can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of men (30) and k is the number of men to be chosen (3). \n\nUsing this formula, we find that there are C(30, 3) = 30! / (3!(30-3)!) = 4060 ways to choose 3 men from the group of 30.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 4 women from the 40 women can be calculated using the same formula, where n is the total number of women (40) and k is the number of women to be chosen (4). \n\nTherefore, there are C(40, 4) = 40! / (4!(40-4)!) = 91,390 ways to choose 4 women from the group of 40.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to form the 7-person steering committee with 3 men and 4 women, we must multiply the number of ways to choose from the men and the women separately, as the choices are independent of one another.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to form the committee is:\n\n4060 * 91,390 = 371,854,000\n\nIn conclusion, there are 371,854,000 ways to form the 7-person steering committee with 3 men and 4 women from the Town Library Club.",
