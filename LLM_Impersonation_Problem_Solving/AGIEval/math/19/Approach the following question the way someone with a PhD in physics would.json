    "solution": "371,\\!043,\\!400",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of ways in which the committee can be formed, we can use the combination formula from combinatorial mathematics. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 men out of 30 is given by the combination formula, which is denoted as C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!). In this case, n = 30 and r = 3. \n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 men from 30 is C(30, 3) = 30! / (3! * (30-3)!) = 30! / (3! * 27!) = 30*29*28 / 3*2*1 = 4060 ways.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to choose 4 women out of 40 is given by the combination formula C(40, 4) = 40! / (4! * (40-4)!) = 40! / (4! * 36!) = 40*39*38*37 / 4*3*2*1 = 91390 ways.\n\nNow to find the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose men and women together: 4060 * 91390 = 371,414,000 ways.\n\nTherefore, there are 371,414,000 ways in which the steering committee consisting of 3 men and 4 women can be formed from the Town Library Club.",
