The number of congruent segments required to form each equilateral triangle is the same as the triangle number. Thus, for Figure n, we require n congruent segments to form the equilateral triangles.\n\nGiven that Figure 3 is formed with 7 congruent segments, we can see that Figure 3 is formed by stacking 1 + 2 + 3 equilateral triangles. Hence, for Figure 3, we need 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 congruent segments to form the equilateral triangles.\n\nFor Figure 25, we need to sum the first 25 triangle numbers. The formula for the triangle number is n * (n + 1) / 2.
