    "solution": "2",
    "gpt_response": "To solve for the value of $x$ in the equation $2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72$, we must first recognize that $72$ can be expressed as the product of $2^3 \\cdot 3^2$. Therefore, our equation simplifies to $2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$. By comparing the bases, we can determine that $x = 2$. This solution highlights the importance of understanding the properties of exponents and utilizing them to simplify complex equations in mathematics.",
