    "gpt_response": "To solve for the value of $x$ in the equation $2^3\\cdot3^x=72$, one must first recognize that the equation can be simplified by breaking down the powers of 2 and 3. \n\nFirst, $2^3 = 8$ and $3^2 = 9$. Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as $8\\cdot3^x=72$. \n\nNext, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 8 to isolate the $3^x$ term. This results in $3^x = 9$. \n\nFinally, by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation with base 3, we can solve for $x$. Therefore, $x = \\log_3 9 = 2$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $2^3\\cdot3^x=72$ is $x = 2$.",
