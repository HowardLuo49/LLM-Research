Since we are only interested in the hundreds digit, we can ignore the other digits and focus on the last three digits of the number.\n\nWhen calculating the last three digits of $2011^{2011}$, it is important to note that the hundreds digit will only be affected by the hundreds digit of the base number, 2011. In this case, the hundreds digit of 2011 is 0.\n\nSince the hundreds digit of the base number is 0, the hundreds digit of any power of 2011 will also be 0.
