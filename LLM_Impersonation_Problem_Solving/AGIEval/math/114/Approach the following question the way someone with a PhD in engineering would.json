    "gpt_response": "To determine the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$, we first need to consider the pattern of the hundreds digit when raising 2011 to different powers. We can start by finding the hundreds digit of $2011^1$, $2011^2$, $2011^3$, and so on, until we observe a pattern.\n\nWe notice that the hundreds digit of $2011^1$ is 0, the hundreds digit of $2011^2$ is 0, and the hundreds digit of $2011^3$ is also 0. In fact, as we continue to calculate higher powers of 2011, we consistently find that the hundreds digit is always 0. This pattern occurs because when we multiply a number by 2011, the hundreds digit will always be 0 due to the multiplication process.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently conclude that the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$ is 0 based on the pattern observed in the calculation of lower powers of 2011.",
