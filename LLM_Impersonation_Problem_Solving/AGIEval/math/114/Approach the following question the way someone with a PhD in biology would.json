    "gpt_response": "To determine the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$, we must first consider the properties of exponents. The hundreds digit is the digit in the hundreds place of a number. When raising a number to a high power, we only need to consider the last two digits of the base number.\n\nIn this case, we are raising 2011 to the power of 2011. To find the hundreds digit of the result, we need to consider the hundreds digit of 2011 raised to various powers. \n\nAfter analyzing the pattern of the hundreds digits of powers of 2011, we find that the hundreds digit repeats every four powers. Therefore, we need to find the remainder when 2011 is raised to the power of 2011 divided by 4.\n\nSince 2011 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3, we need to determine the hundreds digit of $2011^{3}$. Calculating $2011^{3}$, we find that the last three digits of $2011^{3}$ is 231. Therefore, the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$ is 2.",
