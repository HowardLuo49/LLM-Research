    "gpt_response": "To find the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$, we can first consider the last two digits of $2011^{2011}$. \n\nSince $2011^{2011}$ is congruent to $11^{2011} \\pmod{100}$, we can use Euler's theorem to find that $11^{40} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$. Therefore, $11^{2011} \\equiv 11^{11} \\pmod{100}$. \n\nCalculating $11^2 = 121$, we see that the last two digits of $11^{11}$ are $31$. \n\nNext, we can consider the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$. Since $2011^{2011}$ is a 4-digit number, the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$ is equivalent to the tens digit of $2011^{2011} \\pmod{1000}$. \n\nUsing Euler's theorem, we can find that $2011^{200} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$. Therefore, $2011^{2011} \\equiv 2011^{11} \\pmod{1000}$. \n\nBy finding patterns in the powers of $2011$, we can determine that the tens digit of $2011^{11}$ is $5$ and the hundreds digit is $8$. \n\nTherefore, the hundreds digit of $2011^{2011}$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
