    "gpt_response": "To find the length of the given curve in the coordinate plane, we must first understand the nature of the curve defined by the equation provided. \n\nThe equation describes the sum of three absolute values, each containing some combination of x and y. The absolute values ensure that the expression inside is always non-negative. Thus, in order for the entire equation to be equal to zero, each of the three absolute value terms must be zero individually.\n\nAnalyzing the first absolute value term, |x + y - 1| = 0 implies x + y - 1 = 0, which represents a line in the coordinate plane. \n\nSimilarly, the second absolute value term, | |x| - x | = 0 implies |x| - x = 0, which simplifies to x = 0. This represents the y-axis in the coordinate plane.\n\nLastly, analyzing the third absolute value term, $\\Big| |x - 1| + x - 1 \\Big| = 0$ implies $|x - 1| + x - 1 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 1$ and gives $x = 0$ or $x = 2$.
