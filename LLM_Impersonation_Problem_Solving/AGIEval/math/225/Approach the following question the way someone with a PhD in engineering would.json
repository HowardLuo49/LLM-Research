Let's start by simplifying the absolute value expressions one by one.\n\n1. For the first absolute value term |x + y - 1|, we have two cases:\n    a) When x + y - 1 \u2265 0:\n        In this case, the absolute value term simplifies to x + y - 1.\n    b) When x + y - 1 < 0:\n        In this case, the absolute value term simplifies to -(x + y - 1) = -x - y + 1.\n\n2. For the second absolute value term | |x| - x |, we have two cases:\n    a) When |x| - x \u2265 0:\n        This simplifies to |x| - x = x - x = 0.\n    b) When |x| - x < 0:\n        This simplifies to -(|x| - x) = -x + x = 0.\n\n3.
