The amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest quantity at which the company can break even or make a profit, we need to find the x-intercept of the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$. The x-intercept represents the quantity produced (x) at which the company makes $0 in profit. \n\nTo find the x-intercept, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n$0 = x^2 - 8x - 33$\n$x^2 - 8x - 33 = 0$.\n\nNow, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation:\n$x = \\frac{-(-8) \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(1)(-33)}}{2(1)}$\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 132}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm 14}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{22}{2}$ or $x = \\frac{-6}{2}$\n$x = 11$ or $x = -3$\n\nSince quantity produced cannot be negative, the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit is 11 units.",
