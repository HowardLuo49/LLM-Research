The amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",
    "solution": "11",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest quantity at which the company can break even or make a profit, we need to find the point at which the revenue function intersects the x-axis. This point represents the quantity produced at which the company's revenue equals zero.\n\nThe revenue function is given by $y=x^2-8x-33$. To find the quantity at which revenue equals zero, we set the function equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n$x^2-8x-33=0$\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor or use the quadratic formula. Factoring, we get:\n\n$(x-11)(x+3)=0$\n\nThis equation has solutions at $x=11$ and $x=-3$. Since we cannot produce a negative quantity, the smallest quantity at which the company can break even or make a profit is $x=11$. Therefore, the company must produce at least 11 units in order to break even or make a profit.",
