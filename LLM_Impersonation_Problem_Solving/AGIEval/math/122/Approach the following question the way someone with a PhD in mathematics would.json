The amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",
    "solution": "11",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the quantity at which the company can break even or make a profit, we need to find the x-value where the function $y=x^2-8x-33$ is greater than or equal to zero. This x-value represents the minimum quantity that the company needs to produce in order to achieve a break-even point or make a profit.\n\nTo find this x-value, we need to solve the inequality $x^2-8x-33\\geq0$. We can do this by factoring the quadratic equation or using the quadratic formula. Factoring the given equation, we get $(x-11)(x+3)\\geq0$. Solving this inequality, we find that the x-values which satisfy this inequality are $x\\leq-3$ or $x\\geq11$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit is 11 units.",
