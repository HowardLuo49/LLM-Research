The amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",
    "solution": "11",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the smallest quantity at which the company can break even or make a profit, we must analyze the given quadratic function, which represents the revenue of the company. By setting the revenue function equal to zero, we can find the quantity at which the company breaks even. \n\nThe revenue function is given by: \n$y = x^2 - 8x - 33$\n\nSetting $y$ equal to zero, we get: \n$0 = x^2 - 8x - 33$\n\nTo find the value of $x$ that corresponds to breaking even, we must solve the quadratic equation. Utilizing the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1, b=-8,$ and $c=-33$, we calculate: \n\n$x = \\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{8^2-4(1)(-33)}}{2(1)}$\n\n$x = \\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{64 + 132}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{196}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{8\\pm14}{2}$\n\nThis yields two potential solutions, $x = 11$ and $x = -3$. As it is impossible for the company to produce a negative quantity, the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit is $x = 11$. \n\nIn summary, the company must produce a minimum quantity of 11 units to break even.",
