The amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",
    "solution": "11",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest quantity at which the company can break even or make a profit, we first need to find the x-intercepts of the function y(x) = x^2 - 8x - 33. \n\nThe x-intercepts occur when y(x) = 0, so we set x^2 - 8x - 33 = 0 and solve for x using the quadratic formula: \n\nx = [8 \u00b1 sqrt((8)^2 - 4(1)(-33))] / 2(1)\nx = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(64 + 132)] / 2\nx = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(196)] / 2\nx = [8 \u00b1 14] / 2\n\nThus, the x-intercepts are x = 11 and x = -3. Since a negative quantity produced doesn't make sense in this context, we disregard x = -3. Therefore, the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit is x = 11 units.",
