By examining the diagram, we see that the octagon consists of eight right triangles, each with legs of length 4, 6, 8, and 10. These right triangles are arranged in a manner such that their hypotenuses form the sides of the octagon.\n\nConsidering the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, we find the length of each side of the octagon to be the square root of the sum of the squares of 4 and 6, giving us a side length of $\\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 36} = \\sqrt{52}$. Thus, the perimeter of the octagon is the sum of the lengths of its eight sides, resulting in a total perimeter of $8\\sqrt{52}$. \n\nTherefore, the perimeter of octagon $ABCDEFGH$ is $8\\sqrt{52}$.",
