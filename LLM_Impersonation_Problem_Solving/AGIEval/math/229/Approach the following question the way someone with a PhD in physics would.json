In Cartesian space, three spheres centered at $(-2,5,4),$ $(2,1,4),$ and $(4,7,5)$ are all tangent to the $xy$-plane.  The $xy$-plane is one of two planes tangent to all three spheres; the second plane can be written as the equation $ax + bx + cz = d$ for some real numbers $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Find $\\frac{c}{a}.$",

    "gpt_response": "To begin, we can express the equations of the three spheres centered at $(-2,5,4),$ $(2,1,4),$ and $(4,7,5)$ as $(x+2)^2 + (y-5)^2 + (z-4)^2 = r^2,$ $(x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-4)^2 = r^2,$ and $(x-4)^2 + (y-7)^2 + (z-5)^2 = r^2,$ respectively, where $r$ is the radius of each sphere.\n\nSince the spheres are tangent to the $xy$-plane, we know that the $z$-coordinates of their centers are equal to the sum of their radii. Therefore, we have $4+r = 0,$ $4+r = 1,$ and $5+r = 2.$ Solving these equations, we find $r = -4,$ $r = -3,$ and $r = -3,$ respectively.\n\nNow, we can express the second tangent plane as $ax+by+cz = d.$ Since this plane is tangent to all three spheres, the distance between their centers and the plane is equal to their radii. By using the formula for the distance between a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and a plane $ax + by + cz = d,$ which is $\\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 - d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}},$ we can set up and solve a system of equations to find $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$\n\nAfter solving the system, we find that $a = 7,$ $b = 0,$ $c = 4,$ and $d = -17.$ Therefore, $\\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{7}}.$",
