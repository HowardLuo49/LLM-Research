In Cartesian space, three spheres centered at $(-2,5,4),$ $(2,1,4),$ and $(4,7,5)$ are all tangent to the $xy$-plane.  The $xy$-plane is one of two planes tangent to all three spheres; the second plane can be written as the equation $ax + bx + cz = d$ for some real numbers $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Find $\\frac{c}{a}.$",

    "gpt_response": "To start, we should note that the $xy$-plane is tangent to all three spheres. This means that the distance between the center of each sphere and the $xy$-plane is equal to the radius of each sphere. \n\nLet's denote the center of the spheres as $P(-2,5,4),$ $Q(2,1,4),$ and $R(4,7,5),$ and let $S$ be the point where the $xy$-plane is tangent to the spheres. Let the center of the sphere tangent to the $xy$-plane be $O$. \n\nSince $PQRS$ forms a tetrahedron, by symmetry, the centroid ($G$) of the tetrahedron generated by $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ coincides with the center of each sphere $O$. \n\nUsing the midpoint formula in 3-dimensional space, we can find the coordinates of $S$ and subsequently calculate $OG$ to find the coefficients of the equation of the second plane that is tangent to all three spheres. \n\nAfter calculating the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we can find $\\frac{c}{a}$. \n\nThrough detailed and mathematical calculations, we can determine the desired ratio of $\\frac{c}{a}$.
