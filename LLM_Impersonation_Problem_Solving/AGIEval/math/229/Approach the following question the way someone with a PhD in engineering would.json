In Cartesian space, three spheres centered at $(-2,5,4),$ $(2,1,4),$ and $(4,7,5)$ are all tangent to the $xy$-plane.  The $xy$-plane is one of two planes tangent to all three spheres; the second plane can be written as the equation $ax + bx + cz = d$ for some real numbers $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Find $\\frac{c}{a}.$",

The general equation of a sphere centered at $(h, k, l)$ with radius $r$ is given by $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 + (z-l)^2 = r^2$. \n\nTherefore, the equations of the three spheres are:\n1) $(x+2)^2 + (y-5)^2 + (z-4)^2 = r_1^2$\n2) $(x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-4)^2 = r_2^2$\n3) $(x-4)^2 + (y-7)^2 + (z-5)^2 = r_3^2$\n\nGiven that all three spheres are tangent to the $xy$-plane, the distance from the center of each sphere to the $xy$-plane is equal to the radius of the sphere.
