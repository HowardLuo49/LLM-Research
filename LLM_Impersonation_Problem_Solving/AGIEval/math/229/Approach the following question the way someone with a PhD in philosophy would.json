In Cartesian space, three spheres centered at $(-2,5,4),$ $(2,1,4),$ and $(4,7,5)$ are all tangent to the $xy$-plane.  The $xy$-plane is one of two planes tangent to all three spheres; the second plane can be written as the equation $ax + bx + cz = d$ for some real numbers $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  Find $\\frac{c}{a}.$",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first consider the geometric relationships between the spheres and the planes tangent to them. Given that the spheres are tangent to the $xy$-plane, we know that the $z$-coordinates of their centers must be equal to their respective radii. This gives us the equations:\n\n$5 = 4$\n$1 = 4$\n$7 = 5$\n\nThis simplifies to $z = 4$ for all three spheres.\n\nNext, we must find the equations of the spheres centered at $(-2,5,4),$ $(2,1,4),$ and $(4,7,5).$ The equation of a sphere centered at $(h,k,m)$ with radius $r$ is given by $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 + (z-m)^2 = r^2.$ Applying this formula to each of the spheres, we get:\n\n$(-2-x)^2 + (5-y)^2 + (4-z)^2 = (-2-x)^2 + (5-y)^2 + (4-4)^2 = (-2-x)^2 + (5-y)^2 = r^2$\n$(2-x)^2 + (1-y)^2 + (4-z)^2 = (2-x)^2 + (1-y)^2 = r^2$\n$(4-x)^2 + (7-y)^2 + (5-z)^2 = (4-x)^2 + (7-y)^2 + (5-4)^2 = (4-x)^2 + (7-y)^2 = r^2$\n\nWe see that the $z$-coordinate is eliminated from the equations due to our earlier observation. Now, we can find the centers of the spheres in the $xy$-plane by setting $z = 4$ in the equations above:\n\n$(-2-x)^2 + (5-y)^2 = r^2$\n$(2-x)^2 + (1-y)^2 = r^2$\n$(4-x)^2 + (7-y)^2 = r^2$\n\nThe centers of the spheres in the $xy$-plane are $(2,5)$, $(2,1)$, and $(4,7)$ respectively. Now, we know that the second plane is tangent to all three spheres. To find the equation of this plane, let's assume it passes through the point $(2,5,4)$ (the center of the first sphere). This gives us the equation $a(2) + b(5) + c(4) = d$. Similarly, we can set up two more equations using the centers of the other two spheres.\n\nBy solving this system of equations and taking the ratio $\\frac{c}{a}$, we can find the desired answer.
