    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem as a philosopher with a PhD, we must first recognize the scientific notation provided in the equation $8210 = 8.21 \\times 10^{\\square}$. In scientific notation, a number is expressed as the product of a decimal number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. \n\nIn this case, the number $8210$ can be rewritten in scientific notation as $8.21 \\times 10^3$, where the $\\square$ corresponds to the power to which 10 is raised, in this case, 3.
