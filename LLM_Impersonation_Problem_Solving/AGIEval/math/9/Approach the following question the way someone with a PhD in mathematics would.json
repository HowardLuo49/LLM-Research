We can see that for very large positive or negative $x,$ the value of $x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)$ also becomes very large.\n\nNext, we can investigate critical points of the function by taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to 0. This will give us the potential minimum points of the function. Let $f(x) = x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3).$ Then, the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ is\n\\begin{align*} f'(x) &= 4x^3 + 18x^2 + 26x + 6. \\end{align*}Setting $f'(x) = 0$ gives\n\\begin{align*} 4x^3 + 18x^2 + 26x + 6 &= 0. \\end{align*}Solving this equation may be difficult and may require the use of numerical methods. By observing the behavior of the function, we can see that there should be only one minimum point.
