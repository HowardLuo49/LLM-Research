    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in literature would. An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the volume of a single ice cream scoop with a radius of 1 inch. Since the shape of an ice cream scoop is spherical, the volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, V = (4/3)\u03c0r^3. Plugging in the radius of 1 inch, we find that the volume of one scoop is approximately 4.19 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we need to determine the volume of the ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and a height of 5 inches. The formula for the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h. Plugging in the radius of 2 inches and the height of 5 inches, we find that the volume of the ice cream cone is approximately 20.94 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, we can determine how many scoops are needed to fill the ice cream cone by dividing the volume of the cone by the volume of one scoop. So, 20.94 / 4.19 \u2248 5 scoops are needed to fill the ice cream cone.\n\nIn conclusion, it would take approximately 5 ice cream scoops with a radius of 1 inch to fill an ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and a height of 5 inches.",
