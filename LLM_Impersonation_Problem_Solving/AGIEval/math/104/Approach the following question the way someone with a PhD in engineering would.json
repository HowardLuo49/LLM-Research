    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in engineering would. An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the ice cream cone and the volume of each ice cream scoop. \n\nThe volume of the ice cream cone can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cone: Vcone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * r^2 * h, where r is the radius of the cone (2 inches) and h is the height of the cone (5 inches). Plugging in the values, we get Vcone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * 2^2 * 5 = 20.94 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the volume of each ice cream scoop. The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula Vsphere = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere (1 inch). Plugging in the value, we get Vsphere = (4/3) * \u03c0 * 1^3 = 4.19 cubic inches.\n\nNow, we divide the volume of the ice cream cone by the volume of each ice cream scoop to determine the number of scoops needed: 20.94 / 4.19 \u2248 5 scoops. \n\nTherefore, it would take approximately 5 ice cream scoops with a radius of 1 inch to fill an ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and height of 5 inches.",
