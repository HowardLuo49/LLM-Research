    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in computer science would. An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the number of ice cream scoops needed to fill the cone, we first need to determine the volume of the cone and the volume of each ice cream scoop.\n\nThe volume of a cone can be calculated using the formula V = 1/3 * \u03c0 * r^2 * h, where r is the radius of the cone and h is the height of the cone. Substituting the given values, we get V = 1/3 * \u03c0 * (2^2) * 5 = 20\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we determine the volume of an ice cream scoop. The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula V = 4/3 * \u03c0 * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Substituting the given radius of 1 inch, we get V = 4/3 * \u03c0 * (1^3) = 4/3 \u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nNow, to find out how many scoops are needed to fill the cone, we divide the volume of the cone by the volume of each ice cream scoop. Therefore, the number of scoops needed = 20\u03c0 / (4/3 \u03c0) = 15.\n\nTherefore, a total of 15 ice cream scoops with a radius of 1 inch are needed to fill an ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and a height of 5 inches.",
