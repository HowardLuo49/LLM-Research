    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in physics would. An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of ice cream scoops needed to fill the given ice cream cone, we first need to calculate the volume of the ice cream cone. The volume of a cone can be calculated using the formula V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius of the base of the cone and h is the height of the cone. Plugging in the values r = 2 inches and h = 5 inches, we find that the volume of the cone is V = (1/3)\u03c0(2^2)(5) = 20\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the volume of each ice cream scoop. Since the scoops are in the shape of spheres with a radius of 1 inch, the volume of each scoop can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r^3. Plugging in the value r = 1 inch, we find that the volume of each scoop is V = (4/3)\u03c0(1^3) = (4/3)\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, to determine the number of scoops needed to fill the cone, we divide the volume of the cone by the volume of each scoop. Therefore, the number of scoops needed is:\n\nNumber of scoops = Volume of cone / Volume of each scoop = 20\u03c0 / (4/3)\u03c0 = 15\n\nTherefore, 15 ice cream scoops are needed to fill the ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and height of 5 inches.",
