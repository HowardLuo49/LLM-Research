    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.  If the ice cream scoops are allowed to melt into the cone, then how many scoops are needed to fill an ice cream cone with radius 2 inches and height 5 inches?",
    "solution": "5",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of scoops needed to fill the ice cream cone, we first need to calculate the volume of the cone and the volume of each ice cream scoop. \n\nThe volume of the cone can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cone:\nV_cone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * r^2 * h,\nwhere r is the radius of the cone (2 inches) and h is the height of the cone (5 inches).\n\nV_cone = (1/3) * \u03c0 * (2)^2 * 5 = (1/3) * \u03c0 * 4 * 5 = 20\u03c0/3 cubic inches.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the volume of each ice cream scoop, which is a sphere with radius 1 inch. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:\nV_sphere = (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3,\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere (1 inch).\n\nV_sphere = (4/3) * \u03c0 * (1)^3 = 4\u03c0/3 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, we can determine the number of scoops needed to fill the ice cream cone by dividing the volume of the cone by the volume of each scoop:\nNumber of scoops = V_cone / V_sphere\nNumber of scoops = (20\u03c0/3) / (4\u03c0/3) = 20/4 = 5 scoops.\n\nTherefore, it would take 5 ice cream scoops to fill an ice cream cone with a radius of 2 inches and a height of 5 inches.",
