A strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\\dots$ has the property that for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic. Suppose that $a_{13} = 2016$. Find $a_1$.",

    "gpt_response": "To tackle this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the given sequence. From the information provided, we know that the sequence satisfies two properties: for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic.\n\nLet's denote common ratio of the geometric subsequence as $r$ and the common difference of the arithmetic subsequence as $d$. Therefore, the terms of the sequence can be expressed as $a_{2k-1} = ar^{k-1}$, $a_{2k} = ar^{k}$, $a_{2k+1} = ar^{k+1}$ for the geometric part, and $a_{2k} = a + d(k-1)$, $a_{2k+1} = a + dk$, $a_{2k+2} = a + d(k+1)$ for the arithmetic part.\n\nSince $a_{13} = 2016$, we can substitute $k = 6$ into the equations above to get $a_{13} = ar^{12} = a + 5d = 2016$. From this equation, we can see that we need to find the values of $a$, $r$, $d$ that satisfy this equation.\n\nNext, we can use the fact that the subsequence $a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}$ is geometric and $a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}$ is arithmetic to establish another equation involving $a$, $r$, and $d$. By substituting $k = 5$ and $k = 6$ into the expressions for the terms of the sequence above and using the properties of geometric and arithmetic sequences, we can derive the equation $a + 4d = a(1+r^2)$.\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of $a$, $r$, and $d$. Finally, we can use these values to determine $a_1$.",
