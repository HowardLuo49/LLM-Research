    "gpt_response": "To find the length of the belt drawn tightly around the three circles, we can think of the belt as consisting of two straight sections connecting the centers of the circles and three curved sections, each with length equal to the circumference of a circle with radius 10 cm.\n\nThe length of each straight section can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, since the centers of the circles form an equilateral triangle with side length 20 cm. The length of each straight section is thus $20$ cm.\n\nThe length of the curved sections is equal to the circumference of a circle with radius 10 cm, which is $20\\pi$ cm.\n\nTherefore, the total length of the belt is $20 + 20\\pi = 20(1 + \\pi)$.
