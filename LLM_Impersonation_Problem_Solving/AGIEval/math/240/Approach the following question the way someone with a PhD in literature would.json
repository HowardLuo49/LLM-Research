    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in literature, I would approach this question recognizing the similarities between mathematical equations and literary analysis. Much like in literature where one analyzes the language, structure, and themes of a text, in mathematics we can analyze the equation by understanding the properties and relationships between the numbers involved.\n\nIn this case, the equation can be simplified by recognizing that $5^b$ is repeated five times on the left side of the equation. This can be written as $5^b * 5 = 5^{b+1}$. Therefore, the left side of the equation simplifies to $5^{b+1} + 5^{b+1} = 2*5^{b+1} = 10*5^{b}$.\n\nOn the right side of the equation, $625^{(b-1)}$ can be rewritten as $(5^4)^{(b-1)} = 5^{4(b-1)} = 5^{4b-4}$.\n\nSetting the left side equal to the right side, we have $10*5^b = 5^{4b-4}$.\n\nBy setting the bases equal to each other, we have $10=5^{4b-4-b} = 5^{3b-4}$. \n\nSolving for $b$, we find $3b-4=1 \\Rightarrow 3b=5 \\Rightarrow b=\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\frac{5}{3}$ as a common fraction.",
