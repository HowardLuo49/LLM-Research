    "gpt_response": "To solve this mathematical equation, we must first try to simplify it. Notice that each term on the left-hand side equates to $5^b$, so the equation simplifies to $5 \\cdot 5^b = 625^{(b-1)}$. \n\nNow, simplify the right-hand side of the equation. Recall that $625 = 5^4$, so $625^{(b-1)} = (5^4)^{(b-1)} = 5^{4(b-1)} = 5^{4b-4}$.\n\nThus, we have $5 \\cdot 5^b = 5^{4b-4}$, which simplifies further to $5^{b+1} = 5^{4b-4}$. \n\nTherefore, equating the exponents on both sides, we get $b+1 = 4b-4$. \n\nSolving this equation for $b$, we find $b = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nHence, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}$.",
