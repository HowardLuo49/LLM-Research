    "solution": "15",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of sides in a regular polygon based on the relationship between the interior and exterior angles, we can use the formula:\n\nInterior angle + Exterior angle = 180 degrees\n\nGiven that the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle, we can represent this relationship as:\n\nInterior angle = 6.5 * Exterior angle\n\nSubstitute the value of the interior angle into the formula:\n\n6.5 * Exterior angle + Exterior angle = 180 degrees\n(6.5 + 1) * Exterior angle = 180 degrees\n7.5 * Exterior angle = 180 degrees\n\nNow, solve for the measure of the exterior angle:\n\nExterior angle = 180 degrees / 7.5\nExterior angle = 24 degrees\n\nSince the exterior angle of a regular polygon is equal to 360 degrees divided by the number of sides, we can find the number of sides by dividing 360 degrees by the measure of the exterior angle:\n\nNumber of sides = 360 degrees / Exterior angle\nNumber of sides = 360 degrees / 24 degrees\nNumber of sides = 15\n\nTherefore, the regular polygon has 15 sides.",
