    "solution": "15",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first understand the relationship between interior and exterior angles in a polygon. In a regular polygon, all interior angles are equal and all exterior angles are equal. \n\nLet's denote the measure of an interior angle as x and the measure of an exterior angle as y. According to the given information, we have the equation:\nx = 6.5y\n\nWe also know that the sum of an interior angle and an exterior angle in any polygon is 180 degrees. Therefore, we have the equation:\nx + y = 180\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation:\n6.5y + y = 180\n7.5y = 180\ny = 24\n\nNow that we have found the measure of an exterior angle, we can determine the number of sides in the polygon by dividing 360 degrees (the sum of exterior angles in any polygon) by the measure of one exterior angle:\n360 \u00f7 24 = 15\n\nTherefore, the polygon has 15 sides.",
