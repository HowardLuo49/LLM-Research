    "solution": "15",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we must first establish the relationships between the interior and exterior angles of a regular polygon. In a regular polygon, all interior angles are equal, as are all exterior angles. Let us denote the measure of the interior angle as A and the measure of the exterior angle as B.\n\nGiven that the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle, we can express this relationship as:\n\nA = 6.5B\n\nWe also know that the sum of an interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write:\n\nA + B = 180\n\nSubstituting the expression for A in terms of B into the equation above, we get:\n\n6.5B + B = 180\n7.5B = 180\nB = 24\n\nNow that we have found the measure of the exterior angle, we can determine the number of sides in the polygon using the formula:\n\nNumber of sides = 360 / B\n\nNumber of sides = 360 / 24\nNumber of sides = 15\n\nTherefore, the polygon has 15 sides.",
