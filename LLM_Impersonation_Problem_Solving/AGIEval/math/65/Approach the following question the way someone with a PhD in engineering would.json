    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem as someone with a PhD in engineering, we first need to analyze the information given in the diagram. \n\nWe are given that the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is 40. Since the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width, we can set up an equation to find the dimensions of rectangle $ABCD$. Let the length of rectangle $ABCD$ be $x$ and the width be $y$. \n\nFrom the area given, we have:\n\n$x \\cdot y = 40$\n\nSince $x = 8$ and $y = 5$ satisfy this equation, we can conclude that the dimensions of rectangle $ABCD$ are 8 by 5.\n\nNow, we are asked to find the area of quadrilateral $MBCN$. Since $MBCN$ is a trapezoid, we can break it down into a rectangle and a triangle. \n\nThe area of the rectangle $MBCN$ is the length of $MN$ multiplied by the height of the trapezoid. \n\nThe length of $MN$ is equal to the length of $AB$ which is 8. \n\nNow, to find the height of the trapezoid, we can observe that the height is the same length as $NC$. Since $NC = 4$, the height of the trapezoid is 4.\n\nTherefore, the area of trapezoid $MBCN$ is:\n\n$8 \\cdot 4 = 32$ \n\nSo, the area of quadrilateral $MBCN$ is 32.",
