    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first expand the left side of the equation $(ax+b)(2x+3)$:\n\n$(ax+b)(2x+3) = 2ax^2 + 3ax + 2bx + 3b = 2ax^2 + (3a+2b)x + 3b$\n\nNow, we can compare this expression to the right side of the equation $20x^2 + 44x + 21$:\n\n$2ax^2 + (3a+2b)x + 3b = 20x^2 + 44x + 21$\n\nBy comparing coefficients of corresponding powers of $x$, we can see that $2a = 20$, $3a + 2b = 44$, and $3b = 21$. \n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for $a$ as $a = 10$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $3(10) + 2b = 44$, which simplifies to $30 + 2b = 44$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two distinct integers $a$ and $b$ is $a+b = 10 + 7 = 17$.",
