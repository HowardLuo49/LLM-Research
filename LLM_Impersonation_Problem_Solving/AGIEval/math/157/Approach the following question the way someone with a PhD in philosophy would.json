    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, we must first establish the definition of an odd perfect square. A square number is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself, and an odd perfect square is a square number that is also an odd number.\n\nIn the given range of numbers, 5 and 9 are the only odd perfect squares. Beyond 9, all odd squares will be greater than 211. Therefore, the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 is 2.",
