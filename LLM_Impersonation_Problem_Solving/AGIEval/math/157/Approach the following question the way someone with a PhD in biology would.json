    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, we first need to understand the properties of odd perfect squares. An odd perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an odd integer. Therefore, we can start by finding the odd integers between the square roots of 5 and 211. \n\nThe square root of 5 is approximately 2.24, and the square root of 211 is approximately 14.53. Therefore, the odd integers between 2 and 14 are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. \n\nNext, we can square each of these odd integers to find the corresponding perfect squares: 3^2 = 9, 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49, 9^2 = 81, 11^2 = 121, and 13^2 = 169. \n\nOut of these perfect squares, the odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 are 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169. Therefore, there are 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.",
