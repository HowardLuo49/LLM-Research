    "solution": "6",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, one must first recognize that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. Additionally, an odd perfect square is a perfect square that is also an odd integer.\n\nIn order to find the odd perfect squares within the given range, we can start by identifying the smallest odd perfect square greater than 5. The square of 3 is 9, which is the smallest odd perfect square greater than 5. Next, we can determine the largest odd perfect square less than 211. The square of 15 is 225, which is greater than 211. Therefore, the largest odd perfect square less than 211 is the square of 13, which is 169.\n\nNow that we have identified the smallest (9) and largest (169) odd perfect squares within the range of 5 to 211, we can proceed to list out all the odd perfect squares in between. By taking the square roots of these odd perfect squares, we can confirm that the integers corresponding to these values are odd.\n\nThe odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 are as follows:\n9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.",
