    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, we first need to find the square root of the smallest and largest numbers in the given range. The square root of 5 is approximately 2.24, and the square root of 211 is approximately 14.52. \n\nNext, we need to identify the odd perfect squares within this range. We observe that the odd perfect squares are generated by squaring odd integers. Therefore, the odd perfect squares between 5 and 211 are the squares of odd integers between 3 and 14. \n\nThe odd integers between 3 and 14 are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Squaring these integers, we obtain the following odd perfect squares: 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169. \n\nThere are 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211. \n\nIn conclusion, there are 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211, namely 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, and 169.",
