    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of integer values of $k$ for which the graphs of $x^2+y^2=k^2$ and $xy=k$ do not intersect, we can start by examining the nature of the two equations.\n\nThe first equation, $x^2+y^2=k^2$, represents circles with radius $k$ centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane. These circles are centered at the origin and have radius $k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nThe second equation, $xy=k$, represents hyperbolas centered at the origin in the $xy$-plane. These hyperbolas have branches in the first and third quadrants and pass through the origin, with asymptotes along the $x$ and $y$ axes.\n\nThe graphs of these two equations do not intersect when the hyperbola does not intersect the circle, which occurs when the hyperbola's branches lie entirely outside the circle.\n\nTo find the integer values of $k$ for which this occurs, we can analyze the geometry of the system. The hyperbola $xy=k$ never intersects the circle $x^2+y^2=k^2$ if the hyperbola lies entirely in one of the quadrants (with branches in the first and third quadrants).\n\nTherefore, for a given value of $k$, we have to determine the region of intersection between the hyperbola and the circle.
