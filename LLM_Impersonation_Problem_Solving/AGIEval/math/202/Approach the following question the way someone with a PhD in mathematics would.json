This means that for a given value of $k$, the equation defines a circle with radius $k$.\n\nThe second equation $xy=k$ represents a rectangular hyperbola with asymptotes $x=0$ and $y=0$. This means that for a given value of $k$, the equation defines a hyperbola with the rectangular property that the product of $x$ and $y$ is constant, equal to $k$.\n\nTo find the integer values of $k$ for which the graphs of the circle and hyperbola do not intersect, we need to consider when the hyperbola lies completely outside the circle. This occurs when the hyperbola is contained entirely within one of the four quadrants defined by the circle.\n\nConsidering the equations $x^2+y^2=k^2$ and $xy=k$, we can substitute $y=\\frac{k}{x}$ into the circle equation to get $x^2+(\\frac{k}{x})^2=k^2$.
