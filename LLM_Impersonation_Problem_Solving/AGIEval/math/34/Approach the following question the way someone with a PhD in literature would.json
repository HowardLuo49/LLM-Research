When working modulo $m$, the notation $a^{-1}$ is used to denote the residue $b$ for which $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, if any exists. For how many integers $a$ satisfying $0 \\le a < 100$ is it true that $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$?",

The notation $a^{-1}$ in modular arithmetic refers to the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $m$.

This can be rewritten as $a \\cdot (a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$.\n\nWe first note that if $a$ and $20$ have a common factor greater than $1$, then $a$ does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo $20$, and hence the equation does not hold for such $a$.
