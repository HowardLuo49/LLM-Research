When working modulo $m$, the notation $a^{-1}$ is used to denote the residue $b$ for which $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, if any exists. For how many integers $a$ satisfying $0 \\le a < 100$ is it true that $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$?",

    "gpt_response": "To begin solving this problem, let's rewrite the given congruence in a more manageable form. We have $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$, which can be rewritten as $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{5}$ and $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{4}$. \n\nLet's first consider the congruence $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{5}$. To find all solutions for $a$, we must try all possible residues of $a$ modulo $5$. Note that $a^{-1}$ exists only when $\\gcd(a,5) = 1$, so we will only examine $a$ that are coprime to $5$. In this case, there are $4$ possible values for $a$ satisfying this congruence: $1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\nNext, let's consider the congruence $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{4}$. Similarly, we need to try all residues of $a$ modulo $4$. We also want to ensure that $\\gcd(a,4) = 1$ so that we can find $a^{-1}$. The possible values of $a$ that satisfy this congruence are $1, 3$.\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of the sets of possible values of $a$ satisfying both congruences. The values of $a$ that satisfy both congruences are the ones that are coprime to $5$ and equal to $1, 3$ modulo $4$. In other words, the common values for $a$ are those which are congruent to $1, 3$ modulo $4$ and are coprime to $5$. \n\nTo find all possible values of $a$, we perform the Chinese Remainder Theorem on the congruences $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ to get $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Combining this with the condition of being coprime to $5$, we see that the possible values of $a$ are $3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 27, 33, 37, 43, 47, 53, 57, 63, 67, 73, 77, 83, 87, 93, 97$. \n\nIn conclusion, there are $\\boxed{20}$ integers $a$ satisfying $0 \\le a < 100$ such that $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$.",
