When working modulo $m$, the notation $a^{-1}$ is used to denote the residue $b$ for which $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, if any exists. For how many integers $a$ satisfying $0 \\le a < 100$ is it true that $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$?",
    "solution": "0",
    "gpt_response": "Let us first express the given congruence in a simplified form. \n\nWe have $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$. Multiplying both sides by $(a-1)$, we get $a \\equiv 4(a-1) \\pmod{20}$. Expanding, we have $a \\equiv 4a - 4 \\pmod{20}$, which simplifies to $3a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{20}$. \n\nNow, we can solve this linear congruence to find all integers $a$ satisfying the given condition. \n\nBy the definition, $a^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $20$. Therefore, $a$ must be coprime to 20 for $a^{-1}$ to exist. Additionally, $a$ and $a -1$ must also be coprime to 20. \n\nSince $0 \\le a < 100$, we can list the integers between 0 and 99 that are coprime to 20.
