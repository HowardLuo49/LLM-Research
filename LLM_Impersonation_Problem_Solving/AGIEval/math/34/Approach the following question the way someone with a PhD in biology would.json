When working modulo $m$, the notation $a^{-1}$ is used to denote the residue $b$ for which $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, if any exists. For how many integers $a$ satisfying $0 \\le a < 100$ is it true that $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$?",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we first need to determine the meaning of $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$. This means that the residue of $a(a-1)^{-1}$ modulo 20 is equal to the residue of $4a^{-1}$ modulo 20.\n\nLet us rewrite the given congruence as $a(a-1)^{-1} \\equiv 4a^{-1} \\pmod{20}$ as $a \\cdot (a-1)^{-1} - 4a^{-1} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{20}$.\n\nNow, we aim to simplify the left side.
