    "gpt_response": "To find the overall average of the two groups of students, we must first calculate the total score of each group. \n\nThe first group of 25 students averaged 84 on the test, so their total score would be 25 * 84 = 2100. \n\nThe second group of 20 students averaged 66 on the test, so their total score would be 20 * 66 = 1320. \n\nNow, we add the total scores of both groups together to get the overall total score: 2100 + 1320 = 3420. \n\nTo find the overall average, we divide the overall total score by the total number of students: 3420 / (25 + 20) = 3420 / 45 = 76. \n\nTherefore, the overall average of the two groups of students is 76.",
