    "gpt_response": "To find the overall average, we must first calculate the total sum of the scores of all students combined. \n\nFor the first group of 25 students averaging 84, the total sum of their scores is 25 * 84 = 2100.\n\nFor the second group of 20 students averaging 66, the total sum of their scores is 20 * 66 = 1320.\n\nCombining both groups, the total sum of all student scores is 2100 + 1320 = 3420.\n\nTo find the overall average, we divide the total sum by the total number of students:\n\nOverall average = 3420 / (25 + 20) = 3420 / 45 = 76.\n\nTherefore, the overall average score of all students is 76.",
