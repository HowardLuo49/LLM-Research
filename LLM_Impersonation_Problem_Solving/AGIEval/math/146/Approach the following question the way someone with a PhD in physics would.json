    "solution": "76",
    "gpt_response": "To find the overall average of the combined groups of students, we must first calculate the total sum of scores for both groups. The total sum of scores for the first group is 25 students * 84 average score = 2100. Similarly, the total sum of scores for the second group is 20 students * 66 average score = 1320. \n\nTherefore, the total sum of scores for both groups combined is 2100 + 1320 = 3420. \n\nTo find the overall average, we divide the total sum of scores by the total number of students in both groups. The total number of students is 25 + 20 = 45. \n\nTherefore, the overall average score is 3420 / 45 = 76. \n\nThus, the overall average score for the combined groups of students is 76.",
