The general form of the equation of a circle is $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, where $(a,b)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.\n\nIn this case, the equations $x^2-24x +y^2-32y+384=0$ and $x^2+24x +y^2+32y+384=0$ can be rewritten in the standard form of the equation of a circle. Simplifying the equations, we get:\n\n$(x-12)^2 + (y-16)^2 = 4^2$ and $(x+12)^2 + (y+16)^2 = 4^2$\n\nFrom this, we can see that the centers of the circles are at $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ respectively, and their radii are both 4 units.\n\nTo find the shortest distance between the two circles, we need to find the distance between their centers. Using the distance formula, $d = \\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$, we can calculate the distance between $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ to be $\\sqrt{(12-(-12))^2 + (16-(-16))^2} = \\sqrt{24^2 + 32^2} = \\sqrt{576 + 1024} = \\sqrt{1600} = 40$.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance between the two circles is 40 units.",
