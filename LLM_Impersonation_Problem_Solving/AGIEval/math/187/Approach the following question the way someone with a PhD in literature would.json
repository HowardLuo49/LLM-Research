    "gpt_response": "To solve the inequality $\\sqrt{x^2 - x - 6} < 2x - 3$, we first need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality. \n\nFirst, note that in order for the square root to be defined, we must have $x^2 - x - 6 \\geq 0$. This means that $(x-3)(x+2) \\geq 0$, which implies that $x \\leq -2$ or $x \\geq 3$. \n\nNext, we can square both sides of the inequality to remove the square root, keeping in mind that both sides of the inequality must remain positive since the square root is positive. This gives us:\n\\[x^2 - x - 6 < (2x - 3)^2.\\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[x^2 - x - 6 < 4x^2 - 12x + 9.\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[3x^2 - 11x + 15 > 0.\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy both conditions: $3x^2 - 11x + 15 > 0$ and $x \\leq -2$ or $x \\geq 3$. \n\nTo solve the quadratic inequality $3x^2 - 11x + 15 > 0$, we can use various methods such as factoring, the quadratic formula, or graphing. Considering the discriminant of this quadratic, we find two real roots, $x \\approx 1.67$ and $x \\approx 3.33$. This allows us to define the regions where the inequality is satisfied. By constructing a sign chart and testing the values, we find that the solutions to the quadratic inequality are $x < 1.67$ and $x > 3.33$.\n\nTherefore, the final solution to the inequality $\\sqrt{x^2 - x - 6} < 2x - 3$ is $x < 1.67$ or $x > 3.33$, taking into account the restriction $x \\leq -2$ or $x \\geq 3$ due to the square root being within the inequality.",
