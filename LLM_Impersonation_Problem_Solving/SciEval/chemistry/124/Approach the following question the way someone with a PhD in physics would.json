In this case, the molecule contains carbon (C), sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms.\n\nBy counting the number of each atom in the molecular formula, we can determine the overall composition of the molecule. In this case, there are 9 carbon atoms, 2 sulfur atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 oxygen atom. Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is C9H9NS2O.",
