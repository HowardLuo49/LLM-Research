    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCC1=CSC(=N1)CC(C)O can be described as a heterocyclic compound featuring a fused five-membered ring system containing sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon atoms. The molecular formula indicates the presence of three carbon atoms, one sulfur atom, one nitrogen atom, and one oxygen atom. The structural arrangement of the atoms suggests a cyclic structure with potential functional groups such as thiocarbonyl, imine, and hydroxyl groups. The molecule exhibits potential reactivity due to the presence of multiple functional groups, which may have implications for its chemical behavior and potential applications in organic chemistry.",
