    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCC1=CSC(=N1)CC(C)O is C9H16N2OS. This can be determined by counting the number of each type of atom present in the molecule and summing their atomic weights according to the chemical formula. The molecular formula indicates the types and quantities of atoms present in a compound, providing important information about its structure and properties.",
