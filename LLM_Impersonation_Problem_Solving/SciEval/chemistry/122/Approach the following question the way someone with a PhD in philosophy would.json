    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCC(C)CCC(C)(O)O denotes a specific chemical compound with a particular configuration of carbon and hydrogen atoms, along with oxygen atoms. This formula suggests the presence of three carbon atoms connected in a linear chain, followed by an additional carbon atom connected to the third carbon atom in a branching fashion. Furthermore, there are two oxygen atoms attached to the fourth carbon atom. The specific arrangement and bonding patterns of these atoms result in the unique molecular structure and properties of the compound. Further analysis and experimentation would be necessary to determine the exact nature and characteristics of this compound.",
