    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCC(C)CCC(C)(O)O can be elucidated by examining the structure of the compound. This compound appears to be a type of long-chain aliphatic alcohol, as denoted by the presence of multiple carbon atoms linked by single bonds and terminated by a hydroxyl group. The molecular formula indicates that there are three carbon atoms in the main chain, each bearing one or more methyl groups. Additionally, there are two hydroxyl groups present in the molecule. \n\nTherefore, based on the structural representation of CCC(C)CCC(C)(O)O, the molecular formula can be inferred as C6H14O2, representing six carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. This molecular formula provides a concise description of the elemental composition of the compound, allowing for further analysis of its chemical properties and potential reactivity in various contexts.",
