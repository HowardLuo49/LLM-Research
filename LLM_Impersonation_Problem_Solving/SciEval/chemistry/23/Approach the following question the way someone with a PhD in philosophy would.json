    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of C1CC(CC1CNCC(CO)O)O is C13H26N2O3. This can be determined by counting the number of each type of atom (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen) present in the molecular structure provided, taking into account the bonds and functional groups present. The molecular formula provides important information about the composition of a compound and can be used to predict its physical and chemical properties.",
