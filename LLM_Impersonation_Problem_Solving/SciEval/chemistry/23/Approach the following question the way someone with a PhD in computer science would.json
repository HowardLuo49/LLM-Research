    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of C1CC(CC1CNCC(CO)O)O can be broken down into its constituent elements and their respective counts. In this case, the formula consists of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms. The molecular formula can be further simplified by rearranging the atoms in a linear sequence: C9H21N2O4. This represents the overall composition of the compound in terms of the number and types of atoms present.",
