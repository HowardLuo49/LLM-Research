    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of C1CC(CC1CNCC(CO)O)O can be broken down to represent a chemical compound with a carbon backbone, cyclic structures, nitrogen and oxygen atoms, as well as functional groups such as amines and alcohols. The specific arrangement of these elements in the compound results in the molecular formula C11H26N2O4, which indicates the overall composition of the molecule. This formula provides important information about the number and types of atoms present in the compound, which is crucial for understanding its structure and potential biological activities.",
