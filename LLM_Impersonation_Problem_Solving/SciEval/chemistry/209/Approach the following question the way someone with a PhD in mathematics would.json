    "gpt_response": "275.42 g/mol\n\nExplanation: To calculate the molecular weight of 2-[(3S)-1-propylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetonitrile, we first need to determine the molecular formula of the compound. The molecular formula is C\u2081\u2084H\u2082\u2084N\u2082, based on the structural formula provided.\n\nNext, we look up the atomic weights of each element from the periodic table: carbon (C) has an atomic weight of 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of 1.01 g/mol, and nitrogen (N) has an atomic weight of 14.01 g/mol.\n\nNow, we calculate the molecular weight by summing the atomic weights of each element in the formula:\n(14 x 12.01) + (24 x 1.01) + (2 x 14.01) = 168.14 + 24.24 + 28.02 = 220.40 g/mol\n\nAdditionally, we need to add the molecular weight of the acetonitrile group, which is 55.02 g/mol.\n\nTherefore, the total molecular weight of 2-[(3S)-1-propylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetonitrile is:\n220.40 g/mol + 55.02 g/mol = 275.42 g/mol.",
