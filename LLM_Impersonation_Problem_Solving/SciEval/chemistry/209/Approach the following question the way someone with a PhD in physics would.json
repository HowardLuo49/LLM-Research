    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 2-[(3S)-1-propylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetonitrile can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The molecular formula for the compound is C11H20N2, and the atomic weights of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen are approximately 12.01, 1.008, and 14.01, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 2-[(3S)-1-propylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetonitrile can be calculated as follows:\n\n11(12.01) + 20(1.008) + 2(14.01) = 146.16 g/mol\n\nThus, the molecular weight of 2-[(3S)-1-propylpyrrolidin-3-yl]acetonitrile is approximately 146.16 g/mol.",
