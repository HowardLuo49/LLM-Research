The atomic weight of carbon is 12.01 g/mol, the atomic weight of hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol, and the atomic weight of oxygen is 16.00 g/mol.\n\nNext, we multiply the number of each type of atom by its atomic weight and sum the results:\n\n(7 x 12.01) + (12 x 1.008) + (3 x 16) = 84.07 + 12.096 + 48 = 144.17 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C7H12O3 is 144.17 g/mol.",
