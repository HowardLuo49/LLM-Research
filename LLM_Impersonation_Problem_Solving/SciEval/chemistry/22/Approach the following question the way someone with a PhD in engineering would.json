This expression represents the chemical structure of undecanol in a linear format, with the carbon atoms represented by the letter \"C\", hydrogen atoms omitted, and the oxygen atom represented by the letter \"O\" at the end of the chain. The SMILES notation is commonly used in computational chemistry and chemical informatics to represent chemical structures in a concise and standardized way.
