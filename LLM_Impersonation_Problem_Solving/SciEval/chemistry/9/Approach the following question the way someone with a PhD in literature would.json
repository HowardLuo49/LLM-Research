The SMILES expression for C8H14O would be \"CC1=CCC(C)=C(C)C(C)C1C=O\" which encapsulates the connectivity of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms present in the molecule. This concise representation allows for easy communication of molecular structures and facilitates computational analysis in the field of organic chemistry.",
