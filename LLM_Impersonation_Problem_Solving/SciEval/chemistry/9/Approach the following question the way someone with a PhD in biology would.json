To convert this molecular formula into a SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) expression, one must consider the connectivity of the atoms within the molecule. \n\nIn the case of C8H14O, the molecule consists of 8 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. The connectivity of these atoms will determine the SMILES expression, which is a textual representation of the chemical structure.\n\nTo generate the SMILES expression for C8H14O, one would need to determine the specific arrangement of the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms connected to each other within the molecule. This information would then be inputted into a software program or tool that can automatically generate the SMILES expression based on the molecular structure provided.\n\nThe resulting SMILES expression for C8H14O would provide a unique code that represents the connectivity of atoms within the molecule, allowing for easier sharing and communication of chemical structures in scientific research and database systems.",
