    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a chemical compound represents its molecular structure using a short and convenient notation. In the case of C8H14O, we first need to determine the atomic connectivity of the compound in order to generate its SMILES expression.\n\nTo represent the compound C8H14O in SMILES notation, we first identify the atoms present in the compound and their connectivity. In this case, the compound consists of 8 carbon atoms (C), 14 hydrogen atoms (H), and 1 oxygen atom (O). Once we determine the connectivity of these atoms, we can construct the SMILES expression for the compound.\n\nBased on the given molecular formula, we can infer that the compound has a linear aliphatic structure. Therefore, the SMILES expression for C8H14O would be:\n\nCCCCCCCCO\n\nThis SMILES notation represents a linear chain of 8 carbon atoms bonded to each other, with the last carbon atom connected to an oxygen atom via a single bond.",
