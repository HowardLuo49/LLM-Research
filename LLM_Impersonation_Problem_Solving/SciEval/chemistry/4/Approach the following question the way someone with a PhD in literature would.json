    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of 2-amino-3-pentan-2-yloxypropanenitrile is CC(C)(C)OC(CC(C)N)C#N. This is a molecular structure notation that represents the specific arrangement of atoms in a chemical compound, in this case a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups. The SMILES notation is commonly used in chemical databases and software to efficiently and accurately represent molecular structures in a computer-readable format.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response ['CCCC(C)OCC(C#N)N']?: The SMILES expression of 2-amino-3-pentan-2-yloxypropanenitrile is CC(C)(C)OC(CC(C)N)C#N. This is a molecular structure notation that represents the specific arrangement of atoms in a chemical compound, in this case a complex organic molecule containing multiple functional groups. The SMILES notation is commonly used in chemical databases and software to efficiently and accurately represent molecular structures in a computer-readable format.",
