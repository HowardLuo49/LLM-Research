In order to determine the SMILES expression of C8H11NO2, we must first draw the chemical structure of the molecule.\n\nC8H11NO2 can be represented as a molecule with 8 carbon atoms, 11 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 2 oxygen atoms. By arranging these atoms in a way that satisfies their valency requirements, we can draw the chemical structure of the molecule, which in this case is 2-phenylacetamide.\n\nThe SMILES expression of 2-phenylacetamide is CC(=O)NC1=CC=CC=C1, where the capital letters represent the atomic symbols of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O), and the lowercase letters represent the connections between the atoms (e.g., single bonds are not explicitly shown). By applying SMILES notation rules, the correct SMILES expression for C8H11NO2, 2-phenylacetamide, can be generated as shown above.",
