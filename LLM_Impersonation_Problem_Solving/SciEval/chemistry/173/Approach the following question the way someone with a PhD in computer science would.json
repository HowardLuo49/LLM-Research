    "gpt_response": "The SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) expression of a chemical compound provides a compact and unambiguous representation of its structure. In the case of C8H11NO2, we can represent this chemical compound using its SMILES notation as CC(C)(C)C1=CC=C(NC(=O)O)C=C1. This notation follows specific rules to encode the connectivity information of the atoms present in the molecule, allowing for easy exchange and manipulation of chemical structure data in computational applications.",
