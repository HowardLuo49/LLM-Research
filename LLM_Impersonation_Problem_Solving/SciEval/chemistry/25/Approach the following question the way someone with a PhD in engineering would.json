    "gpt_response": "The name of the compound CC1CC(C(NC1)C)C can be determined by analyzing its chemical structure. This compound consists of a cycloalkane with a substituted amine group, making it a tertiary amine. The specific naming convention for this compound would involve identifying the longest carbon chain, naming the substituents, and assigning the correct prefix or suffix based on the functional groups present. In this case, the compound would likely be named as a cycloalkyl-substituted tertiary amine. Further analysis of the compound's properties and potential reactions would be necessary to provide a more precise and definitive name.",
