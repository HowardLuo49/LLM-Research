    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression for (E)-N-[(Z)-ethylideneamino]but-1-en-1-amine can be derived through the application of principles of organic chemistry and the rules governing the construction of SMILES notation. This particular compound is a complex organic molecule consisting of multiple functional groups and stereochemical features.\n\nThe first step in determining the SMILES expression is to parse the chemical structure of the compound into its constituent parts, identifying the individual atoms, bonds, and functional groups present. In this case, the compound contains an ethylidene group, an amino group, and a butenamine group, each contributing to the overall structure and properties of the molecule.\n\nNext, the stereochemistry of the compound must be taken into account, particularly the (E) and (Z) configurations of the double bonds present. This information is crucial in accurately representing the spatial arrangement of the atoms in the molecule and ensuring that the resulting SMILES expression is a true reflection of its structure.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the SMILES expression for (E)-N-[(Z)-ethylideneamino]but-1-en-1-amine can be constructed by systematically encoding the connectivity of the atoms, the types of bonds between them, and the stereochemistry of the molecule. This notation serves as a compact and standardized representation of the compound, facilitating its communication and analysis across different platforms and databases in the field of chemistry.\n\nIn conclusion, the determination of the SMILES expression for (E)-N-[(Z)-ethylideneamino]but-1-en-1-amine requires a deep understanding of organic chemistry principles, stereochemical concepts, and the rules governing the construction of SMILES notation. By applying these principles rigorously, a precise and accurate representation of the compound can be obtained, enabling researchers and practitioners to communicate and work with its structure effectively.",
