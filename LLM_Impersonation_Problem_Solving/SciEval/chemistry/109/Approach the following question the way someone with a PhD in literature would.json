    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule is a concise and unique notation representing its structure. In the case of C11H11I, the molecule is clearly composed of 11 carbon atoms, 11 hydrogen atoms, and one iodine atom. \n\nTo determine the SMILES expression, one must first consider the connectivity of atoms in the molecule. This can be achieved by examining the molecular formula and structural characteristics. In this instance, the molecule is likely to have a linear or branched structure due to the presence of both carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\nBy arranging the atoms in a linear fashion, one can generate a SMILES expression that reflects the connectivity of the C11H11I molecule. This notation will illustrate the relationships between atoms in the molecule, highlighting their positions and connections within the molecular framework.\n\nOverall, the SMILES expression of C11H11I will demonstrate the structural composition of the molecule in a concise and easily interpretable format, aiding researchers in understanding its chemical properties and behaviors.",
