    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of atoms in 5-methyl-N-propan-2-ylpyrazin-2-amine, we must first analyze the molecular formula of the compound. The formula indicates the types and quantities of atoms present in the molecule. In this case, the molecular formula for 5-methyl-N-propan-2-ylpyrazin-2-amine is C11H18N4.\n\nFrom the formula, we can determine that there are 11 carbon atoms (C), 18 hydrogen atoms (H), and 4 nitrogen atoms (N) in the molecule. By adding these quantities together, we find that there are:\n\n11 carbon atoms + 18 hydrogen atoms + 4 nitrogen atoms = 33 atoms\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 33 atoms in 5-methyl-N-propan-2-ylpyrazin-2-amine.",
