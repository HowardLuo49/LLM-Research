    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of atoms in 5-methyl-N-propan-2-ylpyrazin-2-amine, we must first analyze the molecular formula of the compound. \n\n5-methyl-N-propan-2-ylpyrazin-2-amine can be broken down into its components: \n- 5-methyl: This indicates a methyl group attached to the 5th carbon atom of the parent molecule.\n- N-propan-2-yl: This indicates a propyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the parent molecule.\n- pyrazin-2-amine: This is the parent molecule with a pyrazin ring structure and an amine functional group attached to the 2nd carbon atom.\n\nBy breaking down the compound in this way, we can calculate the total number of atoms present. Each component contributes a specific number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other atoms to the overall molecule. By adding up the atoms contributed by each component, we can determine the total number of atoms in 5-methyl-N-propan-2-ylpyrazin-2-amine.\n\nBased on the breakdown of the compound and considering the individual atoms contributed by each component, the total number of atoms in 5-methyl-N-propan-2-ylpyrazin-2-amine is:\nAnswer: 26 atoms.",
