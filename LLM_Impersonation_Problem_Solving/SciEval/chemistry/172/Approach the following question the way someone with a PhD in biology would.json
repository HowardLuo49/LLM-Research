The molecule contains a pentane backbone with a nitrogen atom attached to the second carbon (2-amine functional group) and an ethyl group attached to the nitrogen atom. Additionally, there are three methyl groups attached to the third carbon of the pentane backbone. \n\nThe molecular formula of this compound can be written as C11H25N. This is determined by counting the number of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N) atoms present in the molecule. In this case, there are 11 carbon atoms, 25 hydrogen atoms, and 1 nitrogen atom, resulting in the molecular formula of C11H25N.",
