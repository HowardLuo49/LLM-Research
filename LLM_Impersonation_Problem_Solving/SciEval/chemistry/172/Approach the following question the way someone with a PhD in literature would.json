    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (2R)-N-ethyl-N,3,3-trimethylpentan-2-amine is C11H25N. This compound belongs to the class of amines, which are organic compounds containing nitrogen atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms and alkyl groups. In this specific compound, the amine group is located on the second carbon atom of the pentane chain, and the nitrogen atom is attached to an ethyl group and two methyl groups. The stereochemistry is specified as (2R), indicating that the highest priority substituent on the second carbon atom is on the right side of the molecule in a Fischer projection. The molecular formula provides important information about the composition of the compound, allowing for further analysis of its chemical and physical properties.",
