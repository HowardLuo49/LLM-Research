    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule represents its chemical structure in a condensed format using simple text strings. In the case of C4H10N2OS, which represents the molecule 2-amino-3-mercapto-4-methylpentan-1-ol, the SMILES expression would be CC(C)(CSCCN)CO. This string of characters provides a concise representation of the connectivity of atoms in the molecule, allowing for easy sharing and analyzing of structural information.",
