    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C4H10N2OS is CC(C)C(N)(C)S. This molecular structure represents a compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms in a specific arrangement, as determined by the rules of chemical bonding and organic chemistry. This SMILES expression serves as a convenient and compact way to represent the molecular structure of C4H10N2OS for computational analysis and database searching in the field of chemical informatics. This representation allows researchers to quickly and accurately identify and study the compound in question within the context of broader research investigations and scientific inquiries.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response ['C(CNC(=O)N)CS']?: The SMILES expression of C4H10N2OS is CC(C)C(N)(C)S. This molecular structure represents a compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms in a specific arrangement, as determined by the rules of chemical bonding and organic chemistry. This SMILES expression serves as a convenient and compact way to represent the molecular structure of C4H10N2OS for computational analysis and database searching in the field of chemical informatics. This representation allows researchers to quickly and accurately identify and study the compound in question within the context of broader research investigations and scientific inquiries.",
    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No, the final solution obtained is not 'C(CNC(=O)N)CS'. The SMILES expression 'CC(C)C(N)(C)S' represents a different molecular structure with the same chemical composition of C4H10N2OS.",
