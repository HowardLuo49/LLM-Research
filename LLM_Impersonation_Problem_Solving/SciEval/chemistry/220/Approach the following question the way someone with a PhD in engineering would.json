    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one;prop-1-ene can be determined by examining the structure of the compound and identifying each individual atom and the bonds between them. \n\nIn this case, 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one indicates that the molecule consists of a dioxolane ring with a methyl group attached at the 4th position, and a ketone functional group on carbon 2. The prop-1-ene part of the name indicates that there is a propene (C3H6) chain attached to the dioxolane ring at the first carbon. \n\nBy following this information, the molecular formula of this compound can be calculated as C7H12O3, representing the arrangement of 7 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms in the molecule. \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one;prop-1-ene is C7H12O3.",
