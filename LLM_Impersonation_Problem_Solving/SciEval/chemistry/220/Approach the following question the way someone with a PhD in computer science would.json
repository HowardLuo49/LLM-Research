    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one;prop-1-ene can be determined by first identifying the individual components of the compound. In this case, we have a compound containing a 4-methyl group, a 1,3-dioxolan-2-one ring, and a prop-1-ene group. \n\nThe molecular formula will be CxHyOz, where x represents the number of carbon atoms, y represents the number of hydrogen atoms, and z represents the number of oxygen atoms in the compound. By analyzing the structure of the compound and counting the number of each element present, we can determine the molecular formula. The chemical structure will also need to be analyzed to determine any double bonds or other functional groups present in the compound.\n\nThrough a thorough analysis of the structure and composition of 4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one;prop-1-ene, a computer scientist with a PhD in the field would be able to determine the precise molecular formula of the compound.",
