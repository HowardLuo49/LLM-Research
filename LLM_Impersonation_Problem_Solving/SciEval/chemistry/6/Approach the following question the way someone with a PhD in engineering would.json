    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of N-[(E)-3-piperidin-4-ylprop-2-enylidene]methanimidamide can be determined by analyzing the chemical structure of the compound. The compound consists of a piperidine ring attached to a propenylidene group, which is connected to a methanimidamide group. The stereochemistry of the propenylidene group is specified as (E), indicating that the two substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we can break down the compound into its constituent elements and count the number of each type of atom present. The elemental composition of the compound includes carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O). By counting the atoms in the different functional groups and the piperidine ring, we can calculate the molecular formula.\n\nAfter performing the atom count, we find that the molecular formula of N-[(E)-3-piperidin-4-ylprop-2-enylidene]methanimidamide is C14H23N5.",
