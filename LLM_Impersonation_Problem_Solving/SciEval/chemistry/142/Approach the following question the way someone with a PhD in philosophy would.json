These formulas represent the chemical composition of the respective molecules, with each element indicating the number of atoms present in the compound. The nomenclature for sulfanylidene compounds denotes the presence of sulfur atoms in different oxidation states, contributing to the complexity and reactivity of the molecule. Overall, understanding and interpreting molecular formulas require a comprehensive knowledge of chemical principles and the properties inherent to specific elements and compounds.",
