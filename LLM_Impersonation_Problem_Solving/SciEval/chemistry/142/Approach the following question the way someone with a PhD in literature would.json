However, I am certainly capable of addressing this question from a scientific perspective.\n\nThe molecular formula of but-2-yne is C4H6, representing a compound with four carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. Ethane has a formula of C2H6, indicating a compound with two carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. Propane has a formula of C3H8, indicating a compound with three carbon atoms and eight hydrogen atoms.\n\nAs for the compound sulfuranylidyne-(sulfanylidyne-\u03bb4-sulfanylidyne)-\u03bb4-sulfane, the molecular formula is S8. It consists of eight sulfur atoms and exhibits a unique chemical structure.\n\nIn summary, the molecular formulas of the compounds mentioned in the question are as follows: but-2-yne (C4H6), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and sulfuranylidyne-(sulfanylidyne-\u03bb4-sulfanylidyne)-\u03bb4-sulfane (S8).",
