    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of methyl (3S)-3-amino-4-methylhexanoate is C9H19NO2. This compound consists of 9 carbon atoms, 19 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 2 oxygen atoms. It is formed by combining a hexanoate (6-carbon) chain with a methyl group, an amino group, and a carboxyl group. The stereochemistry designation (3S) indicates that the amino group is attached to the third carbon from the carboxyl group in the (S) configuration.",
