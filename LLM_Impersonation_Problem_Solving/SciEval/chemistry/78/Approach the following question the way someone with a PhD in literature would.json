    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of methyl (3S)-3-amino-4-methylhexanoate is C9H19NO2. This compound is a derivative of the amino acid isoleucine, with a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon and an amino group attached to the beta carbon. The presence of an ester group indicates that this compound is an ester of isoleucine, with a methyl group substituting for one of the hydrogen atoms on the carboxyl group. The (3S) configuration indicates that the stereochemistry of the compound is such that the amino group is oriented towards the 3rd carbon of the hexanoate chain.",
