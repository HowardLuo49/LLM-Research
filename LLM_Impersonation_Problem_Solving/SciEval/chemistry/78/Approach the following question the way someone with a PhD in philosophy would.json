    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of methyl (3S)-3-amino-4-methylhexanoate can be determined by first identifying the structural formula of the compound. In this case, we have a 3-amino-4-methylhexanoate group attached to a methyl group at the 3S position. \n\nBreaking down the structural formula, we can identify the components: \n1. The base structure is a hexanoate group (C6H12O2)\n2. Attached to the fourth carbon of the hexanoate group is a methyl group (CH3)\n3. Attached to the third carbon of the hexanoate group is an amino group (NH2)\n\nPutting these components together, we get the molecular formula of methyl (3S)-3-amino-4-methylhexanoate as C8H17NO2.",
