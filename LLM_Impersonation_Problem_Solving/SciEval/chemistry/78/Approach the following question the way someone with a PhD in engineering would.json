    ],
    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of methyl (3S)-3-amino-4-methylhexanoate, we first need to break down the components of the compound. The prefix \"methyl\" indicates a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the main chain. The prefix \"(3S)\" indicates that the amino group is located at the third carbon atom of the main chain and has an S (sinister) configuration in terms of chirality. The compound also contains a 4-methyl group, which is attached to the fourth carbon atom of the main chain. Finally, the main chain consists of a hexanoate group.\n\nBased on this information, we can construct the structural formula of the compound. The main chain contains six carbon atoms, with the amino group attached to the third carbon and a methyl group attached to the fourth carbon. The structure is as follows: \n\nH3C - CH2 - CH(NH2) - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH2 - COOCH3\n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we calculate the total number of atoms in the compound. The molecular formula is C11H23NO2, as there are 11 carbon atoms, 23 hydrogen atoms, one nitrogen atom, and two oxygen atoms present in the compound.",
