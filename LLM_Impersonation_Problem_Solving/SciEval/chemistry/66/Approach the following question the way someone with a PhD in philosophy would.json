    "gpt_response": "143.27 g/mol\n\nIn addressing the question of the molecular weight of C9H21NO, we must first consider the molecular formula itself. C9H21NO is a chemical formula representing a particular molecule composed of 9 carbon atoms, 21 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 oxygen atom.\n\nTo determine the molecular weight of this compound, we must calculate the sum of the atomic weights of each element present in the formula. The atomic weights of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are approximately 12.01 g/mol, 1.01 g/mol, 14.01 g/mol, and 16.00 g/mol, respectively.\n\nBy summing the atomic weights of each element in the formula C9H21NO, we arrive at a molecular weight of approximately 143.27 g/mol. This value represents the mass of one mole of the compound C9H21NO and is a fundamental aspect of understanding its chemical properties and behavior.",
