    "gpt_response": "189.65\n\nAs a philosopher studying at the doctoral level, I see this question as an opportunity to engage with the concept of molecular weight and its relevance to the broader study of chemistry. The molecular weight of a compound, such as C6H11ClN2S, represents the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in a single molecule of that compound. In this case, we must consider the atomic weights of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), chlorine (Cl), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) in the given chemical formula.\n\nBy consulting the periodic table and calculating the atomic weights of each element in C6H11ClN2S, we can determine that the molecular weight of this compound is approximately 189.65 grams per mole. This numerical value serves as a crucial metric in chemical analysis and research, providing important insights into the composition and properties of a given substance. The molecular weight of C6H11ClN2S is therefore a key piece of information for those studying the interactions and behaviors of this particular compound within various chemical systems.",
