    "gpt_response": "In the realm of molecular chemistry, the Canonical SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation is a concise and standardized way to represent the structure of a chemical compound. Therefore, in the context of the compound C10H20N2, the SMILES expression would depict the arrangement of its constituent atoms in a linear format, adhering to specific rules and conventions set forth by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that providing an exact SMILES expression for the compound C10H20N2 requires a detailed examination of its molecular structure, including the spatial arrangement of atoms, bond types, and connectivity. As such, a comprehensive analysis of the compound's chemical bonding and structural features would be necessary in order to generate an accurate SMILES representation.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth mentioning that the development of a precise SMILES expression for a given compound typically involves the use of specialized software tools and algorithms, as well as a thorough understanding of organic chemistry principles. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the molecular characteristics of C10H20N2 is essential in order to determine its correct SMILES notation.",
