    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 3-(2-fluoropropan-2-yl)-5-methylhexan-1-amine can be calculated by adding up the atomic weights of each individual element present in the compound. \n\nThe compound contains:\n- 3 carbon atoms: atomic weight of carbon = 12.01\n- 9 hydrogen atoms: atomic weight of hydrogen = 1.01\n- 1 fluorine atom: atomic weight of fluorine = 18.9984\n- 1 nitrogen atom: atomic weight of nitrogen = 14.01\n- 1 oxygen atom: atomic weight of oxygen = 16.00\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight can be calculated as follows:\n(3 x 12.01) + (9 x 1.01) + 18.9984 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 114.0884\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 3-(2-fluoropropan-2-yl)-5-methylhexan-1-amine is approximately 114.0884 g/mol.",
