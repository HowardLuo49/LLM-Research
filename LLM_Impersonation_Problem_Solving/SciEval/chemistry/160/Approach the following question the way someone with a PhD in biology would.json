    "gpt_response": "The chemical compound C8H16F2N2 is officially named 2-(2,3-Difluorophenyl)ethylamine. This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenethylamines, which are a group of compounds that share a core structure consisting of a phenethylamine backbone, characterized by a phenethylamine group linked to an ethylamine moiety. In this specific compound, the presence of two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring and the ethylamine functional group make it distinct within this class of compounds.",
