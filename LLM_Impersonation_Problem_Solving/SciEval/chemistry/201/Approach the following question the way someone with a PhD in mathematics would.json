    "gpt_response": "The SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation for a chemical compound represents the structure of the molecule in a concise and standardized manner using ASCII characters. \n\nTo determine the SMILES expression of C7H11N3S, we first need to understand the molecular structure of the compound. C7H11N3S corresponds to a molecule with 7 carbon atoms, 11 hydrogen atoms, 3 nitrogen atoms, and 1 sulfur atom.\n\nAnalyzing the connectivity of the atoms in the compound, we can construct the SMILES notation by sequentially listing the atoms and their bonding connections. This involves considering the valency of each atom and representing the bonds and atom symbols accordingly.\n\nAfter applying the rules of SMILES notation and considering the valency constraints of the atoms, the SMILES expression for C7H11N3S would be: C1CCC(CC1)CNC(=N)S\n\nThis notation captures the molecular structure of the compound in a compact and standardized format, facilitating its representation and communication in chemical databases and computational tools.",
