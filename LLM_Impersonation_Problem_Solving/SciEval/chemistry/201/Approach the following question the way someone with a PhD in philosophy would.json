    "gpt_response": "The Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) expression of C7H11N3S can be derived by considering the structural formula of the molecule. By assigning appropriate symbols to represent each atom (C for carbon, H for hydrogen, N for nitrogen, and S for sulfur), as well as utilizing specific characters to denote the connectivity between atoms (e.g. single bonds represented by '-', double bonds by '=', and aromatic bonds by ':'), the SMILES expression for C7H11N3S can be accurately deduced. It is important to note that the depiction of stereochemistry and geometric isomerism should be taken into account in order to fully capture the three-dimensional structure of the molecule within the confines of a two-dimensional representation. Additionally, the use of parentheses and numerical values may be employed to provide a concise and unambiguous depiction of the molecular arrangement.",
