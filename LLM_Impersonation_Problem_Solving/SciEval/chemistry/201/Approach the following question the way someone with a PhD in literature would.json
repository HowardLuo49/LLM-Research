    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a chemical compound represents its molecular structure in a simplified and standardized notation. In the case of C7H11N3S, this compound is likely to be a heterocyclic or aromatic molecule due to the presence of nitrogen and sulfur atoms in its chemical formula. To determine the specific SMILES expression for this compound, one would need to consider the connectivity of the atoms based on their valence and bonding patterns. This may involve drawing the molecular structure, identifying the positions of the atoms, and assigning appropriate symbols for each element. The resulting SMILES expression would provide a concise and unambiguous representation of the compound's structure, facilitating its characterization and comparison with other related molecules in chemical databases or computational studies.",
