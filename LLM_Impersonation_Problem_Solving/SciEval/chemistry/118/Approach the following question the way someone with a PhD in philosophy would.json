    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C9H18N2O is 166.25 g/mol. This is calculated by adding up the atomic weights of each atom in the compound: \nCarbon (C) has a weight of 12.01 g/mol, hydrogen (H) has a weight of 1.008 g/mol, nitrogen (N) has a weight of 14.01 g/mol, and oxygen (O) has a weight of 16 g/mol. \nUsing these values and the formula C9H18N2O, we can calculate the molecular weight as follows: \n9(12.01) + 18(1.008) + 2(14.01) + 16 = 166.25 g/mol.",
