In order to determine the SMILES expression for C8H18O3, we must first identify the structural formula of the molecule.\n\nC8H18O3 is a molecule consisting of 8 carbon (C) atoms, 18 hydrogen (H) atoms, and 3 oxygen (O) atoms. To determine the structure of this molecule, we must consider the possible arrangements of these atoms to form a stable compound.\n\nBased on the given molecular formula, one possible structure for C8H18O3 could be octyltriol, which is a triol compound with an octyl (C8H17) chain attached to three hydroxyl (OH) groups. The SMILES expression for octyltriol would be CCCCCCCC(C)(O)(O)O.\n\nThus, the SMILES expression for C8H18O3, as the molecule octyltriol, would be CCCCCCCC(C)(O)(O)O.",
