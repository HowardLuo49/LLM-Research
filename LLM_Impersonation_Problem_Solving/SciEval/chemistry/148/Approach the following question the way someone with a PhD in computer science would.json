SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a notation system used to represent chemical structures in a concise and standardized way using ASCII strings. In this case, the SMILES expression represents the structural formula of a compound with 8 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms. Each element is represented by its atomic symbol (C for carbon, H for hydrogen, O for oxygen) and bonded atoms are connected by dash \"-\" symbols. The arrangement of atoms and bonds in the SMILES expression accurately reflects the chemical structure of the compound C8H18O3.",
