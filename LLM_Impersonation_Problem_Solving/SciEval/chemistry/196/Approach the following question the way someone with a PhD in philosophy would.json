    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C8H17NOS refers to a simplified molecular-input line-entry system representation of the chemical structure of a compound composed of 8 carbon (C), 17 hydrogen (H), 1 nitrogen (N), 1 oxygen (O), and 1 sulfur (S) atom. In this case, the specific arrangement of these atoms and their connectivity is denoted by a string of characters following a certain syntax established in the SMILES notation system. The SMILES expression serves as a concise and unique identifier for the chemical structure of the compound in question, facilitating its representation and computational analysis in various chemical and biochemical contexts.",
