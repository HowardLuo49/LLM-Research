In the case of C8H14O, which is a compound composed of 8 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom, the SMILES expression would be \"CCCCCCCCO\". This notation captures the connectivity of atoms within the molecule by indicating the arrangement of bonds and atoms in a simplified manner, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of chemical structures in computational chemistry and chemical databases.",
