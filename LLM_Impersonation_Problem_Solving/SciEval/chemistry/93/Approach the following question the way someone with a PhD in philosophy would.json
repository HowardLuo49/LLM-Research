    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C8H14O refers to the simplified molecular-input line-entry system representation of an organic compound consisting of 8 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. In order to provide the exact SMILES expression of C8H14O, one must consider the structural arrangement of these atoms within the molecule, as well as any additional functional groups or isomeric forms that may be present. The SMILES notation offers a concise and standardized way to represent chemical structures, using a linear string of characters based on specific rules and conventions. To determine the precise SMILES expression of C8H14O, a thorough analysis of the compound's structure and connectivity is necessary, in accordance with established principles of organic chemistry and molecular modeling.",
