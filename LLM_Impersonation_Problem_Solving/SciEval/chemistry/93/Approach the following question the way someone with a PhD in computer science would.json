    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule represents its simplified molecular structure in a line notation format. In this case, the SMILES expression of C8H14O would be CC(C)C(C)CC(C)O. This notation conveys the connectivity of atoms in the molecule, with each element represented by its atomic symbol and the bonds between atoms indicated by the characters in the string. The SMILES expression is widely used in computational chemistry for the representation of chemical structures in a compact and easily interpretable format.",
