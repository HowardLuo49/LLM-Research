To determine the SMILES expression of C8H14O, we first need to consider the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. \n\nThe molecular formula C8H14O suggests that the molecule contains 8 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. Based on this information, we can infer the possible structure of the molecule by considering chemical bonding rules. \n\nThe most likely structure for a C8H14O molecule is 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, which consists of a chain of six carbon atoms with a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to the second carbon atom, and a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the sixth carbon atom. \n\nTherefore, the SMILES expression of C8H14O would be \"CC(CCC(C)O)C\". This notation represents the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule, with each letter representing a specific atom and the bonds between them.",
