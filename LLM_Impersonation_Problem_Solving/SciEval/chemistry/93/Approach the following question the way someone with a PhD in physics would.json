    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule is a linear string notation that represents the structure of the molecule in a unique and concise way. In the case of C8H14O, we can determine the SMILES expression by considering the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule.\n\nTo determine the SMILES expression of C8H14O, we first need to determine the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. From the chemical formula C8H14O, we can infer that the molecule contains 8 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom.\n\nBy considering the molecular structure and bond connectivity of the atoms, we can determine the SMILES expression of C8H14O. The SMILES expression for the molecule would be:\n\nCC(=O)CCCCCCC\n\nThis notation represents the structure of the molecule C8H14O in a concise and unique way, allowing for easy identification and comparison of molecular structures.",
