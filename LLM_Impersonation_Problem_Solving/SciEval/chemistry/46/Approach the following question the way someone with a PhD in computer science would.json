In this case, the SMILES expression would be as follows: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)O. This string of characters uses the SMILES notation to represent the atoms and bonds present in the molecule, with each letter or symbol corresponding to a specific element or type of bond. This notation is widely used in computational chemistry and allows for easy sharing and manipulation of chemical structures in computer programs.",
