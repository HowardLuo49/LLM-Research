SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation is a concise notation used to represent chemical structures in a manner that is both human-readable and can be used by computer programs for processing chemical information. In this notation, each atom is represented by a unique symbol and its connectivity is represented by bonds between these symbols. In the case of N-formyl-N-methylcyclopropanecarboxamide, the notation reflects the specific arrangement of atoms and bonds in the molecule, allowing for its accurate representation and communication in chemical databases and software tools.",
