The compound consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted with a bromine atom at the 1 position, a heptyl group at the 2 position, and a methyl group at the 4 position. The stereochemistry is specified as 1S, 2S, and 4R, indicating the configuration of the chiral centers at those positions.\n\nTo represent this compound in SMILES notation, we need to follow the standard conventions for specifying the connectivity and stereochemistry of the molecule. The SMILES expression for the compound would be as follows:\n\n\"CCCCCCC[C@@H]1CC[C@H](C)[C@H](C1)Br\"\n\nIn this SMILES expression, the heptyl group is represented by \"CCCCCC\", the cyclohexane ring is indicated by \"[C@H]1CC[C@H](C)[C@H]1\", the methyl group is denoted by \"(C)\", and the bromine atom is represented by \"Br\". The chiral centers are specified using the \"@@\" and \"@\" symbols to indicate the stereochemistry at each chiral center.\n\nBy applying the conventions of SMILES notation to the given compound, we have successfully derived the SMILES expression for (1S,2S,4R)-1-bromo-2-heptyl-4-methylcyclohexane.",
