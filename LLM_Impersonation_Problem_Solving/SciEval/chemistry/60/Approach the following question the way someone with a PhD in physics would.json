    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of pyrrolidin-2-ylboronic acid can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of each atom in the molecule. \n\nThe molecular formula for pyrrolidin-2-ylboronic acid is C\u2085H\u2081\u2081BN0\u2082. The atomic weights of each element are:\n- Carbon (C) = 12.01\n- Hydrogen (H) = 1.008\n- Boron (B) = 10.81\n- Nitrogen (N) = 14.01\n- Oxygen (O) = 16.00\n\nUsing these atomic weights, the molecular weight of pyrrolidin-2-ylboronic acid can be calculated as follows:\n\n(5 x 12.01) + (11 x 1.008) + 10.81 + 14.01 + (2 x 16.00) = 121.19\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of pyrrolidin-2-ylboronic acid is 121.19 g/mol.",
