Determine the molecular formula: C4H12O4 represents a molecule containing 4 carbon atoms (C), 12 hydrogen atoms (H), and 4 oxygen atoms (O).\n\n2. Calculate the total number of atoms: By adding the number of each type of atom together, we find that there are 4 + 12 + 4 = 20 atoms in C4H12O4.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 20 atoms in one molecule of C4H12O4.",
