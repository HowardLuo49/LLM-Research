This representation of the molecular structure using simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) notation allows for a concise and standardized way to describe chemical compounds, facilitating computational analysis and database searches within the field of chemical informatics and literature analysis. In this case, the SMILES expression conveys the specific arrangement of atoms in the molecule, highlighting the presence of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms and their connectivity within the compound.",
