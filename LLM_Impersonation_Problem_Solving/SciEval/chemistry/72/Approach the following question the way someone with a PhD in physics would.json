    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine is 160.3 g/mol. \n\nExplanation: \nTo calculate the molecular weight of a compound, we need to determine the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. \n\n1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine has the following chemical formula: C8H20N4\n\nThe atomic weights of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N) are approximately 12, 1, and 14 g/mol, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine can be calculated as follows:\n\n(8 x 12) + (20 x 1) + (4 x 14) = 96 + 20 + 56 = 172 g/mol\n\nHowever, the compound also contains a double bond, which reduces the molecular weight by 2 g/mol.\n\nTherefore, the final molecular weight of 1,1,2,3-tetraethylguanidine is 172 - 2 = 160.3 g/mol.",
