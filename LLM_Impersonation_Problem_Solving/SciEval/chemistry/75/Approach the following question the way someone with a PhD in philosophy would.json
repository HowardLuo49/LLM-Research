This is represented by the primary structure CC(OS. Moving outward from this central structure, we encounter a sulfate group (OS(=O)), with the sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, one of which is double-bonded, and the other bonded to a carbon atom (C) and a sulfur atom (S) on each side. This gives rise to the full structure of the molecule, CC(OS(=O)C(C)S)S.\n\nThus, the molecular formula of CC(OS(=O)C(C)S)S can be simplified as C3H8O2S2, indicating the presence of three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, two oxygen atoms, and two sulfur atoms in the molecule.",
