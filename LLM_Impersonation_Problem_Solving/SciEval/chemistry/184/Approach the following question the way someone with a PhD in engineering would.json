In this case, there are 8 carbon atoms (C8), 12 hydrogen atoms (H12), and 2 oxygen atoms (O2).\n\nTo find the total number of atoms in the compound C8H12O2, we sum up the individual atoms:\n8 (C) + 12 (H) + 2 (O) = 22 atoms of each element\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in C8H12O2 is:\n8 x 1 (C) + 12 x 1 (H) + 2 x 1 (O) = 8 + 12 + 2 = 22 x 2 = 40 atoms",
