    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one, we must first understand the structure of the compound. \n\nThe compound is a bicyclic structure with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom (azabicyclo) and a three-membered ring (cyclopropane) fused together. The nitrogen atom is attached to a propyl group (three carbon atoms in a chain) at the carbon 6 position. Additionally, there is a ketone functional group at carbon 2 of the six-membered ring.\n\nThe molecular formula indicates the types and numbers of atoms present in a molecule. To determine the molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one, we need to count the total number of each type of atom in the compound based on its structure:\n\n- Carbon (C): 6 carbons in the six-membered ring + 1 carbon in the propyl group = 7 carbons\n- Hydrogen (H): Calculate the number of hydrogen atoms based on the typical valency of each carbon atom (4 bonds for carbon, 1 for hydrogen) and the ketone functional group, where the oxygen is double bonded to carbon and single bonded to two hydrogens\n- Nitrogen (N): 1 nitrogen atom in the azabicyclo ring\n- Oxygen (O): 1 oxygen atom in the ketone group\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one is C7H13NO.",
