    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one can be deduced by breaking down the name of the compound. The prefix \"6-propyl\" indicates that there is a propyl group attached to the sixth carbon atom. The term \"6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan\" suggests a bicyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring system. Finally, the suffix \"-2-one\" indicates the presence of a ketone functional group on the second carbon atom.\n\nBased on this information, the molecular formula of the compound can be determined as C9H15NO. This formula accounts for the propyl group, the bicyclic ring system, and the ketone functional group. Further analysis of the structure and connectivity of the atoms in the compound would be necessary to confirm this molecular formula.",
