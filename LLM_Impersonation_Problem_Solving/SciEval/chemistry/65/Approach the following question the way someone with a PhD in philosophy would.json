    ],
    "gpt_response": "In order to deduce the molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one, one must first understand the structural and nomenclatural conventions of organic chemistry. The compound in question is a bicyclic system with a cyclopropane ring fused to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically an azetidine. Furthermore, a ketonic functional group is positioned at the second carbon atom of the heterocycle.\n\nTo arrive at the molecular formula, one must analyze the constituent atoms present in the compound. The prefix \"6-propyl\" denotes the presence of a propyl (C3H7) substituent attached to the sixth carbon atom of the bicyclic system. In addition, the term \"azabicyclo[3.1.0]\" specifies the nature and connectivity of the rings within the compound, where the azabicyclo prefix indicates the nitrogen-containing heterocycle and the numbers within brackets signify the ring sizes and fusion points.\n\nConsidering all these components, one can discern the molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one as C10H17NO, encompassing the requisite number of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms present in the compound. This analytical approach emphasizes the systematic analysis of chemical nomenclature and structure to elucidate the molecular formula of complex organic molecules.",
