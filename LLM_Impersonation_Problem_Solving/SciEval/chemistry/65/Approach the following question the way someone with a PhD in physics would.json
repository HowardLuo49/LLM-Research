    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one can be deduced by breaking down the systematic name of the compound. The prefix \"6-propyl\" indicates a six-carbon alkyl group attached to the molecule, the \"6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]\" specifies the structural arrangement of the ring system, and the suffix \"-2-one\" indicates the presence of a ketone functional group at the second carbon atom.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine that the molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one is C9H15NO. This molecular formula represents the arrangement of nine carbon atoms, fifteen hydrogen atoms, and one nitrogen atom in the compound.",
