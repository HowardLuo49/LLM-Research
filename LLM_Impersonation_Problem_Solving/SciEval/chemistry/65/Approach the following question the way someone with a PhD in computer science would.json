    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one can be determined by first analyzing the structure of the compound. \n\nIn this compound, the prefix 6-propyl indicates that there is a propyl group attached to the sixth carbon atom of the ring. The prefix 6-azabicyclo[3.1.0] indicates that the compound is a bicyclic molecule with a nitrogen atom in the ring system. The suffix -2-one indicates that there is a ketone functional group attached to the second carbon atom of the ring.\n\nBy considering all of this information, we can construct the molecular formula of the compound. The molecular formula of 6-propyl-6-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one would be C9H15NO.",
