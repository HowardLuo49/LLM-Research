    "gpt_response": "The number of atoms in the given molecular formula, COCC(CCN1CC(C1=O)N)O, can be determined by examining the individual elements and their subscripts within the formula. By counting the number of each element represented and summing them, we can ascertain the total number of atoms in the molecule. \n\nIn this instance, we have 5 carbon atoms, 8 oxygen atoms, 3 nitrogen atoms, and 5 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the total number of atoms present in the given molecular formula is 21.",
