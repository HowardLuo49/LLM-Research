    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C(#N)SNC(=NN)N is 120.09 g/mol.\n\nExplanation: To calculate the molecular weight, we need to add up the atomic weights of each element in the molecule. The atomic weights of the elements are as follows:\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n- Sulfur (S): 32.06 g/mol\n\nNow we calculate the total molecular weight:\nC: 1 atom * 12.01 g/mol = 12.01 g/mol\nN: 4 atoms * 14.01 g/mol = 56.04 g/mol\nS: 1 atom * 32.06 g/mol = 32.06 g/mol\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n12.01 + 56.04 + 32.06 = 100.11 g/mol\n\nHowever, we also need to account for the triple bond between the carbon and nitrogen atoms (#N), which adds an extra nitrogen atom to the molecule. Hence, we need to add the atomic weight of nitrogen again:\nN: 1 atom * 14.01 g/mol = 14.01 g/mol\n\nAdding this extra nitrogen atom to the total molecular weight, we get:\n100.11 + 14.01 = 114.12 g/mol\n\nFinally, we need to account for the double bond between the carbon and nitrogen atoms (=NN), which adds an extra nitrogen atom to the molecule. Hence, we need to add the atomic weight of nitrogen again:\nN: 1 atom * 14.01 g/mol = 14.01 g/mol\n\nAdding this extra nitrogen atom to the total molecular weight, we get:\n114.12 + 14.01 = 128.13 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C(#N)SNC(=NN)N is 128.13 g/mol.",
