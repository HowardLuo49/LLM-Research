    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula C8H17NO2 represents a compound known as leucine, which is an essential amino acid. In order to determine the number of atoms present in this compound, we must consider the number of atoms for each element within the formula:\n\n- Carbon (C): 8 atoms\n- Hydrogen (H): 17 atoms\n- Nitrogen (N): 1 atom\n- Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in C8H17NO2 is calculated as follows:\n8 (C) + 17 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 28 atoms\n\nSo, there are a total of 28 atoms in one molecule of C8H17NO2.",
