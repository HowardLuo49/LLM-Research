    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of methyl 4-amino-3-(propan-2-ylamino)butanoate can be systematically derived by representing the molecular structure in a linear notation format that encodes the atoms, bonds, and connectivity of the compound. In this case, we first identify the parent structure, which is butanoic acid, and then proceed to add the substituents in a systematic manner following the rules of SMILES notation.\n\nIn the given compound, methyl is the first substituent, denoted as 'C' for carbon with 'C' for the attached methyl group. The next substituent is 4-amino, which is represented as 'N' for nitrogen with 'CCC' for the attached propyl chain and 'N' for the amino group. The final substituent is propan-2-ylamino, indicated by 'CCC' for the attached propyl chain and 'N' for the amino group.\n\nCombining all these components in a linear notation format, the SMILES expression for methyl 4-amino-3-(propan-2-ylamino)butanoate is 'CC(N)C(C)CC(=O)OC'. This representation captures the molecular structure of the compound in a concise and standardized manner, facilitating computational analysis and comparison with other chemical compounds.",
