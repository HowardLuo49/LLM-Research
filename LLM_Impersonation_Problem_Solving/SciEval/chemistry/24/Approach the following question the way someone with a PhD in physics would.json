    "gpt_response": "There are 19 atoms in C(CCl)C(CCCl)O. \n\nExplanation:\n- The molecule contains one carbon atom in each of the three carbon chains and one carbon atom in the carbonyl group, totaling 4 carbon atoms.\n- There are 4 chlorine atoms attached to the carbon atoms in the chains, bringing the total number of chlorine atoms to 4.\n- Finally, there is one oxygen atom in the carbonyl group.\n- Adding all of these together, 4 (C) + 4 (Cl) + 1 (O) = 9 atoms in each chain. There are 2 chains in the molecule, so 9 * 2 = 18 atoms from the carbon chains and the oxygen atom.\n- Additionally, there is one carbon atom in the middle of the molecule that is not part of the chains, bringing the total to 18 + 1 = 19 atoms in C(CCl)C(CCCl)O.",
