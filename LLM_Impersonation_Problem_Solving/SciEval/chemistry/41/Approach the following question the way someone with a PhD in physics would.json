    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCCCC(C#N)N is C6H5N. This can be determined by counting the total number of atoms of each element in the compound and simplifying the ratio to its simplest form. In this case, there are 6 carbon atoms, 5 hydrogen atoms, and 1 nitrogen atom, leading to the molecular formula C6H5N.",
