    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCCCC(C#N)N can be analyzed using principles of organic chemistry and molecular structure. The CCCCC on the left side of the compound indicates that there are five carbon atoms connected in a linear chain. The (C#N) represents a nitrile group, with one carbon atom triple-bonded to a nitrogen atom. Finally, the N on the right side of the compound is a single nitrogen atom.\n\nBy counting the number of atoms in the compound, we can determine the molecular formula: C5(CN)N, where there are a total of seven carbon atoms and two nitrogen atoms.",
