    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCCCC(C#N)N is C7H5N. This can be determined by breaking down the compound into its elemental components - carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) - and counting the number of each atom present in the compound. In this case, there are 7 carbon atoms, 5 hydrogen atoms, and 1 nitrogen atom, leading to the molecular formula C7H5N.",
