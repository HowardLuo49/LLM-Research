    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate, we must first understand the structure of the compound. The compound contains a 4-ethenoxybutyl group attached to a formate group. \n\nThe 4-ethenoxybutyl group consists of a four-carbon chain with an ethenoxy group attached at the 4th carbon. The ethenoxy group contains a double bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms. \n\nThe formate group consists of a carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to another oxygen atom.\n\nBy combining these two groups, we can determine the molecular formula of the compound as C9H16O3.",
