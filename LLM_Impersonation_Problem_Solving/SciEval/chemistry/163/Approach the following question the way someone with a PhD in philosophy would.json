    ],
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate, we must first establish the structural formula of the compound. The compound is named based on its components: \"4\" refers to the position of the ethenoxy group on the butyl chain, \"ethenoxy\" denotes the presence of an ethenyl group bonded to an oxygen atom, \"butyl\" indicates a four-carbon alkyl chain, and \"formate\" specifies the formate functional group (HCOO-).\n\nBy analyzing the components of the name, we can deduce that the structural formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate is C7H12O3. This molecular formula reflects the arrangement of atoms within the compound, including seven carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, and three oxygen atoms. Therefore, the molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate can be elucidated as C7H12O3.",
