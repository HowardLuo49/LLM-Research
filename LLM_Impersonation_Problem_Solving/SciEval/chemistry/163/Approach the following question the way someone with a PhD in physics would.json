    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate, we need to first understand the structure of the compound. The prefix \"4-ethenoxy\" indicates that there is an ethenoxy group (C2H3O) attached at the 4th carbon atom in the butyl chain. The suffix \"-butyl\" indicates that the main carbon chain contains four carbon atoms. Finally, the suffix \"-formate\" indicates that there is a formate group (HCOO) attached to the rest of the molecule.\n\nTaking this information into consideration, we can construct the molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate as C6H11O2. This can be obtained by combining the molecular formulas of the butyl chain (C4H9), the ethenoxy group (C2H3O), and the formate group (HCOO).\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate is C6H11O2.",
