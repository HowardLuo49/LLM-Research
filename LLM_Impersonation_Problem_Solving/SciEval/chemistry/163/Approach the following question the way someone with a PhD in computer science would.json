    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate is C8H14O3. \n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we first need to identify the parent chain which contains the functional group of interest (in this case, the ethenoxybutyl group). The parent chain in this molecule is an 8-carbon chain with a double bond (representing the ethenoxy group) at the fourth carbon position and an ethoxy group attached to the fourth carbon. \n\nThe molecular formula is then determined by counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in the parent chain and adding the atoms from the functional groups. In this case, we have 8 carbon atoms, 14 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms, resulting in the molecular formula C8H14O3.",
