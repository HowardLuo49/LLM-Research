    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate can be determined by analyzing the structure of the compound. In this case, the compound consists of a 4-ethenoxybutyl group attached to a formate moiety. \n\nThe 4-ethenoxybutyl group consists of a butyl chain with an ethenoxy (or ethenyl ether) substituent at the 4th carbon atom. The formate moiety consists of a carboxylate group attached to a methylene group. \n\nBy combining the structural elements of 4-ethenoxybutyl and formate, the molecular formula can be determined as C\u2081\u2080H\u2081\u2088O\u2083. This formula accounts for the number of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms present in the compound. \n\nFurthermore, the molecular formula indicates the ratios of different elements in the compound and is important for characterizing the chemical composition and properties of 4-ethenoxybutyl formate.",
