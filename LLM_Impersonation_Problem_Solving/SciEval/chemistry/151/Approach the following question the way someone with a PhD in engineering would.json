    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 2,2-difluoro-2-(oxan-2-yl)ethanamine can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. \n\nThe molecular formula of 2,2-difluoro-2-(oxan-2-yl)ethanamine is C6H11F2NO. \n\nThe atomic weights of each element are as follows:\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n- Fluorine (F): 19.00 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nThus, the molecular weight of 2,2-difluoro-2-(oxan-2-yl)ethanamine is calculated as:\n(6 x 12.01) + (11 x 1.01) + (2 x 19.00) + 14.01 +16.00 = 146.14 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 2,2-difluoro-2-(oxan-2-yl)ethanamine is 146.14 g/mol.",
