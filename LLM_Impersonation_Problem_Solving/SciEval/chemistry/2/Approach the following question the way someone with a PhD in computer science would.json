    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (2R,5S)-5-ethyl-2-methylnonanal is C12H24O. This compound belongs to the class of aldehydes and is specifically a branched alkyl aldehyde with an ethyl group at the fifth carbon and a methyl group at the second carbon. The compound is optically active due to the presence of chiral centers at carbons 2 and 5, which are labeled as R and S configurations, respectively. The combined structural arrangement of the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in the compound results in the molecular formula C12H24O.",
