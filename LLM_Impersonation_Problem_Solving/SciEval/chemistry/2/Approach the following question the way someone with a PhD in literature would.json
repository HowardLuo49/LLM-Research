    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (2R,5S)-5-ethyl-2-methylnonanal can be determined by examining the structural formula of the compound. In this case, the compound consists of a nonane backbone with a methyl group attached to the second carbon and an ethyl group attached to the fifth carbon. Additionally, the compound is a ketone with an aldehyde functional group, as indicated by the presence of the aldehyde moiety on the second carbon. Based on this information, the molecular formula of (2R,5S)-5-ethyl-2-methylnonanal can be determined to be C13H26O.",
