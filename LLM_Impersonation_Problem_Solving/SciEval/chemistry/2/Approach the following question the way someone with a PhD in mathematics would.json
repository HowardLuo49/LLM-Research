    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of (2R,5S)-5-ethyl-2-methylnonanal, we first need to identify the structure of the compound based on the provided systematic nomenclature. The prefix \"(2R,5S)\" indicates the stereochemistry at the second and fifth carbon atoms, while the main part of the name indicates the substituents and carbon chain length.\n\nBy breaking down the systematic name, we can see that the compound consists of a nine-carbon chain with a methyl group attached to the second carbon (2-methyl) and an ethyl group attached to the fifth carbon (5-ethyl). The carbonyl group is located at the end of the carbon chain, indicating that the compound is an aldehyde.\n\nBased on this structural information, the molecular formula of (2R,5S)-5-ethyl-2-methylnonanal can be determined as C11H22O. This is because the compound contains 11 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.",
