    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the elements present in the compound. \n\n2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane contains the following atoms:\n- Carbon (C) - 10 atoms\n- Hydrogen (H) - 21 atoms\n- Oxygen (O) - 1 atom\n- Bromine (Br) - 1 atom\n\nThe atomic weights of these elements are:\n- Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol\n- Bromine (Br) = 79.90 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane is calculated as follows:\n\n(10 * 12.01) + (21 * 1.008) + (1 * 16.00) + (1 * 79.90) =  234.31 g/mol\n\nSo, the molecular weight of 2-(4-bromobutoxy)pentane is 234.31 g/mol.",
