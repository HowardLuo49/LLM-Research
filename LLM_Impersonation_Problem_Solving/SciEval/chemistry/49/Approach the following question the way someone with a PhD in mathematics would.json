    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C1CC(SC1)C(CN)(F)F is 307.35 g/mol.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the molecular weight of a compound, we first calculate the atomic weight of each element present in the compound. \n\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of 12.01 g/mol \n- Sulfur (S) has an atomic weight of 32.06 g/mol \n- Nitrogen (N) has an atomic weight of 14.01 g/mol \n- Fluorine (F) has an atomic weight of 19.00 g/mol \n\nUsing the formula C1CC(SC1)C(CN)(F)F, we can determine the number of each element in the compound:\n\n- Carbon: 1 (from C1) + 1 (from SC1) + 1 (from C(CN)) = 3 \n- Sulfur: 1 \n- Nitrogen: 1 \n- Fluorine: 2 \n\nNow, we calculate the total molecular weight by multiplying the number of each element by its atomic weight and adding them together:\n\n(3 x 12.01) + (1 x 32.06) + (1 x 14.01) + (2 x 19.00) = 36.03 + 32.06 + 14.01 + 38.00 = 307.35 g/mol \n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C1CC(SC1)C(CN)(F)F is 307.35 g/mol.",
