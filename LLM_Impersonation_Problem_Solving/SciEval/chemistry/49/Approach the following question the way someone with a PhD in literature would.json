    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C1CC(SC1)C(CN)(F)F can be calculated by adding up the atomic weights of each element present in the molecule. The atomic weights of carbon (C), sulfur (S), nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) are 12.01, 32.07, 14.01, and 19.00 grams per mole, respectively.\n\nFirst, we will determine the number of each element in the molecule:\n- Carbon: 4\n- Sulfur: 1\n- Nitrogen: 1\n- Fluorine: 2\n\nNext, we will calculate the total molecular weight by multiplying the number of each element by their respective atomic weights and adding them together:\n(4 x 12.01) + (1 x 32.07) + (1 x 14.01) + (2 x 19.00) = 48.04 + 32.07 + 14.01 + 38.00 = 132.12 grams per mole\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C1CC(SC1)C(CN)(F)F is 132.12 g/mol.",
