    "gpt_response": "249.16 g/mol\n\nExplanation:\nTo calculate the molecular weight of C9H10BrNS, we first need to determine the atomic weights of each element present in the compound:\n\nC (Carbon) = 12.01 g/mol\nH (Hydrogen) = 1.01 g/mol\nBr (Bromine) = 79.90 g/mol\nN (Nitrogen) = 14.01 g/mol\nS (Sulfur) = 32.07 g/mol\n\nNext, we multiply the number of each element by its respective atomic weight and add them together:\n\n(9 x 12.01) + (10 x 1.01) + 79.90 + 14.01 + 32.07 = 216.09 + 10.10 + 79.90 + 14.01 + 32.07 = 352.17 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C9H10BrNS is 249.16 g/mol.",
