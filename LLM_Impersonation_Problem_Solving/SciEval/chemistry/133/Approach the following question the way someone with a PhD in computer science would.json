In this case, the molecular weight of C7H13N3 is calculated as follows:\n\n- The atomic weight of carbon (C) is 12.01 grams/mole\n- The atomic weight of hydrogen (H) is 1.008 grams/mole\n- The atomic weight of nitrogen (N) is 14.01 grams/mole\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C7H13N3 is calculated as: \n(7 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.008) + (3 * 14.01) = 147.2 grams/mole.",
