    "gpt_response": "285.49 g/mol\n\nTo determine the molecular weight of CCN(CCC#CC)C1CCNC1, we first need to calculate the molecular weight of each individual element in the compound. Taking into account the molecular weights of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and hydrogen (H), we can calculate the total molecular weight of the compound by adding up the individual molecular weights of each element present in the compound.\n\nCCN(CCC#CC)C1CCNC1 consists of 16 carbon atoms, 2 nitrogen atoms, and 26 hydrogen atoms. Using the atomic weights of carbon (12.01 g/mol), nitrogen (14.01 g/mol), and hydrogen (1.01 g/mol), we can calculate the total molecular weight as follows:\n\n16(12.01) + 2(14.01) + 26(1.01) = 285.49 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of CCN(CCC#CC)C1CCNC1 is 285.49 g/mol.",
