    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of CCN(CCC#CC)C1CCNC1 can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. CCN(CCC#CC)C1CCNC1 contains the following atoms:\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of 12.011 g/mol.\n- Nitrogen (N) has an atomic weight of 14.007 g/mol.\n- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of 1.008 g/mol.\n\nBy counting the number of each atom in the molecule and multiplying by their respective atomic weights, we can calculate the molecular weight as follows:\n(4 x 12.011)  + (2 x 14.007) + (10 x 1.008) = 66.054 + 28.014 + 10.08 = 104.148 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of CCN(CCC#CC)C1CCNC1 is 104.148 g/mol.",
