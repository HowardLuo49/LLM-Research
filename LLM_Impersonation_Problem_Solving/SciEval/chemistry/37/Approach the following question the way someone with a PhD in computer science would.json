    ],
    "gpt_response": "206.33\n\nExplanation: \n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of a compound, we need to add up the atomic weights of each atom in the compound. The molecular weight of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01, the molecular weight of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008, and the molecular weight of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00.\n\nTherefore, to find the molecular weight of C12H26O4, we can calculate as follows:\n12(C) + 26(H) + 4(O) = 12.01*12 + 1.008*26 + 16.00*4 = 144.12 + 26.208 + 64.00 = 206.33\n\nHence, the molecular weight of C12H26O4 is approximately 206.33.",
