Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane is a bicyclic compound with a total of 9 carbon atoms (4 in the smaller ring, 5 in the larger ring).\n\n3. Combining all the elements from step 1 and step 2, we have the following atoms in 2-but-2-en-2-yl-9-phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane:\n- 2 Carbon atoms (from the alkene group)\n- 9 Carbon atoms (from the bicyclic structure)\n- 9 Hydrogen atoms (from the bicyclic structure)\n- 8 Hydrogen atoms (from the alkene group)\n- 1 Phosphorus atom\n\n4.
