In this case, the compound consists of 13 carbon atoms, 27 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 oxygen atom.\n\nIn the Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) notation, each element is represented by its atomic symbol. Carbon atoms are typically represented by \"C\", hydrogen atoms by \"H\", nitrogen atoms by \"N\", and oxygen atoms by \"O\". The connectivity between atoms is denoted by using bonds - single bonds are represented by \"-\", double bonds by \"=\", and triple bonds by \"#\".\n\nTherefore, the SMILES expression for C13H27NO would be: CC(C)CCC(C)C(N)O",
