    "gpt_response": "The name of the chemical compound C9H17NO2S is L-cysteine. L-cysteine is a non-essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including protein synthesis and antioxidant defense mechanisms in living organisms. Its chemical structure consists of a thiol group (-SH) attached to the beta carbon of the amino acid, which provides its unique properties and functions in biological systems. As a researcher with expertise in literature, it is essential to understand the chemical nomenclature and structures of compounds like L-cysteine to aid in the interpretation and analysis of scientific texts and research findings that may involve their usage or significance in literature and literary criticism.",
