    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CN1N=C(N=N1)CC(CO)CO can be analyzed using principles of organic chemistry and structural formula interpretation. Through identifying the functional groups present and the connectivity of atoms in the molecule, one can determine the molecular formula. In this case, the molecule contains carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms, along with double bonds and a cyclic structure. By carefully examining the structure and counting the number of each type of atom present, the molecular formula can be derived as C8H14N2O3.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response ['C6H12N4O2']?: The molecular formula of CN1N=C(N=N1)CC(CO)CO can be analyzed using principles of organic chemistry and structural formula interpretation. Through identifying the functional groups present and the connectivity of atoms in the molecule, one can determine the molecular formula. In this case, the molecule contains carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms, along with double bonds and a cyclic structure.
