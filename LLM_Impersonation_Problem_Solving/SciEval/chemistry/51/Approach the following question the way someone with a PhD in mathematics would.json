    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CN1N=C(N=N1)CC(CO)CO can be determined by examining the compound's structural formula. In this case, the compound contains carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms. By counting the number of each atom in the compound and simplifying the ratios, the molecular formula can be determined. In this case, the molecular formula is C7N3O2.",
