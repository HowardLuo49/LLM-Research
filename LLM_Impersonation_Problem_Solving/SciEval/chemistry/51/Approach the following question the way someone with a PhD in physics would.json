In this case, we can see that the molecule contains carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms.\n\nBy counting the number of each type of atom in the molecular formula, we can determine the molecular formula of CN1N=C(N=N1)CC(CO)CO. Based on the structure of the molecule, we can determine that there are 5 carbon atoms (C), 4 nitrogen atoms (N), and 4 oxygen atoms (O) present in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of CN1N=C(N=N1)CC(CO)CO is C5N4O4.",
