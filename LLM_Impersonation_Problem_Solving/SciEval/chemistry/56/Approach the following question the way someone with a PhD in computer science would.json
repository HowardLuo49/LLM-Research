    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a chemical compound provides a compact textual representation of its structure. In the case of C8H14N2O2, the SMILES expression would be CC(C)(C)C(CC(C)C)N(C)C(=O)O. This notation captures the connectivity of atoms in the molecule, representing carbons (C), hydrogens (H), nitrogens (N), and oxygens (O) in the specified ratios. SMILES expressions are widely used in computational chemistry for tasks such as chemical database searching, virtual screening, and chemical similarity analysis.",
