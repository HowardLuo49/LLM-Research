    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C8H14N2O2, also known as L-Carnitine, is CC(C)CC([NH3+])C(=O)[O-]. It is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in fatty acid metabolism and is essential for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production. Its structure is characterized by a central carbon atom bound to three methyl groups, a primary amine group, and a carboxylic acid moiety. SMILES notation provides a concise and standardized representation of molecular structures for use in computer databases and software algorithms.",
