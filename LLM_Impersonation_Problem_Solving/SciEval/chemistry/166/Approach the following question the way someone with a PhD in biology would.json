    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 1-(3-aminocyclobutyl)oxy-3-ethoxypropan-2-ol is 207.27 g/mol. \n\nTo calculate this, we first need to determine the molecular formula of the compound. By breaking down the compound name:\n\n- The cyclobutyl group has a molecular weight of 67.09 g/mol (4 carbon atoms and 1 nitrogen atom).\n- The ethoxy group has a molecular weight of 60.06 g/mol (2 oxygen atoms, 2 carbon atoms, and 1 hydrogen atom).\n- The propan-2-ol group has a molecular weight of 74.12 g/mol (3 carbon atoms, 1 oxygen atom, and 1 hydrogen atom).\n- The amine group has a molecular weight of 17.03 g/mol (1 nitrogen atom and 3 hydrogen atoms).\n\nAdding all these atomic weights together, we get 67.09 + 60.06 + 74.12 + 17.03 = 218.3 g/mol. However, we need to account for the fact that one oxygen atom is lost during the formation of the ether linkage between the cyclobutyl group and the ethoxy group, resulting in a molecular weight decrease of 1(16.00 g/mol).\n\nTherefore, the final molecular weight of 1-(3-aminocyclobutyl)oxy-3-ethoxypropan-2-ol is 218.3 - 16.00 = 207.27 g/mol.",
