    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule is a linear notation used to represent its chemical structure in a simple and concise manner. In the case of C9H17N, the SMILES expression would be \"CCNCCCCCCN,\" representing a chain of nine carbon atoms with one nitrogen atom and 17 hydrogen atoms. This notation provides a valuable tool for communication and representation in the field of computational chemistry and chemical informatics.",
