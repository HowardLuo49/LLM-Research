    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule represents its structure in a linear and text-based format. In order to determine the SMILES expression of C9H17N, we first need to identify the structural formula of the molecule. \n\nC9H17N represents a molecule composed of 9 carbon atoms, 17 hydrogen atoms, and 1 nitrogen atom. To determine the SMILES expression, we need to consider the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. By arranging the atoms in a way that satisfies the valency rules of each element, we can derive the SMILES expression.\n\nAfter determining the connectivity of the atoms in C9H17N, we can then write out the SMILES expression in accordance with the standard rules and conventions of SMILES notation. This notation will allow us to represent the molecule in a concise and standardized manner, facilitating its identification and comparison with other chemical structures.",
