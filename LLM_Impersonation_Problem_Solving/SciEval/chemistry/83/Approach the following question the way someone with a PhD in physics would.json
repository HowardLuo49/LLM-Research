    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule is a concise and standardized notation that represents its structure using ASCII characters. In the case of C9H17N, we can write the SMILES expression as CC(C)CCCCN. This notation indicates the arrangement of carbon and nitrogen atoms in the molecule, with the appropriate number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon atom. The SMILES expression provides a convenient way to represent molecular structures for computational purposes and database storage.",
