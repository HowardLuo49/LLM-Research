    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of (2S)-2-piperazin-1-yl-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be represented as CN1CCNCC1. This notation follows the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES), which is a specification for representing chemical structures using short ASCII strings. In this particular case, the SMILES expression captures the structural formula of the compound in a concise and standardized manner, allowing for easy sharing and manipulation in chemical databases and software.",
