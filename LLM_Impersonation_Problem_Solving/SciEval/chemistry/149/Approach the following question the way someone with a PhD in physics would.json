This notation represents the chemical structure of the molecule in a simplified and compact form, using a specific syntax to denote the atoms and their connectivity within the molecule. The presence of the stereocenter at the 2nd position (2S) is indicated in the SMILES expression to accurately represent the chirality of the molecule. It is important to note that SMILES notation is widely used in chemical informatics for representing chemical structures in a standardized and interpretable manner.",
