    "gpt_response": "The SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) expression of C7H13F3N2 can be derived from the structural formula of the compound. In this case, the compound is likely a small organic molecule composed of carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, and nitrogen atoms.\n\nTo generate the SMILES expression, one must first determine the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. This involves identifying the bonds between the atoms and their arrangement in a specific order. Once the connectivity is established, the SMILES representation can be constructed.\n\nThe SMILES expression of C7H13F3N2 would provide a concise and unique notation for the compound, capturing its structural information in a compact format. This notation can be used in databases, computational modeling, and other applications in chemistry and bioinformatics to represent and manipulate chemical structures effectively.",
