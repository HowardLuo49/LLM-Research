This representation utilizes simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) notation, which is a method of describing the structure of chemical molecules using a linear string of characters. In this case, the SMILES expression condenses the structural formula of the molecule C7H13F3N2 into a concise and standardized format, providing a convenient way to communicate and manipulate chemical structures computationally.",
