The atomic weights are as follows: \n\nC = 12.011 g/mol\nH = 1.008 g/mol\nO = 15.999 g/mol\n\nNext, we sum the atomic weights of each element in the compound (C8H8O2):\n(8 x 12.011) + (8 x 1.008) + (2 x 15.999) = 96.088 + 8.064 + 31.998 = 136.15 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H8O2 is 136.15 g/mol.",
