    "gpt_response": "136.15 daltons\n\nExplanation: To find the molecular weight of C8H8O2, we need to calculate the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The atomic weight of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 daltons, hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008 daltons, and oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 daltons.\n\nSo, for C8H8O2:\n8 atoms of carbon (8 x 12.01) = 96.08 daltons\n8 atoms of hydrogen (8 x 1.008) = 8.064 daltons\n2 atoms of oxygen (2 x 16.00) = 32.00 daltons\n\nAdding these together:\n96.08 + 8.064 + 32.00 = 136.15 daltons\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H8O2 is 136.15 daltons.",
