    "gpt_response": "136.15 g/mol\n\nAs a philosopher with a background in molecular chemistry, I can confidently provide the molecular weight of C8H8O2, which is 136.15 grams per mole. This measurement is derived from the molecular formula of the compound, which indicates the number and types of atoms present in a single molecule. Through the use of elemental weights and mathematical calculations, we can determine the precise molecular weight of C8H8O2.",
