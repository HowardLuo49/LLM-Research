To calculate the molecular weight of C8H8O2, we need to sum up the atomic weights of all the elements present in the formula. \n\nThe atomic weights of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) are 12.01, 1.008, and 16.00 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H8O2 = (8 x 12.01) + (8 x 1.008) + (2 x 16.00) = 180.16 + 8.064 + 32.00 = 220.224\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H8O2 is 220.224.",
