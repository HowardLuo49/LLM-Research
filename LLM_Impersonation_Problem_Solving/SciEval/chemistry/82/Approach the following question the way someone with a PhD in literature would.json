    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a chemical compound serves as a simplified, linear notation that conveys its molecular structure in textual format. In the case of C8H17N3O, the SMILES expression would be represented as CCN(C)C(=O)NCCCCC. This representation highlights the connectivity between the atoms within the compound and enables facile comparison and manipulation of molecular structures in computational chemistry and bioinformatics applications.",
