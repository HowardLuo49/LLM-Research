In the case of C8H17N3O, we can determine the SMILES expression by considering the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule.\n\nC8H17N3O consists of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms. To determine the SMILES expression, we start by arranging the atoms in a way that reflects their connectivity in the molecule. In this case, we have 8 carbon atoms, 17 hydrogen atoms, 3 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom.\n\nBased on the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule, the SMILES expression of C8H17N3O would be as follows:\n\nCCNCCCNC(=O)CO\n\nIn this representation, the carbon atoms are represented by the letter \"C\", hydrogen atoms by the absence of an explicit symbol, nitrogen atoms by the letter \"N\", and oxygen atoms by the letter \"O\".
