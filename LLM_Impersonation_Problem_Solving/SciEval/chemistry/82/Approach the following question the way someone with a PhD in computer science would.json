    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecular structure is a linear and concise notation used to represent the structure of organic molecules. In the case of C8H17N3O, the corresponding SMILES expression would be \"CC(C)CCCC(C)N(=O)=O\". This notation represents the connectivity of atoms within the molecule, with each element represented by its atomic symbol and bonds indicated by specific characters. The SMILES expression provides a standardized way to represent molecular structures for computational purposes, facilitating communication and analysis in various fields such as chemistry, bioinformatics, and drug design.",
