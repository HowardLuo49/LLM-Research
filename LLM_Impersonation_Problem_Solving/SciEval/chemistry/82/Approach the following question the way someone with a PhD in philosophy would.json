    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C8H17N3O can be derived by representing the molecular structure of the compound in a simplified linear notation, which is commonly used in cheminformatics. The SMILES notation for C8H17N3O would involve delineating the atoms and their connections in a diagrammatic format, using a specific set of rules for interpreting the chemical structure. However, a more detailed analysis encompassing the specific arrangement of bonds and functional groups within this molecular formula would be necessary to provide an exact SMILES expression for C8H17N3O.",
