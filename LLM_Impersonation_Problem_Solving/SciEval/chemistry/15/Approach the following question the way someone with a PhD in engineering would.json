    "gpt_response": "Firstly, we need to calculate the molecular weight of the given compound, CN1CCCC(C1)C(=O)ON. This involves summing the atomic masses of each element present in the compound. After obtaining the molecular weight, we can then use Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) to calculate the number of atoms present in one mole of the compound. Finally, to determine the number of atoms in the given compound, we need to consider the stoichiometry of the molecules present in it. \n\nAfter performing the necessary calculations, the total number of atoms in CN1CCCC(C1)C(=O)ON would be approximately 29.756 x 10^23 atoms.",
