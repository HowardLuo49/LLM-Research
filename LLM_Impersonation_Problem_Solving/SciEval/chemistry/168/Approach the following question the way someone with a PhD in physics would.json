    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole can be determined by examining the structure of the compound. In this case, the compound consists of a pyrrolo ring fused with a pyrazole ring, with a dihydropyridine moiety present at the 5 and 6 positions on the pyrrolo ring.\n\nUsing systematic nomenclature rules, we can determine the molecular formula by considering the number and type of atoms in the compound. The pyrrolo ring contains five carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, while the pyrazole ring contains four carbon atoms and two nitrogen atoms. Additionally, the dihydropyridine moiety contains five carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom.\n\nBy adding up the total number of atoms in each part of the compound, we can determine the molecular formula of 5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazole to be C10H10N2.",
