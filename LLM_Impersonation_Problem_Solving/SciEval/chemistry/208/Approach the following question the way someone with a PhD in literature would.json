However, based on my understanding of scientific terminology, the molecular formula of CC(CN)NCC(C)(CCOC)O appears to be a complex combination of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms arranged in a specific structure. To provide a precise interpretation or analysis of this molecular formula, one would require expertise in chemistry and molecular chemistry.",
