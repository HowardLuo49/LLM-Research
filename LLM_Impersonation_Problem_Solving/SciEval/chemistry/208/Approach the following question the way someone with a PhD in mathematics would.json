    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of CC(CN)NCC(C)(CCOC)O, we must first understand the chemical structure of the compound. The given compound consists of various elements bonded together in a specific arrangement. \n\nUsing our knowledge of organic chemistry, we can break down the compound into its constituent elements. In this case, the compound contains carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O). By counting the number of each element within the compound, we can determine the molecular formula.\n\nUpon analysis, we find that the compound contains 8 carbon atoms (C), 2 nitrogen atoms (N), and 1 oxygen atom (O). Therefore, the molecular formula of CC(CN)NCC(C)(CCOC)O is C8N2O.",
