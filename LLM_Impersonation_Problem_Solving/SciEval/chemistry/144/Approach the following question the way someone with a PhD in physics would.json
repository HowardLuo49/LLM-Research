    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-bromo-4-propyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazole can be determined by first identifying the structural formula of the compound. In this case, the compound contains a 1,3-thiazole ring with a bromine atom at position 2, a propyl group at position 4, and a hydrogen atom at position 5. \n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we must first calculate the total number of atoms present in the compound. The 1,3-thiazole ring contains 4 carbon atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 sulfur atom. Additionally, there is 1 bromine atom, 3 carbon atoms in the propyl group, and 1 hydrogen atom attached to the thiazole ring.\n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in the compound is:\n4 (carbon) + 1 (nitrogen) + 1 (sulfur) + 1 (bromine) + 3 (carbon) + 1 (hydrogen) = 11\n\nBased on this information, the molecular formula of 2-bromo-4-propyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-thiazole is C7H11BrNS.",
