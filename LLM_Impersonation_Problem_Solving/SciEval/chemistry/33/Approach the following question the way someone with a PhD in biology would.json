    "gpt_response": "155.26 g/mol\n\nExplanation: To calculate the molecular weight of a compound, we need to add up the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. \n\nThe atomic weights of the elements in C8H13NS are:\n- Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H) = 1.008 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N) = 14.01 g/mol\n- Sulfur (S) = 32.07 g/mol\n\nNow, we multiply the number of atoms of each element by their respective atomic weights and sum them up:\n\n(8 x 12.01) + (13 x 1.008) + 14.01 + 32.07 = 96.08 + 13.104 + 14.01 + 32.07 = 155.26 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H13NS is 155.26 g/mol.",
