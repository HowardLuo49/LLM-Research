    "gpt_response": "177.26 g/mol\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of C8H13NS, we first determine the atomic weight of each element: \n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n- Sulfur (S): 32.06 g/mol\n\nNext, we multiply the atomic weights by the respective subscripts in the molecular formula C8H13NS and sum the results:\n\n(8 x 12.01 g/mol) + (13 x 1.01 g/mol) + 14.01 g/mol + 32.06 g/mol\n= 96.08 g/mol + 13.13 g/mol + 14.01 g/mol + 32.06 g/mol\n= 177.26 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H13NS is 177.26 g/mol.",
