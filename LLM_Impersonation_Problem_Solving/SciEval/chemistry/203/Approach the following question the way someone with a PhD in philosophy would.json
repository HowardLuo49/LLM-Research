To calculate the molecular weight of this compound, we need to add up the atomic weights of each individual element: \n\n- Carbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H) = 1.01 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl) = 35.45 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N) = 14.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O) = 16.00 g/mol\n\nBy summing up the atomic weights of each element in the compound, we get:\n12.01 (C) + 5(1.01) (H) + 35.45 (Cl) + 2(14.01) (N) + 2(16.00) (O) = 139.523 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of CH5ClN2O2 is 139.523 g/mol.",
