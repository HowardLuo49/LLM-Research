    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC(=COC)C(=O)O.Cl is C5H7ClO3. This can be derived by calculating the total number of atoms of each element present in the compound, which in this case are 5 carbon atoms, 7 hydrogen atoms, 1 chlorine atom, and 3 oxygen atoms. Using this information, we can determine that the molecular formula of the compound is C5H7ClO3.",
