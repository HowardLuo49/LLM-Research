In this case, the compound consists of a guanidine moiety with an ethylideneamino substituent. The guanidine moiety has the formula C(NH2)3, and the ethylideneamino substituent consists of an ethyl group (C2H5) attached to an amino group (NH2) through a double bond.\n\nBy combining the guanidine moiety and the ethylideneamino substituent, the molecular formula of 1-[(E)-ethylideneamino]-2-methylguanidine can be determined to be C5H13N5.",
