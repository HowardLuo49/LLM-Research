    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of 1-[(E)-ethylideneamino]-2-methylguanidine, we first need to break down the compound into its constituent parts. \n\nThe compound contains an ethylideneamino group, which consists of an ethyl group (C2H5) attached to an amino group (-NH). The ethylideneamino group is attached to a guanidine molecule, which consists of a carbon atom attached to three amino groups (-NH2). Additionally, there is a methyl group attached to the carbon atom in the guanidine molecule. \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 1-[(E)-ethylideneamino]-2-methylguanidine can be written as C6H15N5.",
