The molecular formula for CC(CCC(C=C)C(C)O)O can be broken down into its constituent elements:\n\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of 16.00 g/mol\n\nCounting up the atoms in the formula, we have 9 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms. \n\n(9 x 12.01) + (18 x 1.008) + (2 x 16.00) = 108.09 + 18.144 + 32.00 = 158.234 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of CC(CCC(C=C)C(C)O)O is 338.55 g/mol.",
