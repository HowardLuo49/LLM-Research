    "gpt_response": "288.48 g/mol\n\nTo calculate the molecular weight of CC(CCC(C=C)C(C)O)O, we need to first determine the molecular formula of the compound. By counting the number of each type of atom in the given structure, we find that there are:\n\n- 7 Carbon (C) atoms\n- 16 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n- 2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n\nNext, we need to look up the atomic weights of each element from the periodic table. The atomic weights are approximately:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nMultiplying the number of atoms of each element by their respective atomic weights and summing up the results gives us the molecular weight of CC(CCC(C=C)C(C)O)O:\n\n(7 * 12.01) + (16 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 288.48 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of CC(CCC(C=C)C(C)O)O is 288.48 g/mol.",
