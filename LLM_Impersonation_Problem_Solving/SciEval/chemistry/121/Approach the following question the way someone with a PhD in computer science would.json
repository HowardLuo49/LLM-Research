    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of N-(3-chloro-2-methylprop-2-enyl)pentan-1-amine is CC(C)(CCCl)C(C)CCN. This is a simplified and linear notation used to represent the structure of a molecule in a concise and unambiguous way. In this case, the SMILES expression describes the connectivity of atoms within the molecule, with each uppercase letter representing a unique atom and the bond connectivity specified by parentheses and other symbols. By decoding the SMILES expression, one can easily understand the molecular structure of N-(3-chloro-2-methylprop-2-enyl)pentan-1-amine.",
