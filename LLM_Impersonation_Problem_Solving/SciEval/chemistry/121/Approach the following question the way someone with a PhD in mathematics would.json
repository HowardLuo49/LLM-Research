    "gpt_response": "To determine the SMILES expression of N-(3-chloro-2-methylprop-2-enyl)pentan-1-amine, we first need to identify the structural formula of the compound. Breaking down the compound into its constituent parts, we have a pentane backbone with an amine group (NH2) attached to the first carbon atom. Additionally, we have a substituent group attached to the nitrogen atom, which consists of a 3-chloro-2-methylprop-2-enyl group.\n\nBy assigning appropriate atom symbols, bond types, and numbering the atoms in the structure, we can construct the SMILES expression for the compound. The SMILES expression for N-(3-chloro-2-methylprop-2-enyl)pentan-1-amine is as follows: CC(C=C(C)Cl)C(N)CCCCC.\n\nThis SMILES expression encapsulates the connectivity of atoms in the compound, providing a compact representation of its structure that can be used for computational purposes, chemical databases, and other applications related to chemical informatics.",
