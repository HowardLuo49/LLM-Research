    "gpt_response": "146.21 g/mol\n\nA molecule of C8H18O3 consists of 8 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms. To calculate the molecular weight, we must sum the atomic weights of each atom in the molecule. The atomic weights of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are approximately 12.01 g/mol, 1.008 g/mol, and 16.00 g/mol, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H18O3 can be calculated as follows:\n\n(8 x 12.01 g/mol) + (18 x 1.008 g/mol) + (3 x 16.00 g/mol) = 146.21 g/mol.\n\nThus, the molecular weight of C8H18O3 is 146.21 g/mol.",
