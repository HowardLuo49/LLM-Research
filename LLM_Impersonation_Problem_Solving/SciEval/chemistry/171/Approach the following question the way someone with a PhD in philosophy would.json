    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of CC(=CCNC1CC(C1)N)C is approximately 235.35 grams per mole. This calculation is derived from the sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms present in the compound, taking into account the number of each type of atom in the molecular formula. Each carbon atom contributes approximately 12.01 grams per mole, each nitrogen atom contributes approximately 14.01 grams per mole, and each hydrogen atom contributes approximately 1.01 grams per mole. By adding up the atomic weights of each atom in CC(=CCNC1CC(C1)N)C, we can determine the molecular weight of the compound to be approximately 235.35 grams per mole.",
