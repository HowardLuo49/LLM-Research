    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of the compound CC(=CCNC1CC(C1)N)C can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of all the atoms in the compound. The chemical formula of the compound indicates that it consists of 15 carbon atoms, 21 hydrogen atoms, 3 nitrogen atoms, and 1 chlorine atom.\n\nThe atomic weights of these elements are:\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol\n- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of CC(=CCNC1CC(C1)N)C can be calculated as follows:\n\n(15 x 12.01) + (21 x 1.008) + (3 x 14.01) + (1 x 35.45) = 288.318 g/mol\n\nThus, the molecular weight of CC(=CCNC1CC(C1)N)C is 288.318 g/mol.",
