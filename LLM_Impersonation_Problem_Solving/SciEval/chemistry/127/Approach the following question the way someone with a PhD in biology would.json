    "gpt_response": "Quite simply, the molecular weight of a compound can be calculated by summing the atomic weights of each element in the formula. In the case of C11H20O, we have 11 carbon atoms, 20 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. \n\nThe atomic weight of carbon is approximately 12.01, hydrogen is approximately 1.01, and oxygen is approximately 16.00. \n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C11H20O would be:\n(11 x 12.01) + (20 x 1.01) + (1 x 16.00) = 136.22 + 20.20 + 16.00 = 172.42 \n\nSo, the molecular weight of C11H20O is approximately 172.42 g/mol.",
