    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of C1C(C1(F)F)C(=O)O can be deduced by breaking down the compound into its constituent elements. In this case, the compound consists of carbon (C), fluorine (F), and oxygen (O) atoms. \n\nUpon further analysis, it can be observed that the compound contains one carbon atom, two fluorine atoms, and one oxygen atom. The arrangement of these atoms suggests a cyclic structure, with carbon serving as the central atom bonded to two fluorine atoms and one oxygen atom. \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of C1C(C1(F)F)C(=O)O can be expressed as C2F2O, representing two carbon atoms, two fluorine atoms, and one oxygen atom in a cyclic arrangement. This molecular formula provides insight into the composition and structure of the compound, allowing for further examination of its chemical properties and behavior.",
