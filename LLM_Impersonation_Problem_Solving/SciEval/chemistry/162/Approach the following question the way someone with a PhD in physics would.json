    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula C1C(C1(F)F)C(=O)O represents a chemical compound with a carbon backbone containing three carbon atoms, one oxygen atom, and two fluorine atoms. The structure of the compound indicates that one carbon atom is double-bonded to the oxygen atom, with the other carbon atoms in the molecule being bound to the oxygen atom and one fluorine atom each. This compound appears to be a simple organic molecule with potential applications in the field of organic chemistry. Detailed analysis of its properties and reactivity would require further experimental investigation.",
