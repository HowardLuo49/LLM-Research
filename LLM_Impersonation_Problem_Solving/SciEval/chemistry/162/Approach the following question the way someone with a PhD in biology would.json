    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of C1C(C1(F)F)C(=O)O refers to a chemical compound consisting of one carbon atom bonded to one carbon atom, which is further bonded to two fluorine atoms and a carbonyl group containing an oxygen atom. The presence of the carbonyl group indicates the compound is likely an organic molecule with potential functional groups such as ketones or esters. The specific structure and properties of the compound can be further elucidated through techniques such as spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.",
