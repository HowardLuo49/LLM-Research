    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of C1C(C1(F)F)C(=O)O represents an organic compound composed of carbon, fluorine, and oxygen atoms arranged in a specific configuration. The designation of C1C(C1(F)F)C(=O)O suggests a structural formula in which a carbon atom is singly bonded to three other carbon atoms, one of which is double bonded to an oxygen atom. Additionally, two fluorine atoms are attached to one of the carbon atoms in a tertiary configuration. \n\nIn terms of interpreting this molecular formula, we can discern that the presence of the C(=O) functional group indicates a carbonyl group, which is commonly found in aldehydes and ketones. The designation of C1 and F also signifies specific carbon and fluorine atoms within the structure. Overall, the molecular formula C1C(C1(F)F)C(=O)O serves as a representation of a unique organic compound with distinct connectivity of atoms and functional groups.",
