    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of (4Z)-6-methyl-3-methylidenehepta-4,6-dienal can be represented as CC(=C)CCCCC=CC=O. The (4Z) indicates that the double bond between the 4th and 5th carbon atoms is in the Z configuration, and the methyl groups are located on the 6th and 3rd carbon atoms, respectively.

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response ['CC(=C)C=CC(=C)CC=O']?: The SMILES expression of (4Z)-6-methyl-3-methylidenehepta-4,6-dienal can be represented as CC(=C)CCCCC=CC=O. The (4Z) indicates that the double bond between the 4th and 5th carbon atoms is in the Z configuration, and the methyl groups are located on the 6th and 3rd carbon atoms, respectively.
