This notation uses a linear string of characters to represent the structure of the molecule, with each character representing a specific atom or bond in the molecule. In this case, the SMILES expression captures the molecular structure of the compound in a concise and standardized format that can be easily interpreted by computational software for further analysis and modeling.",
