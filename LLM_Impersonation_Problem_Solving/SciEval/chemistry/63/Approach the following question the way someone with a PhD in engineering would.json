This representation is a linear notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. The C6H12N2O molecule consists of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms, two nitrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom arranged in a specific configuration. The SMILES notation provides a compact and easily-readable way to convey the structural information of a molecule, making it convenient for computational analysis and chemical database searching.",
