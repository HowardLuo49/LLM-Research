    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C6H12N2O can be written as \"CC(C)C(N)C(=O)N\". This is a linear notation for representing the structure of a chemical compound in a concise and unique way. In this case, the SMILES expression describes the arrangement of atoms and bonds in the molecule containing 6 carbon (C) atoms, 12 hydrogen (H) atoms, 2 nitrogen (N) atoms, and 1 oxygen (O) atom. This representation can be used for various purposes in computational chemistry, such as structure searching, database mining, and generation of molecular graphs.",
