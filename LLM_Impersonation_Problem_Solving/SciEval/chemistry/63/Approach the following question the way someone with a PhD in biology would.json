This notation represents the chemical structure of the compound by using a string of characters to denote the atoms and bonds present in the molecule. In this case, the expression breaks down to show the six carbon atoms (C6), twelve hydrogen atoms (H12), two nitrogen atoms (N2), and one oxygen atom (O), along with their connectivity in the molecule.",
