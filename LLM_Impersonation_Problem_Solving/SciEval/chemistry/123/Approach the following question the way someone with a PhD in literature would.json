    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of C10H21NO2 can be calculated by adding up the atomic weights of each element present in the molecule. The atomic weights are as follows: \n\n- Carbon (C) = 12.011\n- Hydrogen (H) = 1.008\n- Nitrogen (N) = 14.007\n- Oxygen (O) = 15.999\n\nNow, multiplying the number of atoms of each element by its atomic weight and adding the results together:\n\n10(C) + 21(H) + 1(N) + 2(O) = 10(12.011) + 21(1.008) + 1(14.007) + 2(15.999) = 120.11 + 21.168 + 14.007 + 31.998 = 187.283 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C10H21NO2 is approximately 187.283 g/mol.",
