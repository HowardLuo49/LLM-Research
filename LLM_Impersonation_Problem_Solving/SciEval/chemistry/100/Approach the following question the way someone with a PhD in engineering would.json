The semicolon \";\" is used to separate the nitroxyl group from the rest of the molecule, which in this case is 1,3-thiazole. Thiazole is a five-membered heterocyclic ring containing one sulfur atom and one nitrogen atom. The \"C=C\" denotes the double bond between the carbon and sulfur atoms in position 2 and 3 of the thiazole ring, respectively.
