    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (E)-1-hydroperoxy-2-methylbut-1-ene can be expressed as C5H10O2. This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as organic hydroperoxides, which contain a peroxide functional group attached directly to an organic molecule. The (E)- designation indicates that the compound has an E-configuration, meaning the highest priority groups attached to the double bond are on opposite sides of the molecule. The presence of a hydroperoxy group (-OOH) on the 1-position of the butene chain, as well as a methyl group on the 2-position, further characterizes the structure of this molecule. The molecular formula provides a succinct description of the types and numbers of atoms present in the compound, enabling a deeper understanding of its chemical properties and potential reactivity.",
