    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (E)-1-hydroperoxy-2-methylbut-1-ene can be determined through a systematic analysis of its chemical structure. This compound is a derivative of butene, a hydrocarbon with a double bond between the first and second carbon atoms. The presence of a hydroperoxy group (-OOH) indicates that this compound is a hydroperoxide, which is a class of organic compounds containing an oxygen-oxygen bond.\n\nTo derive the molecular formula of (E)-1-hydroperoxy-2-methylbut-1-ene, we first identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on its name. The prefix \"methyl\" indicates the presence of a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the second carbon atom of butene. The term \"but\" indicates that the parent hydrocarbon chain contains four carbon atoms. Additionally, the suffix \"-ene\" signifies the presence of a double bond in the molecule.\n\nNext, we consider the presence of the hydroperoxy group in the compound. The hydroperoxy group consists of one hydrogen atom, one oxygen atom, and one oxygen-oxygen bond. Therefore, we must account for these elements in the molecular formula.\n\nCombining all these factors, the molecular formula of (E)-1-hydroperoxy-2-methylbut-1-ene can be determined as C5H10O2. This formula represents the arrangement of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in the compound and provides a concise depiction of its chemical composition.",
