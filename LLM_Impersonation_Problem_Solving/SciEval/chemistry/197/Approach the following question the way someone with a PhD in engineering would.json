    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol can be determined by analyzing the chemical structure provided. In this case, breaking down the name of the compound reveals that it is composed of a propanol group, a thiophenyl group, and a methylamino group.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we first identify the molecular formula of each individual group. Propanol has the molecular formula C3H8O, thiophenyl has the molecular formula C4H3S, and methylamino has the molecular formula C2H5N. \n\nBy combining these individual molecular formulas based on the structure given, we see that the molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol is C10H15NOS.",
