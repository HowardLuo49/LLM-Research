    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol is C11H15NOS. This can be determined by analyzing the structural formula of the compound and counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms present in the molecule. The structural formula indicates that there are 11 carbon atoms, 15 hydrogen atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 sulfur atom in the compound. Therefore, the molecular formula is C11H15NOS.",
