    "gpt_response": "To determine the molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol, we first need to break down the compound into its constituent parts. \n\n1. The base structure of the compound is propan-1-ol, which consists of a 3-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the first carbon atom.\n\n2. The propan-1-ol structure is further modified by the addition of a thiophen-2-yl group at the second carbon atom. Thiophene is a five-membered aromatic ring with a sulfur atom in the ring.\n\n3. Additionally, a methylamino group (-NHCH3) is attached to the second carbon atom of the thiophen-2-yl group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol can be written as C11H15NOS.",
