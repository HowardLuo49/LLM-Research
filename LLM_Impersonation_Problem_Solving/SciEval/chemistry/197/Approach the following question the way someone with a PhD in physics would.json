    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol can be determined by first identifying the molecular structure based on the given name. In this case, the molecule consists of a propanol group (C3H7OH) attached to a thiophenyl group (C4H3S), with a methylamino group (CH3NH) attached to the second carbon atom of the propanol group. \n\nTaking into account the molecular formula of each individual group and the bonding arrangement described in the name, we can combine the atoms and calculate the total number of each element in the molecule. This results in the molecular formula of C8H13NOS.",
