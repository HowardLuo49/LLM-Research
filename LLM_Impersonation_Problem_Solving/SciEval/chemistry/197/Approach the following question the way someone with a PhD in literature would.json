    ],
    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol can be determined by examining the structural components of the compound. \n\nFirstly, the presence of \"2-(methylamino)\" indicates that there is a methyl group attached to an amino group at the 2-position of the molecule. This can be represented as -CH3NH-. \n\nNext, the \"-1-thiophen-2-yl\" component indicates the presence of a thiophenyl group attached at the 1-position of the molecule. Thiophene is a heterocyclic compound containing a sulfur atom in the ring structure.\n\nFinally, the presence of \"propan-1-ol\" indicates the main carbon chain of the molecule is a propanol group, indicating a three-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group attached at the 1-position.\n\nPutting all these components together, the molecular formula of 2-(methylamino)-1-thiophen-2-ylpropan-1-ol can be written as C10H15NOS.",
