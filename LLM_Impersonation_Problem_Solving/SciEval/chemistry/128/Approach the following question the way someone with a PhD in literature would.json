    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression for a chemical compound is a condensed notation that represents its structure using ASCII characters. In the case of C8H17NO2S, also known as Lysine, the SMILES expression would be CC(CCC(N)C(=O)O)CSC. This notation is used in computational chemistry and bioinformatics for predicting the properties and activities of molecules based on their structure. The SMILES expression allows for easy comparison and manipulation of chemical structures in various computational tools and databases.",
