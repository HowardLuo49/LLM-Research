    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (3S)-3-methyloxane-2-thiol is C5H12OS. In this compound, there are five carbon atoms (C5), twelve hydrogen atoms (H12), one sulfur atom (S), and one oxygen atom (O). The presence of the sulfur atom and the -SH functional group indicates that this compound is a thiol, a class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a sulfhydryl (-SH) group. The stereochemistry designation \"3S\" indicates that the sulfur atom is located at the third carbon position in the molecule.",
