    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of (3S)-3-methyloxane-2-thiol can be deduced by first examining the structural formula of the compound. The prefix (3S) indicates that the stereochemistry at the third carbon atom is in the S configuration. The compound contains a methyl group attached to the third carbon atom of a six-membered oxane ring, along with a thiol group attached to the second carbon atom. \n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we need to consider the number and type of atoms present in the compound. The base structure oxane contains six carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, while the addition of the methyl group adds one more carbon atom. The thiol group contributes a sulfur atom and a hydrogen atom. Therefore, the molecular formula of (3S)-3-methyloxane-2-thiol is C7H14OS.",
