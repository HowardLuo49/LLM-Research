    "gpt_response": "The compound C1CCC(C1)(CN)C(O)O is known as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, abbreviated as cAMP. It is a critical molecule in cellular signaling pathways, functioning as a second messenger to relay external signals to the cell's interior. cAMP is involved in numerous physiological processes, including metabolism, gene expression, and neurotransmission. Its structure consists of a cyclic backbone with a purine base (adenine) and a ribose sugar.",
