Therefore, the total number of atoms in 5-ethyl-3,5-dimethylhept-3-ene is 11 (carbon atoms) + 22 (hydrogen atoms) = 33 atoms.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract 4 atoms (2 carbon atoms and 2 hydrogen atoms) because they are part of the functional group of the alkene which would not be considered as part of the carbon chain. Therefore, the total number of atoms in 5-ethyl-3,5-dimethylhept-3-ene is 33 - 4 = 29 atoms.",
