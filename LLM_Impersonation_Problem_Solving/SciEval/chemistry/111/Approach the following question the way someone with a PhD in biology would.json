In order to determine the molecular formula of this compound, we first need to identify the atoms present and their connectivity.\n\nIn this case, the compound contains carbon (C), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) atoms. The chain of carbon atoms is connected by alternating double bonds, indicated by the presence of the \"CC\" and \"C=CC\" segments. The carbonyl group (=O) is present in the middle of the chain, while the carboxyl group (COO) is located at the end of the chain.\n\nBased on this information, we can determine the molecular formula of CC(=O)C=CC=COO to be C7H6O2. This is calculated by adding the number of carbon atoms (7) and hydrogen atoms (6) present in the compound, and subtracting the number of oxygen atoms (2) since they are part of the functional groups (carbonyl and carboxyl).",
