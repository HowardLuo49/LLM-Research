The quinoline ring contains 9 carbon atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and a total of 11 hydrogen atoms. The methyl group adds an additional 3 carbon atoms and 3 hydrogen atoms. \n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in 2-methyl-3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydroquinoline is: \n9 carbon atoms + 1 nitrogen atom + 14 hydrogen atoms = 24 atoms. \n\nThus, there are 24 atoms in 2-methyl-3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydroquinoline.",
