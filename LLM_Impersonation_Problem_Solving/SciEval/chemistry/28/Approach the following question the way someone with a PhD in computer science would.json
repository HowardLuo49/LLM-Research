    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of 1-(3-oxobutyl)diazinan-3-one can be calculated by adding the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule. The molecular formula for 1-(3-oxobutyl)diazinan-3-one is C7H13NO2. \n\nTo calculate the molecular weight, we first need to find the atomic weights of each element present in the molecule:\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of 12.01\n- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of 1.008\n- Nitrogen (N) has an atomic weight of 14.01\n- Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of 16.00\n\nNow we calculate the total molecular weight:\n(7 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.008) + 14.01 + (2 * 16.00) = 99.14\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of 1-(3-oxobutyl)diazinan-3-one is approximately 99.14 g/mol.",
