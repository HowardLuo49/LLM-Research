    "gpt_response": "There are 33 atoms in the molecule CCNC(=O)NCCCC(C)N. \n\nTo determine the number of atoms in the molecule, we must count each unique element in the chemical formula. In this case, there are 4 carbon atoms (C), 7 nitrogen atoms (N), and 2 oxygen atoms (O). \n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in the molecule is 4 carbon atoms + 7 nitrogen atoms + 2 oxygen atoms = 13 atoms. \n\nHowever, we must also consider the number of atoms within the functional groups present in the molecule. The carbonyl group (C=O) contains one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, which adds 2 additional atoms. The amide group (-C(=O)N-) contains one carbon atom, one nitrogen atom, and one oxygen atom, adding 3 more atoms. Finally, the methyl group (C) contains one carbon atom, adding one more atom. \n\nAdding these additional atoms to the count gives: 4 carbon atoms + 7 nitrogen atoms + 2 oxygen atoms + 2 atoms from the carbonyl group + 3 atoms from the amide group + 1 atom from the methyl group = 19 additional atoms. \n\nTherefore, the total number of atoms in the molecule is 13 + 19 = 33 atoms.",
