    "gpt_response": "To accurately determine the number of atoms in the chemical compound CCNC(=O)NCCCC(C)N, one must first examine the molecular structure of the compound. The compound contains multiple elements, including carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O). Each element contributes a specific number of atoms to the overall molecular composition. By counting the specific number of atoms for each element within the compound, one can calculate the total number of atoms in CCNC(=O)NCCCC(C)N. \n\nTo determine the total number of atoms in this compound, one must account for each individual atom of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen present in the molecular structure. By utilizing principles of chemical bonding and molecular formulae, we can analyze the composition of CCNC(=O)NCCCC(C)N to determine the exact number of atoms.\n\nAfter careful consideration and calculation, the total number of atoms in CCNC(=O)NCCCC(C)N is found to be 27.",
