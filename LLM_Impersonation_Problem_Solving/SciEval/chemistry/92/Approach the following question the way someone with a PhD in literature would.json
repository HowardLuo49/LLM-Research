    "gpt_response": "171.23\n\nExplanation: To calculate the molecular weight of C8H17NO3, we need to determine the atomic weights of each element in the compound and add them together. \n\n- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of 12.01\n- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of 1.01\n- Nitrogen (N) has an atomic weight of 14.01\n- Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of 16.00\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate the molecular weight as follows:\n(8 x 12.01) + (17 x 1.01) + 14.01 + (3 x 16.00) = 96.08 + 17.17 + 14.01 + 48.00 = 171.23\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H17NO3 is 171.23.",
