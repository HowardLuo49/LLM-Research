    "gpt_response": "175.23 g/mol\n\nExplanation: To calculate the molecular weight of a compound, we need to add up the atomic weights of all the elements present in the compound. The atomic weights of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) are approximately 12.01 g/mol, 1.01 g/mol, 14.01 g/mol, and 16.00 g/mol, respectively.\n\nFor C8H17NO3:\n(8 x 12.01) + (17 x 1.01) + 14.01 + (3 x 16.00) = 96.08 + 17.17 + 14.01 + 48.00 = 175.23 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of C8H17NO3 is 175.23 g/mol.",
