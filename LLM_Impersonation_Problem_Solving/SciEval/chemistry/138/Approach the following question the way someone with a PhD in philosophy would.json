    "gpt_response": "In contemplating the molecular formula of CCOC(=O)C1CCCCC=CC1, it is vital to engage in a thorough structural analysis informed by principles of organic chemistry and chemical nomenclature. The empirical formula of a compound provides the simplest ratio of elements present, while the molecular formula specifies the exact number and type of atoms constituting the compound. In this particular case, the molecular formula represents a combination of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms arranged in a specific configuration denoted by the structural formula CCOC(=O)C1CCCCC=CC1. By decoding this representation through the lens of organic chemistry, one can discern that the molecular formula of CCOC(=O)C1CCCCC=CC1 corresponds to C15H22O2. This deduction stems from counting the carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms present in the structural formula with precision and attention to detail. Ultimately, the molecular formula encapsulates the compositional essence of the compound in its entirety, rendering it a foundational aspect of chemical characterization and understanding.",
