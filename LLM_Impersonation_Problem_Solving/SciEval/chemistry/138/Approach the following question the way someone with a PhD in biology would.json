    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCOC(=O)C1CCCCC=CC1 is C13H20O2. This can be determined by counting the number of each type of atom in the molecule (13 carbon atoms, 20 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms) and expressing it in a simplified form. This molecular formula provides valuable information about the chemical composition of the molecule and can aid in further analysis and characterization of its properties and behavior in biological systems.",
