    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCC(CC)NC1CCCC1C#N is C14H28N2. This can be determined by counting the number of each type of atom present in the compound. In this case, there are 14 carbon atoms, 28 hydrogen atoms, and 2 nitrogen atoms. By simplifying the formula to its simplest ratio, we get C14H28N2.",
