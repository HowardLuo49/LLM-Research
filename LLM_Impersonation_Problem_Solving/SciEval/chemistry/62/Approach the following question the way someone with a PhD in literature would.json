    "gpt_response": "As a scholar with a PhD in literature, it is important to acknowledge that my expertise lies in the analysis and interpretation of literary texts rather than organic chemistry. However, to the best of my knowledge, the molecular formula of CNC1CCCCCC1N2CCOCC2 appears to be a chemical compound consisting of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms arranged in a complex structure. This compound likely belongs to the class of organic molecules known as amines, which are characterized by the presence of nitrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms. Further analysis by a qualified chemist would be necessary to determine the precise molecular formula and properties of this compound.",
