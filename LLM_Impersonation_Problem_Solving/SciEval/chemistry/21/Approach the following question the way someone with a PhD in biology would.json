    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-aminocyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-thione is C7H9NS. This compound consists of a cyclohexane ring with an amino group at the 4th position, a double bond at the 2nd and 4th positions, and a thione group at the 1st position. By counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms present in the compound and arranging them according to their connectivity, we arrive at the molecular formula C7H9NS.",
