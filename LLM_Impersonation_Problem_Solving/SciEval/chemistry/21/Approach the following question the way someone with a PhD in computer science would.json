    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-aminocyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-thione can be determined by examining the structure of the compound. The compound consists of a cyclohexane ring with an amino group (NH2) attached to carbon number 4, a conjugated diene at position 2 and 4, and a thione group (C=S) at position 1. \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 4-aminocyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-thione is C7H9NOS.",
