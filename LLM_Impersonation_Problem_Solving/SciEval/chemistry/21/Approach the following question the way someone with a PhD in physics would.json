    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 4-aminocyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-thione can be determined by first identifying the structural formula of the compound. In this case, the compound contains a cyclohexane ring with two double bonds at positions 2 and 4, an amino group at position 4, and a thione group at position 1.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula, we must first count the number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms present in the compound. The cyclohexane ring contains 6 carbon atoms, the two double bonds contribute a total of 4 carbon atoms, and the amino group adds 1 nitrogen atom. The thione group contains a sulfur atom.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 4-aminocyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-thione is C8H9NS.",
