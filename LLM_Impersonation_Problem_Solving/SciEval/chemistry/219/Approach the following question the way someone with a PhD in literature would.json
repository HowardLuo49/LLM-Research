    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine can be determined by examining the chemical structure of the compound. In this case, the compound contains a methoxy group (-OCH3), a propyl group (-C3H7), a hept-5-yn-2-amine group (-C7H15N), and a terminal amine group. By adding up the number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in each group, we can calculate the overall molecular formula of the compound.\n\nBy summing the total number of atoms in each group, we can derive the molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine as C12H25NO.",
