    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine can be deduced by analyzing the structure of the compound. In this case, we have a compound with a main chain of seven carbon atoms (hept) with a triple bond between the fifth and sixth carbon atoms (5-yn) and an amine functional group attached to the second carbon atom (2-amine). Additionally, there is a methoxy group attached to the first carbon atom (1-methoxy) and a propyl group attached to the nitrogen atom (N-propyl).\n\nBy arranging the atoms according to the given nomenclature and considering the valency of each element, the molecular formula can be determined as C\u2081\u2080H\u2082\u2080NO. This formula represents the arrangement of ten carbon atoms, twenty hydrogen atoms, and one nitrogen and one oxygen atom in the compound.",
