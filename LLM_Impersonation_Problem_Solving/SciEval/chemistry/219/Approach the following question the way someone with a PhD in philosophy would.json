        "C11H21NO"
    ],
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine, one must first break down the name into its constituent parts and analyze the structural composition of the compound. The prefix \"1-methoxy\" indicates the presence of a methoxy group (CH3O-) attached to the first carbon atom in the molecule. The designation \"N-propyl\" signifies that a propyl group (C3H7-) is bonded to the nitrogen atom in the compound. The term \"hept-5-yn-2\" suggests that a heptane backbone, with a triple bond on the second carbon atom, is present in the structure. Lastly, the suffix \"-amine\" indicates the presence of an amine group (NH2) in the molecule.\n\nBy combining these various components, we can construct the molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine as C11H21NO. This formulation captures the arrangement of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in the compound based on the information provided by the chemical name. The molecular formula represents the specific composition of the molecule and provides valuable insights into its potential chemical properties and reactivity.",
