    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine can be determined by identifying the functional groups present in the compound and determining the number and type of atoms in each group. \n\nIn this compound, the functional groups present are methoxy (-OCH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), hept-5-yn-2-amine (-C7H13N), and the 1-methoxy group implies that the methoxy group is attached at the first position of the compound. \n\nBased on this information, we can construct the molecular formula by combining the atoms in each functional group:\n\n- The methoxy group (-OCH3) contains 1 oxygen atom and 3 hydrogen atoms.\n- The propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3) contains 3 carbon atoms and 7 hydrogen atoms.\n- The hept-5-yn-2-amine group (-C7H13N) contains 7 carbon atoms, 13 hydrogen atoms, and 1 nitrogen atom.\n\nCombining these groups together and accounting for their positions in the compound, we can derive the molecular formula of 1-methoxy-N-propylhept-5-yn-2-amine as C12H23NO.",
