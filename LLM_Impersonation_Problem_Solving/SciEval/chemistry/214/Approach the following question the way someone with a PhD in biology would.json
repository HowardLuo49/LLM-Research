    "gpt_response": "The chemical formula C12H25NOS corresponds to the compound L-Cysteine, which is an amino acid that contains a thiol group. It plays essential roles in protein structure and function, as well as in the synthesis of glutathione, a key antioxidant in living organisms. L-Cysteine is crucial for various physiological processes and is involved in redox reactions and regulation of gene expression. Its sulfur-containing thiol group allows for the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the stability of proteins and enzymes.",
