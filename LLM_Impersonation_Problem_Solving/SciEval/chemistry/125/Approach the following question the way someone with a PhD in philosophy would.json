    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC1(C(=O)N(N=N1)C)C can be elucidated through a deep analysis of its chemical structure and the atoms present in the molecule. This compound appears to contain carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms based on the symbols within the formula. Additionally, the presence of double bonds (=) suggests the presence of unsaturation, which is further supported by the presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond (N=N).\n\nFurthermore, the arrangement of atoms within the molecule indicates the presence of a cyclic structure with a central nitrogen atom. By systematically analyzing the connectivity of atoms and their bond types, it can be deduced that the molecular formula of CC1(C(=O)N(N=N1)C)C is C8H10N4O, representing 8 carbon atoms, 10 hydrogen atoms, 4 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of organic molecules and the importance of structural elucidation in determining their molecular formulas.",
