    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC1(C(=O)N(N=N1)C)C is C10H9N3O. This compound appears to be a derivative of a pyrazole-based molecule, containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in its structure. The substructure of a pyrazole ring is evident in the formula, with additional carbon and nitrogen atoms attached. Further analysis of the compound's structural properties and potential chemical reactivity would be required for a more comprehensive understanding of its literary significance or implications.",
