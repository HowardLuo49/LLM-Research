    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CC1(C(=O)N(N=N1)C)C is C6H6N4O. This compound contains 6 carbon atoms, 6 hydrogen atoms, 4 nitrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom. It is a cyclic compound with a central carbon atom surrounded by alternating nitrogen and oxygen atoms, connected by double bonds. The chemical structure of this compound suggests potential biological activity, which could be investigated further through experimental studies.",
