    "gpt_response": "The given molecular formula can be deconstructed into its constituent elements and their respective counts. From the formula, we can identify the elements present as Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), and Hydrogen (H). The molecular formula can be rewritten as C\u2082N\u2082H\u2083. Therefore, the molecular formula of CC1=NN(CN1C)C is C\u2082N\u2082H\u2083.",
