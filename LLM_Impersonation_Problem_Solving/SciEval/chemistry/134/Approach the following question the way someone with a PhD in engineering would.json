    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C9H16O4 is CC(O)CC(C)C(C)OC(=O)C(C)O. SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a specification for unambiguously describing the structure of chemical molecules using short ASCII strings. In this case, the SMILES expression represents the structure of a compound with 9 carbon atoms, 16 hydrogen atoms, and 4 oxygen atoms. Each character in the SMILES string represents a specific atom or a bond between atoms in the molecule, allowing for easy and concise representation of chemical structures.",
