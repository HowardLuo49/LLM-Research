To determine the SMILES expression of a compound, one must first count the number of each type of atom in the molecule and then arrange them in a specific order according to the SMILES notation rules.\n\nIn the case of C9H16O4, we have 9 carbon (C) atoms, 16 hydrogen (H) atoms, and 4 oxygen (O) atoms. To construct the SMILES expression, we would arrange these atoms according to their valence electrons and connectivity in the molecule.\n\nThe SMILES expression of C9H16O4 would be: CC1(C)OC(=O)C(C)(O)C(C)CC1. This notation captures the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule and provides a unique identifier for C9H16O4 in chemical databases and computational models.",
