    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C9H16O4 refers to a simplified molecular input line entry system representation of the molecular structure of a compound containing 9 carbon atoms, 16 hydrogen atoms, and 4 oxygen atoms. The specific arrangement of these atoms is represented in a linear string of characters according to a standardized notation system developed for computer-based chemical information systems. The SMILES expression for C9H16O4 is \"[O-]C(=O)CC(C)(C)COC(=O)CC(C)(C)C\" which describes the spatial arrangement of the atoms and their covalent bonds within the molecule.",
