The molecular formula C9H16O4 suggests the presence of nine carbon atoms, sixteen hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms. From this information, we can deduce the possible structural arrangements of the atoms within the molecule.\n\nOnce the connectivity of the atoms is established, we can then generate the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) expression for the compound. SMILES notation is a method used to represent the structure of a molecule in a simple and concise manner, using alphanumeric characters and symbols to depict the connectivity of atoms.\n\nBy considering the molecular formula C9H16O4 and applying principles of organic chemistry, a PhD in literature would be able to deduce the corresponding SMILES expression for the compound.",
