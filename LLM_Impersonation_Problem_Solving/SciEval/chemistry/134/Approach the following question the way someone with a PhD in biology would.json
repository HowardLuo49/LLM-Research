    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule represents its unique chemical structure in a compact and standardized format. In the case of C9H16O4, which corresponds to an organic compound containing 9 carbon atoms, 16 hydrogen atoms, and 4 oxygen atoms, the SMILES expression would be: CC(C)(O)C(O)=O. Each character in the SMILES string corresponds to a specific atom or bond in the molecule, allowing for easy representation and comparison of chemical structures.",
