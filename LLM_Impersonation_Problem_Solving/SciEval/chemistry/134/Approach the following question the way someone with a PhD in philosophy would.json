    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of C9H16O4 refers to the simplified molecular-input line-entry system, a notation used to represent chemical structures in a concise and unambiguous manner. In this case, the given molecular formula corresponds to a compound containing 9 carbon atoms, 16 hydrogen atoms, and 4 oxygen atoms. The SMILES expression for C9H16O4 would be 'CC(C)(C)OC(=O)C(CC(C)C)O', indicating the arrangement of atoms within the molecule according to predefined rules. This representation allows for easy transmission and storage of chemical structures, facilitating computational analysis and interpretation in the field of chemistry.",
