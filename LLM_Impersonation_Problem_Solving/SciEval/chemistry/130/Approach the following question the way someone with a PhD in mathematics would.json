    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCCCCCCCCCC(C)OOOC is C14H28O2. This can be determined by counting the number of each type of atom present in the molecule - 14 carbon (C) atoms, 28 hydrogen (H) atoms, and 2 oxygen (O) atoms. By following the IUPAC naming convention for organic compounds, we can determine the molecular formula of the given compound.",
