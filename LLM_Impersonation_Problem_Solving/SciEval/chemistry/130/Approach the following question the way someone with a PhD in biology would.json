    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of CCCCCCCCCCC(C)OOOC is C15H30O2. This can be determined by counting the number of each element present in the compound (C - carbon, H - hydrogen, O - oxygen) and arranging them in the formula CxHyOz. By counting the carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens, we can determine that there are 15 carbons, 30 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens in the compound. Thus, the molecular formula is C15H30O2.",
