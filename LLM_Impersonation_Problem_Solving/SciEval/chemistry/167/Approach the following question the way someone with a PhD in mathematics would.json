    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoro-1-methylsulfanylethane can be deduced by breaking down the name of the compound. The prefix \"1-chloro\" indicates the presence of a chlorine atom bonded to the first carbon atom of the main chain. The following \"1,2,2,2-tetrafluoro\" indicates that there are four fluorine atoms attached to the second carbon atom. Finally, \"1-methylsulfanylethane\" suggests the presence of a methyl group bonded to the third carbon atom and a sulfur atom bonded to the third carbon atom.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoro-1-methylsulfanylethane is C5H6ClF4S.",
