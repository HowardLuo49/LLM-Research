    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-methyl-5-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-amine can be determined by analyzing the structural information provided. In this compound, we have a cyclohexene ring with a propenyl group attached to carbons 2 and 5, and a methyl group attached to carbon 2. Additionally, there is an amine group attached to carbon 1 on the cyclohexene ring.\n\nBy breaking down the compound into its constituent parts, we can determine the molecular formula. The cyclohexene ring has a formula of C6H10, the propenyl group has a formula of C3H5, the methyl group has a formula of CH3, and the amine group has a formula of NH2. Putting all these parts together, we get the molecular formula of C10H17N. \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 2-methyl-5-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-amine is C10H17N.",
