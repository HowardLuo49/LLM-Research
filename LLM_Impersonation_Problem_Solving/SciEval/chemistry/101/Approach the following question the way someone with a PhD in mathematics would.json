    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-methyl-5-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-amine can be derived by first identifying the structure of the compound based on the given systematic nomenclature. \n\nThe compound contains a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group attached at the 2nd carbon, a propenyl group attached at the 5th carbon, and an amino group attached at the 1st carbon. Additionally, there is a double bond between the 1st and 2nd carbons in the cyclohexene ring.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula can be determined by counting the number of each type of atom present in the compound. In this case, the molecular formula would be C11H19N. \n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of 2-methyl-5-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-amine is C11H19N.",
