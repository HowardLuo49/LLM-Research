    "gpt_response": "The molecular formula of 2-methyl-5-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-amine can be discerned by first identifying the constituent atoms and their respective bonding configurations within the compound. By deconstructing the chemical name provided, we can ascertain that the compound consists of a cyclohexene ring with an amino group attached at the first position, and additional substituents of a methyl group at the 2nd position, a propenyl group at the 5th position, and an allyl group at the 2nd position of the propene moiety.\n\nConverting this structural information into a molecular formula requires accounting for the individual atoms present in the compound and their respective quantities. From the given description, we can derive the molecular formula as C\u2081\u2086H\u2082\u2083N, representing the 16 carbon atoms, 23 hydrogen atoms, and 1 nitrogen atom present in the compound. This molecular formula encapsulates the precise composition and connectivity of atoms within 2-methyl-5-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-amine, serving as a foundational basis for further chemical analysis and characterization.",
