    "gpt_response": "The molecular weight of the compound CC(C)C(CCN)C1=NSC=N1 can be calculated by adding up the atomic weights of each atom in the molecule. The atomic weights of the elements present are as follows:\n\nCarbon (C) = 12.01 g/mol\nNitrogen (N) = 14.01 g/mol\nSulfur (S) = 32.07 g/mol\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate the molecular weight of the compound with the given structure:\n\nCC(C)C(CCN)C1=NSC=N1\n= 4(C) + 2(N) + S\n= 4(12.01) + 2(14.01) + 32.07\n= 48.04 + 28.02 + 32.07\n= 108.13 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of the compound CC(C)C(CCN)C1=NSC=N1 is 108.13 g/mol.",
