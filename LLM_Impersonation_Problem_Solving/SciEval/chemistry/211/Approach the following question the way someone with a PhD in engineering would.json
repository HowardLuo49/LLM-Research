    "gpt_response": "The SMILES expression of a molecule represents its structure using a linear string notation. To generate the SMILES expression for C8H12BrF3, we first need to determine the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule. \n\nC8H12BrF3 is a compound made up of 8 carbon (C) atoms, 12 hydrogen (H) atoms, 1 bromine (Br) atom, and 3 fluorine (F) atoms. Based on this composition, we can deduce the structure of the molecule, which consists of a carbon backbone with hydrogen atoms attached, along with a bromine atom and three fluorine atoms substituting some of the hydrogen atoms. \n\nTo convert this structure into a SMILES expression, we would need to assign unique labels to each atom, considering its connectivity and any stereochemistry if applicable. The SMILES expression would then be constructed by listing the atoms in a specific order while incorporating symbols to denote bonds between them. \n\nTherefore, the SMILES expression for C8H12BrF3 could be something like \"CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)C(Br)(F)(F)F\", where each letter represents a different atom and the parentheses indicate connectivity. Advanced SMILES software tools can be used to generate a more concise and standardized expression for this molecule.",
