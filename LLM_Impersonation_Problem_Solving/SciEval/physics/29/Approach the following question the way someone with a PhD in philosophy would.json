What is the distance that a star must be from a black hole of 2 solar masses in order to orbit the black hole with a period of 6 day? How does the accretion disk around the black hole affect the star's orbit? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : \\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.
