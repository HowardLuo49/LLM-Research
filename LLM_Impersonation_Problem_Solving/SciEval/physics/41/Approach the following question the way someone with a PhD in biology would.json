Sure, here's a question that a physics student can solve related to Cosmic ray propagation and acceleration:\n\nWhat acceleration is required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 2 TeV, assuming it originates from a supernova remnant shock wave with a magnetic field of 698 microgauss? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : elementary charge : e = 1.6e-19 C ; velocity of light : c = 3e8 m/s.
