    "gpt_response": "To calculate the acceleration required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 2 TeV, we can use the following formula: \n\nE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere E is the energy of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity of the particle. Since the mass of a cosmic ray particle is negligible compared to its energy, we can simplify the formula to:\n\nE = 0.5 * v^2\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for velocity, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2E)\n\nGiven that the energy of the particle is 2 TeV (2 * 10^12 eV), we can convert this to joules by using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J.
