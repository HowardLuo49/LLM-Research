    "gpt_response": "To calculate the acceleration required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 2 TeV, we can use the equation for relativistic kinetic energy:\n\nKE = (\u03b3 - 1) * m * c^2\n\nWhere KE is the kinetic energy, \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is the mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the Lorentz factor:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 + (KE / (m * c^2))\n\nGiven that the energy of the particle is 2 TeV, we convert this to joules by using the conversion factor 1 TeV = 1e12 eV.

So, 698 \u00b5G = 698e-6 T.
